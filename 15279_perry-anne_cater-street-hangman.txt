anne perry cater street hangman chapter one charlotte ellison stood in the centre of the withdrawing room the newspaper in her hand her father had been very lax in leaving it on the side table he disapproved of her reading such things preferring to tell her such matters of interest as he felt suitable for young ladies to know and this excluded all scandal personal or political all matters of a controversial nature and naturally all crime of any sort in fact just about everything that was interesting all of which meant that since charlotte had to obtain her newspapers from the pantry where the butler maddock put them for his own reading before throwing them out she was always at least a day behind the rest of london however this was todays paper april and the most arresting news was the death the day before of mr disraeli her first thought was to wonder how mr gladstone felt did he feel any sense of loss was a great enemy as much a part of a mans life as a great friend surely it must be it must be the cross thread in the fabric of emotions there were footsteps in the hall and she put the paper away quickly she had not forgotten her fathers fury when he had found her reading an evening journal three years ago of course then it had been about the libel case between mr whistler and mr ruskin and that was a little different but even last year when she had expressed interest in the news of the zulu war reported in person by those who had actually been in africa he had viewed that with equal disfavour he had refused even to read them selected pieces such as he considered suitable in the end it had been dominic her sisters husband who had regaled her with all he could rememberbut always at least one day late at the thought of dominic mr disraeli and the whole matter of newspapers vanished from the time dominic had first presented himself six years ago when sarah had been only twenty charlotte herself seventeen and emily only thirteen she had been fascinated by him of course it was sarah he had called on charlotte was only permitted into the drawing room with her mother so that the occasions might be conducted with all the decorum suitable to a courtship dominic had barely seen her his words polite nothings his eyes somewhere over her left shoulder seeing sarahs fair hair her delicately boned face charlotte with her heavy mahoganycoloured hair that was so difficult to keep tidy her stronger face was only an encumbrance to be endured with good manners a year later of course they had married and dominic no longer held quite the same mystery he no longer moved in the magical world of someone elses romance but even with five years of knowledge of each other of living under the same spacious wellordered roof he still exerted the original charm the original fascination for her that had been his footstep in the hall she knew it without conscious thought it was there part of her life listening for him seeing him first in a crowd knowing where he was in the room remembering whatever he said even trivial things she had come to terms with it dominic had always been out of reach it was not as if he had ever cared for her or could have done she had not expected it one day perhaps she would meet someone she could like and respect someone suitable and mother would speak with him see that he was socially and personally acceptable and of course father would make the other arrangements whatever they were as he had done with dominic and sarah and no doubt would do with emily and someone in due course it was not something she wished to think about but it remained permanently in the future the present was dominic this house her parents emily and sarah and grandmama the present was aunt susannah coming to tea in two hours time and the fact that the footsteps in the hall had gone away again leaving her free to take another quick look at the newspaper her mother came in a few moments later so quietly charlotte did not hear her charlotte it was too late to hide what she was doing she lowered the paper and looked into her mothers brown eyes yes mama it was an admission you know how your father feels about your looking at those things she glanced at the folded paper in charlottes hand i cant imagine why you want to theres very little in them thats pleasant and your father will read those things out to us but if you must look at it for yourself at least do it discreetly in maddocks pantry or get dominic to tell you charlotte felt the colour flood her face she looked away she had had no idea her mother knew about maddocks pantry even less about dominic had dominic told her why should that thought hurt like a betrayal that was ridiculous she could have no secrets with dominic what had she let herself imagine yes of course mama im sorry she dropped the paper behind her onto the table i shant let papa catch me if you want to read why dont you read books theres something of mr dickens in the bookcase over there and im sure you havent read mr disraelis coningsby yet funny how people always say they are sure when they mean they are not sure mr disraeli died yesterday charlotte replied i wouldnt enjoy it not just at the moment mr disraeli oh dear i am sorry i never cared for mr gladstone but dont tell your father he always reminds me of the vicar charlotte felt disposed to giggle dont you like the vicar mama her mother composed herself immediately yes of course i do now please go and prepare yourself for tea have you forgotten aunt susannah is coming to call on us this afternoon but not for an hour and a half at the soonest charlotte protested then do some embroidery or add some more to that painting you were working on yesterday it didnt go right grammar charlotte it didnt go well im sorry perhaps you had better finish the comforters so you can take them to the vicars wife tomorrow i promised we would deliver them do you suppose they really comfort the poor it was a sincere question ive no idea her mothers face relaxed slightly as the thought occurred to her obviously for the first time i dont think ive ever known anyone really poor but the vicar assures us they do and we must presume he knows even if we dont like him very much charlotte please dont be impertinent but there was nothing harsh in her voice she had been caught in an unintentional truth and she did not resent it she was annoyed with herself perhaps but not with charlotte obediently charlotte left the room to go upstairs she might as well finish the comforters it would have to be done sometime tea was served by dora the kitchen maid in the withdrawing room tea was the most erratic affair it was always at four oclock and always when they were home in this room with its pale green furniture and the big windows onto the lawn closed now even though the clear spring sun was slanting onto the grass and the last of the daffodils it was a small garden only a few yards of lawn a patch of flowers and the single delicate birch tree against the wall climbing the old brickwork were the roses charlotte loved best the whole summer from june till november was glorious with them old roses rambling undisciplined in showers and fronds shedding carpets of petals it was the company that was erratic either they called on someone perching on unfamiliar chairs in some other withdrawing room and making selfconscious conversation or one of them received callers here sarah had young married friends whose conversations were indescribably boring to charlotte emilys friends were little better all romantic speculation fashion who was or was about to be courting whom most of mamas friends were stiff a little too consciously righteous but there were at least two who were given to reminiscences which charlotte loved to hearmemories of old admirers perished long since in the crimea sebastopol balaclava and the charge of the light brigade and then memories of the few who came back and there were stories told with mixed admiration and disapproval of florence nightingale so unfeminine but you have to admire her courage my dear not a lady but an englishwoman one might reasonably be proud of and grandmamas friends were even more interesting not that she liked them not many of them they were singularly disagreeable old ladies but mrs selby was over eighty and she could remember the news of trafalgar and the death of lord nelson black ribbons in the streets people weeping black borders on the newspapers at least she said she could she spoke frequently of waterloo and the great duke the scandals of the empress josephine the return of napoleon from elba and the hundred days most of it she herself had overheard in drawing rooms much like this one perhaps a little more austere with less furniture lighter neoclassic it was nevertheless fascinating to charlotte a reality sharper than this but today was a world away from such things with mr disraeli dead gaslights in the streets women admitted to degrees in london university the queen was empress of india and the empire itself stretched to every corner of the earth wolfe and the heights of abraham clive and hastings in india livingstone in africa and the zulu war were all history the prince consort had been dead of typhus twenty years gilbert and sullivan wrote operas like hms pinafore what would the emperor napoleon have made of that today mrs winchester was here to see mamawhich was a boreand aunt susannah was here to see them all which was excellent she was papas younger sister in fact she was only thirtysix nineteen years younger than her brother and only ten years older than sarah she seemed more like a cousin it was three months since they had seen her three months too long she had been away visiting in yorkshire you must tell me all about it my dear mrs winchester leaned forward fractionally curiosity burning in her face who exactly are the willises im sure you must have told mesublime assurance that everybody told her everything but i do find these days that my memory is not nearly as good as i should like she waited expectantly eyebrows raised susannah was a subject of permanent interest to her her comings and goings and above all any hint of a romance or better still of scandal she possessed all the elements necessary she had been married at twentyone to a gentleman of good family and the year after in he had been killed in the hyde park riots leaving her comfortably provided for in a wellrun establishment of her own still very young and enormously handsome she had never married again although no doubt there had been numerous offers opinion veered between the conclusion that she was still mourning her husband and like the queen could never recover from the grief to the reverse conclusion that her marriage had been so acutely painful to her that she could not entertain the thought of a second such venture charlotte believed that the truth lay between that having satisfied the requirements of family in particular and society at large by marrying once she now had no desire to commit herself again unless it were for genuine affectionwhich apparently had not yet occurred mrs willis is a cousin on my mothers side susannah replied with a slight smile indeed of course mrs winchester leaned back and what does mr willis do pray im sure i should be most interested to know he is a clergyman in a small village susannah answered dutifully although her eye caught charlottes momentarily in unspoken amusement oh mrs winchester struggled to hide a certain disappointment how very nice i suppose you were able to be of much assistance in the parish i expect our own dear vicar would be much encouraged to hear of your activities and poor mrs abernathy im sure it would take her mind off things to hear about the country and the poor charlotte wondered why either the country or the poor should comfort anyone least of all mrs abernathy oh yes her mother encouraged that would be an excellent idea you might take her some preserves grandmama added nodding her head always nice to receive preserves shows people care and people are not as considerate as they used to be in my young days of course its all this violence all this crime its bound to change people and such immodesty women behaving like men and wanting all sorts of things that arent good for them well have hens crowing in the farm yard next poor mrs abernathy mrs winchester agreed shaking her head has mrs abernathy been ill susannah enquired of course grandmama said sharply what would you expect child thats what i keep saying to charlotte she gave charlotte a piercing glance you and charlotte are alike you know that was an accusation aimed at susannah i used to blame caroline for charlotte she dismissed her daughterinlaw with a wave of her fat little hand but i suppose i can hardly blame her for you you must be the fault of the times your father was never strict enough with you but at least you dont read those dreadful newspapers that come into this house i had you too late in life no good comes of it i dont think charlotte reads the newspapers as much as you fear mama susannah defended how many times do you require to read a thing before the damage is done grandmama demanded they are all different mama how do you know grandmama was as quick as a terrier susannah kept her composure with only the faintest colour coming to her face they print the news mama the news must be different from day to day nonsense they print crimes and scandals sin has not changed since our lord permitted it in the garden of eden that seemed to close the conversation there were several minutes silence do tell us aunt susannah sarah began at last is the country in yorkshire very pretty i have never been there perhaps the willises would permit dominic and me she left the suggestion delicately susannah smiled im sure they would be delighted but i hardly imagine dominic enjoying such a very rural life he always seemed to me a man of morecultivated tastes than visiting the poor and attending tea parties you make it sound terribly dull charlotte said without thinking she received a general stare of surprise and disapproval just the thing poor mrs abernathy needs i dont doubt mrs winchester said with a sage nod do her the world of good poor woman yorkshire can be uncommonly cold in april susannah said quietly looking from one to the other of them if mrs abernathy has been ill dont you think perhaps june or july would be better cold has nothing to do with it grandmama snapped bracing very healthy not if youve been ill are you contradicting me susannah i am trying to point out mama that yorkshire in early spring is not an ideal place for someone in a delicate state of health far from bracing her it might well give her pneumonia it will at least take her mind off things grandmama said firmly poor dear soul mrs winchester added to leave here even for yorkshire would surely only be an improvement change her spirits whats wrong with here susannah asked looking at mrs winchester then at charlotte ive always thought this an unusually pleasant place we have all the advantages of the city without the oppression of its more crowded areas or the expense of the most highly fashionable our streets are as clean as any and we are within carriage distance of most that is of interest or enjoyment to see not to mention our friends mrs winchester swung round to her of course youve been away she said accusingly only for two months it surely cannot have changed so much in that time the question was ironic even a little sarcastic how long does it take mrs winchester gave a dramatic shudder and closed her eyes oh poor mrs abernathy how can she bear to think of it no wonder the poor soul is afraid to go to sleep now susannah was totally confounded she looked at charlotte for help charlotte decided to give it and bear the consequences do you remember mrs abernathys daughter chloe she did not wait for a reply she was murdered about six weeks ago garotted and her clothes ripped from her her bosom wounded charlotte caroline glared at her daughter we will not discuss it we have been discussing it one way or another all afternoon charlotte protested out of the corner of her vision she saw emily stifle a giggle we have merely covered it in words it is better covered mrs winchester shuddered again i cant bear to think of it the very memory makes me quite ill she was found in the street all huddled up on the footpath like a bundle of laundry her face was terrible blue asasi dont know what and her eyes staring and her tongue poking out been lying in the rain for hours when they found her all night i shouldnt wonder dont disturb yourself grandmama said tersely looking at mrs winchesters excited face mrs winchester remembered quickly to be distressed oh terrible she wailed screwing up her features please my dear mrs ellison let us not speak of it again the whole subject is quite unbearable poor dear mrs abernathy i just dont know how she bears it what else can she do but bear it charlotte said quietly it has happened there isnt anything anyone can do now i suppose there never was susannah stared at the tea some madman a robber no one could have foreseen she looked up frowning surely she was not alone in the street after dark my dear susannah caroline remonstrated it is dark from four oclock on in the middle of winter most especially on a wet day how can one guarantee to be indoors by four oclock that would mean one could not even visit neighbours for tea is that where she was she was setting out to take some old clothes to the vicar for the poor carolines face pinched with a sudden very real sorrow poor child she was barely eighteen without warning it became real no longer a scandal to be toyed with a titillation but the real death of a woman like themselves footsteps behind sudden agony in the throat terror the struggle for breath bursting lungs and darkness no one spoke it was dora coming in from the hallway who broke the silence charlotte was still feeling depressed when her father returned to the house a little after six the sky had darkened outside and now it was spattering the first heavy drops of rain on the roadway as the carriage drew up edward ellison worked with a merchant banking house in the city which provided him with a very satisfactory income and a social standing of at least acceptable middle class charlotte had been brought up to think perhaps rather more edward came in now brushing the raindrops off his coat in the few seconds before maddock came to relieve him of it and put his top hat gently in its place good evening charlotte he said pleasantly good evening papa i trust you have had a profitable day he enquired rubbing his hands together i fear the weather is distressingly seasonal we may well be in for a storm the air has that oppressive feeling mrs winchester came to tea she answered his question about the afternoon by implication he knew she disliked her oh dear he smiled faintly there was some understanding between them even though it did not show itself as often as she would have liked i thought susannah was expected oh she came too but mrs winchester spent the entire time either questioning her about the willises or talking about chloe abernathy edwards face darkened charlotte realized that she had inadvertently betrayed her mother papa would expect her to control such talk in her own drawing room it would meet with his considerable displeasure that she had not at that moment sarah came out of the sitting room into the hall the light behind her creating a halo around her fair hair she was a pretty woman more like grandmama than caroline with the same porcelain skin and neat mouth the same soft chin hello sarah my dear edward gave her a little pat on the shoulder waiting for dominic i thought you might have been he sarah answered the faintest flicker of disappointment in her voice i hope he arrives before the storm i thought i heard thunder a few minutes ago she stood back and edward went into the sitting room crossing immediately to the fire and standing with his back to it blocking most of its heat from everyone else emily was sitting at the piano flipping pages of music over idly he surveyed his daughters with satisfaction there was another low rumble of thunder and the door closed sharply all of them turned to the sitting room door automatically there was a shuffle outside the sound of maddocks voice and then dominic came in charlotte felt her throat tighten really she ought to be over this by now it was ridiculous he was slim and strong smiling a little his dark eyes first on edward as manners and breeding required in the patriarchal house and then on sarah hope you had a pleasant day edward said still standing by the fire as well you made it home before the storm i think it might become quite violent within a quarter of an hour or less always afraid the horses will take fright and cause an accident becket lost his leg that way you know the conversation washed over charlottes head it was the usual comfortable family exchange more or less meaningless one of the small rituals of the day that established a pattern of life would it always be like this endless days of needlework painting house chores and skills teas papa and dominic coming home what did other people do they married and raised children ran houses of course the poor worked and society went to parties rode in the park or in coaches and presumably had families as well she had never met anyone round whom she could imagine centering her lifeanyone except dominic perhaps she should copy emily and cultivate a few more friends like lucy sandelson or the hayward sisters they always seemed to be beginning or ending a romance but they all seemed so incredibly silly poor papa it was hard for him to have had three daughters and no son could couldnt you charlotte dominic was looking at her his eyebrows raised amusement in his elegant face daydreaming edward commented dominic smiled broadly you could take on old mrs winchester at her own game couldnt you charlotte he repeated charlotte had no idea what he was talking about the loss must have been obvious be just as inquisitive as she is dominic explained patiently answer all her questions with another question there must be something she would rather not discuss charlotte was honest as she always was with him perhaps that was why he loved sarah you dont know mrs winchester she said straight away if she doesnt want to discuss a subject she will simply ignore you there is no reason in her mind why her reply should be related to your question she will say whatever she is thinking of which today was poor susannah not really it was poor mrs abernathy susannah was only a side adventure leading up to how much good it would do poor mrs abernathy to go to yorkshire in april dominic was incredulous the wretched woman would freeze and be bored stiff edwards face darkened unfortunately at that moment caroline came in caroline he said stiffly charlotte tells me you have been discussing chloe abernathy this afternoon i thought i had made myself plain but perhaps i did not so i will do so now the death of that unfortunate girl is not to be a subject for gossip and speculation in this house if you can be of some assistance to mrs abernathy in her bereavement then by all means do so otherwise the matter is closed i trust there can be no misunderstanding as to my wishes in this regard now no edward of course not im afraid i am not able to control mrs winchester she seems she trailed off knowing it would serve no purpose edward had expressed his feelings and was already thinking of something else maddock came in and informed them dinner was served the following day the storm had passed and the street was clean in the white april light the sky bleached blue and the garden tremulous with dew every grass blade bright charlotte and emily spent the morning occupied with the usual household duties while sarah went to visit the dressmaker caroline was closeted with mrs dunphy the cook going over kitchen accounts in the afternoon charlotte went alone to deliver the mufflers to the vicars wife it was a duty she disliked especially since it was a day on which the vicar himself was highly likely to be at home and he was a man who always produced in her a profound depression still there was no avoiding it this time it was her turn and neither sarah nor emily had seemed in the least likely to relieve her of it she arrived at the vicarage a little before half past three it was mild after the storm and it had been a pleasant walk something under two miles but she was used to exercise and the mufflers were not heavy the maid opened the door almost immediately she was a severe angular woman of indeterminate age and charlotte could never remember her name thank you she said politely stepping in i believe mrs prebble is expecting me yes maam if youll come this way the vicars wife was sitting in the smaller back parlour and the vicar himself standing with his back to the black smoking fire charlottes heart sank as soon as she saw him good afternoon to you miss ellison he said with a very slight bow more a bending of his back how pleasant to see you spending your time in small duties for others a very small thing vicar she instinctively wanted to deny it only a few mufflers my mother and sisters have made i hope they will be she trailed off realizing she did not really mean anything uttering empty words noises to fill the silence mrs prebble reached for the bag and took it she was a handsome woman broadbusted strong with fine strong hands im sure next winter there will be those who will be most grateful for them i have frequently noticed that if your hands are cold your whole body is chilled havent you yes yes i suppose i have the vicar was staring at her and she looked away quickly from his cold eyes you seem a little chilled now miss ellison he said very clearly im sure mrs prebble would be happy to offer you a dish of hot tea it was a statement there was no avoiding it without discourtesy thank you she said without feeling martha prebble rang the little bell on the mantel and when the maid came back a moment later she requested the tea and how is your mother miss ellison the vicar enquired still standing with his back to the fire shielding them all from its heat such a good woman well thank you vicar charlotte answered ill tell her you were asking after her martha prebble looked up from the sewing she was doing i hear your aunt susannah has returned from yorkshire i hope the change of air has done her good mrs winchester had lost no time i believe so but she was not ill you know things must be hard for her at times martha said thoughtfully alone i dont think aunt susannah minds charlotte spoke before thinking i think she prefers it the vicar frowned the tea arrived obviously it had been already prepared and only awaited the signal it is not good for a woman to be alone the vicar said grimly he had a large squarish face with a strong thin mouth and heavy nose he must have been quite fine as a young man charlotte was ashamed of how deeply she disliked him one should not feel that way about a man of the church it leaves her vulnerable to all kinds of dangers he went on susannah is perfectly safe charlotte replied firmly she has adequate means and she certainly doesnt venture out alone except in the daytime and at night of course the house is quite secure i believe her manservant is very proficient even in the use of firearms i was not thinking of violence miss ellison but of temptation a woman alone is subject to temptations of the flesh to lightmindedness and entertainments that by their very shallowness tend to pervert the nature a good woman is about the tasks of her house consider your bible miss ellison i recommend you read the book of proverbs susannah keeps a very good house charlotte felt impelled to defend her and she doesnt occupy herself inin lightminded amusements you really are a most argumentative young woman the vicar smiled at her stiffly it is unbecoming you must learn to control it she is only being loyal to her cousin my dear martha said quickly seeing charlottes face colour in quick anger loyalty is not a virtue martha when it misguidedly praises that which is evil and dangerous you have only to look at chloe abernathy unfortunate child and susannah is her aunt not her cousin charlotte could still feel the heat under her skin what has chloe abernathy to do with susannah she demanded bad company miss ellison bad company we are all weak vessels and in bad company women especially young women are easily led to become subject to vices even to fall under the influence of evil men and end their lives in destitution and abandonment on the streets chloe wasnt anything like that you are softhearted miss ellison and so a woman should be you should not know of such things and it does your mother credit that you do not see them but great evils begin in small ways that is why even the most innocent of women need the protection of men who see the seeds of sin in time to guard against them and bad company is the seed of sin child there can be no doubt of it poor chloe was much taken with the company of the madison daughters lately before her death and perhaps you did not fully appreciate their lightmindedness the frivolous painting of their faces the wearing of clothes intended to attract the attention of men and the lingering about without chaperones indulged in by the misses madison but i am sure your father was aware and would not have let you associate with such people you may thank his wisdom that you are not also lying murdered in the street i know they giggled rather a lot charlotte said slowly she tried to recall the misses madison to see in them any of the beginnings of sin the vicar spoke of her memory produced nothing more than a lot of romantic nonsense and very little harm empty certainly but not wicked even in embryo but i dont remember anything spiteful in them not spiteful the vicar gave a faintly patronizing smile sin is not spite my dear child sin is the beginning of the road to damnation to indulgence of the flesh to fornication and the worship of the golden calf his voice rose and charlotte knew instinctively it was the beginning of a sermon she clutched desperately mrs prebble she leaned forward in total hypocrisy please tell me what else you would like us to do what next we may make to contribute to the relief of the poor im sure both my mother and my sisters would be most grateful to know martha prebble was a little startled by the vehemence in her voice but she too seemed more than happy to leave the subject of sin oh im sure any blankets or especially clothes for children the poor always seem to have so many children you know they seem to have more than those of us who are more comfortably suited naturally the vicar was not to be left out his face was massive resting on his broad shoulders like a monument it is precisely because they indulge themselves and give birth to more children than they can support that they are poor and the rest of us inherit the obligation to care for their needs i suppose it is productive of patience in affliction for them and of christian charity and virtue in us charlotte had no answer for that she drank the last of her tea and stood up thank you for the tea im quite warm and refreshed now i must return home before the evening begins to chill i shall inform my mother of your satisfaction with the mufflers and im sure she will be most grateful that there is more we can do childrens clothes i shall begin tomorrow i expect we shall do well martha prebble came to the front with her she put her hand on charlottes arm in the hallway my dear charlotte dont mind the vicar he is solicitous for our wellbeing and doesnt mean to sound so harsh im sure he was as distressed as anyone thatthat tragedies should happen of course i understand charlotte loosened herself she did not understand at all she thought nothing but ill of the vicar but she was sorry for martha she could not imagine living with such a man although he was perhaps not so different from many men they all tended to be pretty severe with girls like the misses madison and in truth they were more than a little tedious but not sinfuljust incredibly silly martha smiled you are very gentle my dear i knew you would and she stood on the doorstep watching charlotte down the path two days later they were all sitting in the withdrawing room sewing the childrens clothes martha prebble had requested when edward returned home as usual they heard the front door close there was a murmur of voices as maddock took his coat and hat but a moment later instead of edward it was maddock whose face showed at the door madame he looked at caroline his face flushed yes maddock caroline was surprised not yet aware of anything wrong what is it was that not mr ellison yes madame would you be so good as to come into the hall now charlotte emily and sarah all stared at him caroline stood up of course as soon as she was gone they turned to look at one another whats happened emily said immediately excitement in her voice do you suppose papa has brought company i wonder who it is and if he is wealthya man from the city perhaps then why doesnt he bring him in charlotte asked sarah frowned and looked at the ceiling in exasperation really charlotte he would naturally consult mama first and introduce him maybe he is not suitable for us to meet perhaps he is only someone in trouble someone who needs help what a bore emily sighed you mean a beggar someone in reduced circumstances i dont know papa may be having maddock take care of him but he would naturally tell mama about it emily stood up and went to the door emily you arent going to listen emily held her finger to her lips smiling dont you want to know she asked charlotte got to her feet quickly and went over to emily standing almost on top of her well i certainly do she joined in open the door just a crack emily had already done so they crouched over it together and a moment later charlotte felt the warmth of sarah right behind her her taffeta afternoon dress rustling a little edward you must destroy the newspapers caroline was saying say that you lost them we dont know that it will be in the newspapers of course it will caroline was angry upset her voice quavered and you know that charlotte drew in her breath sharply her mother was about to betray her that it might get left where one of the girls could see it caroline went on and i wont have the servants read it either poor mrs dunphy sometimes uses newspapers to wrap kitchen refuse or lily might use them in cleaning it would frighten the poor things out of their wits yes edward agreed yes my dear you are quite right i shall read it and destroy it before returning home it would be wise if we could keep mama from hearing about it it is bound to distress her carolines agreement lacked any conviction charlotte smiled hiding her face in emilys silk back it was her private opinion that grandmama was tougher than a turkish soldier in the crimea she was always talking about apparently caroline thought so too but what was it that had happened her curiosity was boiling over was the poor girl caroline swallowed they could hear it from behind the door garotted like chloe abernathy hardly like chloe abernathy edward corrected but there was a catch in his voice too as if reality had just overtaken him chloe was a a respectable girl this maid of the hiltons waswell it seems regrettable to speak ill of the dead especially dead in such a terrible way but she was a girl of dubious reputation she had more followers than any decent girl would i dare say that was what brought about her terrible death you said she was found in the street edward yes in cater street not half a mile from the vicars well dont the hiltons live in russmore street that leads off cater street at the far end i suppose she went out to meet someone and it it happened hush my dear it was quite horrible obscene we wont speak of it any more we had better go into the withdrawing room or they will begin to wonder what is keeping us i just hope the whole neighbourhood wont be buzzing with it i imagine dominic will have the sense not to speak of it at least of the more bestial aspects of it well you only heard by chance because you were in cater street at just the moment when the police were there otherwise in the dark you would have known nothing i must warn him to be discreet we dont want the girls upset or the servants either but i had better have a word with maddock and see that neither dora nor lily goes out walking alone until this wretched man is caught there was a sound of footsteps as he moved charlotte felt emilys elbow in her ribs as a sharp warning and they all collapsed backwards and fled to their respective seats they were sitting awkwardly skirts crumpled when the door opened edwards face was pale but he was perfectly composed good evening my dears i hope you had a pleasant day yes thank you papa charlotte said breathlessly quite pleasant thank you but her mind was out in a shadowed street in some unimaginable horror of dark shapes sudden pain chokingand death chapter two emily was excited this was the kind of day she loved even more than the day after today was the day of dreams of preparations of lastminute stitching of laying out every detail of clean underwear of washing hair and brushing of curling irons and then at the very last minute of all the delicate infinitely discreet touches to the face tonight they were going to a formal ball at the house of one colonel decker and his wife and far more to the point his son and his daughter emily had seen them only twice but had heard delicious stories from lucy sandelson as to their dashing style their elegance the flair with which they wore the latest fashions and yet more intoxicating the abundance and intimacy of their acquaintances among the wealthy and the aristocratic truly this ball gave promise of endless doors which with a little luck and a little skill might open onto worlds heretofore only dreamed of sarah was going to wear blue a soft baby blue which was extremely becoming to her it flattered her skin highlighting its delicacy and caught the colour of her eyes it was a colour that suited emilys warmer tone very well also complementing her cheeks darker eyes and brownish hair with its hazel and gold lights still it would flatter neither of them to wear the same indeed it would make them look ridiculous and sarah naturally had first choice charlotte had decided upon a rich wine pink another shade which would have suited emily but to be honest it suited charlotte with the redwood colour of her hair and her honeytoned skin even better no one could call her eyes blue they were gray in any light which left only yellow or green for emily yellow always made her look sallow it looked dreadful on sarah too only charlotte was flattered by it so with a touch of ill humour emily had settled for green a soft lighter than apple green now holding it up in front of her she had to admit that chance had favoured her it really was most excellently becoming she looked all delicacy and spring like some flower in its selfchosen setting as if she owed nothing to artifice indeed if dressed in this she could not attract the admiration and thus of course the attention of one of the decker familys friends she did not deserve to succeed sarah was not in the field being married the madison sisters were unattractively dark and let us be honest much thicker round the waist than was desirable both of them perhaps they overate lucy was handsome enough but so clumsy and charlotte she knew would be no rival because charlotte always spoilt any visual effect she might have made as soon as she opened her mouth why did charlotte always have to say what she thought instead of what she certainly had enough wit to know people wished this green really was excellent she must get another gown in the same shade for daytime and where was lily she was supposed to be coming with the curling irons she went to the door lily coming miss emily one moment and im coming right now what are you doing just the last touches to miss charlottes dress miss emily the irons will get cold really lily was stupid at times didnt the girl ever think theyre still too hot miss emily im coming right now this time she fulfilled her promise and half an hour later emily was totally satisfied she turned slowly in front of the mirror the reflection was dazzling she could think of nothing to add or alter this was the best image she was able to present young yet not totally unsophisticated ethereal without being quite out of reach caroline came into the room behind her youve been standing in front of that mirror too long emily you must know every fold of your dress by now her reflection was smiling meeting emilys eyes vanity in a woman is not an attractive quality my dear however beautiful you areand you are pretty enough but not beautifulit becomes you to pretend indifference to it emily stifled a laugh she was far too excited to be offended i dont intend anyone else to be indifferent to it are you ready mama do you feel there is something i have yet to do carolines mouth twisted a little emily swung round flouncing her skirt she regarded her mother in mock consideration on anyone else the browngold dress would have been sombre but against carolines rich skin and mahogany hair it was very handsome indeed emily had too much honesty to do anything but approve thank you caroline said with some acerbity are you ready to come down everyone else is prepared to leave emily came down the stairs carefully holding her dress and was the first into the carriage all the way there she was silent her mind whirling faster and faster through dreams picturing handsome men faces as yet indistinct all turned towards her as she danced music in her ears in her body and in her feet barely touching the ground one vision melted into another she progressed to the next day to admirers calling to letters then to rivalry for her attention a pity gentlemen did not duel any more of course it would all be very proper perhaps one of them would be titled would she marry him become lady something there would be a long passionate courtship firsthis family would have chosen someone else for him someone of his own social standing an heiress but he would be prepared to risk everything the dream was delicious it was almost an anticlimax when they arrived but she knew the difference between dream and reality they had judged it perfectlyprobably mamas doing the ball was already in progress they heard the music even as they mounted the steps to the great doors emily caught her breath and swallowed hard in the excitement there were more than fifty people swirling gently like flowers in a breeze colours blending and drifting one into another interspersed with the dark stiffer forms of the men the music was like summer and wine and laughter they were announced mama and papa went down the steps slowly then dominic and sarah then charlotte emily hesitated as long as she dared were all those faces looking at her oh yes please let it be that they were she picked up her skirt just an inch or two in her hand delicately and began to descend the stair it was a moment to be savoured like the exquisite first strawberry of the year at once sweet and tart drawing the mouth they were formally introduced but most of it passed over her head she was aware only of the son of the family he was a bitter disappointment reality shattered the remnant of the dream he was ruddyfaced shortnosed and definitely too stout for a man of his youth emily curtsied as habit dictated and when he asked her for the honour of the dance she accepted there was no other civil way to behave and she was duly led away he danced badly afterwards emily found herself deposited among a group of other young women most of whom she knew at least by sight conversation was minimal and extremely silly as everyones mind was on the men now congregating at the far side or dancing with others such remarks as were made were not listened to either by those who made them or by those to whom they were addressed emily saw dominic and sarah together and mama dancing with colonel decker charlotte was talking with an attempt at interest to a young man with an elegant and weary air it was half an hour and several dances later before young decker returnedmuch to emilys dismay until she saw that he brought with him quite the handsomest man she had seen in a year he was of no more than average height but his brown hair curled richly to his head his colour was excellent his features regular his eyes large and above all he carried with him an air of assurance that was beauty in itself miss emily ellison young decker bowed very slightly may i present to you lord george ashworth emily held out her hand and curtsied eyes down to hide the colour of excitement she felt climbing up her cheeks really she must behave as if she met lords every day and cared not a whit he spoke to her she hardly heard the words she replied gracefully the conversation was formal a little stilted but it hardly mattered decker was an assshe needed only half her attention to maintain a subject with himbut ashworth was entirely different she could feel his eyes on her and it was both dangerous and exciting he was a man who would reach boldly for what he wanted there might be finesse but there would be no fumbling no diffidence it brought her a tingle of fear to know that she was at this moment the object of his interest she danced with him twice within the next hour he was not indiscreet twice was enough more would have drawn attention perhaps papas which could spoil everything she saw papa across the room dancing with sarah and mama trying to avoid the very open admiration of colonel decker without at the same time offending him or allowing the situation to arouse the jealousy of others at a different time emily would have watched for the education it would have given her now she had business of her own that required all her wits she was standing talking to one of the misses madison but she was conscious of lord ashworths eyes on her from across the room she must stand straight a bent back was most unbecoming made an ugly bustline and did little for the chin she must smile but not seem to be vacuous and move her hands prettily she never forgot how ugly hands could spoil an otherwise graceful woman having seen it all too disastrously demonstrated by the other of the misses madison to the total loss of a promising admirer that was something sarah had never quite mastered and charlotte had which was odder still charlotte was so awkward with her tongue but she had such beautiful hands she was dancing now with dominic her face lifted her eyes glowing really sometimes emily doubted she had the sense she was born with there was nothing to be gained from dominic he had no friends of value and certainly no relations true he was comfortably enough placed himself but that was of no consequence to charlotte only a fool travelled a road that led nowhere still you could not tell some people by midnight emily had danced with george ashworth another two times but nothing had been said about a further meeting or about his calling on her she was beginning to fear she had not been as successful as she had at first presumed papa would soon decide it was time to go home she must do something within the next few minutes or perhaps lose her chance and that would be appalling she could not lose so soon the first lord she had spoken to familiarly quite the handsomest man and even more to her liking a man of wit and boldness she excused herself from lucy sandelson on the pretext of being rather warm and made her way towards the conservatory it would doubtless be far too cold in there but what was a little discomfort in the pursuit of such advance she had waited five minutes which seemed like fifty when at last she heard footsteps she did not turn pretending to be absorbed in the contemplation of an azalea i hoped you would not have grown cold and returned to the ballroom before i had the chance to disengage myself she felt the blood surge through her it was ashworth indeed she said as calmly as she could i had no idea you had observed my leaving i did not intend to be obvious what a lie if she had not thought he observed her she would have had to return and leave again i was finding the heat growing a trifle oppressive so many people do you dislike crowds i am most disappointed he sounded it i was hoping i might invite you and perhaps miss decker to accompany me and one or two friends to the races in a weeks time there is a big meeting and all fashionable london will be there you would have graced the scene especially if you were to have worn the same delightful shade as you are wearing now it brings all springtime and youth to mind she was too choked with excitement to speak the races with lord ashworth all fashionable london dreams flickered past her eyes in such profusion she could hardly distinguish one from another maybe the prince of wales would be there he loved racing and who knew who else she would buy another dress in green a dress for the races fit to turn every head on the course you are very silent miss ellison he said from behind her i should be dreadfully disappointed if you did not come you are quite the most enchanting creature here and i promise you the crowds at the races will be nothing like as stifling as here in the ballroom it will all be open air and if we are lucky sunshine as well please say that you will come thank you lord ashworth she must keep her voice steady as if she frequently were invited to the races by lords and it were no cause for ecstasy i should be most charmed to come i have no doubt it will be a delightful occasion and miss decker quite a proper companion i understand she has accepted naturally or i should not have been so inconsiderate as to approach you that was a lie but she was not to know it when papa came to inform her it was time to return home she followed obediently smiling in a haze of delight race day was fine one of those cool dazzlingly sunny days of late spring when the very air seems to sparkle emily had prevailed upon papa to purchase yet another new dress and in the very green she wished she had hinted at the eloquent argument that if really successful she might attract a future husbanda thought which could not fail to impress papa three daughters were a severe test of any mans connections and good fortune if he wished to see them satisfactorily married sarah had been matched if not brilliantly at least acceptably dominic had sufficient means and was certainly more than personable he was uncommonly handsome and seemed of easy temper and good habits charlotte of course was entirely another matter emily could not see charlotte being nearly so easily settled she was both far too unaccommodating in her natureno man liked an argumentative womanand far too impractical in her own desires she wished for the most awkward and in the long run unrewarding attributes in a man emily had tried to speak to her regarding her ambitions to point out that financial means and social standing coupled with acceptable appearance and behaviour that was at any rate wellmannered were all one could reasonably expectindeed were a very great deal more than most girls ever achieved but charlotte refused to be persuaded or seriously to acknowledge that she even understood but today none of that mattered emily was at the race meeting with lord george ashworth and miss decker and some young man she barely noticed he was of infinitely less promise than ashworth and therefore not to be considered at the moment the first race was already over and george had won very nicely on it he claimed to know the owner of the animal which made the whole venture even more exciting emily paraded along the close grass parasol in hand luxuriating in an air of great superiority she was on the arm of a member of the aristocracy and an uncommonly handsome one she looked both fashionable and lovely and she knew it and she had inside information on the winner of the previous race what more could anyone ask she was of the elite the second race was a smaller affair but the third was the big event of the meeting the crowd began to buzz in excitement like a swarm of bees disturbed the swirls of movement grew more violent as people elbowed their way towards bookmakers calling odds trying to induce higher and higher wagers men in elegant and rakish clothes laughed loudly as fistfuls of money changed hands once while ashworth was talking about horses legs good heart jockeys skill and other things she did not understand emily observed an incident she could merely stare at transfixed a portly gentleman somewhat red in the face was chuckling to himself over his good fortune clutching a note in his hand he took one or two steps forward moving towards a sallow man in dark clothes lugubrious as an undertaker lose old fellow the stout man asked cheerfully never mind better luck with this one cant lose em all keep at it i say and he gave a broad chuckle the thin man looked at him with polite dismay i beg your pardon sir but were you addressing me his voice was quite soft had emily been less close she would not have caught the words you look as if misfortune has visited you the stout man went on heartily happens to the best of us keep trying i say indeed sir i assure you i have had no misfortune ah the stout man grinned and winked not wanting to admit it eh i assure you sir the stout man laughed and clapped the other on the arm at that moment a stranger missed his footing and staggered sideways cannoning into the stout man he in turn fell forward almost into the arms of the sallow man in the mourning clothes the man put out both hands to steady the sudden weight or to fend it off there were profuse apologies all round and an attempt at straightening clothes the illfooted stranger muttered something then apparently saw an acquaintance in the distance and still talking took himself off a smart young woman materialized next to the dark man and begged him to come immediately and witness some good fortune of hers while two other fellows having a heated discussion on the merits or demerits of a certain horse took over almost the same spot of ground the stout man brushed himself down drawing a deep breath then his hand stopped convulsively halfway down his body dived into his vest pocket and came out empty my watch he howled in anguish my money my seals i had three gold seals on my watch chain ive been robbed emily swivelled round and tugged on ashworths sleeve george she said urgently george i just saw a man robbed he was robbed of his watch and seals ashworth turned round a slightly indulgent smile on his mouth my dear emily it happens all the time at the races but i saw it it was most cleverly done this man bumped him from behind and forced him almost on top of another who ran his hands over him and like a conjuror must have removed his possessions arent you going to do something what do you suggest his eyebrows rose the man who took them will be innocently engaged in something quite different by now and the goods themselves will have been passed on to someone else neither you nor the victim has ever seen but it only happened this moment she protested and where is the thief she stared round there was no one she recognized except the victim and the two arguers she turned back to george helplessly i cant see him he grinned of course not and even if you tried to pursue him there would be people specially detailed to block your way thats how they work its quite an art indeed nearly as great as the art of avoiding them dont think about it theres really nothing you can do just dont carry money in your skirt pockets they are excellently clever at robbing women too she stared at him now he said firmly would you care to place a small wager on charless horse i can promise a place at least she accepted to wager money was exciting part of the thrill and since it was not her own money she could lose nothing and might even gain but far more important than any small financial advantage was the knowledge she was actually part of this new brilliant world that since adolescence she had dreamed about ladies of high fashion laughed and swirled their skirts as they flounced along on the arms of elegant gentlemen gentlemen with money and titles who gambled on horses on the turn of a card or the fall of dice gentlemen who took life by the throat and won or lost fortunes in a day she overheard their talk and it conjured visions for her a little blurred of course because she had never been to a gambling den or a dogfight or cockfighting pit she had never seen a gentlemens gambling club or come to that anyone more than very slightly the worse for drink but there was danger in it and danger risk was the essence of fortune emily had youth and looks and some ready wit and above all she believed she had style that indefinable quality that marked the winners from the losers if she were to win something permanent the chance must be taken now she succeeded as well as she could have hoped ten days later she was invited again with miss decker to a lawn tennis party which she enjoyed enormously of course she did not play but the purpose was purely social and in this she accomplished much including an invitation to ride in the park in a few days time she would of course have to be lent both horse and habit but this presented no problem ashworth had arranged for the horse and she could perfectly easily borrow aunt susannahs habit they were much the same size and the fact that susannah was approximately two inches taller could be dealt with by tucking the skirt over at the waist no one but herself would know the day was the first of june cool and brisk with dazzling sky and rainclean streets emily joined miss decker whom she had grown to dislike although she hid it excellently lord ashworth and a mr lambling who was a friend of ashworths and who had taken a distinct fancy to miss decker heaven only knew why they rode together under the trees on the firm gravel of rotten row emily sat a trifle precariously on the side saddle she was not used to horses but determined to keep her balance and even manage a certain panache as she guided her horse cautiously between a group of solemn children on fat ponies she looked good and she heard it reflected in the approving murmurs of a bunch of gentlemen eight or ten yards away the habit was half an inch tight flatteringly so her highcrowned riding hat very like a gentlemans top hat sat rakishly to one side on her shining hair her fair skin was complemented perfectly by the hats dark colour and her shirts white lace ruffles the others caught up with her and rode more or less abreast conversation was sporadic until they passed quite the most elegant woman emily had ever seen she had the palest silver fair hair and broad handsome face her habit was forest green and most exquisitely cut with velvet on the collar her horse was an animal of obvious mettle emily was lost in admiration one day she would dearly like to ride down ladies mile with that air of assurance of superiority so deep as to be casually assumed the woman smiled broadly as they drew level and adjusted her hat fractionally with one finger setting it at a still more dashing angle she was looking at ashworth good morning my lord she said with a faintly mocking air ashworth looked through her for a long chill moment then turned slightly in the saddle to face emily you were telling me miss ellison about your aunts visit to yorkshire it must be most pleasant country from your account do you go frequently yourself it was an astounding piece of rudeness it had been at least a quarter of an hour since emily had mentioned yorkshire and the woman quite plainly knew him emily was too astonished to speak although im surprised she found early spring a comfortable time of the year to visit so far north he went on still keeping his back to the row emily stared at him the womans face twisted in a small grimace a touch of bitter amusement in it then she touched her horse with her crop and moved on she was speaking to you emily said boldly my dear emily ashworths mouth curved downward slightly a gentleman does not reply to every harlot who importunes him he said with a hint of condescension most especially in such a public place as this and certainly not if he happens to be in the company of ladies at the time harlot emily stammered but she wasshe was dressedi mean there is every degree of harlot just as there is every degree of just about everything else the more expensive they are the more elite their custom the less they look like it thats all you must learn to be a little less simple the thought flashed through her mind but she forbore from asking him how he knew the womans occupation obviously there was an entire world about which she had much yet to learn if she were to thread her way through it successfully and reach the prize she intended perhaps you will be good enough to teach me she said with a smile that she hoped hid more than it revealed let him read into it what he wished it is an area in which i am totally unacquainted he gave her a hard look for a moment or two then broke into a broad smile he had extraordinarily fine teeth emily made up her mind right then that she would exert her utmost effort to end up as lady ashworthregardless ofcertain disadvantages they would have to be dealt with in due course but she had no doubt she would be equal to them im not sure emily if you are quite as mellow as you seem he was still looking at her she affected total innocence and met his eyes with a charming smile she considered inviting him to know her better and decided against it it was too forward and anyway she was quite sure he intended to anyway it was the second week in june when george ashworth actually came to the ellison house to call naturally it had been planned planned most meticulously even caroline tried unsuccessfully to hide a certain bubble of excitement at quarter to four they were all sitting in the withdrawing room the sun shining in across the floor the first roses blooming outside lord ashworth and mr and miss decker were expected at any moment sarah sat rather primly on the piano stool playing something nondescript emily was sufficiently practiced herself to know she was playing it badly emily was singing inside with anticipation caroline sat in the best hardbacked chair as if already preparing to pour the tea which was not yet served charlotte alone seemed unaffected but then of course charlotte never had had the sense to know what was important emily herself was very composed she had already done everything she could to prepare all that remained now was to play each phrase each glance as it came they arrived precisely on time and were shown in with a flurry of introductions they all sat down and began the usual ritual of small talk only george ashworth looked totally comfortable a giggling and rather flushed dora brought in their tea all mrs dunphys most elegant sandwiches little butterfly cakes and others that defied category everything was served with even more than usual ceremony emily told us about the race meeting caroline said conversationally proffering the sandwiches to ashworth it sounds quite fascinating i have been on only two occasions myself and they were both some time ago and in yorkshire london races are most fashionable i hear do tell us more about them do you go often emily hoped he would be discreet partly because she had told her mother very little about the races and even that little had been definitely slanted a strong accent on fashion and nothing whatsoever about the gambling touts the pickpockets those who had taken more refreshment than was good for them and those who she now realized were of the same basic occupation as the lady of the elegant riding habit in rotten row please heaven george would have the sense to pick and choose his recollections also george smiled im afraid there are not so very many race meetings that it would be possible to go more than two or three times a month mrs ellison and not all of them are worth bothering withnot the sort of thing i enjoy and certainly not for ladies do ladies not attend all of them sarah asked curiously you mean they are for men only not at all mrs corde i used the term ladies to distinguish from the various other females who do attend for their own reasons sarah opened her mouth interest lighting her face then remembered her propriety and closed it again emily caught charlottes eye with amusement they all knew sarahs love of the socially correct charlotte said it for her you mean women of no virtue she said frankly the demimonde i think they call it georges smile broadened they do indeed among other things he agreed there are the racegoers and those who follow the racegoers and those who follow the followers horse traders gamblers and im afraid thieves caroline frowned oh dear it does not sound as pleasant a place as i had imagined race meetings vary as much as people mrs ellison george said easily reaching for another sandwich i was explaining why i do not attend certain of them caroline relaxed of course i was concerned about emily unnecessarily it seems i hope you understand it would hardly become you to do less but i assure you i would not dream of taking emily anywhere i would not be happy to see my own sister i didnt know you had a sister caroline was suddenly interested again and so from the looks on their faces were the deckers lady carson george said easily we should be most delighted to meet her you must bring her to visit us mr decker said quickly im afraid she lives in cumberland george dismissed his sister with equal ease she very seldom comes to london carson decker would not let it go i dont think i know him do you know cumberland mr decker emily asked she did not like decker and resented his curiosity decker looked a little taken aback no miss ellison is itpleasant emily turned to george raising her eyebrows very beautiful if a little rustic he replied it lacks a good many of the amenities of civilized living no gaslights charlotte asked surely they must have hot water and fires certainly miss ellison i was thinking of gentlemens clubs imported wines tailors fit to patronize theatres of anything but the most bucolicin short society it must be most distressing for your sister miss decker said drily i must be sure not to marry a man with the misfortune or the perversity to live in cumberland then if such a gentleman should ask you you will have to refuse him charlotte said tartly emily hid a smile apparently charlotte did not like miss decker any more than she did but please heaven she was not going to be rude let us hope you have an offer more to your liking charlotte finished miss decker flushed in annoyance i dont doubt i shall miss ellison she snapped george sat forward his handsome face darkened his lip tight i doubt you will get an offer more favourable than lord carsons miss decker not for marriage at least there was a moments hot silence it was inexcusable for him to have embarrassed a woman in such a fashion whatever the provocation caroline was at a loss for words emily had to do something it is as well we do not all have the same tastes she said quickly but i dare say lord carsons estates are very comfortable living in a place is quite different from visiting it one always finds plenty to do when one is at home there are responsibilities how perceptive you are george agreed lord carsons estates are extremely wide he breeds bloodstock and runs a prize herd of cattle and of course there is extensive shooting and fishing there are mills of some sort also he stopped suddenly realizing he was speaking of possessions of money in a manner that was vulgar eugenie has more than enough to do especially with three children she must indeed be busy caroline said noncommittally and so the afternoon continued the conversation recovered emily worked hard to see that it did so and sarah was sufficiently impressed to exercise her very best manners which were excellent afterwards emily and charlotte were alone in the withdrawing room charlotte opened the doors to let in the late afternoon sun you were not a great deal of help emily said a little crossly you might have perceived what manner of creature miss decker is i also perceived what manner of creature he is charlotte replied staring at the roses mr decker emily said in surprise he is nothing not decker your lord ashworth that yellow rose is going to be out tomorrow what on earth does that matter charlotte i mean to have george ashworth offer for me so just control your tongue while he calls upon us you what charlotte turned round in amazement you heard me i mean to marry him so just play at being courteous at least for the present emily you hardly know him i will by the time it matters you cant marry him youre talking nonsense im speaking perfectly good sense you may be happy to spend your life dreaming but i am not i have no illusions that george is perfect perfect charlotte said incredulously hes appalling hes shallow a gambler and probably a rake hes notnot a part of our world emily even if he married you he would make you wretched youre a dreamer charlotte there is no man who wont make you wretched some time or other i think george will have more to compensate for it than most and i mean to marry him i wont allow you to prevent me she meant it standing in the withdrawing room in the gold evening sunlight looking at charlottes face the light on her heavy hair she realized just how profoundly she did mean it that which at the beginning of the afternoon had been an idea had now become a quite irrevocable intention chapter three it was the end of july and caroline was arranging flowers in the withdrawing room thinking about the household accounts she ought to be doing instead when dora came in without knocking caroline stopped a long white daisy in her hand really she could not allow this extraordinary behaviour she turned to speak then saw doras face dora what is it she let the daisy drop oh maam dora let out a long wail oh maam pull yourself together dora now tell me what has happened is it that butchers boy again ive told you to report him to maddock if he continues to be impertinent hell soon sort out a tongue that runs away with a young man otherwise hell lose his employment maddock will tell him that now stop sniffling and go back to your work and dora dont come into the withdrawing room again without knocking you know better than that she picked up the daisy from the sideboard and considered the vase again there was too much blue on the left side oh no maam dora was still there its nothing to do with the boy i dealt with that all rightthreatened to set the dog on him i did after all the meat you see we dont have a dog dora i know that maam but he dont you shouldnt tell lies dora but there was no criticism in her voice she considered it a fair retaliation her words were habit those she thought she ought to say certainly what edward would expect of her well what is it then dora doras face bunched into a howl again as she remembered oh maam the murderers at it again well all be strangled if we set foot outside the door carolines immediate reaction was to deny it to keep dora from hysterics nonsense youre perfectly safe as long as you dont go hanging around by yourself after dark and no decent girl does that anyway theres nothing for you to be afraid of but maam he tried it again dora wailed he attacked mrs watermans daisy right out in the daylight he did caroline felt a shiver of fear what are you talking about dora are you just repeating a lot of silly gossip where did you hear that from some errand boy no maam mrs watermans jenks told maddock really perhaps you had better send maddock to me now maam dora stood transfixed yes dora right now dora scuttled out and caroline tried to compose herself to arrange the rest of the flowers the result was unsatisfying maddock knocked at the door yes maddock she said coldly maddock dora tells me she was present when you andjenks is it were talking about the two girls who were killed recently and a new attack maddock stood stiffly surprise showing on his usual poker face no maam mr jenks came round to bring a bottle of port from mr waterman for mr ellison while he was in my pantry he told me i should keep our girls in even in daylight not send them on errands alone because their daisy or whatever her name is had been attacked in the street the other day apparently she is a wellbuilt girl and not the fainting kind she had a jar of pickles of some kind in her hand and hit him over the head with it she wasnt hurt and seemed quite in control of herself until she got home then of course she realized what could have happened to her and burst into tears i see she was glad she had not criticized him too obviously allowing herself room to retreat and where was dora i can only presume maam that she was in the passage outside the pantry door thank you maddock she said thoughtfully perhaps you had better not send the girls on any errands as jenks suggestsat least for the time being i wish you had told me this earlier i told the master maam he said not to worry you with it oh her mind raced over reasons why edward should have done such a thing what if she or one of the girls had gone out alone did he think only servants were attacked what about chloe abernathy thank you maddock you had better see if you can calm dora a little and suggest she stop listening at doors while you are about it yes maam certainly and he turned on his heel and went out closing the door silently behind him she had intended this afternoon to go and see martha prebble without really understanding why she always felt rather sorry for the woman although she did not like her greatly perhaps it was because she disliked the vicarwhich was quite stupid he was doubtless a very good man and probably suited martha as well as most husbands suit their wives one could not sensibly expect a vicar to be romantic if he was honest sober wellmannered and respected in the community that was a great deal to demand more was unreasonable and martha was eminently reasonable even if she had not been as a girl she would be by now which brought emily to her mind it was all very well for her to accept occasional social invitations from lord ashworth but one or two things emily had said lately led caroline to believe that she entertained ideas of a more permanent relationship for emilys own sake she must be disabused of such romantic follies otherwise she would be quite seriously hurt later on not only by the dissolution of her ambitions in that direction but by the casting of very definite disadvantage on any future designs people would be bound to think the worst other young men less aristocratic but far more practically within emilys reach might well be put offor their mothers would be which was more to the point in view of maddocks warning it would be better not to go even as far as the vicars alone she would take emily with her giving them an opportunity to talk privately it was a delightful afternoon for a walk far better than taking charlotte which had also crossed her mind charlotte disliked the vicar and seemed unable or unwilling to conceal it that was another thing somehow to school charlotte in the art of dissembling masking her feelings apart from anything else those feelings were far too violent to be becoming in a lady she loved charlotte dearly she was the warmest the quickest to sympathize and had by far the sharpest sense of humour among her daughters but she was impossibly forthright there were times when caroline despaired of her if only she could learn a little tact before she ruined herself socially with some totally unforgivable gaffe if only she would think before she spoke what kind of man would take her as she was she was practically a social liability at times she surveyed the vase of flowers with exasperation and decided she was in that frame of mind when further effort would only make the arrangement worse better find emily and advise her that they were going to the vicars charlotte at least would be pleased the walk to cater street was a pleasure full of sunlight and wind and the noise of leaves they set out shortly after three emily a little reluctantly but accepting it with good enough grace caroline thought she had better approach the subject obliquely maddock tells me there has been another girl attacked in the street she began in a businesslike manner better get this over with also oh emily seemed interested but not as frightened as caroline would have expected i hope she wasnt seriously hurt apparently not but that may be a matter of good fortune rather than lack of intent on her attackers part caroline replied sharply she must frighten emily enough to make sure she took no risks a risk was so easy an injury could be so permanent who was it anyone we know a servant of mrs watermans but that is hardly the point you must not go out alone any of you until this lunatic is apprehended by the police but that might be forever emily protested id planned to call on miss decker on friday afternoon you dont even like miss decker liking her has nothing to do with it mama she knows people whom i wish to know or at least to be acquainted with then youll have to take charlotte or sarah you are not to go alone emily emilys face hardened sarah wont come shes going to madame tussauds with dominic its taken her a month to persuade him then take charlotte mama emily said with withering disgust you know as well as i do charlotte will ruin it even if she doesnt actually say anything her face will give her away i take it she doesnt care for miss decker either caroline said a trifle drily charlotte has no sense of what is practical it was the perfect opening caroline took it immediately it seems to me that you have very little idea yourself my darling your pursuit of lord ashworth is hardly destined for any permanent success and you are seeing far too much of him for a temporary admiration you will draw an unwelcome attention to yourself you will find that you are remembered as ashworths she hesitated trying to find the right word i intend to be ashworths wife emily said with an aplomb that staggered caroline which seems to me to be excellently practical dont be ridiculous caroline said sharply ashworth wont marry a girl with neither family connections nor money even if he were minded to his parents certainly wouldnt permit it emily stared straight ahead of her and continued marching down the street his father is dead and he is quite equal to his mother there is no point in trying to dissuade me i have made up my mind and you have the temerity to say that charlotte is impractical caroline said in dismay as they turned into cater street at least keep your own counsel and dont say anythingcommittingin front of the vicar i shouldnt dream of saying anything of any sort at all in front of the vicar emily replied sharply he doesnt understand such things im sure he understands them but as a man of the cloth he would not be interested all men are equal before god emily gave her a look that stripped bare her own dislike of the vicar and made her feel a hypocrite it was an uncomfortable feeling especially when it was generated by ones own youngest child well if you imagine youre going to be a lady youll have to learn to exercise good manners even to those you dislike caroline said sharply aware that the reminder was possibly as timely to herself as to emily like miss decker emily looked sideways at her with a tiny smile caroline could think of no reply and fortunately they were at the prebbles door ten minutes later they were in the back parlour martha prebble had ordered tea and was sitting on the overstuffed sofa facing them incredibly sarah was also there deep in conversation she did not seem the least surprised to see them martha apologized for the vicars absence in a tone that left caroline feeling that in some way martha prebble was perhaps as relieved as they were so good of you to help mrs ellison martha said leaning forward a little i sometimes wonder how this parish would survive if it were not for you and your good daughters only last week sarah was here she smiled sideways at sarah helping with our charity for orphans such a delightful girl caroline smiled sarah had never been any concern except perhaps briefly when both she and edward had wondered if dominic had been a wise choice but it had proved excellent and everyone was happy with itexcept perhaps charlotte once or twice she had thought but martha prebble was talking again course we must help these unfortunate women in spite of what the vicar says i feel some of them are the victims of circumstance the poorer classes do not have the advantages of proper upbringing such as we have sarah nodded in agreement really sarah was pompous at times just like edward caroline had missed the beginning of the conversation but she could guess they were planning an evening lecture with a collection plate and tea and refreshments afterwards in aid of unmarried mothers it was something caroline had been drafted into in a moment of absentmindedness martha prebbles face showed a sense of loss for a moment as if she had meant something quite different then she recollected herself naturally but the vicar says it is our duty to help such people whatever their station however they came tofall of course caroline was delighted when the maid came in with the tea perhaps we had better discuss the programme who did you say was going to address us im afraid if you mentioned it i must have forgotten the vicar martha replied and this time her face was unreadable after all he is best qualified to speak to us on the subjects of sin and repentance the weaknesses of the flesh and the wages of sin caroline winced at the thought and privately thanked providence she had brought emily and not charlotte heaven only knew what charlotte would have made of that very suitable she said automatically it ran though her mind that it was also totally useless except to those who felt better for expressing such sentiments poor martha it must at times be very trying to live with so much rectitude she looked across at sarah she wondered if it had ever occurred to her to consider such things she looked so bland so satisfied to agree what thoughts were there behind her pretty face she turned to martha again who was staring at sarah was that grief in her face hunger for a daughter she had never had oh i do so agree with you mrs prebble sarah was saying eagerly and im sure the whole community looks to you for a lead i promise you we shall all be there my dear you may promise for yourself caroline added in haste but you cannot for others i shall certainly attend but we cannot speak for emily or charlotte i have an idea charlotte has a previous engagement and if she had not caroline would soon contrive one for her the evening would be bad enough without the kind of disaster charlotte could cause with a few illconsidered remarks they all turned to emily who opened her eyes with apparent innocence when did you say the occasion was mrs prebble next friday week in the evening at the church hall emilys face fell oh how most unfortunate i have promised to do a favour for a friend to visit an elderly relation with her you understand of course that she would not make the journey alone and visits mean so much to the elderly especially when they are not in the best of health emily you liar caroline thought afraid lest it show in her face but she had to concede lie though it was emily did it uncommonly well and so the visit progressed polite largely meaningless conversation excellent tea hot and fragrant rather gluey cakes and everyone hoping the vicar would not return they all walked home together sarah and emily talking sarah the more emily seemed a little short of temper caroline came a step or two behind them her mind still on martha prebble and what manner of woman she must be to enjoy living with the vicar had he perhaps been very different when he was young heaven knew edward was pompous enough at times perhaps all men were but the vicar was infinitely worse caroline had often ached to laugh at edward even at dominic only a lack of courage had prevented her did martha also long to laugh it was not a face of laughter in fact the more she thought about it the more it seemed a face of suffering strongboned reflecting deep feelings not a face of peace a month later the whole event was only an embarrassing memory charlotte was delighted to have been prohibited from attending and had agreed as fervently as was politic that she might well say something to cause illfeelinginadvertently of course tonight it was gusty and cold for august mama sarah and emily had all gone to a further affair at the church hall and since martha prebble had a summer cold it was all the more necessary that it should be well supported by people like mama capable of organizing seeing that those in charge of the catering attended to details that things were done on time and all was adequately tidied up afterwards again charlotte was happy to remain at home with a quite genuine headache she thought it might be caused by the heavy stormy weather and she opened the garden doors to let in the air it worked surprisingly well and by nine oclock she felt much better at ten oclock she closed the doors as it was now dark sitting with the darkness intruding she felt a little vulnerable remembering that there was nothing between the garden and the street except the rose wall she had been reading a book her father would not have approved of but a perfect opportunity since both he and dominic were also out it was half past ten and quite dark outside when mrs dunphy knocked on the withdrawing room door charlotte looked up yes mrs dunphy came in her hair a little untidy her apron screwed up in her fingers charlotte stared at her in surprise what is it mrs dunphy perhaps i shouldnt ought to bother you miss charlotte but i dont rightly know what to do about it about what mrs dunphy cant it wait till tomorrow oh no miss charlotte its lily mrs dunphy looked wretched shes gone out with that jack brody again and she isnt back its gone half past ten miss charlotte and shell have to be up at six in the morning well dont you worry about it charlotte said a little sharply she loathed trying to sort out domestic wrangles if she feels terrible tomorrow perhaps shell learn not to stay out too late in future mrs dunphy caught her breath in exasperation you dont understand miss charlotte its half past ten and she hasnt come home yet i never did like that jack brody mr maddock has said a number of times he was no good and lily ought to tell him to be on his way charlotte had noticed that maddock had a very ready regard for lily which would predispose him to disapprove of jack brody or anyone else with whom she stepped out i wouldnt take maddocks view very seriously mrs dunphy hes probably harmless enough miss charlotte its nearer eleven than ten and its dark outside and lilys out there somewhere with a man thats no good mr maddocks been out to look for her hes out there now but i think you should do something charlotte realized for the first time exactly what mrs dunphy was afraid of oh dont be foolish mrs dunphy she burst out not because it was foolish but because she was afraid now too shell be back presently and you can send her in here to me ill make it plain to her that if she does this again we shall dismiss her youd better tell maddock when he comes back and then go to bed yourself maddock will wait up yes miss charlotte do youdo you think shell be all right not if she ever does this again now go back to the kitchen and dont worry about it yes thank you miss and mrs dunphy went out still twisting her apron in one hand it was half an hour later after eleven when maddock came in charlotte put down her book she was just about to go to bed herself there was no point in waiting up for the others although they were later than she had expected church hall affairs usually finished by ten perhaps there was a lot of clearing up to do and then they would have to find a carriage home papa was at his club and she could not remember where dominic had said he was going what is it maddock its after eleven miss charlotte and lily still isnt home with your permission i think we should contact the police the police whatever for we cant get the police out because our servant girl is out with an undesirable man well be the laughingstock of the neighbourhood papa would never forgive us even if she is she looked for the word loose enough to stay out all night maddocks face tightened neither of our girls is immoral miss charlotte there is something wrong all right then if not immoral foolish thoughtless charlotte was beginning to be really frightened herself now she wished papa were here or dominic they would know what to do was lily really in danger should she call the police the very thought of speaking to the police was frightening demeaning respectable people did not have to call the police if she did would papa be furious her mind raced with possibilities of rumours of disgrace of papas face red with anger of lily lying in the road somewhere all right perhaps youd better call them she said very quietly yes maam ill go myself and lock the door behind me and dont worry miss charlotte youll be perfectly safe here with mrs dunphy and dora just dont let anyone in yes maddock thank you she sat down to wait suddenly the room seemed chill and she huddled further into the cushions on the sofa had she done the right thing wasnt it a little hysterical to send maddock out for the police just because lily was no better than she should be papa would be furious it would be talked about mama would be thoroughly embarrassed it reflected on the morality of the whole household she stood up to call maddock back then realized it was too late she had only just sat back on the sofa shivering when the front door opened and closed she froze then sarahs voice came clearly ive never been so tired in all my life does mrs prebble normally do all that herself no of course not caroline said wearily its just that with her being ill she didnt contact the people who normally help the door to the withdrawing room opened why charlotte what on earth are you doing sitting there like a child huddled in the halfdark are you ill caroline came forward quickly charlotte was so glad to see her she felt the tears prickle in her eyes it was ridiculous she swallowed hard mama lily hasnt come back maddocks gone to tell the police caroline stared police emily said incredulously and then her disbelief changed to anger what on earth are you thinking of charlotte you must be mad sarah came up behind her what will the neighbours say we cant have the police here just because a servant girl has run off with someone she looked around as if she expected to see him materialize wheres dominic hes out of course charlotte snapped do you think if he were here hed have gone to bed you should never have left charlotte alone emily said anger sharpening her tone well possibly mama didnt know lily was going to pick tonight to get lost charlotte could hear her voice cracking in her mind she saw lily lying in the street she might be dead or something and all you are thinking of is making silly remarks before anyone could take it any further the door opened and closed again and edward came in through the open doorway of the withdrawing room whats the matter he said immediately caroline charlotte sent for the police because lily has run away sarah said furiously i expect well be the talk of the street tomorrow edward stood aghast staring at charlotte charlotte he demanded yes papa she could not look at him what on earth possessed you to do such a foolish thing child she was afraid something caroline began be silent caroline he said sharply charlotte im waiting charlotte felt her tears disappear in rebellion she looked at him as angry as he was now if the whole street is going to talk about us she replied distinctly i would prefer it were because we were worried unnecessarily than because we didnt care enough to see if she was all right when she was lying somewhere hurt charlotte go to your room wordlessly head high she went out and up the stairs her bedroom was cold and dark but she could only think of the colder and darker streets outside she woke in the morning tired and heavyheaded she remembered last night papa was almost certainly still angry and poor lily would reap the worst of it possibly even a dismissal maddock was probably in for an unpleasant patch too she must remember not to make it worse for him by letting papa know it was he who had suggested the police and of course if lily were dismissed it would upset the whole household until a replacement was found mrs dunphy would be thoroughly aggrieved dora would be run silly and mama would discover all over again how hard it was to come by a respectable girl never mind to train her it was still early but there was no point in lying in bed anyway better to get it over with than to lie fearing and building it into ever larger proportions she had ventured as far as the downstairs hall when she saw dora oh miss charlotte whats the matter dora you look terrible are you ill not properly speaking im not but isnt it terrible miss charlottes heart sank surely papa had not turned lily out into the street in the middle of the night what is dora i went to bed before lily came back oh miss charlotte dora swallowed her eyes round she never did come back she must be lying murdered in the street somewhere and we all in our beds like we didnt care she doesnt have to be anything of the sort charlotte snapped trying to convince herself shes probably lying in bed too in some miserable room with jack whatshisname oh no miss its wicked of you to say she blushed violently im sorry miss charlotte but you didnt ought to say that lily was a good girl shed have never done that and without giving notice even charlotte changed the subject did the police come do you know i mean maddock went for them yes miss a constable came but he seemed to be of a mind that lily was no better than she should be and had simply run off but then i always reckon police is no better than they should be either all the low sorts of people they mix with i dare say stands to reason dont it i dont know dora ive never known any police breakfast was a formal and very grim affair even dominic looked unusually glum he and papa departed for the day and emily and mama went to the dressmakers for fittings sarah was in her room writing letters funny what an enormous correspondence she had charlotte could never find above two or three people to write to in a month it was half past eleven and charlotte was painting surprisingly successfully for the gray mood she was in when maddock knocked and opened the door what is it maddock charlotte did not look up from her palette she was mixing a muted sepia for leaves in the distance and wished to get it exactly right she enjoyed painting and this morning it was particularly soothing a person miss charlotte to see mrs ellison but since she is not in he insisted on seeing someone she abandoned the sepia what do you mean a person maddock what kind of a person a person from the police miss charlotte fear rippled through charlotte it was real at last or were they come to complain about having been bothered over a domestic matter then youd better show him in do you wish me to remain miss in case he becomes a nuisance you can never tell with police persons they are used to a different class of neighbourhood altogether charlotte would very much have liked his moral support no thank you maddock but stay in the hall so i can call for you please yes miss a moment later the door opened again inspector pitt maam the man who came in was tall and looked large because he was untidy his hair was unruly and his jacket napped his face was plain a little semitic although his eyes were light and his hair no darker than brown he appeared intelligent his voice when he spoke was unusually beautiful quite incongruous against his somewhat scruffy appearance he looked charlotte up and down keenly irritating her already im sorry to have to tell you when you are alone miss ellison but we cannot afford to waste time perhaps you would like to sit down instinctively she refused no thank you she said stiffly what is it you want im sorry i have bad news we have found your maid lily mitchell charlotte tried to stand quite still upright although her knees were weak she could feel the blood drain from her face where her voice was a squeak this wretched man was staring at her she did not normally dislike people on sightno perhaps that was not quite truebut this man certainly inspired it well she said keeping her voice level in cater street perhaps you had better sit down im perfectly all right thank you she tried to freeze him with a glance but he seemed oblivious to it quite firmly he took her arm and guided her backwards into one of the hardbacked chairs would you like me to call one of your maids he offered that incensed her she was not so feeble she could not conduct herself decently even in the face of shocking news what is it you wish to do that cannot wait she said with great control he wandered slowly round the room really the man had no manners at all still what could you expect of the police he probably could not help it your butler reported last night that she had gone out walking with a man called jack brody a clerk of some sort what time did you require her to come home half past ten i think im not sure no maybe ten oclock maddock could tell you with your permission i shall ask him it sounded more like a statement than a request how long was she in your employ it all sounded so final so much in the past four years about she was only nineteen she heard her voice drop suddenly and a sharp memory of emily came back to her emily as a baby emily learning to walk it was ridiculous emily had nothing in common with lily except that they were both nineteen the wretched policeman was staring at her you must have known her fairly well i suppose so she realized just how little she did know lily was a face around the house something she was used to she did not know anything about the girl behind the face at all what she cared about or was afraid of had she ever stayed out before what she had temporarily forgotten him he repeated the question no never mister she had forgotten his name too pitt inspector pitt he filled in for her inspector pitt was shewas she strangled like the others garroted miss ellison with a strong wire yes exactly like the others andand was she alsomutilated yes im sorry oh she felt weakness overwhelm her and horror and pity he was watching her apparently he saw nothing but her silence with your permission ill go and speak to the other servants they probably knew her better than you did there was something in his tone of voice that implied she did not care it made her angryand guilty we dont pry into our servants lives mr pitt but in case you think we are not concerned it was i who sent maddock for the police last night she coloured with anger as soon as she had said it why on earth was she trying to justify herself to this man unfortunately you were not able to find her then she added sharply he accepted the rebuke silently and a moment later he was gone charlotte stood staring at the easel the painting which had seemed delicate and evocative a quarter of an hour ago was now only so many graybrown smudges on paper her mind was full of blurred images dark streets footsteps fighting for breath and above all fear and the dreadful intimate attack she was still staring at the easel when her mother came in emilys voice floated from the hall im sure it will look perfectly dreadful if she leaves it as loose as that i shall appear to be quite fat its so unfashionable caroline had stopped staring at charlotte charlotte my dear what is it charlotte found her eyes filling with tears in an agony of relief she ran into her mothers arms and almost crushed her holding her so tightly lily mama shes been strangled like the others they found her in cater street theres a terrible policeman here now this moment hes talking to maddock and the servants caroline touched her hair gently it was an infinitely soothing gesture oh dear she said softly i was so afraid of that i never really imagined lily had run off i suppose i just wanted to think so because it was so much preferable to this your papa will be so angry at having the police here does sarah know no shes upstairs caroline pushed her away gently then we had better collect ourselves and prepare to face a good deal of unpleasantness i shall have to write to lilys parents it is only right that they should hear from a member of the family someone that knew lily and we were responsible for her now go upstairs and wash your face and you had better tell sarah where did you say this policeman was inspector pitt returned in the evening when edward and dominic were home and insisted on speaking to them all again he was very persistent and authoritative ive never heard of such nonsense edward said furiously when maddock came to announce him the fellows impertinence is beyond words i shall have to speak to his superior i will not have women involved in this sordid affair i shall speak to him alone caroline girls please withdraw until i send maddock for you they all stood up obediently but before they could reach the door it opened and the untidy figure of pitt came striding in good evening maam he bowed to caroline evening he said and took in everyone else his eyes lingering a moment longer on charlotte to her annoyance sarah turned to look at her with disgust as if she were somehow responsible for this creature coming into the drawing room the ladies are just leaving edward said stiffly will you be so good as to stand aside and let them pass how unfortunate pitt smiled cheerfully i had hoped to speak to them in your presence for moral support as it were but if you prefer i speak to them alone then of course i prefer that you do not speak to them at all they can know nothing of this affair whatsoever and i will not have them distressed well of course we shall be very grateful for anything that you know sir i know nothing either i dont interest myself in the romantic affairs of servant girls edward snapped but i can tell you all that the family knows of lily i can tell you about her service record her references where her family lives and so on i imagine you will want to know that yes although i dont suppose its in the least relevant however i do require to speak to your wife and daughters women are very observant you know and women observe other women you would be surprised how much might miss your eye or mine but not theirs my wife and daughters have more to interest them than the romances of lily mitchell edwards face was growing redder and his hands were clenched sarah moved a little closer to him really mr she dismissed his name i assure you i know nothing whatsoever you would be better employed questioning mrs dunphy or dora if lily confided in anyone it would be one of them find this wretched man she was walking out with oh mrs corde we already have done he says he left lily at the end of the street within sight of this house at ten minutes before ten he had to be back at his lodgings himself at ten oclock or be locked out youve only got his word for that dominic spoke for the first time he was leaning back in one of the chairs looking a little flushed but the most composed of them all charlottes heart lurched as she turned to him he looked so calm papa was ridiculous beside him he was in his lodginghouse by ten oclock pitt replied looking down at dominic with a faint pucker between his eyes well he could have killed her before ten oclock couldnt he dominic persisted certainly but why should he i dont know dominic crossed his legs thats up to you to find out why should anyone thats right sarah moved closer to dominic visibly allying herself with his theory you should be there not here at least he had the discretion not to come in daylight emily whispered to charlotte poor sarahs frying dont be spiteful charlotte whispered back although silently she agreed and she knew emily knew it you believe it was him do you mrs corde pitt raised his eyebrows of course who else would it be who indeed i think its perfectly obvious edward found his tongue again they had some sort of lovers quarrel and he lost his temper and strangled her well make all the arrangements for the funeral of course but i dont think you need to bother us again maddock can tell you anything else you need to know of a practical nature not strangled sir garotted pitt held his hands up pulling tight an invisible wire with a wire he just happened to be carrying no doubt in case of such a contingency edwards face was white i shall report you to your superiors for impertinence charlotte felt an idiotic desire to giggle no doubt it was hysteria did he also kill chloe abernathy pitt enquired and the hiltons maid as well or have we two hangmen loose in cater street they stared at him in silence he was a ludicrous figure in their quiet withdrawing roomwith ludicrous ugly and frightening suggestions charlotte felt emilys hand creep into hers and she was glad to hang on to it no one answered pitt chapter four the following day was one of the worst that charlotte could ever recall everyone was feeling wretched although it showed variously in different people papa was shortertempered than usual and very full of authority mama was endlessly seeing to practical details as if sorting out the kitchen and the housework would somehow alter other events sarah kept repeating the comments of social acquaintances until charlotte finally lost her temper and told her in no uncertain terms to be quiet dominic already was quiet to the point of silence emily seemed least affected her mind obviously on other things the only good thing to be said was that grandmama was still staying with susannah and as yet was not in a position to offer comment since it was a saturday there was no work and no one felt like going out for any other purpose the vicar sent a small note by messenger to express his regrets very courteous of him sarah said glancing at it when her father had read it its the least he could do charlotte said irritably the very thought of the vicar was enough to make her spit you dont expect him to come in person over a servant sarah was also annoyed now besides there really isnt anything he can do charlotte searched for an argument to that and could not find one she saw dominics amused dark eyes on her and felt the blood rush to her face if only she could stop that happening it made her feel so foolish caroline came in at that moment her face coloured from rushing her hair a little astray edward looked up what on earth have you been doing my dear you look liketheres something on your nose she brushed at it automatically and made it worse charlotte took a handkerchief and removed the mark from her it was flour have you been cooking edward asked with pained surprise whats the matter with mrs dunphy shes got a headache im afraid all this business has hit her very hard she was fond of lily you know anyway i rather like cooking i came because i just remembered i promised to take a receipt for vegetable soup to mrs harding and i wondered if two of you would take it for me this afternoon charlotte liked mrs harding she was a sharptongued but very longmemoried old lady with endless recollections about all sorts of people she had known in her somewhat colourful youth before she had married above herself and settled to wealth and respectability charlotte doubted all the stories were true but they were hugely entertaining ill be happy to go mama she offered quickly you must take sarah or emily with you caroline looked at them both im busy emily replied i have sewing to do since we are a maid short there is linen to be mended and if mrs dunphy is sick sarah added then i shall stay at home and see if there is anything i can do for her perhaps i can talk with her take her mind off it charlotte gave her a withering stare she knew perfectly well her reasons were not to do with mrs dunphy sarah thought mrs harding was a disreputable old gossip and she did not wish to know her socially as far as the gossip went she was perfectly correct but had her stories been a little more up to date they might well have found her a readier audience charlotte doesnt need company edward said tartly its less than two miles away go straight there charlotte and return as soon as it is civil for you to do so i doubt there will be any need to explain i expect the news is all over the neighbourhood and dont gossip old mrs harding is an inveterate busybody give her the receipt and wish her well and then come home again i wont have the girls walking in the street alone caroline said firmly either someone goes with her or mrs harding will have to wait the streets are too dangerous nonsense caroline shell be perfectly safe edward sat up straighter its broad daylight it was broad daylight when mrs watermans maid was attacked caroline rejoined i wonder you didnt tell us about that so we as well as the servants might have been warned my dear caroline where is your sense of proportion this lunatic whoever he is attacks servant girls girls of loose morals no one could take charlotte to be such a creature what about chloe abernathy she wasnt a servant yes i was surprised about her myself i had always considered her to be proper enough if somewhat lightheaded it shows how one can be deceived because she was killed caroline said with a lift of amazement in her voice precisely that is a completely circular argument charlotte thought almost forgetting herself so far as to say so you are saying she was killed because she was immoral and she was immoral because she was killed she finished aloud i am saying she was killed because she kept immoral company edward looked at her with a frown and the fact that she was killed proves it are you frightened to go out alone this time there was concern in his voice he was not unkind yes she said honestly i would prefer not to dominic stretched out his legs and then stood up swiftly if you like ill come with you i doubt i should be of any assistance whatsoever here either with the linen or with mrs dunphy and certainly not in the kitchen the journey with dominic was marvellous in spite of the heat which beat down from the august sun and up in waves from the pavement mrs harding was delighted to see them although for once her flow of gossip seemed to have been cut off at the source perhaps it was the very masculine presence of dominic she offered them refreshments and they were glad to accept a lemonade before parting she understood but regretted their need for haste at least she said so but charlotte had the distinct feeling dominics presence hampered her although she obviously admired himas indeed what woman would not on the way home dominic himself had seemed a little put out at her reticence he said he had heard she was the best gossip in the district and was greatly disappointed in her charlotte tried to explain what she felt to be the reason and ended up by regaling him with the best stories she could remember to his vast entertainment he laughed with pure delight and charlotte was blissfully painfully as happy as she had ever been they arrived home to find sarah in a rage papa whitefaced emily silent and mama absent in the kitchen the happiness vanished as if a door had been closed on it though dominic was still smiling as if he had not felt the change whats the matter with everyone he asked going over to open the french windows you need some air its a perfect day then he swung round his face clouded youre not still thinking about lily are you im sure she wouldnt want or expect us to stay glum for the rest of the summer this is hardly the rest of the summer dominic sarah said tartly but it has nothing to do with lily at least not in the way you mean the wretched police have been here again charlotte felt only anger until she saw her fathers face he seemed less angry than genuinely distressed what for papa havent we told them all we know he frowned looking away from her it appears they are not satisfied that it was this fellow she was walking out with or if it was not him then some lunatic well they cant imagine it has anything to do with us dominic said incredulously i dont know what they imagine edward replied sharply i personally think they are using it as an excuse to be inquisitive to exercise their curiosity what have they been asking charlotte looked from one to the other of them surely if they are impertinent we dont have to answer them send them out of the house its all very well for you to speak sarah snapped you were not here you could have been out if youd been prepared to come with me charlotte was quite mild she was delighted that dominic had come instead but a hint of resentment over the spoilt afternoon lingered at the back of her mind dont worry you havent escaped anything sarah tossed her head a little they are coming back to see you i dont know anything and dominic charlotte turned to edward papa what can i tell them i never even saw lily that day that i can recall she felt a quick stab of shame and i didnt know her very well at any time i dont know what they want once again edwards anxiety was more apparent than his irritation they asked all sorts of odd questions about myself and maddock and they were very keen to speak to dominic dominic frowned and a flicker of concern crossed his face what about the other victimsapart from lily dont be foolish sarah said sharply they can hardly consider you had anything to do with it except perhaps that you may have noticed something some odd person hanging around the street perhaps after all you do travel up and down the street almost every day a new and appalling thought occurred to charlotte could the police possibly be idiotic blind enough to think one of them dominic and papa were out frequently passed cater street sarah saw it in her face i shall soon disabuse them of that lunacy she said furiously i know dominic far too well he is not the sort of man even to look at servant girls much less accost them he is not some creature of uncontrollable passions he is a civilized man such a thing would not enter into his head charlotte turned to dominic and saw for an instant in his face a look of hurt of deep frustration as if he had glimpsed and then lost something of inestimable value she did not know then what momentary dream of sensuality or danger he had seen and missed it was just over an hour later when pitt returned this time bringing with him a man charlotte had not seen before a man who was very briefly introduced to her as sergeant flack he was a slight man of hardly average height but looked even smaller beside pitt he remained absolutely silent but his eyes wandered all over the room with consuming interest good afternoon mr pitt charlotte said calmly she was determined not to be ruffled by him and to dismiss him as soon as possible im sorry you have taken the trouble to return since im quite sure i can tell you nothing more however of course i will answer any questions you wish to ask perhaps that was a little rash she must not let him be impertinent you would be surprised what is sometimes useful pitt replied he turned to his sergeant and briefly directed him to the kitchen to question maddock mrs dunphy and dora he looked back to charlotte he seemed to be totally at ease which in itself was irritating he ought to have been a little a little impressed after all he was a mere policeman and in the house of those considerably superior to him socially what is it you wish to know she said coldly he smiled charmingly the name and whereabouts of the lunatic who is garotting young women in the streets of this neighbourhood he replied of course that is presuming it is one person and not a crime and then another crime in imitation she was surprised into facing him meeting his eyes whatever do you mean that sometimes people hear of a crime especially if it is a gruesome one and it gives them the idea to solve their own problems in the same manner to dispose of someone that is in the way from whose death they could benefit financially or otherwise and he snapped his fingers you have a second murder or a third or whatever the second murderer hopes the first will be blamed you make it sound so matteroffact she said with distaste it is a matter of fact miss ellison whether it is this fact or not i have to enquirebut not until i have exhausted some of the more obvious possibilities what possibilities do you mean she asked and then wished she had not she did not desire to encourage him and to be honest she was a little afraid of the answer three young women have been garotted in this area over the last few months the first thing that comes to mind is that there is a maniac loose i would have thought that was the answer she said with some relief why should you imagine any other why dont you take your enquiries to the sort of place where you will find such peoplei mean the sort of people who are likely to she fumbled for the exact phrase she wanted the criminal classes the underworld he smiled a little derisively there was bitter amusement and a little patronage in his tone what sort of a place do you imagine the underworld is miss ellison something i find by opening a sewer manhole no of course not she snapped i have no knowledge of it myself of course it hardly comes within my social sphere but i know perfectly well that there is a world of criminal classes whose standards are totally different she raked him up and down with a withering stare at least from mine oh very different miss ellison he agreed still smiling but there was a hardness in his eyes although whether you are referring to moral standards or standards of living you didnt say but perhaps it doesnt matterthey are not as far apart as the words imply in fact i have come to think they are usually symbiotic symbiotic she said in disbelief he misunderstood her supposing she did not know the meaning of the word each dependent upon the other miss ellison a relationship of coexistence of mutual feeding interdependence i know what the word means she said furiously i question your choice of it under the circumstances poverty does not necessarily produce crime there are plenty of poor people who are as honest as i at that he broke into a genuine grin you find that amusing mr pitt she said icily i spoke forgetting that you do not know me well enough for that to be any standard but at least you know that i do not garotte young women in the street he looked at her at her waist at her slender hands and wrists no he agreed i doubt you would have the strength your sense of wit is impertinent mr pitt she tried to stare him down but since he was well over six feet and she was half a foot shorter she failed and not in the least amusing she finished it was not intended to amuse miss ellison nor to be wit i meant it quite literally now he was serious again and i doubt you have ever seen real poverty in your life yes i have have you his disbelief was quite apparent have you seen children abandoned when they are six or seven years old to beg or steal to keep alive sleeping in gutters and doorways soaked to the skin by rain owning nothing but the rags they stand in what do you suppose happens to them how long do you think it takes for an undernourished sixyearold alone in the streets to die of starvation or cold when he has been taught nothing but to survive when he cannot read or write when he has been passed from one person to another until nobody wants him what do you think happens to him either he diesand believe me ive seen a lot of their little bodies lying in the back streets dead of cold and hunger or else hes lucky and some kidsman or sweep takes him in in spite of herself she let her pity overcome her anger a kidsman a kidsman is a man who picks up children like these he went on and at first takes them in and feeds them gives them shelter and some sort of security a place to belong then gradually he prevails on their gratitude by teaching them to thieve at least to thieve with skill to begin with they go out with some of the older boys watching them work something simple to start with it used to be silk handkerchiefs when they were more fashionable later they graduate to something more subtle the clever ones even progress to inside pockets watch chains or seals a really firstclass kidsman will run classes hell hang a row of old coats on a line across the room a silk handkerchief trailing from each pocket and the boys will take them one by one to try their skill or he might use a tailors dummy with bells sewn all over the coat to tinkle at the slightest disturbance or even stand with his back to them himself those who succeed are well rewarded while those who fail are punished a child with courage or hunger and nimble fingers can make himself and his master a good living until he grows too large or loses the agility of his hands she was horrified and through her distress for the child she was angry with him for making her look at such things what happens then does he starve she asked she did not want to know and yet she could not bear not to probably he graduates to being a footpad or if hes smart joins a band of pickpockets the swell mob the what the swell mobthe best end of the pickpocketing business welldressed usually having rooms in a moderate neighbourhood a mistress which they pick up when they are about thirteen or fourteen almost always an older girl oddly enough they are very faithful and regard it as a sort of marriage they work in gangs of three to six each taking his part in the maneuvering and execution of a robbery they very often rob women how do you know all this and if you know about it why dont you arrest them prevent it he snorted slightly we do arrest them nearly all of them spend some of their time in prison she shivered what a terrible life surely it would be better to be a sweep didnt you say something about sweeps that at least would be honest my dear miss ellison it would take a wiser and considerably more experienced woman than you are to find an honest sweep have you ever been up a chimney she raised her eyebrows in disdain as frigid as she could make it you have a curious idea of the occupations of a gentlewoman mr pitt but if you need an answer then no i have never climbed up inside a chimney no he did not seem in the least perturbed by her tone he looked her up and down again and she found herself colouring under his gaze you would not fit he said frankly you are far too tall and far too big she blushed furiously oh you have an excellent waist but his eyes went to her shoulders and bust then on down the rest of you would most certainly get stuck in the vertical tunnels the dogleg bends and soot would get in your nose and mouth your eyes your lungs it sounds horrible but not dishonest except for the sweep because he gets someone else to do the labour but as you pointed out they could hardly do it themselves miss ellison no professional cracksman robs a house without first obtaining information as to the layout and where the valuables are kept can you think of a better way of doing that than by going through the chimney system you meanbut thats terrible of course its terrible miss ellison its all terrible he said furiously poverty and crime loneliness dirt chronic disease drunkenness prostitution beggary they steal forge money and letters practice fraud and prostitution but seldom murder unless pushed to it and they dont come out of their own world except for profit theres no profit in garotting three helpless girls in cater street they were not even robbed she could not look away from him she was held by a mixture of fascination and horror she disliked him acutely and what he was saying frightened her what do you mean what are you suggesting they are dead oh very im saying that the kind of garotter you are thinking of from the underworld the criminal classes kills for gain he would not risk his neck for fun he kills to escape capture and only if it is necessary far better to merely immobilize or stun he first marks his victim choosing only those who have money then why a new world had opened in front of her ugly and confused intruding into the safety of her beliefs the things she had considered certain fixed he looked at her with a very slight smile as if there were understanding between them if i knew that perhaps i should know who it is but his reason is not a simple oneand not a clean one like a robbery or revenge it is something darker than that twisted deeper into the soul she was frightened and she disliked him disliked his familiarity his intrusion into her emotions forcing her to know things she did not want to know i think you had better go mr pitt there is nothing whatsoever i can tell you and i believe you wished to see mr corde although im sure he can tell you nothing either perhaps you had better consider the other girlswho were killed she drew breath and tried to steady herself i shall consider everything miss ellison but yes i would like to see mr corde perhaps you would be good enough to call maddock and send for him the evening was not a pleasant one dominic would not tell anyone what pitt had asked him although edward did press him as far as discretion would allow dominic remained almost silent which was worrying in itself because it was out of character charlotte was afraid even to entertain her thoughts she kept just beyond framing the possibility that pitt had discovered something that embarrassed dominic something to be ashamed of of course it could have nothing to do with the death of lily or the others but everyone knew that men even the best of them occasionally did other things that were not known it was the nature of men and to be expected but not acknowledged for ones own peace of mind she talked determinedly of other things aware that sometimes what she said was nonsense but better nonsense than the long gaps in conversation when thoughts intruded in spite of being tired she slept badly and woke late causing her to have to rush to get ready for church she had never particularly enjoyed church the formality of it the atmosphere of rigid propriety the polite greetings that were a ritual rather than a matter of friendship the form of service that was always the same till she found herself saying the words and singing the responses like a parrot she could go through the whole thing automatically providing she did not stop to think where she was once she stopped she had to look at the words to get herself started again until habit took over and of course the vicar would preach a sermon it was usually on sin and the need for repentance the woman taken in adultery was his favourite story although he never drew from it the same meaning that charlotte did and why was it always the woman why were men never taken in adultery in all the stories she had ever heard it was women who committed the adultery and men who found them and commented on it what about the men with whom they were found why didnt the women throw stones at them she had asked papa that a long time ago and been told with some surprise not to be ridiculous the vicar gave his usual sermon today in fact if anything it was even worse his text was blessed are the pure in heart but his message was more blessed are the clean of action he went to great lengths to condemn unclean actions and the more he spoke about harlots and prostitutes the more charlotte found her mind seeing the poor that that wretched pitt had described children left to starve at the age when she and her sisters were just learning to read and write being taught by miss sims in the schoolroom she thought of young women left alone with babies how else could they live she very seldom swore but this morning she would have consigned mr pitt to hell for haying forced her to know of such things she sat on the hard pew and stared at the vicar everything he said made her feel worse she had always disliked him and by the end of this morning she hated him with a vehemence that depressed and frightened her she was sure it was very unchristian and unfeminine to hate anyone this way and yet she felt it with a depth and rightness she could not deny she looked up at the organ loft and saw martha prebbles pale face as she played the closing hymn she looked bored and unhappy too sunday lunch was a miserable affair and the afternoon must of course be spent suitably for the sabbath tomorrow grandmama was returning from susannahs which was not greatly to be looked forward to either it would have seemed impossible but monday was worse grandmama arrived at ten oclock muttering dark prognostications about the downfall of the neighbourhood of the gentle classes of the world at large morality was going downhill at a great rate and they were all destined for disaster they had no sooner got her unloaded and upstairs in her own sitting room when inspector pitt arrived again bringing with him the silent sergeant flack sarah was outsomething to do with some charitable cause or other emily was at the dressmakers being fitted for another occasion with george ashworth really she ought to have more sense it was time she realized he was a gambler a philanderer or worse and that nothing would come of it for her but the ruin of her reputation and all the time mama was upstairs trying to soothe grandmama into a state where she could be left without making everyones life a plague there was no one charlotte wished to see less than inspector pitt he came into the morning room filling the doorway coat flapping hair untidy as always his affability irritated charlotte almost beyond bearing what do you want mr pitt he did not bother to correct her to say that he was inspector pitt this also annoyed her for she had intended it to slight him good morning miss ellison the most perfect summer day is your father at home of course not this is monday morning like most other respectable people he is in the city just because we are not working class does not mean we are idle he grinned broadly showing strong teeth charmed as i am by the pleasure of your company miss ellison i am here working also but if your father is out then i shall have to speak to you if you must i dont investigate murder for pleasure his smile vanished although his good humour remained there was a hint of tragedy even anger in his voice there is little pleasure in it for anyone but it must be done i have already told you what little i know she said exasperatedly several times if you cannot solve it then perhaps you had better give up and pass it over to someone who can he ignored her rudeness was she a pretty girl lily mitchell didnt you see her she said in surprise it seemed a most elementary thing to have omitted his smile was sad as if he were sorry for her as well as patient yes miss ellison i saw her but she was not pretty then her face was swollen and blue her features distorted her tongue stop it stop it charlotte heard her own voice shouting at him then will you be good enough to step off your dignity he said quite calmly and help me to find out who did that to her before he does it to someone else she felt angry and hurt and ashamed yes of course she said quickly turning away so he could not see her face and even more so she could not see him yes lily was quite pretty she had very nice skin she shivered and felt a little sick as she tried to picture that skin bloated and marked by violent death she forced it out of her mind she never had spots or looked sallow and she had a very soft voice i think she came from somewhere in the country derbyshire oh was she friendly with the other servants yes i think so we never heard of any trouble with maddock she swung round to face him her thoughts coming too quickly to disguise you mean precisely did maddock admire her fancy her she had never before considered the possibility of maddock having such feelings possessiveness over his servants perhaps but desire jealousy maddock was the butler in formal clothes polite in charge of the house but he was a man and now that she thought about it probably not more than thirtyfive or so not much older than dominic what a preposterous thought to think of him in the same breath as dominic pitt was waiting watching her face i see the thought is a new one to you but not unlikely when you weigh it there was no point in lying to him no i remember someone saying something mrs dunphythe night lilydisappeared she said maddockliked lily that he would be bound to disapprove of jack brody because he took lily out whatever he was like but that could mean no more than that he was afraid of losing a good girl it takes a long time to train a new one you know she did not want to get maddock into trouble she could not really imagine he had followed lily out and done that to her could she but maddock went out that evening into the streets pitt went on yes of course you already knew that he went to look for her because she was late any good butler would do that what time im not sure why dont you ask him she was aware as soon as she said it that it was foolish if maddock were guilty of anything not that he was of course but if he were he would hardly be likely to tell pitt the truth about it im sorry why should she apologize to this policeman ask mrs dunphy she went on stiffly i believe it was a little after ten but naturally i was not in the kitchen to know for myself i have already asked mrs dunphy he replied but i like to get corroboration from as many sources as possible and her memory on her own admission is not very reliable she was very upset by the whole business and you think im not just because i dont weep all over the place the intimation that she had not cared as much as she should have i would hardly expect you to be as fond of a servant girl as the cook might be pitt said with his mouth twitching slightly as if there were a smile inside him and i would think your nature excites to anger rather more readily than to tears you think i am illtempered she said then immediately wished she had not it implied she cared what he thought of her which was absurd i think you are quicktempered and take little trouble to hide your feelings he smiled a not unattractive quality and uncommon in women especially of gentle birth she found herself blushing hotly you are impertinent she snapped his smile broadened he was looking straight at her if you didnt wish to know what i thought of you why did you ask she could think of no answer to that instead she summoned all the dignity she could and faced him squarely i believe it is quite possible maddock was fond of lily but you surely cannot imagine he held the same regard for the hiltons maid and still less for chloe abernathy therefore to suppose that he might have killed them all is faulty reasoning in the extreme if you attribute his motive to fondness if not then you have no motive at all i think perhaps you had better begin again on a more promising line of enquiry she intended it as a dismissal he did not move you were the only one here at the time he asked apart from mrs dunphy and dora of course why your mother and sisters were at some church function where were your father and mr corde ask them you dont know no i dont but they came home passing close to cater street if not actually through it if they had seen anything im sure they would have told you possibly of course they would whyever not a terrible thought hit her like a blow you cantyou cant imagine that one of them would i imagine everything miss ellison and believe nothing until there is proof but i admit there is no cause to suppose he left it hanging a second but someone did i would like to have another talk with maddockundisturbed that evening everyone was at home even emily they sat with the french windows open onto the lawn and the late sun in the garden but instead of the balmy air of evening filled with the scents of the day it seemed only heavy with oppression it was sarah who said what they were all thinking or something close to it well im not worried she lifted her chin a little inspector pitt seems a sensible man to me hell soon discover that maddock is as innocent as the rest of us i dare say hell even decide so tomorrow charlotte spoke her thoughts as usual before she considered i have no faith at all in his good sense he is not like us we all know he is a different class of person sarah said quickly but he is used to dealing with criminals he must know the difference between a perfectly respectable servant like maddock and the kind of ruffian who goes around strangling girls garotting charlotte corrected and there is a lot of difference between ruffians as you put it who attack and rob people and the sort of person who garottes women especially servant girls who have nothing worth stealing dominic smiled widely and how would you know charlotte have you become an expert on crimes of passion she doesnt know edward said very sharply she is being contrary as usual oh i dont agree dominic was still smiling charlottes not contrary shes just forthright and she has been spending a lot of time lately with that police fellow perhaps shes learned something she could hardly learn anything of value or suitable for a lady to know from such a person edward said with a frown he turned to her charlotte is this true have you been seeing this person charlotte found herself colouring with confusion and anger only when he called here on police business papa unfortunately he has come on two occasions when no one else was in and what have you been saying to him answering his questions of course we hardly have social conversations dont be impertinent i meant what has he asked you not a great deal now that she came to think of it their conversations had been of no immediate relevance to his investigations he asked me a little about lily and about maddock hes a perfectly awful man sarah shivered it really is appalling that we should have to have him in the house and i think we should be very careful about letting charlotte talk to him you never know what she may forget herself and say do you suggest we should stand in the street and answer his questions charlotte lost her temper completely and if you dont let him speak to me he will suspect i know something shameful that you are afraid i will let slip charlotte carolines voice was quite soft but there was an edge of firmness in it that had the desired effect i dont think hes awful dominic said casually in fact i rather like him you what sarah was incredulous i rather like him dominic repeated he has a dry sense of humour which must be difficult enough in his job or perhaps its the only way to retain his sanity you have a peculiar taste in friends dominic emily said tartly i should be obliged if you didnt entertain him at home it would seem redundant at present dominic said pleasantly charlotte appears to be doing very well i doubt he has time to spare charlotte was about to reply when she realized he was teasing she blushed with confusion her heart was beating so violently she worried in case someone else noticed it dominic this is not a suitable occasion caroline said clearly it seems this person really does consider that maddock might be involved more than involved edward was totally serious now i gather he actually thinks he might have killed lily but thats ridiculous sarah was not yet more than superficially worried her concern was still only a matter of social inconvenience a stigma to be circumvented with care to be talked away he couldnt have emily was thinking hard frowning edward folded his hands together staring at them why not sarah looked up startled but no one else spoke after all edward went on it is inescapable that someone did it would also appear that it might well be someone who lives around this area which precludes the sort of criminal who ordinarily attacks people in the street robbers and so forth and no robber of any efficiency attacks a servant girl out late such as lily she could have nothing worth taking poor child perhaps maddock became infatuated with her and when she rejected him for this young brody he lost his head we have to consider that that may be the truth however disagreeable papa how can you sarah burst out maddock is our butler he has been for years we know him he is still a human being my dear edward said gently and subject to human passions and weaknesses we must face the truth denying it will not alter it nor can it help anyone not even maddock and we have to consider the safety of others especially dora and mrs dunphy sarahs face dropped you dont think i dont know my dear it is for the police to decide not us i dont think we should leap to conclusions caroline was obviously unhappy but we must be prepared to face the truth when it becomes inevitable charlotte could no longer keep silent we dont know that it is the truth she was garotted not strangled killed with a wire if maddock suddenly lost his temper why did he have a wire with him he doesnt walk around carrying a garotting wire my dear its quite possible he lost his temper before he left the house edward said quietly she was not looking at them refusing to face it will not help face what charlotte demanded that maddock could have killed lily of course he could he was out in the street at the right time so were you papa so was dominic i dare say there were a hundred other men who were and we shall never know threequarters of them any one of them could have killed her dont be foolish charlotte edward said sharply i dont doubt the other households can account for their menservants at the relevant time and there is no reason to suppose any of them were acquainted with poor lily anyway and did maddock know the hiltons maid charlotte demanded caroline winced charlotte your behaviour is becoming offensive edwards face was stern it was obvious he wished to end the matter we understand that you would prefer it to be someone we dont know a wanderer from some slum region but as you pointed out yourself the motive of robbery doesnt stand now let us consider the matter closed you cant just say that maddock killed lily and leave it at that she knew she was risking his very real anger but the indignation inside her would not let her be silent edward opened his mouth but before he could muster words emily broke in you know papa charlotte has a certain truth maddock might have killed lily although it seems rather pointless if he was fond of her in fact selfdefeating but why on earth should he kill the hiltons maid or chloe abernathy and they were killed first before lily it doesnt make sense charlotte felt a rush of warmth towards emily she hoped emily knew it murder itself is hardly sensible emily edwards colour heightened with anger to be defied by charlotte was becoming habit but by emily as well was intolerable it is a bestial crime a crime of animal passion and unreason are you saying hes mad she looked at her father that maddock is bestial or passionately unreasonably insane no of course not he snapped i am not an expert in criminal insanity and neither are you but i presume inspector pitt is it is his job and he believes maddock is guilty now you will not discuss the subject any further is that understood charlotte looked at him his eyes were hard and could it possibly be that they were also frightened yes papa she said obediently she was used to obedience it was habit but her mind rebelled whirling with new thoughts with new fears finding shapes with something very dreadful chapter five the wretched policeman returned the following day questioning maddock first then caroline then finally asking if he could see charlotte again why charlotte was tired and this morning the deep unhappiness of fear and the reality of death had settled upon her the blindness of the first shock had passed she had gone to sleep on tragedy and wakened to find it still with her i dont know dear caroline replied still in the doorway she held the door open for her daughter but he asked for you so i suppose he must think you can help somehow charlotte stood up and walked out slowly caroline touched her arm gently do be careful before you speak my dear we have had a great tragedy dont let your distress or your concern for maddock provoke you into saying something you may afterwards regret because it has led to conclusions you did not foresee do not forget he is a policeman he will remember everything you say and try to see meanings beneath it charlotte never thought before she spoke in her life sarah said crossly shell lose her temper and i cant blame her he is a most disgusting person but the least one can do is behave like a lady and say as little as possible emily was sitting at the piano i think he admires charlotte she said touching the top note lightly with her finger emily this is no time for levity caroline said sharply cant you ever think of anything but romance sarah glared at her emily smiled with a small uplift of the corners of her mouth do you think policemen are romantic sarah i think inspector pitt is excessively plain and of course he must be common or he wouldnt be a policeman but he has the most beautiful voice sort of surrounds you like warm treacle and his diction and grammar are excellent i suppose he is trying to better himself emily lily is dead caroline gritted her teeth i know that mama but he must be used to that kind of thing so it wont prevent him from admiring charlotte she turned to her sister and regarded her objectively and charlotte is very handsome i dare say he doesnt mind her tongue he is probably used to indelicacy charlotte felt her face flaming the thought of inspector pitts even entertaining such an idea about her was unbearable hold your tongue emily she fumed inspector pitt has no more chance of enjoying my attentions thanthan you have of marrying george ashworth which is just as well because ashworth is a gambler and a cad she pushed past caroline and into the hall pitt was in the smaller rear sitting room good morning miss ellison he smiled widely it would have been charming in anyone else good morning mr pitt she said coldly i cannot think why you should have sent for me again but since you have what is it you want she stared at him trying to make him feel awkward and instead thought for an appalling moment that she saw in his eyes the admiration emily had spoken of it was intolerable dont stand there staring like a fool she snapped what do you want his smile vanished you seem very disturbed miss ellison has something further happened to distress you an event a suspicion something you remembered his light intelligent eyes were on her face waiting you appear to suspect our butler she replied icily which is naturally distressing to me both because you are blaming someone in my home and no doubt you will arrest him and put him in prison and because since im perfectly sure he didnt do it whoever did is still out in the streets i would have thought that such a situation would be enough to distress any person of the slightest sensibility you leap to conclusions with the greatest of mental athleticism miss ellison he smiled to begin with we frequently arrest people but we take them to court we do not put them in prison you might feel sure he is not guilty and i am inclined to agree with you but neither you nor i has the right to dismiss anyone from consideration until something is proved or disproved regarding their involvement in the affair and to conclude you are wrong in assuming that because i am still looking at maddock i have ceased to look elsewhere i do not wish for a lecture on police procedure mr pitt she could see his point even that he was right and it did nothing to help her temper i thought it might be reassuring what is it you want mr pitt the night that lily was killed when was the last time you saw maddock before he went to look for her ive no idea what did you do that evening i read what can that possibly have to do with it oh his eyebrows rose with interest he smiled what did you read she could feel herself colour with annoyance because her father would have disapproved of her books as something that was not becoming for a lady to wish to know about that is not your concern mr pitt her answer seemed to amuse him it suddenly occurred to her that he might have thought it was a romance or old love letters i was reading a book on warfare in the crimea she said angrily his eyes widened in surprise an unusual interest for a lady possibly what has it to do with lily which im told is your job here i take it you chose that opportunity because your father does not approve of your interest in such bloody and unfeminine subjects that is none of your concern either so you read alone you did not call in maddock or dora to fetch you any refreshment or alter the gas or lock the doors i didnt wish for any refreshment and im quite capable of turning the gas up or down myself or locking the doors then you didnt see maddock at all at last she realized what he was seeking she was annoyed with herself for not having seen it before no so he could have been out any time during the evening as far as you know mrs dunphy said he spoke to her he only went out when lily was late home andand he became worried so he says but mrs dunphy was alone in the kitchen he could actually have gone out earlier no he couldnt if i had called for anything i should have noticed his absence but you were reading a book your father did not approve of he was looking at her closely his eyes were frank as if there were no wall between them he didnt know that but even as she said it the sickening thought came that maddock probably had known it she had taken the book from her fathers study maddock knew the books well enough to spot which one was missing and he knew her she turned to face pitt he merely smiled however he went on dismissing the book with a wave of his hand really he was a most untidy creature so different from dominic he looked like a wading bird flapping its wings i can think of no reason why he should harbour any feelings against miss abernathy his voice lifted was miss abernathy a friend of yours not especially no he said thoughtfully from what i have been told she would hardly have been your choice of company a somewhat flighty girl much given to laughter and rather frivolous pursuits poor child charlotte looked at him he was quite grave was he not sufficiently used to death in his job that it no longer moved him she was not an immoral girl she said quietly just very young and still a little foolish indeed he gave a tight little grimace and not in the least likely to have had a liaison with someone elses butler i imagine her sights were set a good deal higher she could hardly have remained in the kind of society she sought were she in any way engaged with a servant even a superior one are you being sarcastic mr pitt quite literal miss ellison i do not always observe the rules of society but i am quite aware of what they are you surprise me she said cuttingly do you disapprove of sarcasm miss ellison she felt her face flush it had been the perfect barb i find you offensive mr pitt if you have some question to ask in connection with your business please do so otherwise permit me to call maddock to have you shown out to her surprise he also blushed and for once he did not look at her i apologize miss ellison the last thing i wished was to offend you now she was confused he looked unhappy as if she had actually hurt him she was at fault and she knew it she had been intolerably rude and he had so far forgotten himself as to give her as good in return she had used her social advantage to fire the last shot it was not something to be proud of in fact it was an abuse of privilege it must be rectified she did not look at him either im sorry mr pitt i spoke hastily i am not offended at you but a little more disturbed by by circumstances than i had allowed for please pardon my rudeness he spoke quietly emily was right he had a beautiful voice i admire you for that miss ellison again she felt acutely uncomfortable knowing he was staring at her and there is no need to fear for maddock i have no evidence on which to arrest him and quite honestly i think it is very unlikely he had anything to do with it her eyes flew up to meet his to search and see if he were being honest i wish i did have some idea who it was he went on seriously this kind of man does not stop at two or three please be most careful do not go out alone even for the shortest distance she felt a confusion of horror and embarrassment run through her horror at the thought of some nameless madman stalking the streets just beyond the darkened windows and embarrassment over the depth of feeling in pitts eyes surely it wasnt conceivable that he actually no of course not it was just emilys stupid tongue he was a policeman very ordinary he probably had a wife somewhere and children what a big man he was not fat but tall she wished he would not look at her like that as if he could see into her mind no she said with a quick swallow i assure you i have no intention of going out unaccompanied we none of us shall now if there is nothing more i can tell you you must persist in your enquirieselsewhere good day mr pitt he held the door open for her good day miss ellison it was late afternoon and she was alone in the garden picking off dead rose heads when dominic came over the grass towards her how very tidy he looked at the rose bushes she had done funny i never thought of you as soregimented thats more like sarah tidying up after nature i would have expected you to leave them she did not look at him she did not want the disturbing emotion of meeting his eyes as always she said what she meant i dont do it to be tidy taking off the dead heads means the plant doesnt put any more goodness into them seeds and so forth it helps to make them bloom again how practical and that sounds like emily he picked a couple off and dropped them into her basket what did pitt want i would have thought hed asked us everything possible by now im not really sure he was very impertinent then she wished she had not said it perhaps he had been but she had also been rude and it was less forgivable in herself it may be his way of of surprising people into frankness a little redundant with you i would have thought he grinned her heart turned over habit familiarity all vanished and it was as if she had just met him again enchanted he was everything that was laughing masculine romantic why oh why could she not have been sarah she looked down at the roses in case he read it all in her eyes she knew it must be naked there for once she could think of nothing to say did he go on about maddock he asked yes he snapped off another dead head and dropped it into the basket does he honestly think the poor devil was so besotted by lily that when she chose brody instead he followed after her and killed her in the street no of course not he wouldnt be so stupid she said quickly is it so stupid charlotte passion can be very strong if she laughed at him mocked him maddock dominic she faced him without thinking you dont think he did do you his dark eyes were puzzled i find it hard to believe but then i find it hard to believe anyone would strangle a woman with a wire like that but someone did we only know one side of maddock we always see him very stiff and correct yes sir no maam we dont ever think what he feels or thinks underneath you do think so she accused i dont know but we have to consider it we dont pitt might have to but we know better no we dont charlotte we dont know anything at all and pitt must be good at his job or he wouldnt be an inspector hes not infallible and anyway he said he didnt think that maddock was involved he just had to exhaust all the possibilities did he say that yes then if he doesnt think its maddock why does he keep coming here i suppose because lily worked here what about the others chloe and the hiltons maid well i suppose he goes there too i didnt ask him he stared at the grass frowning she longed to say something wise something he would remember but nothing came to her but a storm of feelings he took off the last rose and picked up the basket well i suppose hell either arrest someone or declare it an unsolved crime he said drily not a very comforting thought i think id rather anything than that and he walked back into the house she followed after him slowly papa and sarah and emily were all in the withdrawing room and as she came in after dominic mama also entered from the other door she saw the basket of flower heads ah good thank you dominic she took them as he held them out edward looked up from the newspaper he was reading what did that policeman ask you this morning charlotte he asked very little she replied actually all she could clearly remember was how rude she had been and the relief that he did not seriously suspect maddock you were in there long enough emily observed if he was not asking you questions what on earth were you doing emily dont be foolish edward said tersely and your comments are in poor taste charlotte please answer me a little more fully we are concerned really papa he seemed only to be going over the same things again about maddock what time he went out what mrs dunphy said but he did admit that he did not believe maddock guilty himself only that he had to pursue every possibility oh she had expected relief even joy she could not understand the silence that greeted her papa yes my dear are you not relieved the police do not suspect maddock inspector pitt said as much then whom do they suspect sarah asked or didnt they tell you that of course they didnt edward frowned im surprised they told her so much are you sure you understood correctly it was not perhaps wishful thinking it was almost as if they did not want to believe her no i didnt misunderstand he was perfectly plain what exactly did he say caroline asked quietly i cant remember but i was not mistaken in his meaning of that i am perfectly sure well thats a relief sarah said putting down her sewing she sewed very beautifully charlotte had envied her that for as long as she could remember now perhaps the police wont return emily smiled yes they will what for if they dont suspect maddock to see charlotte of course inspector pitt admires charlotte greatly edward drew in a sharp breath emily this is not an occasion for frivolity and the less fortunate imaginings of some policeman are not of interest to us no doubt many men of ordinary background admire women who are above them but have more sense than to let it be known but the police have no reason to come back no real reason sarah pressed that is the most real of reasons emily was not easily suppressed crimes come and go loves last longer some do dominic said drily well its obviously someone from the criminal classes sarah said ignoring them both i dont know why they even considered it could be otherwise it seems incompetent to me no charlotte said quickly it isnt edward turned to her in surprise isnt what my dear isnt someone from the criminal classes they only kill if they cant help it either to escape or something of that sort or else for revenge they only attack people they dont know in order to rob and lily was not robbed how do you know all this charlotte was conscious that they were all looking at her inspector pitt told me and it makes sense i dont know why you should expect the criminal classes to make sense sarah was impatient it will be some lunatic someone who is quite depraved and does not know what he is doing she shivered poor devil dominic spoke with feeling and charlotte was surprised by it why should he have such pity for a creature who had horribly killed three times spare your concern for lily and chloe and the hiltons maid edward said with a little snort dominic looked around why theyre dead this poor animal is still alive at least i presume he is stop it edward said sharply youll frighten the girls dominic gazed round at them im sorry although i think this is a time when a little fear might save your life he turned his head to charlotte so pitt doesnt think its some madman from the underworld what does he think there was only one conclusion she faced it as calmly as she could but her voice still shook he must think it is someone who lives here somewhere near cater street nonsense edward sat up sharply ive lived here all my life i know just about everyone within a radius ofof miles there is nolunatic of such monstrous proportions in this neighbourhood good heavens if there were does he not think we should know it such a creature could hardly pass unnoticed he could not appear to be like the rest of us couldnt he charlotte looked at him then surreptitiously at dominic how much of people really showed in their faces did any of them even guess the wildness of feeling in her please heaven no if such madness such tormented hatred as this creature felt was there to see why was this man not known already he must be seen by someonefamily wife friends what did they think if they knew could you know something like that about someone and not speak or would you refuse to believe it turn away from the evidence construe it as meaning something else what would she doif she loved someone if it were dominic would she not protect him from everything die to do it if necessary what a monstrous thought as if anyone remotely like dominic could have been involved in violence the obscene anger that drove one to terrify and destroy to linger in shadows along the street walls hungering after fear what kind of man was he she could only see him as a black shadow against mists had lily seen his face had any of them if she saw it herself would it be a face she knewa new nightmare or a familiar one they were talking round her she had missed it why did they accept that it could be maddock so easily it was almost as if they were grateful for a solution as if any solution were better than none no that was dreadful but in spite of herself she could understand it the suspicion was gone any knowledge any fact to face was better than wondering knowing he was still out there in the gaslit streets whatever the known was it was better than the unknown better than the police here asking questions suspecting she could understand but at the same time she was ashamed of them for it of herself for not saying something exposing it in a way she was allowing it allowing them all to deceive themselves the conversation flowed round her and she had no heart to join in emily had no such thoughts and the following day the whole sordid business had receded to the dimension of a mere practical problem of course she was sorry about lily but lily was beyond help now and grieving would do her no good emily had never understood mourning the most peculiar thing about it was that it was the most pious people who indulged in it those who should have been the ones to rejoice after all they preached heaven and hell loudly enough surely to mourn was the gravest insult one could pay to the dead it presupposed judgment was going to find them light in the balance lily had been ordinary enough but there was nothing in her to warrant damnation so one could presume she was in a better place whatever sins she had committed and they could only be small were surely washed clean by the payment of her life so the whole matter was better forgotten except for the rather squalid business of discovering who killed her and that was the job of the police all she and her family could do was take sufficient care to see they did not get in the way of this lunatics garotting wire the practical matters of real importance were the positive ones such as discovering what everyone might wear at the party to be given by a certain major and mrs winter to which george ashworth was to escort her it would be a serious setback if she were to find her dress duplicated or nearly so she aimed ultimately to set fashion rather than follow it but in the meantime she must judge it to a nicety so as not to appear merely eccentric she would have to consult the misses madison and miss deckerwithout their being aware of it of course the police did not return for several days apparently they were conducting their investigations elsewhere probably going back to the earlier deaths talking to the abernathys and the hiltons the whole affair was not discussed openly again although they nearly all found themselves saying small things letting thoughts slip out they were mostly expressions of relief that the police were out of the house and had transferred their unwelcome presence with its attendant speculation and scandal to someone else the other feeling that came through was the continuing anxiety about what might happen next where this creature might be if it were actually conceivable that he came from the immediate neighbourhoodsomeones manservant or a small trader emily gathered all her information and procured a magnificent gown in the palest lilac with delicate silver trim she was in particularly good health her skin was clear far better than the elder miss madisons and her eyes bright she had excellent colour not too high and her hair for once did everything she wished ashworth called for her in his coach naturally paying his respects to the family before departing mama was very civil papa even more so but charlotte was as uncompromising as usual your sister charlotte has little liking for me i think ashworth observed as soon as they were alone its a pity shes a handsome creature emily knew she had nothing to fear from charlotte but it might be wise not to be too readily available to ashworth it was more than possible he hankered more for the chase than for the prize indeed she is she agreed and you are not the only one to have noticed it i should hardly think so then he looked at her with a smile or were you being particular tell me if you know a nice piece of gossip only that our police inspector seems much taken with her to charlottes fury he laughed outright and knowing you you have not let it go unmarked poor charlotte how very irritating to be admired by a policeman of all things their arrival was all emily could have hoped for indeed have planned and thereafter for at least the first two hours all went well but later she found ashworths attention wandering not only to his drinking and gambling companions but especially to one hetty gosfield a conspicuous girl of somewhat indelicate charms but influential parentage and worse than that money she had always known that ashworth had an admiring eye for a pretty woman and she had not expected to hold his entire attention or even the larger part of it without considerable work but this gosfield woman was beginning to be a threat emily watched as ashworth at the far side of the room smiled into the eyes of hetty gosfield and hetty laughed happily back a quarter an hour later the situation was much the same emily took a deep breath and considered above all things she must not make a scene ashworth abhorred any vulgarity that was not his own even when he found it amusing he still despised it she would have to be far subtler than that put the gosfield woman in the wrong it took her some time to work it out as her attention was divided between carrying on a conversation with mr decker without talking too apparent nonsense controlling her temper and coming to a satisfactory plan of action when at last she moved it was with decisiveness she knew one of ashworths young friends passably well the honorable william foxworthyemptyheaded possessing more money than good taste and of an exhibitionistic temperament it was not hard to attract his attention he was at one of the tables playing cards he saw her watching him she waited until he won oh excellent mr foxworthy she applauded what skill you have indeed i swear i have never seen anyone clevererexcept lord ashworth of course he looked up sharply ashworth you think he is cleverer than i she smiled sweetly only at cards i have no doubt you excel him in many other things i dont know about other things miss ellison and i assure you i have a greater skill at cards she gave him a gentle look full of patience and total disbelief ill show you he stood up the pack in his hand oh pray dont trouble yourself she said quickly it was going extremely well exactly as she had intended im sure you are most able not able miss ellison he was stiff now full of outraged pride that implies mere indifference i am better than ashworth ill prove it oh please i didnt mean to disturb your game she protested still loading her voice with disbelief you doubt me do you wish me to be honest then you leave me no option but to beat ashworth and oblige you to believe me he strode across the room towards ashworth who was still totally engaged with hetty gosfield george he said loudly oh please emily cried plaintively but did not follow him beyond the first few paces she must not be seen to have instigated this or the whole purpose would be destroyed it worked marvellously foxworthy disrupted the teteatete demanding to prove his superiority ashworth could not resist and hetty gosfield argued at first but as ashworth became annoyed with her because she was being tiresome and drawing a vulgar attention to them she sulked and went away with someone else after it was all over emily found herself with ashworth again beat him he said with satisfaction of course emily smiled he apparently had no idea that the exercise had nothing to do with skill at cards i had presumed you would i cant bear vulgarity he went on aggrievedly bad taste for a woman to make an exhibition of herself again emily agreed although privately she thought it was no worse for a woman than for a man but that was not the way society saw it and she knew the rules well enough to play by them and too well to imagine one could break them and still win it was only when she was at home lying in bed staring at the gaslight patterns on the ceiling reflected from the lamps outside that she reviewed the evening there was no question in her mind that she still intended to marry george ashworth but there must be a weighing of his faults a decision as to which might reasonably be changed and which she would have to learn to live with and herself change perhaps it was too much to require of any man of breeding and wealth that he should be faithful but she would most certainly require that he be discreet in his liaisons he must never make her an object of public sympathy when the time was right she must make that quite clear again he might gamble his own money as much as he chose but never mortgage that which she might in good conscience regard as his provision for herin other words their house the wages of servants a carriage and good horses and a dress allowance sufficient to permit her to appear as becomes a lady she fell asleep still thinking of the practicalities the following thursday she went with sarah to visit the vicar and mrs prebble for tea and to discuss the forthcoming church bazaar but what if the weather is inclement sarah asked looking from one to another of them we must trust in the lord the vicar replied and september is frequently the most delightful month of the year even if it rains it is unlikely to be cold i dont doubt our faithful parishioners will suffer it with good grace emily profoundly doubted it and was glad that charlotte was not there to express her opinion is it not possible to arrange some form of shelter in case of misfortune she asked we can hardly rely upon the lord to favour us above others us above others miss ellison the vicar raised his eyebrows i fear i have not grasped your meaning well perhaps others may require rain she explained farmers the vicar looked at her coolly we are about the lords business miss ellison there was no courteous answer to that it may be quite easy to arrange to borrow some tents martha said thoughtfully i believe they have some at st peters no doubt they will be happy to lend them to us it will be something of a social occasion sarah observed people will be wearing their best clothes it is a church bazaar miss ellison to raise money for charity not for women to disport themselves the vicar was cold his disapproval obvious sarah blushed in embarrassment and emily charged to her defence in a manner worthy of charlotte surely to appear on the business of the lord one would wish to wear ones best vicar she said blandly we can still behave with decorum we do at church where you would not expect us to come higgledypiggledy a curious expression flickered across marthas face something like triumph and fear at the same time and an obscure humour also gone before it could be recognized true miss ellison the vicar said piously let us hope everyone else has the sense of duty and fitness that you do we must set an example we must also hope that people enjoy themselves martha offered after all they will be little likely to part with their money if they feel miserable emily glanced at the vicar we are not a public amusement he said icily emily could think of nothing less likely to amuse the public than the vicars frozen face surely we can be happy she said deliberately without being remotely like a public amusement as if charlotte were at her elbow she went on in fact the very knowledge that we are in the service of the lord will be a source of joy to us if it ever occurred to the vicars mind that she was being sarcastic there was no sign of it in his face but she caught marthas eye and wondered if perhaps martha would like to have said the same herself im afraid you are not wise in the ways of the world the vicar said looking down at her as indeed it becomes a woman not to be however i must advise you that people are not as happy in the lords work as they should be else the world would be a far better place instead of the vale of sin and frailty it is alas how weak is the flesh even though the spirit would have it otherwise there was no answer to that either emily turned her attention to the practical details these at least she was extremely good at although they interested her not at all but it was only fair she did not leave them all to sarah on the way home they were both quiet for a long time till they were within half a mile of their own house sarah pulled her wrap a little closer round her it is far cooler than i expected she said with a little shiver it looked as if it would be warm youre tired emily sought the obvious explanation you have been working very hard on thisaffair she decided to omit the adjective that came to her tongue i cant leave poor mrs prebble to do everything you have no idea how hard that woman works sarah walked a little more quickly she was quite correct emily had very little idea of what martha prebble might do with her time it had never interested her to think of it does she at what at raising money for the church at visiting the sick and the poor at running the orphanage who do you suppose arranged the outing for them last month who do you think laid out old mrs janner she had no family and she was as poor as a mouse emily was surprised martha prebble did yes sometimes others help but only when they feel like it when it suits them or when they think someone else is watching who will praise them for it i didnt know that sarah pulled her shawl closer round her again i think thats why mama sometimes puts up with her rather funny ways and with the vicar i must admit myself they are a little trying at times but one must bear in mind the work they do emily stared ahead of her such thoughts obliged her admiration in spite of her profound dislike of the vicar and by association of martha also people were full of the most curious traits caroline also was thinking of the vicar and martha prebble but less kindly she had been aware of marthas work especially with orphans long enough for the surprise to have faded she also understood some of the loneliness of a woman who has had no children and who is driven by both family and circumstances to labour for those who are not her own it must frequently be an anonymous thankless task but a little of their company especially the vicars was sufficient for a long time a very worthy woman grandmama observed a fine example to others of the parish a pity there are so few who follow her you must be pleased with sarah shes turning out very well caroline thought it made her sound like a cake or a pudding but she knew grandmama did not appreciate levity at her expense yes caroline agreed still looking at her sewing there seemed to be far more linen to mend than she had remembered but it was a long time since they had been short of a maid in fact since before sarah was married pity you cant do something about charlotte grandmama went on i really dont know how youre ever going to get that girl married she doesnt appear even to be trying caroline rethreaded her needle she knew why charlotte did not try but it was none of grandmamas business she certainly is different in her tastes from emily she said noncommittally and in her tactics but then there is no reason why they should be the same you ought to speak to her grandmama insisted point out the practicalities to her what is going to happen to her if no one marries her have you considered that yes grandmama but frightening her will do no good and even if she does not marry she will survive better single than married to someone disreputable or looseliving or who could not provide for her satisfactorily my dear caroline grandmama said exasperatedly it is your duty as her mother to see that she does not and it is also your duty to control this house in an organized fashion when are you going to get another maid i have already made enquiries and mrs dunphy has seen two but they were not satisfactory what was the matter with them one was too young no experience the other had a reputation that was undesirable perhaps if youd checked lily a little more closely she wouldnt now be murdered this sort of thing doesnt happen in a wellordered house it didnt happen in the house caroline was stung to sharpness at last it happened in cater street and you are quite irresponsible to suggest even by implication that lily brought it upon herself in any way or that she was immoral and i wont have it said in my house well really grandmama stood up her hands tight her face flushed no wonder charlotte doesnt know how to keep a civil tongue in her head and emilys chasing after that neerdowell just because he has a title shell do nothing but make a fool of herself and youll be to blame i told edward when he married you that he was making a mistake but of course he was enamoured of you and didnt listen now charlotte and emily will have to pay for it well dont say afterwards that i didnt warn you i wouldnt dream of it grandmama do you want dinner upstairs or will you be sufficiently recovered in time to come down for it i am not ill caroline i am merely very disappointed though not surprised one can recover from disappointment as well as illness caroline said drily you are immodest caroline and unfeminine no wonder charlotte is a shrill if youd been my daughter i would have seen to it that you grew up to be a lady and without giving caroline a chance to reply to that she went out and closed the door behind her with a sharp clack caroline sighed there was more than enough to do enough trouble without grandmama aping a prima donna still she ought to be used to it by now only she resented the criticism of charlotte the slander against lily was painful in a different and deeper way what kind of person would kill a harmless penniless girl like lily mitchell only a madman a madman straying from the criminal world or a madman who looked like any of the rest of them except at night when he saw a young woman alone in the streets could it even be someone she herself had seen her thoughts were interrupted by edward coming in good evening my dear he kissed her on the cheek have you had a pleasant day he looked at the linen and frowned still no replacement for lily i thought you were seeing one or two today i did nothing suitable where are the girls and mama he sat down stretching comfortably do you wish some refreshment before dinner no thank you i stopped at my club i thought you were a little late she said as she glanced at the clock where are they he repeated sarah and dominic are dining with the lessings the who the lessings the sexton and his family oh and the others emily is with george ashworth again i wish you would speak to her edward i dont seem to make any impression im afraid my dear she will have to learn by the bitterness of experience i doubt she will listen to anyone i could forbid her of course but they would be bound to see each other at social occasions and it would only lend an air of romance to the affair which would strengthen it in her eyes it would defeat its purpose in the end she smiled she had not credited him with such perception she had made the suggestion only to safeguard herself you are quite right she agreed it will probably blow past of its own accord in time and charlotte and mama charlotte is to dinner with young uttley and grandmama is upstairs in something of a temper with me because i would not let her say that lily was immoral he sighed no we must not say so although i fear it may well be true why because she was killed if you believe that then what about chloe abernathy my dear there are many ways of the world that you do not know and it is better that it should be so but it is more than possible that chloe brought it upon herself also unfortunately he hesitated even wellborn girls form liaisons alliances he left it hanging one doesnt knowthere may bejealousies revenges things it is better we do not discuss and caroline had to be content with that although she found herself unable to believe it wholly or to dismiss it from her thoughts chapter six it was a week later that caroline finally succeeded in engaging a new maid to take lilys place it had not been easy because although there were plenty of girls seeking a good position many of them were unskilled and many had reputations and references that were less than satisfactory and of course since lilys death and the manner of it were known it was not the most pleasing prospect for a respectable girl seeking employment however millie simpkins seemed the best applicant they were likely to get and the situation was becoming most awkward without someone in the position the next thing would be that mrs dunphy would find she could not cope and use the shortage of help as an excuse to give her notice as well millie was a pleasant enough girl sixteen years old she appeared to have an accommodating and willing nature and was clean and passably neat she lacked any great experience this being only her second position but that could be all to the good if she had few set ways then she could be taught moulded into the pattern of this household and perhaps most important of all mrs dunphy took to her immediately it was wednesday morning when millie knocked on the door of the rear sitting room come in caroline replied millie came in a coat over her arm and dropped a funny little curtsey yes millie what is it caroline smiled at her poor child was nervous please maam this coat israther spoiled maam i dont rightly know how to mend it im sorry maam caroline took it from her and held it up it was one of edwardssmart a formal jacket with velvet collar it was a moment or two before she found the tear it was in the sleeve in the lower section at the back of the arm how on earth could anyone tear themselves in such a place she explored it with her fingers pulling the pieces apart it was almost as if a sharp claw had ripped it about two inches long im not surprised caroline agreed dont worry about it millie ill see what i can do with it but we might well have to send it to a tailor get a new piece set in yes maam millies relief was almost painful caroline smiled at her you did the right thing to bring it to me now youd better go back and get on with the plain linen and i believe theres a petticoat of miss emilys thats torn yes maam she dropped another awkward little curtsey thank you maam after she had gone caroline looked at the coat again she could not remember edwards having worn that coat for a long time weeks in fact where could he have done that obviously he would not have worn it with such a tear why had he not asked her to do something about it at the time he could not have failed to notice it it was a coat he frequently wore to his club in fact he had worn itthe night lily was killed she could remember quite clearly his coming in and being so angry with charlotte for having sent for the police the picture came to her mind the gaslight on the wall hissing a little throwing a yellowish light on the claretcoloured velvet they had all been too busy with fear and anger to think of clothes perhaps that was why he had forgotten it it took her most of the afternoon to mend the tear she had to pull threads from the seams to darn it invisibly and even so she was not entirely satisfied with it edward was home fairly early and she mentioned it straight away more or less in the way of an apology im afraid it is still noticeable she held it up but only if you catch it in the light which of course you wont since it is on the back of the arm how in goodness name did you come to tear it he frowned looking away from her im not sure that i can remember it must have happened ages ago why didnt you mention it at the time i could have mended it as easily then as now in fact more easily lily would have done it she was extremely clever at such things well it probably happened since lilys death and i dare say i thought you had enough to do being short a maid without this after all i have plenty of other clothes i havent seen you in it since the night of lilys death she did not know why she said it well maybe thats the last time i wore it that explains very completely i should think why i didnt mention it it was hardly of importance compared with lily and the police in the house yes of course she folded it over her arm meaning to tell millie to take it upstairs how did you do it what the tear i really dont remember my dear whatever does it matter i thought you were at your club all evening and that that was why you were so late i was his voice was becoming a little shorter im sorry if the new maid is unable to do these chores but my dear caroline there is no need to make such an issue of it i dont intend to discuss it the whole evening she put it over her arm and opened the door no of course not i just wondered how it happened it is such a large tear and she went out into the hall to call millie it would be a good idea for her to steampress it to make it lie flat it was dominic who quite unintentionally shattered her peace of mind and set her in a turmoil she could not control he came to her a couple of days later holding out a waistcoat with his forefinger poked through a tear on the pocket how did you do that she took it from him and examined it shoved my hand in it too far he smiled sheer stupidity can you mend it i saw the marvellous job you did on papainlaws coat she was pleased he should say so because she was still not totally satisfied with it herself thank you yes i think so ill try this evening if you can do papas im sure you can do that a thought occurred to her as he turned away when did you see it what he looked back when did you see the tear in edwards coat he frowned very slightly the night lily was killed how observant of you i wouldnt have thought in all the excitement youd have seen it or did you see it at the club that was where he did it he shook his head fractionally i think you must have misunderstood i was at the club but papa left very early and his coat certainly wasnt torn then i remember it clearly belton the footman gave him his hat and his cane he would have noticed couldnt have failed to you must have the wrong night no because i had dinner with reggie hafft he dropped me off in cater street and i walked the last half mile or so i saw papa coming from the opposite end of cater street and called out to him but he didnt hear me he got home just a little while before i did oh it was a stupid remark but she was too stunned to think clearly edward had lied to her over something completely trivialbut on the night lily had been murdered why why had he not told her the truth was it something he was ashamed of or afraid of what on earth was she thinking this was preposterous he must have been to call on some friend and forgotten that was it it would be explained quite easily and then she would be ashamed of the thoughts that crossed the back of her mind now the first time she saw him alone was when they retired to bed caroline was sitting on the stool in front of the mirror letting down her hair and brushing it edward came in from the dressing room whom did you call on the night lily was killed she said lightly trying to make it sound as if it did not matter she saw his face reflected in the mirror he was frowning whom did i what she repeated it her heart beating strongly her eyes avoiding his no one he said a little sharply ive already told you caroline i was at my club i came straight from the club home i dont know why you are continuing to discuss the matter do you imagine i was lurking in cater street after my housemaid he was thoroughly angry now no of course not she replied quietly dont be foolish his face hardened into the white temper she knew very well she had offended him profoundly by using the word foolish or had he chosen to pretend it was so in order to avoid having to tell the truth or think of another lie she must be overwrought her mind was quite off the rails becoming ridiculous better try to dismiss it and go to bed edward was still observing an icy silence she thought for a moment of apologizing then something within her acknowledged that she would think of it again pursue it again which would make any apology a lie they both got into bed without speaking he lay perfectly still breathing regularly she had no idea whether he was asleep trying to sleep or merely pretending to be to avoid further involvement why was she even entertaining such thoughts she knew edward knew that for whatever reason he lied it could have nothing to do with what had happened in cater street she knew that yet he must have been doing something that he did not want her to know such as what nothing good or he would have told her the truth or at least whom he was with if not the reason where could edward have been to return via the opposite end of cater street where could he have been that needed lying about she tried to think of his pattern of life the things he did daily whom he knew the other places he visited the more she thought about it the more she realized how little she knew at home she knew him so well she could often tell beforehand what he would say how he would feel about any event whom he would like or dislike but when he left for the city he walked into a different part of his life and she actually knew nothing about it except what he told her she went to sleep deeply unhappy the next day was appalling caroline woke with a dull headache and felt so fearful and depressed she spoke only when necessity forced her she was busy in the linen cupboard checking millies work when dora came to say that inspector pitt from the police was back again and would she see him caroline stared at the pile of pillowcases in front of her her heart pounding her mouth dry had pitt been to the club and found out that edward was lying it was impossible that he had killed lily for any reason but he must be hiding something she would have to try to protect him if only she knew the truth maam dora was still waiting oh yes dora tell him i shall be there in five minutes put him in the withdrawing room yes maam pitt was standing staring out of the window when she opened the door he swung round to face her good morning mrs ellison im sorry to disturb you again but im afraid i have to pursue everything you seem to be pursuing us rather extensively mr pitt do i presume from your remark that you pursue everyone else as diligently certainly maam what an oddlooking man he was so inelegant his presence dominated the room or did she just feel that way because she was frightened of him what is it you wish this time mr pitt better to get it over with your husband came home unusually late on the evening lily mitchell was murdered it was more of a statement than a question as if he were reaffirming something he already knew yes did her voice sound as strained as she felt where had he been what should she say should she repeat what edward had told her or the truth that dominic had subsequently let slip she realized as she put the problem to herself that she had not even questioned dominics version if she told him edward was at the club the whole evening she would be saying at the same time that edward had lied to her it would make it that much harder for him toto negotiate himself out of the lie but if she said he had been elsewhere then she obliged him to explain something he would not or could not pitt was staring at her with those light intelligent eyes she felt transparent like a child caught in the pantry i believe he said he was at his club she said slowly making her mouth form each word although whether he was going on to dine with friends afterwards i dont remember and he didnt tell you his enquiry was polite was it extraordinary did the careful lie show in her face in view of what we found when we returned homecharlotte having sent for the police the distress our fearsi never thought of it again it seemed the least important of things naturally however if you dont know i cannot eliminate the possibility that mr ellison may have passed somewhere near the scene of the crime at the appropriate time he smiled showing his teeth his eyes bright and he may have seen something that would help us she swallowed hard yes of course im afraid i dont know of course not mrs ellison i already know that you passed along cater street in a carriage and in the company of your daughters and i have spoken to all of you but you have spoken to my husband also what more can there be to say could she avoid it persuade him not to see edward at all there could be nothing else to ask him unless he suspected something already knew somehow that edward had lied surely mr pitt you cannot doubt that if my husband had seen anything at all he would have told you if he knew it was important but perhaps he saw an odd thing a small detail that has slipped his memory and time is important you know the exact time to the minute may establish someones alibi or break it alibi an account of where a person was at the time of a crime making it impossible for him or her to have been involved i know what the word means mr pitt i just had not realizedyou wereonly eliminating people onon proof of imposs she trailed away afraid of her conclusion confused well when we have suspects mrs ellison it will help to whittle them down cast the impossible out of the picture she wished more than anything that he would leave he was a policeman which was almost like a tradesman it was idiotic to let him dominate her like this emily was right he did have a beautiful voice resonant and soft his diction was perfect quite she said awkwardly but im afraid my husband is not at home this morning and i cannot help you he smiled gently i shall come back this evening if mr ellison is expected home yes he is expected to dinner he gave a small bow and went to the door when edward came home at quarter past six she told him of pitts call and that he would return he stood still staring at her hes coming back this evening yes you shouldnt have told him i would be here caroline his face was stiff i have to go out again you said this morning she stopped fear suddenly cutting off her voice he was avoiding pitt because he was afraid of lying to him obviously i have made arrangements since this morning he snapped anyway it is quite pointless i know nothing whatsoever that i have not already told him you may say that to him or have maddock do so do you think she said hesitantly good heavens caroline he is a policeman not someone to be socially entertained have maddock tell him i had made previous arrangements and i know nothing that would further his investigations if he has found out nothing so far after all the enquiries he has made and the time he has taken either it is an insoluble mystery or the man is incompetent but pitt returned yet again the following evening and was shown into the withdrawing room where caroline and edward were sitting with charlotte and grandmama everyone else was out at a concert maddock opened the door to announce him and before anyone could reply pitt himself moved past him into the room in a gentlemans home mr pitt edward said tartly it is customary to wait until you are invited before entering caroline felt herself blush for his rudeness and go cold for his fear he must be afraid to depart so far from his usual good manners usual did she know him as well as she imagined why in gods name had he been in cater street pitt did not seem in the least put out he walked further in and maddock withdrew forgive me murder doesnt often take me into the homes of gentlemen but even they have a disinclination to speak to me which i have to overcome by the best means available i am sure you are as anxious as i am to identify and apprehend this man of course edward looked at him coldly however i have already told you everything i knowmore than once i have nothing to add i dont see how repetition will help you youd be surprised details get added small things remembered i have remembered nothing where were you that evening mr ellison edward frowned i have already told you i was at my club which is nowhere near cater street all evening mr ellison caroline looked at edward his face was pale she could almost see the struggle in his mind could he get away with the lie dear god what was he hiding she turned to pitt the clever eyes were not watching edward but her suddenly she was terrified he could see her fear that her knowledge of the lies was in her face she looked away anywhere else and found charlotte watching her also the room suffocated her terror almost stopped her breathing all evening mr ellison pitt repeated quietly er no edwards voice was tight the strain rasping where did you go then pitt was perfectly polite if he was at all surprised he hid it had he already known carolines heart tightened did he know where edward had been i went to visit a friend edward replied looking at him indeed pitt smiled which friend mr ellison edward hesitated grandmama sat a little more upright young man she said sharply remember your position both in this house and in society in general mr ellison has told you he visited a friend that is sufficient for your purpose we appreciate that you have a duty to perform and an arduous one necessary for justice and for public safety and of course we will assist you as we can but do not presume upon our goodwill to trespass beyond your duty pitt raised his eyebrows in humour more than annoyance maam unfortunately murder is no respecter of persons or of social distinction this man must be found or one of your granddaughters may be next nonsense grandmama said furiously my granddaughters are women of moral rectitude and decent habits i appreciate that you may not be familiar with such women and therefore i will excuse your insult as coming from ignorance rather than ill will pitt took a deep breath and let it out maam we have no reason to suppose this man has any exclusive hatred of immoral women or even any predilection for them miss abernathy was a little frivolous but no worse lily mitchell had a stainless reputation and we have yet to fault it even her behaviour with brody appears so far to have been perfectly correct grandmama looked at him with a slight flaring of her nostrils what is correct for a serving maid or a policeman may be quite beneath a gentlewoman she said damningly pitt bowed very slightly i beg to differ maam i believe morality is universal circumstances may alter the degree of blame but not that an act is wrong grandmama drew breath to condemn his temerity then considered his argument instead and let it out without speaking caroline looked at edward who was still silent then at charlotte she was watching pitt with surprise and some respect pitt looked back at edward mr ellison the name and address of your friend if you please i assure you it is necessary also as near as you know it the exact time of your departure from his house again there was a moments silence to caroline it was an eternity like waiting while you tear open a message which you know will be news of disaster im afraid i dont know what time i left edward replied at the time of course i had no idea it would be of the least importance possibly your friend will know pitt seemed unperturbed no edward said quickly my friendis ill that is why i called erhe was already drifting to sleep when i left that is why i departed when i did im afraid we can neither of us be of any very precise assistance im sorry but you did come home from the far end of cater street pitt was not easily discouraged ive already said so edward was also regaining his composure did you see anyone else at all not that i recall but i was thinking of getting home not of observing the street naturally but no doubt you would have noticed a man running or two people struggling or if you had heard a cry of alarm or any kind of scream of course i would if there was anything at all it must have been relatively inconspicuous a late traveller like myself or something of that sort actually i dont remember anyone at all and the address i beg your pardon the address from which you came i see no reason why that is relevant my friend is ill and in some distress i would prefer you did not call on them it would cause them considerable anxiety and only increase their illness i see pitt stood still all the same i would like to know it they just might remember the time what good would that do establish at least one time at which the crime did not happen by process of elimination we might pin it down very nicely without thinking caroline jumped in that can easily be known she demanded pitts attention he arrived here a few minutes after we did less than five minutes if you walk from here to cater street you will have the time precisely she waited with heart lurching to see if he accepted it pitt gave a small smile quite thank you he glanced at charlotte then inclined his head in a gesture of resignation i wish you good day he opened the door for himself and went out they heard maddock in the hall and then the front door close also well grandmama let out her breath what a vulgar young man persistent caroline said before thinking but not vulgar if he were to be put off by equivocation he would never solve his cases i have never considered you a competent judge of vulgarity caroline grandmama said with mounting anger but i am shocked that you can even entertain the possibility that edward would know anything about a crime you appear to doubt him of course i dont caroline lied her face flushing hotly i was speaking of the police not myself you cannot expect mr pitt to take the same view as i i do not but neither did i until now expect you to take the same view as mr pitt she wasnt grandmama charlotte interrupted she was merely pointing out that be silent charlotte edward said crossly i forbid anyone to discuss the matter further it is sordid and has no part in our life beyond the assistance we have already given if you cannot control yourself charlotte then you may retire to your room charlotte said nothing at all grandmama started off again to bemoan the general decline of good manners and the increase of immorality and crime caroline sat staring at a rather ugly photograph of her wedding and wondering with mounting fear why edward would not tell pitt where he had been nothing more was said that day but the following morning caroline was going through household accounts at her desk in the back sitting room when grandmama came in caroline i have to ask you what you mean by it although i fear i know i think i have a right caroline lied immediately in defence im afraid i dont know what youre talking about grandmama she had been thinking of little else herself but she pretended now to have her mind on the fishmongers bill in front of her then you are more callous even than i presumed i am talking about that policeman and his extraordinary behaviour last night in my day policemen knew their place a policemans place is wherever there is crime caroline said wearily she knew she was not going to be able to avoid the confrontation but she instinctively delayed it as one recoils from all pain there is no crime in his house caroline except your betrayal of your husbands good name that is a malicious and totally false thing to say caroline swung round from the desk the pen still in her hand but held like a knife now and you would not dare say it if we were not alone and if you did not imagine i would not wish to quarrel with you well you mistake me this time i most certainly shall quarrel if you say such a mischievous thing again do you hear me it is your conscience that makes you so angry grandmama said with evil delight and i certainly dare say it again and i shall in front of edward then well see who will quarrel and who will not youd love that wouldnt you caroline leaned forward youd like to upset edward and set his house on its head well for once im not yielding to your blackmail you tell edward anything you want to but i observe it was not you who defended him when he did not wish to tell the police where he was you did nothing but antagonize pitt by being insufferably rude what did you think that would do frighten him off then you are living in a dream it only made him the more suspicious suspicious of what grandmama was still standing her body rocking back and forth with rage what do you think edward has done caroline do you think he trailed out after his housemaid and strangled her is that what you think does edward know this is what you think of him not unless youve told him which would not surprise me it would certainly cause the kind of unhappiness you feed on isnt lilys death enough for you enough for me me what do you think i gain from the death of some wretched housemaid i have always hated immorality but it is not for me to bring down the judgment of god on her you old hypocrite caroline exploded there is nothing in the world more immoral than pleasure in the pain and misfortune of others you have brought your misfortune on yourself caroline i for one cannot get you out of it whether i wished to or not and with a lift of her head grandmama swept out of the room before caroline could reply although she could think of nothing to say anyway she sat at the desk and stared through tears at the fishmongers account she hated quarrels but this one had been brewing for years this had only been an eruption of hatreds that had simmered in both of them and but for lilys death and its terrors might have lain dormant forever now things had been said which would never be forgotten and certainly could not be forgivennot by grandmama even if she herself chose to the worst of it was that grandmama would draw in the whole house she would compel them all to take sides there would be meaningful glances silences cryptic remarks until curiosity drove someone to ask what it was all about edward would hate it he loved them both and wished above all things that there should be peace in his house like most men he loathed family rows he would pay a considerable price for tranquillity he would pretend to be unaware of it as long as possible dominic would probably be the catalyst quite unintentionally he had not known grandmama long enough to read the undercurrents and ignore them it would be awful and the worst part was that grandmama was right she did suspect with sick fear that edward had done something dishonourable she could feel her throat ache with the effort not to weep and if she looked down the tears would spill over mama it was charlotte she had not even heard her come in she sniffed yes what is it im busy with accounts charlotte slid her arms round her and kissed her i know i heard you it was welcome almost unbearable in its relief after she had been feeling so alone it was harder than ever to control herself but she had had years of practice oh im sorry i had not realized we had raised our voices charlotte adjusted a hairpin for her and stepped away tactfully leaving her to compose herself odd what sensitivity charlotte had sometimes while at other times she was so outspoken charlotte was staring through the window dont worry about grandmama if she says anything to papa he will be very angry with her and she will come off the worse for it caroline was too surprised to hide it she swung round in the chair to stare at charlottes back whyever do you think that charlotte still looked out of the window because papa was somewhere he does not wish to speak of we must face that therefore he will be angry with whoever mentions it again what on earth do you mean caroline could hear her own voice shaking now what are you saying charlotte you cannot suspect your fatherofof i dont know perhaps he was gambling or drunk or associating with people we would not like but he does not wish mr pitt or us to know of it it is no use pretending to each other we cannot pretend to ourselves but dont worry mama he cannot have had anything to do with lily if thats what youre afraid of charlotte she could think of nothing else to say how could she stand there so calmly speaking those words i think it may be very foolish charlotte went onand this time caroline heard the catch in her voice and knew she was only keeping control of herself with the greatest effort because i think mr pitt will find out anyway do you yes and it will seem the worse for not being revealed of ones own free will then if we could persuade him but she knew she lacked the courage edward would be angry go into that cold bitter retreat she had experienced only a few timeslike the occasion she had defied him over gerald hapwith that was years ago and all so silly now but the pain of the estrangement was easy to remember and more than that she was afraid to know what it was he wanted to hide perhaps pitt would not find out but he did mr pitt returned two days later in the evening andperhaps to be sure of catching edwardby surprise not having called in the morning to forewarn them they were all at home this is not very convenient mr pitt edward said coolly what is it this time we have established that you must have walked back along cater street from approximately five minutes to eleven until a few minutes past the hour you had no need to come to tell me that edward was sharp since i arrived home at about quarter after that much is obvious nothing seemed to discompose pitt to you sir who know what you did to us who have to accept your word it is satisfying to obtain proof if murderers could be caught merely by asking them our job would hardly be worth doing edwards face froze what are you implying mr pitt that we have established that you left mrs attwood at quarter to eleven it would take you about half an hour of comfortable walking to reach your home here and you would pass along cater street between five to eleven and about five past edward was whitefaced you had no right it would have been a great deal easier and have saved much time sir if you had given us mrs attwoods address earlier now perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me where you were on the night chloe abernathy met her death if you know where i was on the night lily was killed you know i can have had nothing to do with it edward said between his teeth for the first time he looked really frightened what do you imagine i can tell you about chloe abernathy only where you were pitt smiled broadly and if possible with whom i was with alan cuthbertson discussing business in his rooms pitts smile became wider if anything good that is what he says but since he was acquainted with miss abernathy fairly well it was necessary to check that he was being precisely honest thank you mr ellison you have done mr cuthbertson and the police a service im obliged maam he inclined his head in a small bow good night who is mrs attwood papa sarah said immediately i dont recall your having mentioned her i doubt i did edward said looking away she is a rather tiresome woman who is a dependent of a man who once did me a favour and is now dead himself she has become ill and i occasionally render her some small practical assistance she is not bedridden but close to it she seldom leaves the house you might visit her yourself if you wish but i warn you she is most tiresome and wandering somewhat in her mind she confuses reminiscences with fantasy on occasion although at other times she is lucid enough no doubt it comes from spending a great deal of time alone and reading romantic novels of the cheapest kind the relief was immense but later that night in bed caroline woke and began to think at first she worried about the fact that edward had been so concerned about hiding his visit to this mrs attwood was it really to protect a sick woman or because she was perhaps a little common a little loud someone he did not wish to be associated with then the deeper worry came to the surface and would not be ignored she had questioned in her mind had feared for a moment that he had had something to do with lily he was lying beside her now asleep she had been married to him for more than thirty years how could it even have crossed her mind that he had murdered a girl in the street what kind of a woman was she to have considered such a thing even for a second she had always believed she loved him not passionately of course but adequately she knew him wellor she had believed so until this week now she realized there were things about him she did not know at all she had lived in the same house with him the same bed for over thirty years and borne him three children four counting the son who had died when only a few days old and yet she had actually considered he might have garotted lily what was her relationship worth what would edward think or feel if he knew what had been in her mind she was confused and ashamed and deeply afraid chapter seven it was the following week the beginning of september and hot and still when millie came to charlotte in the garden her face was pink and she looked flustered she had a piece of paper in her hand charlotte put down the hoe she was using to poke around the soil between the flowers it was a pastime rather than a job an excuse to be outside instead of attending to the preserves she should have been stewing for sarah to bottle but sarah was out with dominic on some social affair while emily was at a tennis party with a whole group of people including george ashworth and mama was visiting susannah what is it millie please miss charlotte i found this letter this morning ive been trying to decide all day what i should do about it she held out the piece of paper charlotte took it from her and read deer lily this is to tel yu that i ant warnin yu any mor ither yu dus as yur told or itll be the wors for yu it was unsigned where did you get this charlotte asked i found it in one of the drawers in my room miss where lily used to be i see did i do the right thing miss yes millie you did most certainly it would have been very wrong not to have brought it to me itit might be important you think the murderer wrote her that miss i dont know millie probably not but we should let the police have it yes maam but mr maddock is busy unpacking the next cases of wine this afternoon and the master said it had to be done straight away thats all right millie ill take it myself but miss charlotte you arent going out by yourself are you charlotte stared at her for a moment no millie youll have to come with me me miss charlotte she froze her eyes wide yes you millie go and get your coat on tell mrs dunphy i need you to come with me on an urgent errand now go on three quarters of an hour later millie was in the outer waiting room of the police station and charlotte was shown into inspector pitts small room to await his return it was drab functional and a little dusty there were three chairs one of them on a swivel a table with locked drawers in it a rolltop desk also locked and a brown linoleum floor worn patchy where feet had trodden from door to desk and back again she had been there for only ten minutes when the door opened and a sharpnosed little man in overly smart clothes came in his face dropped in surprise allo miss you sure youre in the right place i believe so im waiting for mr pitt he looked her up and down carefully you dont look like a nose i beg your pardon you dont look like a nose he came in and closed the door behind him an informer a spy for the crushers for whom she frowned trying to understand him the police you did say you wanted to see mr pitt yes he grinned suddenly showing broken teeth you a friend of his i have come on a matter of business which forgive me for frankness is not your concern she had no wish to be rude he was a harmless enough little man and apparently friendly business you dont look like you have business with the crushers he sat down on the chair opposite still looking at her in amiable curiosity do you belong here she said doubtfully oh yes he grinned i got business too indeed important he nodded his eyes bright do a lot for mr pitt i do dont know how hed manage without me i dare say hed survive somehow charlotte said with a smile he was unoffended ah miss thats cos you dont know anything about it begging your pardon about what about the workings miss the way things is done ill wager you dont even know how to break a drum or to christen the stuff and fence it afterwards charlotte was completely lost but in spite of herself interested no she admitted i dont even know what youre talking about ah he settled himself more comfortably but you see i knows everything born to it born in the rookeries i was grew up there mother died when i was about three so they say and i was very small lucky that lucky you mean someone took pity on you he gave her a look of friendly contempt i mean they saw my possibilitiesthat if i stayed little i could be of use memories of things that pitt had told her about small boys up chimneys came back and she shivered had you no family what about your father or grandparents me father was crapped in fortytwo year i was born and me grandfather got the boat so they said me ma had a brother who was a fine wirer but he didnt want nothing to do with kids did he not one that was too young to be any use besides fine wiring aint an art as needs kids what is crapped she asked he drew a hand across his throat then held it up behind him to imitate a rope she blushed with embarrassment oh im sorryi dont matter he dismissed it werent no good to me anyway and your grandfather went to sea didnt he return bless you miss you really is from another world aint you not went to sea miss but got sent to australia oh she could think of nothing else to say to that and your uncle fine wiring is the picking of ladies pockets miss very delicate art that is dont use kids like some does no use for me see so they gave me to a kidsman who taught me a bit o oly fakinthats pickin silk handkerchiefs out o pockets to you miss to earn me keep so to speak then when i got older but not much bigger he sole me to a firstclass cracksman climb through any set o bars i could ease myself through them like a snake manys the toffken i bin in and out of and opened the door for em whats a toffken she felt her father would be furious if he knew of this extraordinary conversation but it was a world which appalled her too much to turn her back on it she was fascinated as a child is by a scab that he must keep picking at a swell house like maybe you lives in he seemed to bear her no resentment but rather to find her the more interesting for it i dont think we have a great deal worth taking she said honestly what happened to you then well come the time i got too big of course but before that he got caught and i never seen him again but hed taught me a lot o things like how to use all is tools how to do a spot of star glazing star gazing she said incredulously he burst out with rich dry laughter bless you you are a caution star glazing look he got off his seat and went to the window say you wanted to get through that piece of glass well you lean up against it he demonstrated put your knife here near the edge and press hard but gentle till the glass cracks not so hard it falls out mind then you put brown paper plaster over it so it all sticks and prestoyou can pull the glass out without a whole lot o noise put your hand in and undo the latch he looked back at her in obvious triumph i see didnt you ever get caught of course i did but you expects that dont you occasional like you didnt consider takingaaregular job she did not want to say an honest job for some incomprehensible reason she did not want to hurt his feelings id got a readymade team adnt i got me tools a good crow the andsomest canary in london and a good fence as lived in a flash house nice and comfortable for us and a few dollyshops if we hit hard times what else did i need what did i want to go and break me back for in some factory or sweatshop for a few pence a day what are the birds for birds his face puckered up what birds the crow and the canary he chuckled in genuine delight oh i do like talking to you miss youre a refreshment you are a crow is either a quack a medical man or in this case a feller what stands around and gives the warning if anyone comes along as is dangerous like a jack or the crushers or whatever and a canary is the one who brings your tools for you if youve got any class you dont bring your own tools you goes to the place takes a good look around and then your canary brings them when alls clear shes usually a woman works better that way and bessie was as andsome as a summer day she was what happened to her died of cholera she did in sixty the year before the american war poor bessie how old was she eighteen same as me younger than emily younger than lily mitchell she had lived in the slums been a carrier of burglars tools and died of disease at age eighteen it was an existence which mocked charlottes tidy life with its small difficulties the only big thing that had ever happened to her was her love of dominic and lilys death everything else was comfortable have we mended all the linen shall we preserve peaches or apricots is the fishmongers bill too high what shall i wear to the party on friday do i really have to be civil to the vicar and all the while there were people like this funny little man here fighting just to eat and some of them lost the smallest and the weakest the most easily frightened im sorry was all she could say he looked at her closely youre a funny creature he said at last before she could react to that the doors swung open and pitt came in his face dropped in surprise when he saw her apparently whoever was outside had failed to forewarn him miss ellison what are you doing here shes waiting for you the little man shot to his feet with excitement shes been here sittin this past half hour he pulled an exceedingly elegant gold watch out of his pocket pitt stared at it where did you get that willie you got a nasty mind mr pitt ive got a nasty temper too where did you get it willie i bought it mr pitt his outrage carried no anger only ringing innocence from whom one of your dollyshops mr pitt thats real gold that is its quality pawnshop then thats not nice mr pitt i bought it respectable all right willie go out and convince the sergeant while i talk to miss ellison willie lifted his hat and bowed elaborately out willie yes sir mr pitt good afternoon maam pitt closed the door behind him and indicated a chair for charlotte now that he was alone with her he seemed less assured conscious of the shabby surroundings charlotte found herself wishing to put him at ease she pulled out the letter straight away our new maid millie handed this to me a little over an hour ago she found it this morning in her room i should explain that the room used to be lilys he took the letter and unfolded it he read it and then held it up to the light it doesnt look old and hardly the type of letter one would wish to keep i think we may presume she received it shortly before she was killed its a threat she moved a little closer to look at it herself it would be difficult to read it as anything else although of course it may not be a threat of death by any means a world of fear opened up to charlottes imagination poor lily who had threatened her and why had she not felt she could turn to any of them to help her what isolated struggle had been going on in their house under the smooth exterior of housemaids black and white what do you suppose they wanted her to do she asked whoever wrote that letter do you think you can find them and punish them they may not have killed her i dont care they frightened her they tried to force her to do something she obviously did not want to isnt that a crime he was looking at her with surprise taking in her anger her sense of outrage and pity and perhaps guilt because it had all happened in her house and she had not seen it yes it is a crime if we could prove it but we dont know who wrote it or what he wanted her to do and the poor little creature isnt alive to complain now arent you going to find out she demanded he put out a hand as if to touch her then remembered himself and withdrew it well try but i doubt that the person who wrote this killed her she was garotted exactly the same way with a wire from behind as chloe abernathy and the hiltons maid a cracksman might have threatened two maids but he would never have tried it with a girl like chloe his eyes opened wider with a new thought unless of course he mistook her for lily they were of a similar height and colouring i suppose in the dark what would he threaten them for two maids i mean what oh burglars often use housemaids to let them in and tell them where all the valuables are in the house perhaps if she refused he sighed but it seems a rather extreme way of going about business and largely unnecessary a burglar could find enough indoor servants who are willing or loosetongued not to need to resort to this kind of thing why didnt she come to us probably because it wasnt a burglar at all but some kind of romantic involvement he replied something she preferred that you not be aware of that she thought you wouldnt approve of i expect we shall never know but you will try yes well try and you did the right thing to bring it thank you she found herself uncomfortable under his gaze and she was conscious of the shabby room again what had made him become a policeman she realized how little she knew about him as so often happened her thoughts spilled into words have you always been a policeman mr pitt she asked he was surprised but there was a flicker of amusement in his eyes which at any other time she might have found irritating yes since i was seventeen why why did you want to be a policeman you must see so much she could not find the exact words for all the misery and squalor she imagined i grew up in the country my parents were in service my mother was cook and my father gamekeeper he gave a wry little smile conscious of their difference in station they were with a gentleman of considerable means he had children of his own a son about my age i was allowed to sit in the schoolroom and we used to play together i knew rather more about the country than he did i had friends among the poachers and gypsies very exciting for a small boy son of the manor house with too many sisters and too much time spent with lessons pheasants were stolen from the estate and sold my father was blamed he was charged at the assizes and found guilty he was sent to australia for ten years in my own mind i was convinced he didnt do itnaturally i suppose i spent a long time trying to prove it i never succeeded but that was when it started she imagined the child caring desperately burning with confusion and injustice she felt a tenderness for him which appalled her she stood up quickly and swallowed i see and you came to london how interesting thank you for telling me now i must return home or they will be anxious for me you shouldnt have come alone he frowned ill send a sergeant back with you thats not necessary i thought you might want to speak to millie and so i brought her with me no i see no reason to speak with her now but im glad you were wise enough to have her come with you he smiled with a tiny downward gesture and i apologize for doubting your good sense good day mr pitt she went out of the door good day miss ellison she knew he was standing in the doorway watching her and she was idiotically selfconscious she all but fell over the step on the way out having to catch millies arm to steady herself why on earth should a very plain policeman make her feel soso conspicuous three days later charlotte was visiting the abernathys she was there alone only because sarah and mama were but a hundred yards away round the corner at the vicars do have some more tea miss ellison it is so kind of you to visit us thank you charlotte pushed her cup forward a little its a pleasure to see you looking so much better mrs abernathy smiled gently having young people in the house again helps after chloe died no one came for such a long time at least it seemed so i suppose one cannot blame them no one least of all the young wishes to visit a house in mourning it is too much of a reminder of death when one wishes to think of life charlotte wanted to comfort her to prevent her feeling that chloes friends were callous thinking more of their own pleasure than her grief she leaned forward a little perhaps they did not wish to intrude when one is deeply shocked one doesnt know what to say nothing can make it better and one is afraid to be clumsy and make it worse by saying something stupid you are very gentle my dear charlotte i wish poor chloe could have sought more friends like you and not some of the foolish ones she did it all began with that wretched george ashworth what charlotte so far forgot herself as to abandon all courtesy mrs abernathy looked at her with slight surprise i wish chloe had not been quite so friendly with lord ashworth i know he is a gentleman but sometimes the real quality have some strange tastes and habits we wouldnt approve of i didnt know chloe knew lord ashworth charlotte was troubled now emilys determined little face kept coming into her mind did she know him well a great deal better than her father and i would have wished but he was charming and titled you cant tell young girls she blinked several times charlotte would have liked to leave the subjectshe knew it could only cause pain where the wound was already deepbut for emilys sake she had to know do you think he treated chloe badly that he was less than frank with her affections mr abernathy gets very angry with me for saying this her face pinched but i believe that if chloe had not known that man she would be alive today charlotte felt as if she were entering a dark corridor as if its shadows were closing in on her why do you say that mrs abernathy mrs abernathy leaned forward clutching at charlottes arm oh please dont repeat it charlotte mr abernathy says i could end up in the most terrible trouble if i say too much charlotte closed her other hand over mrs abernathys gripping her firmly of course i wont but i would like to know why you consider george ashworth such a bad influence i have met him and although i didnt care for him i would not have judged him as ill as you seem to he flattered chloe into believing all sorts of things that could not come true that were not true of her station in life he took her to places where there were women of low morals how do you know did chloe say so she told us a little but i heard it from others who saw them there a gentleman friend of mr abernathys told him he had seen chloe where he did not expect to see any daughter of a respectable family and this friend is truthful not given to misunderstanding or exaggeration and has no cause for spite no wish to damage chloes reputation oh none at all the most upright of men good gracious then forgive me but what was he doing in such a place as you describe mrs abernathy looked confused for a moment my dear charlotte it is quite different for men it is perfectlyacceptable for a gentleman to frequent places that a woman of good moral character would not go to we all have to accept these things charlotte was loath to accept any such thing at all but there was no proper way of arguing it now i see and you feel lord ashworth may have led chloe into unfortunate company and even tempted her to practices not acceptable to her or to anyone of decent upbringing yes i do chloe was not really part of his world and i think she died because he tried to make her part of it let me not misunderstand you mrs abernathy are you saying that you think either lord ashworth or someone in his circle killed chloe yes charlotte i believe it but you have promised not to say that i said so nothing can bring chloe back and we cannot be revenged against such people one can prevent them from doing it again charlotte said angrily and in fact one has a duty oh but charlotte please i do not know anything it is just my foolish feeling perhaps i am quite wrong and i should be doing a great injustice she was on her feet now anxious flapping her hands you gave me your promise mrs abernathy my own sister emily is currently in acquaintance with lord ashworth if what you say is true how can i take no interest in your feelings whether they are accurate or not i promise you i will say nothing unless i feel emily to be in danger then i cannot keep silent oh my dear mrs abernathy sat down sharply oh my dear charlotte what can we do i dont know charlotte said frankly have you told me everything you know that you either know for sure or have reason to suspect i know that he drinks too much but then gentlemen often do i know that he gambles but i imagine he can afford to i know that poor chloe was enamoured of him that he swept her off her feet and she saw in him all sorts of romantic dreams i know he took her with him into his social world where standards are quite different from ours and where they do all kinds of terrible things for amusement and i believe if she had stayed among her own kind gentlemen of moderate means and respectable family she would not now be dead the tears were running down her face as she stopped at last forgive me she reached for her handkerchief and began to cry quietly charlotte put her arms round her and held her tightly she felt a terrible pity for her because there was nothing she could do and guilt because she had raked it all up again and made her talk of it charlotte held on to her rocking a little as if mrs abernathy were a child not a woman her mothers age on the way home she could think of nothing to say to her mother or to sarah but they were too busy with their own concerns to notice all evening she sat almost silent replying only when necessary and then somewhat at random dominic made one or two comments on her absentmindedness but even for him she could not abandon her anxiety if mrs abernathy were right then george ashworth was not merely reprobate but positively dangerous and might even be implicated in murder it seemed stretching reason too far to suppose the existence of more than one murderer in cater street therefore he must have also killed lily and the hiltons maid if indeed he were actually involved perhaps several of his friends in drunken madness had waylaid the thought was appalling but the worst consideration was emily might not emily however much she wished not to somehow become aware of his guilt and if she did and betrayed her knowledge in his presence perhaps she too would be found dead in the street but charlotte had no proof perhaps it was all in the imagination of mrs abernathy distorted by grief desperately needing someone to blame preferring any answer to the unknown and if charlotte told emily her suspicions without proof emily would surely disbelieve them and with some heat she might even in defiance tell george ashworth just to prove her trust in him and thus provoke her own death what was the right thing to do she looked round their faces as they all sat in the withdrawing room after dinner whose advice could she ask papa was looking at the newspaper his face grim he was very probably reading about the stock market he would be illdisposed to interruptions at the moment and he had appeared to approve of ashworth mama was embroidering she looked pale grandmama had not yet forgiven her for her fears over papa and his visit to mrswhatever her name was grandmama had been dropping small barbed remarks for days and there was no use asking grandmama anyway she would immediately either tell everyone directly or else drive them mad with innuendos until someone dragged it from her emily was playing the piano next to her sarah was playing bezique with dominic could she ask sarah part of her longed to ask dominic to have something to share with him to ask his advice and yet within her there was also a growing resistance a fear that dominic would not meet the standard of wisdom she needed that he would give her an answer that was not decisive did not commit him she had no deep confidence in sarah either but there was no one else she found an opportunity to approach her on the landing before retiring sarah sarah stopped in surprise i thought you had gone to bed i want to speak to you it cannot wait until morning no please come into my bedroom when the door was closed charlotte stood against it and sarah sat on the bed i went to see mrs abernathy today i know did you know that george ashworth was closely acquainted with chloe just before she was killed sarah frowned no i didnt im sure emily doesnt know either so am i and mrs abernathy believes that he took chloe to places very unsuitable for a decent woman and that it was through him that she may well have met whoever killed her at least that the association was in part responsible are you quite sure of what youre saying charlotte i know you dont care for lord ashworth are you not perhaps letting your prejudices run away with you i dont believe so what should i say to emily nothing she wouldnt believe you anyway but i must warn her of what all you can tell her is that ashworth admired chloe before he met her that will help no one and why shouldnt he chloe was very pretty poor little thing i dont doubt he has admired a great many girls and will admire a great many more but what about emily charlotte demanded what if he really did have something to do with chloes death emily could find out she could even be next dont be hysterical charlotte sarah said sharply mrs abernathy is very oldfashioned and very narrow in her background i daresay what appears very daring and immoral to her would be no more than ordinary high spirits to us i have heard her express disapproval of the waltz how stuffy is it possible to be even the queen waltzes or she used to before she became old mrs abernathy was talking about murder not waltzing to us they are opposite ends of the pole but to her they are not so far apart in her mind a person capable of one may very well contemplate the other i didnt know you had such a sense of humour charlotte said bitterly but this is not the time to show it what should i say to emily i cannot merely do nothing at least you havent told your dreadful policeman yet of course i havent and that observation is hardly helpful sorry perhaps we had better have emily in here and tell heri dont know precisely what i suppose the truth as she spoke she stood up and came to the door charlotte agreed it was the best idea and she was grateful for sarahs support she stood aside for sarah to leave a few moments later they were all in charlottes bedroom the door closed well emily asked charlotte heard something today which we think you ought to know sarah replied its in your own interest when people say that it always means something unpleasant emily looked at charlotte all right what is it charlotte took a deep breath she knew emily was going to be angry george ashworth was very wellacquainted with chloe just before she was murdered he took her to a great many places emilys eyebrows rose did you imagine i did not know that charlotte was surprised yes i did but perhaps you do not know what kinds of places apparently they were places where moral women do not go you mean whorehouses emily please sarah said sharply i appreciate you are angry but there is no need to be coarse no i do not meanwhorehouses charlotte said sharply at least i dont think i do but this is not a matter to be taken lightly remember that chloe is dead and remember how she died mrs abernathy believes that it was her association with george ashworth that led to her death either directly or indirectly emilys face was white you have not left me unaware that you dislike george even perhaps that you are jealous but this is spiteful and quite beneath you goodness knows i am sorry enough for chloes death but it had nothing to do with george how do you know because it is only your prudish spite that imagines it might have i know george and you do not why on earth should he do such a thing i dont know but i am not telling you for spite and it is very wrong of you to say so i am telling you because i could not bear it if the same thing were to happen to you if through george ashworth you met someone who emily let out a sigh of impatience if chloe mixed in bad company then it was because she had not the wit to recognize it i hope you do not put me in the same category i really dont know emily charlotte said honestly sometimes i wonder emily was defensive again so what are you going to do tell papa what for he could forbid you to see george ashworth but you would still do whatever you wishedonly secretly which would be even worse justjust be careful emilys face softened of course i shall be careful i suppose you mean well but really sometimes you areso pompous and such a prude i despair of you well im too tired to stand here any longer good night charlotte stared at sarah when emily had gone you cant do any more sarah said quietly and honestly i dont think ashworth had anything to do with it its just mrs abernathys imagination dont worry about it good night good night sarah and thank you chapter eight on the second of october autumn rain cooling the streets maddock knocked on the withdrawing room door after dinner and came in immediately his trousers were splattered with rain and his face was gray edward looked up opened his mouth to question his behaviour and then saw him he stood up sharply maddock whats the matter man are you ill maddock stiffened and swayed a little on his feet no sir if i might speak to you outside sir what is it maddock edward obviously was afraid now too the room was silent charlotte stared at them cold knotting up inside her if i might speak to you in confidence sir maddock asked again edward caroline said very quietly if something has happened we shall have to know maddock had as well tell us all as leave us in suspense maddock looked to edward very well edward nodded what is it maddock there has been another murder sir in an alley off cater street oh my god edward went sheetwhite and sat down hard on the chair behind him there was a low moan from sarah who was it caroline said so quietly she could barely be heard verity lessing maam the sextons daughter maddock answered her a constable has just come from the police to tell us and warn us all to stay in the house and not to let the maids out even into the areaway no of course not edward looked stunned staring into the room blindly was it the same yes sir with a garotting wire like the others oh my god perhaps i had better go and check all the doors again sir and close the shutters on the windows it would reassure the women yes edward agreed absently yes do that please maddock caroline called as he turned to leave yes maam before you do please bring us a bottle of brandy and some glasses i think we could do with a littlehelp yes maam certainly a moment after he had brought them in and left there was another clatter outside as dominic came in shaking the rain off his jacket should have taken a coat he said looking at his wet hands didnt expect the change his eyes moved from their faces to the brandy and back again whats the matter you look awful come to think of it there were people all over the street mama he frowned peering at her grandmamas not ill is she no edward answered for caroline theres been another murder youd better sit down and have some brandy too dominic stared at him his face blanching oh god he drew in his breath and let it out who verity lessing dominic sat down the sextons daughter yes edward poured him some brandy and passed the glass whats happening dominic said bewilderedly was this in cater street too in an alley just off it edward replied i suppose we must face it whoever this madman is he is someone who lives here near cater street or else he has business here some reason to come here regularly no one answered him charlotte watched his face all she could think of was her overwhelming relief that he had been home all evening that this time when pitt cameas she did not doubt he wouldthere would be no questions for papa im sorry edward went on we can no longer pretend it is some creature from the criminal slums invading us by mischance papa emily said tremulously you dont imagine it could becould actually be someone we know do you of course not sarah said sharply it must be someone quite deranged that doesnt mean it isnt someone we know charlotte painfully gave expression to the thoughts that had been forming in her mind after all someone must know him i dont know what you mean sarah frowned at her i dont know anyone deranged how do you know that you dont of course i dont dominic turned to her what are you trying to say charlotte that we wouldnt know if someone were as mad as this well would you charlotte looked back at him if it were so easy to see wouldnt those who do know him have said something done something by now after all someone must know himtradesmen servants neighbourseven if he doesnt have a family oh but how awful emily stared at her imagine being servant to someone or neighbour and knowing they weremad like that that they killed women thats what im trying to say charlotte turned from one to another of them urgently i dont think you would know or he would have been captured long ago the police have talked to all sorts of people if someone knew it would have come out by now well there are several people i can think of who are not all they seem to be on the surface grandmama spoke for the first time ive always said you cant tell what wickedness lies underneath the smooth face people show to the world some that appear saints are devils underneath and some that appear devils are still devils no matter how far underneath you look charlotte said instinctively is that remark supposed to mean anything grandmama asked very tartly its time young woman that you learned to control your tongue in my young day a girl your age knew how to behave herself in your day you were not faced with four murders in the streets where you lived caroline came to charlottes defence and obliquely her own or so you frequently inform us perhaps that is why grandmama returned why what sarah asked we all know that charlottes tongue runs away with her but are you suggesting that it is responsible for verity lessings murder off cater street this evening you are impertinent sarah grandmama snapped and it is quite unlike you i think you are being unfair grandmama dominic smiled at her he could usually charm herhe knew it and used it we are rather badly shocked both by the loss of someone we know and the thought that the murderer may also be someone we know or at least have seen yes mama edward stood up perhaps you should retire caroline will see that you are brought something to drink before you sleep grandmama stared at him belligerently i do not wish to go to bed i will not be dismissed i think it is better edward said firmly grandmama sat where she was but she had met her match and a few minutes later she allowed him to help her up and with considerable ill grace went to bed thank god caroline said wearily it really is too much nevertheless dominic scowled we cannot avoid the truth that as charlotte said it could be anyoneeven someone we speak to someone we have always felt perfectly at ease with stop it dominic sarah sat upright you will have us suspecting our neighbours even our friends we will become unable to conduct a proper conversation with anyone without wondering in our hearts if they could be the one perhaps it would be as well emily said thoughtfully until he is found emily how can you say such a thing even in jest and it is a bad enough time for humour of any sort emily is not being humorous dominic put in for her she is being eminently practical as always and to an extent she is right perhaps if verity lessing had been more suspicious she would now be alive a new thought occurred to charlotte do you think so dominic do you think that is why no one has heard screamsbecause whoever did it was known to each victim and they were not afraid until it was too late dominic paled obviously he had not thought of it his mind had been following his words not leading them his imagination was still far behind charlotte was surprised she thought he had seen the conclusion before her it would explain it she said unhappily so would being taken by surprise from behind sarah pointed out i think this conversation is unprofitable edward interrupted we cannot protect ourselves by indulging in speculation about all our acquaintances and we may do them grave injustice we will only end by frightening ourselves even more than is already unavoidable that is easy to say caroline looked at her brandy glass but it will be very hard to do from now on i believe i shall find myself thinking about people in a different way wondering how much i really know about them and if they are thinking the same of me or at least of my family sarah stared at her eyebrows arched you mean they might suspect papa why not or dominic they do not know them as we do charlotte remembered when it had crossed her mind hers and mamas for a black shaming hour and they themselves had considered the possibility of papas involvement she did not look at her mother if she could forget it so much the better what i am afraid of she said honestly is that one day i might meet someone and my suspicions show as they might concerning anyonebut that this time they would be justified and when he recognized my suspicions i would see in his face they were right then we would look at each other and he would know that i knew and he would have to kill me quickly before i spoke or cried out charlotte edward stood up and banged his fist on the piecrust table knocking it over stop it you are very foolishly frightening everyone and quite unnecessarily none of you is going to be alone with this man or any other we dont know who he is charlotte was not put off he could be someone we had considered a friend as safe as one of us it could be the vicar or the butchers boy or mr abernathy dont be ridiculous it will be someone with whom we have the barest acquaintance if indeed any at all we may not be excellent judges of character but at least we are not capable of so gross a mistake as that arent we charlotte was looking at a blank space on the wall ive been wondering how much of a person is on the surface how much we really know about anyone at all we dont really know very much about each other never mind those with whom we have only an acquaintanceship dominic was still staring at her surprise in his face i thought we knew each other very well did you she looked back at him meeting the dark bright eyes for once seeking only meaning without her heart leaping do you still perhaps not he looked away and walked to the brandy decanter to pour himself some more anyone else wish for another glass edward stood up i think we had better all have an early night after sleep we may have composed ourselves and be able to face the problems a little morepractically i shall think about it and let you know in the morning what i have decided is best for us to do until this creature is caught the following day there were the usual grim offices to perform a police constable called in the early morning to inform them officially of the murder and to ask them if they had any information charlotte wondered if pitt would come and was curiously both relieved and disappointed when he did not lunch was a more or less silent affair of cold meat and vegetables in the afternoon all four of them went to pay their respects to the lessings and offered to give any assistance they couldalthough of course there was nothing that would do anything to dissipate the shock or ease the pain nevertheless it was a visit which must be paid a courtesy that would cause hurt if not observed they all wore dark colours mama wore black itself charlotte regarded herself in the mirror with distaste before leaving she had a dark green dress with black trim and a black hat it was not flattering especially in the autumn sun they walked since it was only a short distance the lessing house had all the blinds drawn and there was a constable outside in the street he looked solid and unhappy it crossed charlottes mind that perhaps he was used to death even to violence but not to the grief of those who had loved the dead it was embarrassing to be obliged to watch grief one cannot help she wondered if pitt felt it the helplessness or if he were too busy trying to fit the pieces together who was where loves hates reasons she suddenly realized how deeply she would dislike the task how the responsibility would frighten her all the neighbourhood looked to him to rescue them from their alarms to find this creature to prove it was not someone they loved each of them with his separate loves secret suspicions and desperate unspoken fears did they look for miracles from him he could not alter truth perhaps he could not even find it they were met at the door by the maid redeyed and nervous mrs lessing was in the front parlour darkened in respect for the dead gas lamps hissing on the wall mrs lessing was dressed in black her face bleached pale her hair a little untidy as if she had not taken it down last night but merely pulled it back with a comb this morning and rearranged a few pins caroline went straight over to her and put her arms round her kissing her on the cheek verity had been an only child my dear im so sorry she said softly can we help with anything would you like one of us to stay with you for a little while to help with things mrs lessing struggled to speak her eyes widening with surprise then hope then she burst into tears and hid her face on carolines shoulder caroline put both her arms round her tighter and held her touching her hair arranging the stray wisps gently as if it mattered charlotte felt a painful welling up of pity she remembered the last time she had seen verity she had been brusque with her and had meant to apologize for it now there would be no chance id like to stay mrs lessing she said clearly i was very fond of verity please let me help there will be a lot to do you shouldnt do it alone and i know mr lessing still hasdutiesthat cannot be left it was several minutes before mrs lessing gained control of herself she turned to charlotte still struggling to master her tears but unashamed of her grief thank you charlotte pleaseplease do there was little for the rest of them to say charlotte remained behind not wishing to leave mrs lessing alone and it was arranged that maddock would bring a box of clothes and toiletries for her within the next hour or two it was a very hard day since mr lessing was sexton to the church he had duties to perform which kept him from home the great part of it and so charlotte stayed with mrs lessing to receive other callers who came to express their condolences there was little to say only a repetition of the same words of shock and sympathy the same expressions of how well they had liked verity and the same fears of what horror might come next naturally the vicar called it was something charlotte had dreaded but knew was inevitable apparently he had been the previous evening when the news was first heard but he came again in the late afternoon bringing martha with him the maid let them in and charlotte received them in the parlour mrs lessing had at last agreed to rest on her bed and had fallen into a light sleep ah miss ellison the vicar looked at her with some surprise are you also calling upon poor mrs lessing how good of you well you may safely leave now we will guide and comfort her in this terrible hour the lord giveth and the lord taketh away no i am not calling upon mrs lessing charlotte replied a little sharply i am staying here to help her as i can there is a great deal to be done i am sure we can do that the vicar was clearly annoyed possibly by her tone i am somewhat more used to these types of arrangements than you are at your tender years it is my calling in life to comfort the afflicted and to mourn with those who mourn i doubt you have time to govern a house vicar charlotte stood her ground as you say you will be busy with funeral arrangements and since it is your calling to comfort the afflicted you will have other claims upon your time i dare say poor mrs abernathy is still in need out of the corner of her eye she saw marthas white face pale even more till her eyes seemed like depressions in her skull and the fair hair of her eyebrows appeared quite dark in contrast the poor woman looked ready to faint in spite of her broad shoulders and solid body please sit down charlotte half pushed a chair towards her you must be terribly tired have you been up all night martha nodded and sank into the chair its very good of you she said a little shakily so many practical details to see to so much cooking letters to write black to be prepared and the house still has to be organized maids given instructions is mrs lessing asleep yes and i am most loath to wake her unless it is something of real urgency charlotte said firmly meaning it for the vicar although she was still looking at martha the vicar grunted i had hoped to be of some spiritual assistance to the poor woman but if you say she is asleep i suppose i shall have to call another time quite charlotte agreed she did not wish to offer them refreshment but marthas haggard face inspired her pity may i offer you a dish of tea it would be no trouble martha opened her mouth as if to accept then doubt mixed with anxiety crossed her face again she hesitated but at last she stood up and definitely declined after they had gone charlotte went to the kitchen to see that a light meal was being prepared for supper and that the following days catering was in hand she was called from those duties by the parlour maid to announce that the police had arrived she had been expecting their call had it in her mind from the beginning and yet now she was taken by surprise it was pitt of course she found herself oddly embarrassed that he should find her here selfconscious of her wish to help good evening miss ellison he said without showing more than a lifted eyebrow of surprise is mrs lessing well enough to speak to me i am aware that mr lessing is still at the church i imagine that she will have to speak to you charlotte said quietly she meant the softness of her tone to rob it of rudeness perhaps it would be easier to have it done as soon as may be there is no purpose in avoiding it if you care to wait i shall go and awaken her if i take a little while please excuse me of course he hesitated charlotte she turned he was frowning if she is ill distressed there is nothing i need to ask that cannot wait until tomorrow its just that i doubt it will be any easier then it might even give her a better night to have it past she found herself smiling i think it would may i stay if she wishes i would prefer that you did it took her several minutes to rouse mrs lessing and assure her that her appearance was acceptable and would not disgrace her in front of such a lesser creature as a policeman and then that he was courteous that she had nothing to fear since she had no guilt and would rest more easily from having the ordeal accomplished she did not have the heart to tell her it would very likely be merely the first of many calls one grief one fear was enough for today pitt was very gentle with her but the questions were unavoidable who were veritys friends with whom had she only recently become acquainted who were her male admirers had she expressed any fears how well had she known chloe abernathy had she visited the hiltons or the ellisons so that she might have any knowledge of their servants or they of her had they any information or observations in common mrs lessing knew nothing that was of help she answered with the bewildered meaninglessness of someone still suffering from shock it was as if she did not understand the purpose of his questions finally he gave up and rose to leave he watched mrs lessing as she walked slowly into the hallway and closed the door behind her are you remaining charlotte it did not even cross her mind to condemn his impertinence then for the use of her given name yes there is a great deal to be done and mr lessing still has to continue his duties he is not a very practical man not used to running an orderly house it might be as well to let her do certain things herself work cannot heal but it can alleviate idleness gives one time to think yes i i will i will find household jobs for her to do that do not require thought but i shall do the planning myself the preparations for the funeral telling people and so on he smiled i see a great deal of tragedy in my job and of ugliness but i see a great deal of kindness as well good evening he turned at the door oh dont forget do not go out alone under any circumstances even if you should require a doctor send someone send mr lessing or call for assistance next door they will understand mr pitt yes do you know anything further yet i mean what manner of man from whatwhat walk of life she was thinking of george and emily do you know something you have not told me he was looking at her again in that way that seemed to probe inside her as if he knew her well as an equal not as a policeman no of course not if i knew anything i should tell you would you there was gentle disbelief in his voice even if it were no more than a suspicion would you not be afraid of wronging someone perhaps someone you loved it was on the edge of her tongue to say quite angrily that she did not love anyone who could possibly be connected with such crimes then something in him compelled her to be honestan intelligence or an honesty in him yes of course i should be afraid of wronging someone if it were merely a matter of suspicion but i imagine you do not leap to conclusions just because of something someone tells you it was a question because she wanted reassuring no or we would catch ourselves ten criminals for every crime he smiled showing those strong teeth again what is it you do not want me to act upon you are leaping to conclusions she said hotly i did not say i knew anything you did not say so directly but your evasion makes me believe it she turned away from him making up her mind not to speak of it you are mistaken i wish i knew something that could genuinely help but i do not im sorry if anything i said gave a wrong impression charlotte you are becoming overly familiar inspector pitt she said quietly he came up behind her she was acutely aware of him emilys words about his admiration flashed across her mind and she found her skin burning with embarrassment and a sudden appalling knowledge that it was true she stood rooted to the spot charlotte he said gently this man has killed four women already there is no reason to suppose he will stop in all likelihood he cannot help himself it is better some innocent person should be suspected unjustly for a whilehe will be one of manythan that another woman should die how old was lily nineteen verity lessing was only twenty chloe abernathy was little more or the hiltons maid i cant even remember her name if you doubt the monstrosity of it go upstairs and look at mrs lessing again i know charlotte said furiously you dont have to remind me ive been here since last night then tell me whatever it is you have thought of or seen or heardwhatever it is if it is wrong i shall find out no one will be pursued unjustly he will be caught one day but better now before he kills again she turned round without thinking to stare at him do you think he will kill again dont you she closed her eyes to avoid looking at his face what has happened here this used to be a quiet a good place to live there was nothing worse than a few broken romances a little gossip now suddenly people are dead we are all looking at each other and wondering i am im looking at men ive trusted for years and wondering if it could be them thinking thoughts about them that make me blush with shame and i can see in their faces that they know i am suspicious thats almost the worst part of it they know i wonder that im not sure how must they feel how must it feel to look at your wife or your daughter and see in their faces in spite of their words that they are not absolutely sure that it is not you that it has actually crossed their minds that it could be could you ever feel the same again could love live through that is not love at least partly trust faith in someone and knowing them well enough that you dont even have such thoughts she kept her eyes shut i realize i hardly even know people i thought i loved and i see it in others too all the people who have come here i listen to what they say because i have to and they are beginning to look around to try to find someone to blame where it will upset them least the gossip and the suspicions are beginning the little whispered suggestions it isnt only the dead who are going to suffer or even only those who loved them then help me charlotte what is it you know or think you know george ashworth lord george ashworth he knew chloe abernathy quite well just before she died he took her to somesome very unpleasant places or so mrs abernathy said and in spite of what papa says chloe was not immoral not in the least just silly i know she opened her eyes ashworth is escorting emily a lot please see he isntthat he doesnt he gave a bitter little grimace i shall look discreetly into the late actions of lord george ashworth i promise you he is not unknown to us at least by repute you mean i mean he is a gentleman whose taste is a littleraucous and whose pocket and family title allow him to do things that in others would be punished i suppose speaking to emily would have no effect none at all i have done so and if it had been received differently i would not have troubled you he smiled of course dont worry he put out his hand as if to touch her arm and then withdrew it selfconsciously i shall have lord ashworth observed discreetly i shall do all i can to see emily comes to no harm although i cannot protect her from a possible serious fright that will do her no harm at all charlotte said tersely she was overwhelmingly relieved thank you inspector ii am gladof your help he coloured faintly and turned to leave are you going to remain with mrs lessing until after the funeral yes why no reason good night miss ellison thank you for your assistance good night inspector pitt it was over a week later after the funeral when charlotte returned from the lessings she had been forbidden to travel alone not only by pitt but by papa she was more than pleased that it was dominic who came in the cab to collect her even the memory of the funeral the finality of it the pathetic black mrs lessings grief could not drive away the pleasure of seeing dominic being alone with him when he met her eyes it was as if he had touched her his smile warmed her through melting the chill of fear and helplessness she sat in the cab beside him and for a moment everything else was shut out no past and no future they talked of trivialities but she did not care it was being with him that mattered knowing that all his attention was turned towards her the cabdriver unloaded her box and maddock carried it in she followed behind on dominics arm it was a marvellous feeling it collapsed as soon as she entered the withdrawing room sarah looked up from the sofa where she was sitting sewing her face darkened as soon as she saw them you are not entering a ballroom charlotte she said tartly nor unless you are feeling faint do you need someone to hang on to like that emily was at the piano and looked downward at her hands with an uncomfortable colour creeping up her face charlotte stopped still her arm in spite of the warmth and closeness of dominic suddenly feeling dead perhaps she was holding him too closely she could not deny she had done it consciously now she was selfconscious and guilty she sought to free her arm but dominic was still gripping her and his grip tightened sarah he said with a frown charlotte has just returned home from a visit of charity would you have me allow her to come in alone i would have you welcome her naturally sarah was annoyed and her voice was tight and hard but not to make an entrance clinging to each other like that charlotte deliberately freed herself her face flaming im sorry if you were offended sarah but until you spoke it was no more than excitement at being home again and now that i have spoken what is it sarah demanded well you have certainly taken much of the pleasure from coming home charlotte was beginning to become angry herself this was unjust her foolishness did not warrant this degree of criticism and not publicly you have only been round the corner sarah snapped not to australia she has been staying with mrs lessing to help her through her worst time which was an act of particular generosity dominic was growing sharper himself it cannot have been easy or very pleasant under the circumstances sarah glared at him i know perfectly well where shes been you dont need to be so sanctimonious about it it was charitable certainly but hardly as saintly as you make it seem charlotte could not understand it she looked at sarahs face there was something almost like hatred in it she turned from it feeling sick and shaken emily would not meet her eyes she swivelled back to dominic thats right sarah stood up look to dominic thats just what i would expect except that you should do it behind my back charlotte could feel the blood flaming in her cheeks even her brow because she loved dominic had always loved himbut she was blushing for her thoughts not her deeds for her deeds the accusation was unjust she drew her breath in deeply and let it out sarah i dont know what it is you think but if it is anything improper or in any way unfair or unjust to you then you are wrong and your charge does you no credit it is not true and i believe you know me well enough to have known that before you spoke i thought i did i only discovered how blind i had been while you were away doing your charity turn at mrs lessings you are the perfect hypocrite charlotte i never even suspected you and you were right charlotte heard her own voice coming from a long way away there was nothing to suspect it is now that you are wrong not before she felt dominic take her arm again and moved to loose herself but he was holding her tightly sarah he said quietly i dont know what you imagine and i dont wish to know but you owe charlotte an apology for whatever your thoughts are and for having voiced them she looked at him squarely her lip curled with disgust dont lie to me dominic i know i am not guessing his face went blank with complete surprise know what there isnt anything to know i know dominic emily told me it was the first time charlotte had seen dominic really angry suddenly emily looked frightened too frightened to move emily theres no point in appealing to emily or trying to bully her sarah stepped forward bully emily dominic raised his eyebrows in harsh amusement nobody ever bullied emily in her life it would be an impossibility dont try to be amusing sarah snapped charlotte disregarded them she was staring at emily emily lifted her chin a little you told inspector pitt about george and chloe abernathy she said with only a slight tremor in her voice because i was afraid for you charlotte defended herself and yet felt guilty also she knew emily saw it as a betrayal and however little charlotte had meant it as such the guilt remained afraid of what that i might marry george leaving you here alone the only one of us not married she shut her eyes her face white im sorry that was a dreadful thing to say i thought he might have killed chloe and you might guess it one day and that then he would have to kill you charlotte said simply she would have given anything she possessed for dominic not to have been there not to have heard this youre wrong emily said quietly her eyes still closed george has faults faults you probably wouldnt put up with but nothing like that do you suppose i should think of marrying anyone who would be capable of murdering like that no i think you would find out and that is why he would kill you too do you hate him so much i dont care about him charlotte said in exasperation almost shouting i was thinking about you emily said nothing dominic was still angry so you made up something vicious about charlotte and told sarah to get your revenge he accused emilys face tightened she looked very young and now also very ashamed i shouldnt have told her she admitted looking at dominic then apologize and withdraw it dominic demanded emilys face set i shouldnt have said it but that does not make it untrue charlotte is in love with dominic she has been ever since he first came and dominic is flattered by it he enjoys it i dont know how much she left it a question painful and suggestive emily charlotte pleaded emily turned to her can you take back what you said to inspector pitt can you make him forget it then why do you expect me to take back youll have to live with itjust as i shall and she pushed past them and went out into the hallway charlotte looked at sarah if you are waiting for me to apologize you will wait in vain sarah said stiffly now perhaps you would be good enough to go upstairs and unpack i would prefer to speak to my husband alone you wont be surprised that i have questions to ask charlotte hesitated but there was nothing else to say nothing that could do anything but make it worse she disengaged herself from dominic and turned to leave perhaps tomorrow there would be apologies and perhaps not but whatever was said nothing would wipe out the memory of today feelings could not be the same again what she had said to pitt was true this was all like ripples on a pool and perhaps the rings would never stop chapter nine the following day dominic went into the city as usual and on returning home was due to go out and dine with a retired brigadier and his wife it was an occasion sarah had been looking forward to for some time but when he returned home he found her in a mood that reflected none of the excitement and pleasure he had expected she seemed remote not merely preoccupied but positively offended by his presence he tried all the usual tactics he complimented her on her gown he told her all he knew about the brigadiers wife and her social connections he assured her she would be more than equal to the occasion he kissed her without disarranging either her hair or her gown none of it was to any effect she withdrew from his touch and avoided his eyes there was no opportunity to ask her what was annoying her on two or three occasions during the evening he tried to speak to her without being overheard but each time either they were interrupted or she changed the subject and drew some other persons attention to them in the carriage on the way home they were alone for the first time sarah yes she kept her face away what is it sarah youve been behaving likelike a stranger all evening no thats not true a stranger would have shown better manners im sorry you find my manners inadequate stop playing sarah if theres something wrong tell me something wrong she turned to face him her eyes blazing in the flashes of gaslight from the street yes something is very wrong and if you are not aware that it is wrong then you have a sense of morality that is despicable i really havent anything to say to you morality about what oh for gods sake youre not still making a fuss because i took charlottes arm when she came home yesterday thats ridiculous and you know it youre just looking for an excuse for a row at least be honest looking i dont have far to look do i you are busy admiring my sister holding her hand whispering to her and heaven knows what else and you think i have to look for something to quarrel over she turned away again her voice choking he put his arm towards her but she was dead to his touch sarah dont be ridiculous i have no interest in charlotte except that shes your sister i like her nothing else for heavens sake i knew charlotte when i married you if id wanted her i would have asked for her that was six years ago people change she sniffed and then was obviously angry with herself for what she considered a vulgarity he was sorry not wanting to hurt her but the whole thing was preposterous he could not help being irritated for a whole evening spoiledand now a silly argument when they were both tired sarah thats stupid i havent changed and i dont think you have and as far as i can see charlotte hasnt either but charlotte hasnt anything to do with this anyway surely you can see emily just said whatever she did because shes in love with george ashworth and charlotte told the policemanwhats his name that ashworth knew chloe a lot better than hed said youve got to have enough wisdom to see that and discard it for the nonsense it is why do you lose your temper if youre not guilty she said calmly because its so damn silly he exploded in exasperation i have just found out that you are in love with my sister and she with you and i am silly because it upsets me oh sarah for heavens sake stop it he said wearily thats none of it true and you know it i have never been remotely interested in charlotte except as a sisterinlaw shes intelligent has a wit and a mind of her ownnone of them very feminine attributes which youve been the first to point out inspector pitt doesnt seem to mind she said accusingly hes in love with her anyone can see that for gods sake sarah what have i in common with some wretched policeman and i should imagine charlotte is embarrassed by the whole affair if indeed its true hesworking class hes not more than a tradesman and why shouldnt he admire charlotte as long as he remembers his place shes a very handsome woman you think so again there was accusation in her voice almost triumph yes i do his own voice rose in anger really she was being very stupid and very tiresome indeed he was tired and in no mood for this he had been patient all evening but his patience was rapidly coming to an end now please dont pursue it any more i have done nothing whatsoever that requires apology or deserves your criticism she said nothing but when they arrived home she went straight upstairs when dominic had spoken to edward in the study and followed her up she was already in bed her back turned to him he considered for a moment approaching her again but he had no feeling of warmth no desire and honestly he was too tired for the effort the hypocrisy he undressed and went to sleep without speaking the following day he woke having forgotten the whole stupid affair but he was stiffly reminded when he returned home in the evening things were no better there was also a certain coolness between emily and charlotte but no one else seemed to observe it conversation was unusually restrained caroline spoke of neighbourhood trivialities which edward did little more than acknowledge only grandmama was voluble she was full of speculation about what secrets gossip attributed to all the families especially the men in the vicinity of cater street at last edward told her rather testily to be silent the day after was no better and on the following evening dominic decided he would remain at his club for dinner sarah would come out of it sooner or later but for the present she was being very tedious he had no idea why she was doing it he had never entertained any interest other than friendly in charlotte sarah must know that women frequently did odd and inexplicable things it was usually an obscure way of laying claim to attention and after a little flattery they were back to normal whatever sarah wanted this time she was making rather too much of an issue of it he was bored with it and becoming genuinely angry he dined at his club again two evenings later it was on the third occasion that he fell into conversation with four other men who lived within a mile or two of cater street at first he had done no more than overhear but his interest was drawn when they began to discuss the murders wretched police all over the place and they dont seem to be accomplishing a damn thing one complained poor devils are as lost as we are someone else argued more lost dont even belong in our world part of a different social class dont understand us any more than we understand them good god you arent suggesting this lunatic is a gentleman there was amusement incredulity and the edge of anger in this voice why not good god he was stunned well weve got to admit it if he were a stranger he would have been noticed by now the man leaned forward for the love of heaven man the way everyone feels at the moment do you think any stranger could go unobserved everyone is looking over his shoulder women darent even go next door alone the men are all watching and waiting delivery boys practically clock in and out they want themselves timed to prove where they were and when even cabbies dont like coming to cater street any more in the past week two have been stopped by constables only because they were strange faces you know the man opposite him frowned its just come to me what that old fool blenkinsop was talking about the other day i thought he was rambling at the time but now i realize he was saying in a roundabout way that he suspected me quite thats the most damnable thing about it having people looking queerly at you not precisely saying anything but you know cursed well whats going on in their minds even errand boys are getting above themselves youre not alone old fellow left my carriage for my wife and was out late had to get a cab home wretched cabbie asked my destination i told him and the man had the impertinence to refuse me not going to cater street he said i ask you one of them caught dominic in his peripheral vision ah corde youll know what were talking about dreadful business isnt it whole place turned upside down creature must be insane of course unfortunately it isnt obvious dominic replied sitting down in the proffered chair not obvious what dyou mean i would have thought it could hardly be more obvious than to run around the streets garotting helpless women i mean it does not show in his demeanour at other times dominic explained in his face his actions or in anything else he must look exactly like anyone else most of the time charlottes words came back to him for all we know he could be here now any one of these extremely respectable gentlemen i dont care for your sense of humour corde misplaced poor taste if i may say so to make jokes about murder at all is poor taste but i wasnt joking i was perfectly serious even if you dont believe in the intelligence of the police with feeling running as it is if this man were visible for what he is surely one of us would have spotted him before now the man stared at him his face turning purple then paling bless me shockin thought not nice having ones neighbours think has it never crossed your mind about someone else i admit it occurred to me gatling behaved a trifle odd caught him being overly solicitous to my wife the other day hands where they had no business helping her with a shawl said something to him at the time never thought of itperhaps thats why he was so offendedthought i meantoh well all past now damned unpleasant though feel as if no one tells me what they mean anymore see meanings behind meanings if you understand me thing i cant stand is the maids looking at one as if one were and so it went on dominic heard the same views over and over again the embarrassment the anger the bewildermentand something worse the almost inevitable sense that somewhere close to someone they knew it would happen again he wanted to forget it to go back for a few hours to the way it was before the first murder dominic was delighted a week later to see george ashworth dressed very formally obviously ready for a night out ah corde ashworth slapped him on the back coming for a nights entertainment as long as you dont tell sarah he smiled meaning it as a joke it was unthinkable of course that dominic would say anything one did not mention such things to women any women except bawds dominic made up his mind instantly exactly what i need certainly ill come where are we going ashworth grinned bessie mullanes to end with perhaps one or two other places beforehand have you eaten yet no excellent i know a place you will like quite small but the best food and the most entertaining company and so it proved it was certainly a little bawdy but dominic had never eaten a richer more delicately cooked meal or enjoyed such free wine gradually he forgot cater street and all those who lived thereor died there even sarahs present foolishness disappeared from his mind with the good spirits and conviviality of the company bessie mullanes proved to be a cheerful and extremely comfortable bawdy house where they were lavishly welcomed ashworth was obviously not only known but quite genuinely liked they had not been there above half an hour when they were joined by a young swell extravagantly dressed and a little drunk but not yet objectionable george he said with evident pleasure havent seen you in weeks he slid into the seat beside him good evening sir he inclined his head towards dominic i say have you seen jervis thought id take him out of himself a bit but cant find him whats the matter with him ashworth enquired pleasantly by the way he indicated dominic dominic corde charles danley danley nodded silly fool lost at cards lost rather a lot shouldnt play more than you can afford ashworth said without sympathy stay with your own level of game thought he was danley curled up the corners of his lips in disgust other fellow cheated could have told him he would thought jervis was pretty comfortable ashworth opened his eyes indicating it was something of a question hell recover have to curtail his entertaining for a while that isnt it he was stupid enough to accuse the bastard of cheating ashworth grinned what happened did he call him out for a duel should have thought after all that scandal with churchill and the prince of wales five years ago hed have steered clear of anything like that no of course he didnt apparently the cheating hadnt been particularly well done and he was able to expose it without any effortwhich he was idiotic enough to do why idiotic dominic interrupted from sheer curiosity i would have thought if a man were crass enough to cheat and do it badly he deserved whatever came to him naturally but this was an extremely illtempered fellow and with some weight of influence hell be ruined of course ultimate sin to cheat badly implies you dont even have the respect for your fellows to do it well but hell make damned sure he takes poor jervis with him ashworth frowned how jervis didnt cheat did he even if he did he wasnt caught which is the main thing after all everyone cheats the accusation will look mere spite nothing to do with cheating dear fellow mans married to jerviss cousin of whom hes very fondjervis i mean so seems she has a lover which is common enough and nothing in itself gave him five children and hes bored with her and she with him understandable all perfectly all right as long as its discreet seems she wasnt country weekend didnt lock her door someone came in mistaking it for another ladys room and found her with some fellow or other upshot of it all is that this wretched cheat threatened to divorce her ashworth shut his eyes oh my god shed be ruined of course upset poor jervis no end very fond of her apart from the family name and all that makes things dashed difficult for him in society cousin whos divorced and your cheating feller gets away with it scotfree quite having a deuced good time hell marry again when it suits him and she poor creature an outcast teach you to lock your doors didnt catch her himself gracious no he was in bed with dolly lawtonsmith oblivious to the world but thats irrelevant different for a man of course what about dolly wouldnt do her any good nor harm either everyone knows about everyone else its what is seen that counts and the vulgarity of being caught instead of being a bit of a fellow makes one look ridiculous and divorce is of no great importance to a man but it ruins a woman after all its one thing to have a little fun oneself but one is made to look a complete fool if it is seen that ones wife prefers someone else and dollys husband oh i believe they have an amicable enough arrangement he certainly wont divorce her if thats what youre thinking why should he no one caught him cheating at cards poor old jervis ashworth sighed what a perilous life talking of peril what about all the grisly business in cater street four murders man must be mad damn glad i dont live there he frowned suddenly you go there quite often dont you that pretty little thing i saw you with at actons didnt you say she lived there liked her woman of spirit not blueblooded but dashed pretty dominic opened his mouth to speak then decided to listen instead he liked emily but regardless of that there was a certain loyalty blue blood gets a bit tedious at times ashworth said slowly disregarding dominic entirely all too strictly brought up looking for the right marriage i ought to marry money i suppose or at least some expectation of it but so many rich young women are such utter bores dominic remembered emilys determined little face whatever she was and sometimes she was uncommonly irritating she was never a bore in her own way she was as wilful as charlotte if a good deal more devious well for heavens sake george danley leaned back and signalled to one of the women holding up his empty glass marry a woman of blood and money by all means but keep this other one as a mistress i would have thought the answer sufficiently obvious ashworth glanced sideways at dominic with a grin dashed good suggestion charlie but not in front of her brotherinlaw what danleys face dropped then the colour swept up his cheek dont care for your sense of humour george he pulled one of the passing girls onto his knee disregarding her giggle uncivil of you dominic looked at him miss ellison is my sisterinlaw he said with distinct pleasure and i cannot see her settling for mistress to anyone even someone as distinguished as george however you may try by all means ashworth was grinning broadly he was a remarkably handsome man the fun is in the chase for more generous entertainment one can always come here emily offers something a good deal moreinteresting involves the brain and the skill dont you see sarah was always at home when dominic returned from his nights out she was no longer cool nor did she mention the matter of any untoward affection between charlotte and himself again but he knew from her manner and a certain reticence that she had not forgot it there was nothing he could do indeed he did not seriously consider doing anything but even so it was unpleasant it robbed him of a warmth a happiness that he used to take for granted the police were still questioning people the fear was still there although the first urgency had gone verity lessing had been buried and mourners picked up their lives again suspicions were presumably still festering under the surface but the hysteria was decently controlled it was october and rapidly chilling when dominic ran into inspector pitt quite by chance in a coffeehouse dominic was alone pitt stopped by his table really he was an inelegant creature no one could possibly have mistaken him for a man of society there was no concession to fashion in him and only a passing accommodation to convention good afternoon mr corde pitt said cheerfully alone good afternoon mr pitt yes my companion has left then may i join you pitt put his hand out onto the back of the chair opposite dominic was taken by surprise he was not used to entertaining policemen socially still less in public the man seemed to have no sense of his position if you wish he replied with reluctance pitt smiled broadly and pulled out the chair he sat comfortably thank you is this coffee fresh yes please help yourself did you wish to speak to me about something surely the man was not foisting himself on him for purely social reasons he could not be so insensitive thank you pitt poured from the pot and drank with delicately flared nostrils how are you and your family presumably he meant charlotte emily was probably exaggerating but there was no doubt pitt did admire charlotte well enough i think thank you naturally the tragedies in cater street have not left us untouched i suppose you are no nearer a solution pitt pulled a face he had remarkably mobile expressive features only insofar as we have eliminated more possibilities i suppose that is some kind of progress not much dominic was not in a mood to spare his feelings have you given up i observe you havent been to bother us any more i havent thought of anything else to ask you pitt said reasonably i had not noticed thats preventing you in the past damn the man if he could not solve the crime he should call in assistance from his superiors why dont you hand over the case to someone higher up or get help pitt met his eyes dominic was made a little uncomfortable a little selfconscious by the sheer intelligence in them i have mr corde everyone at scotland yard is bending their minds to it i assure you but there are other crimes you know robberies forgeries embezzlement corruption burglaries and even other murders dominic was stung could the man possibly be patronizing him of course there are i hadnt imagined ours was the only crime in london but surely you consider ours to be the most serious pitts smile vanished of course mass murder is the most dreadful crime of allthe more so since it will almost certainly be repeated what do you suggest we do dominic was taken aback by the sheer brazenness of it how on earth would i know i am not a policeman but i would have thought if there were more of you more experienced perhaps to do what pitt raised his eyebrows ask more questions we have dug up an incredible number of trivial eccentricities immoralities small dishonesties and cruelties but no clue to murderat least none that can be recognized as such his face became very grave we are dealing with insanity mr corde its no use looking for reasons or patterns that you or i would recognize dominic stared at him afraid this wretched man was speaking about something horrible something hellish and incomprehensible and it frightened him what manner of man are we looking for pitt went on does he choose his particular victims for any specific reason or is his choice arbitrary do they just happen to be at the right place at the right time does he even know who they are what have they in common they are all young all pleasing enough to look at but that is all as far as we know two were servants two daughters of respectable families the hiltons maid was somewhat loose in her morals but lily mitchell was entirely proper chloe abernathy was a little silly but no more verity lessing mixed in high society you tell me what they had in common apart from being young and living in or near cater street he must be a madman dominic said futilely pitt pulled a bitter smile we had already got so far robbery dominic suggested then knew it was silly as soon as he had said it pitt raised his eyebrows of a maid on her evening off were they dominic did not like to use the word pitt had no such scruples raped no verity lessings dress was torn open and her bosom scratched quite deeply but nothing more why dominic shouted oblivious of the heads turning from the other tables he must be a raving aa he could think of no word his anger collapsed it doesnt make any sense he said helplessly no pitt agreed and while we are trying to understand it trying to see some sort of pattern in the evidence we still have to do something about the other crimes yes of course dominic stared into his empty coffee cup cant you leave that to your sergeant or something the street is in a terrible state everyone is afraid of everyone else he thought of sarah its affecting even the ways we think of each other it will pitt agreed nothing strips the soul quite as naked as fear we see things in ourselves and in others that we would far rather not have known about but my sergeant is in hospital was he taken ill dominic was not really interested but it was something to say no he was injured we went into a slum quarter after a forger and he attacked you no pitt said wryly thieves and forgers far more often run than fight youve never been into the vast warrens where these people live and work or you wouldnt have asked buildings are packed so close together they are indistinguishable any single row has a dozen entrances and exits they usually post some sort of watchmana child or an old woman a beggar anyone and they prepare traps were used to the trapdoors that open up beneath you and drop you into a sort of oubliette a hole perhaps fifteen or twenty feet deep possibly even into the sewers but this was different this fellow went upwards towards the roof and we chased him up the stairs i had been set upon by two other villains and was busy fighting them off poor flack charged up the stairway and the forger disappeared ahead of him dropping a trapdoor downwards across the stairs the thing was fitted with great iron spikes one sliced through flacks shoulder another missed his face by inches oh god dominic was horrified pictures swam into his mind of dark and filthy caves and passages smelling of refuse running with rats his stomach rose at the thought of entering them he imagined the ceiling slamming shut in front of him the iron spikes driving into flesh the pain and the blood he thought for a moment he was going to be sick pitt was staring at him hell likely lose the arm but unless it becomes gangrenous hell live he was saying he passed over the dish of coffee you see there are other crimes mr corde did you catch him dominic found his voice scratchy he ought to be hanged yes we caught him a day later and hell be transported for twentyfive or thirty years from what i hear thatll likely be as bad maybe hell be of some use to someone in australia i still say he should be hanged its easy to judge mr corde when your father was a gentleman and you have clothes on your back and food on your plate every day williamss father was a resurrectionist a churchman dominic was shocked pitt smiled sardonically no mr corde a man who made his living by stealing corpses to sell to the medical schools before the law was changed in the thirties sweet god oh there were plenty of unwanted corpses around the rookeries the slum areas of the old days it was a crime of course and it demanded a good deal of skill and nerve to smuggle them from wherever they were stolen to wherever they were handed over and the money received sometimes they were even dressed and propped up to look like live passengers stop it dominic stood up i take your point that the wretched man may not know better but i dont want to hear about it it doesnt excuse him or help your sergeant let the man forge his money whats a few guineas more or less in the whole of london but find our hangman pitt was still seated a few guineas more or less is nothing to you mr corde but to a woman with a child it may be the difference between food and starvation and if you can tell me what else to do to catch your hangman ill be only too willing to do it dominic left the coffeehouse feeling miserable confused and deeply angry pitt had no right to speak to him like that there was nothing whatsoever he could do about it and it was unfair he should be forced to listen when he arrived home he felt no better sarah met him in the hall he kissed her putting his arms round her but she did not relax against him in irritation he let go of her sharply sarah ive had enough of this childish attitude of yours you are behaving stupidly and its time you stopped do you know how many nights you have been out this last month she countered no i do not do you yes thirteen in the last three weeks alone and if you were to behave yourself with dignity and like a grown woman instead of an undisciplined child i should take you with me i hardly think i should care for the places which you have been frequenting he drew breath to say he would change the places but then his anger hardened and he changed his mind there was no purpose in arguing with words it was feelings that mattered and as long as she felt like this it was pointless he turned away and went into the withdrawing room sarah went back to the kitchen charlotte was in the withdrawing room standing by the open window painting this is a withdrawing room charlotte not a studio he said waspishly she looked surprised and a little hurt im sorry everyone else is either out or busy and i was not expecting you home so early or i would have put it away she did not however move to close her box i met your damned policeman mr pitt have you another i havent any dont be coy charlotte he sat down irritably you know perfectly well he admires you indeed is enamoured of you if you havent observed it for yourself emily has certainly told you charlotte flushed with embarrassment emily was saying it to annoy and you of all people should know that emily can say things merely to cause trouble he turned to look at her properly he had been unfair he was taking out his anger with pitt and with sarah on charlotte im sorry he said frankly yes emily has an irresponsible tongue although i think she may well be right about pitt after all why shouldnt he admire you you are an extremely handsome woman and have the kind of spirit that might appeal to him he was surprised to see charlotte colour even more deeply he had meant it to comfort her not to make her embarrassment worse she was the most forthright person he had ever met and yet paradoxically the hardest for him to understand obviously one did not want the attentions of someone like pitt but it should be no more than an irritation to be forgotten where did you meet him she asked still absently fiddling with her palette in a coffeehouse didnt know policemen frequented such places he had the nerve to just come and sit down at my table his anger rekindled at the memory what did he want she looked worried he tried to think back but he could not remember pitt had not asked anything pertinent i dont know perhaps just to talk why she lifted a shoulder slightly in a small shrug he went on about forgers and resurrectionists she looked round resurrectionists what are theyreligious charlatans no men who steal corpses to sell to medical students oh how pathetic pathetic its disgusting its also pathetic that people should be reduced to such a level are you sure they havent reduced themselves if they have thats even worse what an odd woman she was sarah would never have viewed it that way there was an innocence in charlotte a gentleness that was quite misplaced and yet he was drawn to her because of it odd he had always thought it was sarah who was gentle and charlotte who had a streak of of resistance in her something unfeminine he looked at her now as she stood with the paintbrush in her hand she was not as pretty as sarah and she lacked the small touchesthe fine lace the little earrings the delicate curls in the nape of the neckand yet in a way she was also more beautiful and in thirty years when sarah would be plump her chin line gone her hair faded the bones in charlottes face would still be beautiful its a terrible responsibility she said slowly we all expect him to be able to solve the murders for us put us back to where we were before and she would still be saying whatever came into her mind he thought wryly she would never learn the small deceits that make women mysterious femininethat they survive by but charlotte would not sulk over some imagined slight charlotte would have a blazing row in the long run that might be better easier to put up with at least he doesnt have to live here nobody suspects him he said going back to her remark no but well all blame him if he doesnt find the man he had not even thought of that now that she pointed it out to him he felt a surge of sympathy for pitt he wished he had not been so patronizing in the coffeehouse charlotte was staring at her picture on the easel i wonder if he even knows who he is or if hes just as afraid as we are of course not if he knew hed arrest him not pitt the man whoever he is does he remember does he know or is he as frightened and as puzzled as the rest of us oh god what an unspeakable thought whatever put that into your head i dont know but its possible isnt it i shouldnt think so i would very much rather not think so if that were true it could beit could be anyone she looked at him solemnly her eyes very steady and gray it could be anyone now charlotte stop it for heavens sake lets just pray pitt finds him stop thinking about it theres nothing we can do except never go out alone under any circumstances he shivered only go out if you have to and then take maddock or your father or ill come with you she smileda strange tight little gestureand turned back to the painting thank you dominic he looked at her odd he had always thought her open obvious now she seemed enigmatic more mysterious than sarah did one ever learn to understand women a couple of days later dominic had yet more cause to ponder the female mind they were all sitting in the withdrawing room after dinner even emily was at home grandmama was crocheting squinting a little when she occasionally glanced at her work most of the time she worked blind her fingers and long habit guiding her i called on the vicar this afternoon grandmama said a little sharply there was a hint of criticism in her voice sarah took me oh caroline looked up did you find them well not especially the vicar was well enough i suppose but martha looked very strained i thought a woman should never let herself go like that she begins to have the look of a drudge she does work very hard sarah said in her defence that has nothing to do with it my dear grandmama said disapprovingly however hard one works one should still take care of ones appearance it matters a great deal emily looked up i doubt it matters to the vicar i should be surprised if he ever notices that is not the point grandmama was not to be put off a woman owes it to herself it is a matter of duty im sure anything to do with duty would appeal to the vicar charlotte observed especially if it were unpleasant charlotte we all know that you do not care for the vicar you have made it abundantly obvious grandmama looked a little down her nose however comments like that are of no use at all and do you no credit the vicar is a very worthy man and as suits a man of the cloth he disapproves of frivolity and paint on the face and anything that encourages harlotry not by the wildest stretch of lunacy can i imagine martha prebble encouraging harlotry charlotte was unabashed except by perverse example caroline dropped her linen pillowcase charlotte what on earth do you mean that the sight of marthas pale face and the thought of living with someone as critical and selfrighteous as the vicar would make one entertain the idea of harlotry as a more bearable alternative charlotte said with devastating frankness i can only presume grandmama said icily that you imagine that to be in some fashion amusing when i consider what manners are coming to these days i sometimes despair what passes for wit has become mere vulgarity i think you are a little unkind charlotte caroline spoke more mildly the vicar is a little difficult i admit and not a very likeable man but he does a great deal of good work and poor martha is almost tireless i dont think you realize sarah added just how much she does or that she has suffered deeply with all these murders she was very fond of both chloe and verity you know charlotte looked surprised no i didnt know i knew about verity but i didnt know she knew chloe i wouldnt have thought they had many interests in common i think she was trying to help chloe toto keep her feet on the ground she was a little silly but quite kind you know listening to her dominic suddenly felt an appalling sense of pity he had not cared in the least for chloe when she was alive in fact he had found her tiresome now he felt something that was as strong as love and far more painful without thinking he looked at charlotte she was blinking hard a tear had spilled over onto her cheek caroline had picked up her linen again emily was doing nothing and grandmama was staring at charlotte with disgust what were they thinking grandmama was blaming everyone for the decline in morals caroline was concentrating on her sewing emily also would be thinking of something practical sarah had defended chloe and charlotte had wept for her how well did he know any of them dominic continued to go out to his club and to other places to dine and generally enjoy himself on several occasions he saw george ashworth and found him easy and pleasing company he fully expected sarah to forget the silly affair with emily and the accusation she had made against charlotte and himself but apparently she had not she said nothing further but the coolness remained the distance between them grew greater if anything it was an icy evening in november fog swirling in the streets and swathing the gas lamps in wreaths of mist it was clammy and bitterly cold and he was glad when his cab turned the corner from cater street into his own road and a few moments later stopped and set him down he paid and heard the horses hooves clopping away on the stones muffled by sounddeadening fog within minutes he was marooned on a small island of one gas lamp everything else was impenetrable darkness the next lamp seemed very far away it had been an excellent evening warm in both wine and companionship standing alone in the fog however he could think of nothing but women alone in the street footsteps behind them perhaps even a face or a voice they knew then they would feel a cutting pain in the throat and darkness bursting lungs and deatha limp body to be found on the wet stones in the morning by some passerby then examined by the police he shivered as the cold cut into his bones and his spirit he hurried up the steps and knocked sharply on the door it seemed like an age passed before maddock opened it and he was able to push beyond him into the warmth and the light he was even pleased when it was closed behind him shutting out the street with its fog and darkness and god knew what unspeakable creatures miss sarah has retired sir maddock said from behind him but not long since mr ellison is in his study reading and smoking but the withdrawing room is empty if you wish me to bring you something would you prefer a hot drink sir or brandy nothing thank you maddock i think ill go to bed myself its infernally cold outside and the fog is coming down pretty thick most unpleasant sir would you care for me to draw you a hot bath no thats all right thank you ill just go to bed good night good night sir upstairs everything was silent only a small nightlight burned on the landing he went into his dressing room and took off his clothes ten minutes later he opened the door to the bedroom theres no need to creep she said coldly i thought you might be asleep you mean you hoped i might be he did not understand why should i care one way or the other i merely did not wish to disturb you if you were where have you been at my club it was not precisely the truth but near enough there was no lie in it that mattered she raised her eyebrows in sarcasm all evening she had never questioned him before he was too surprised to be annoyed no i went on to a few other clubs why alone well i certainly wasnt with charlotte if thats what you had in mind he snapped i cant imagine charlotte being seen in that sort of place even to be with you she was staring at him icily what on earths the matter with you his confusion was growing i was out with george ashworth i thought you approved of him she looked away i went to see mrs lessing today oh he sat down on the dressing stool he was not in the least interested in whom she had visited but obviously she was leading up to something i did not realize until today how well you knew verity she went on i knew you were well acquainted with chloe but verity was a surprise to me what does it matter i only spoke with her a few times i think she liked me but the poor childs dead for heavens sake sarah you cant be jealous of a dead girl think where she is now i hadnt forgotten where she is dominic nor that chloe is there also and lily and bessie or are you jealous of the maids as well he was getting really angry he had not looked at charlotte except as a sister and it was bad enough that sarah should have accused him of involvement with her but this was ridiculous and obscene sarah was sitting upright in the bed whos bessie the hiltons maid i didnt even know her name how did you know it i dont know what the hell does it matter shes dead i know that dominic theyre all dead he looked at her she was staring at him with wide eyes as if he were a stranger and she had seen him for the first time as if he had come out of the fog with a wire in his hands now why did he think of something horrible like that because it was in her face she was afraid of him she was all knotted up sitting there on the bed with her shoulders hunched he could see the strain across her neck in the muscles of her throat sarah her face was frozen stiff and unable to speak sarah for gods sake he moved towards her sitting on the bed leaning forward to put his hands on her bare arms her flesh was rigid underneath his fingers you cant thinksarah you know me you cant think i could have he trailed off his voice dying there was no response in her he let go suddenly he did not want to touch her he was cold inside as if he had received a wound and could see the horror of it but shock kept the wound numb the pain would come later perhaps tomorrow he stood up ill sleep in the dressing room good night sarah lock the door if itll make you feel safer he heard her speak his name quietly hoarsely but he shut the door behind him without turning he wanted to be alone to absorb it and to sleep chapter ten of course charlotte knew nothing about dominics feelings or what had passed between him and sarah on his return from the club but the following day she could not help but be aware that there was a deep strain between them deeper than anything accountable for by sarahs standing suspicion about dominic and herself the whole matter was swept violently from her mind in the afternoon however when she was alone in the house copying out a folder of recipes for mrs lessing she had just turned to the window to look at the clouds massing everyone else was out visiting and charlotte was thinking that they would get wetwhen there was a timid urgent rapping at the door come in she said absently it was too early for tea it must be some problem with the preparations for dinner it was millie the new maid and she looked terrified charlottes immediate thought was that she had been outside on some errand perhaps only as far as the areaway and had either been molested herself or seen something or someone that had put the hangman into her mind come in millie charlotte said again you had better sit down you look dreadful what is it oh miss charlotte the poor child was shaking as if she had a fever im so glad its you sit down millie and tell me what has happened charlotte commanded millies legs seemed locked rigid and her hands were twisting in each other as if of their own volition suddenly speech deserted her and she looked as though she was about to run for goodness sake charlotte sighed taking millie bodily and pushing her into a chair now what has happened were you outside on an errand or in the areaway oh no miss charlotte she looked quite surprised well what is it then where were you upstairs in my room miss oh mrs dunphy told me i could go charlotte stepped back she was confused herself she had been sure millies pale demeanor had something to do with the hangman now it seemed it had not so whats wrong millie are you sick no miss millie stared down at her hands still twisting in her lap charlotte followed her eyes and realized for the first time that she was holding something what have you got millie oh millies eyes filled with tears i wouldnt have brought it miss but i was afraid for my name she sniffed violently im so glad its you miss she began to cry with quiet hopelessness charlotte was puzzled she was not only sorry for millie but a little frightened herself what is it millie she put out her hand give it to me slowly millies white little fingers uncurled to show a crumpled mans necktie it meant nothing at all to charlotte she could not see any reason why millie had brought it to her or why it should inspire any feeling whatever let alone the paralyzing terror that so obviously had stricken millie charlotte took it and held it up millie stared at her with enormous eyes its a necktie charlotte said blankly whats the matter with it then another thought came to her millie you didnt think anyone was strangled with a necktie did you she felt relief sweep through her almost weakening her knees she wanted to laugh it wasnt a necktie millie it was a garotting wire nothing like this take it away and have maddock attend to it its filthy yes miss charlotte but millie didnt move the fear still held her white and motionless go on millie its mr dominics miss charlotte i know because i collect the laundry the masters are made of a different stuff you can always tell them apart when i take the laundry back i only have to look and i know whose it is charlotte felt the sick fear come back though it was without reason why should it matter that dominic had lost a tie so its mr dominics she said with a quick swallow its filthy take it back to the laundry millie stood up very slowly gripping the tie hard mangling it in her hands its nothing to do with me miss charlotte i swear it isnt as god is my judge miss i swear it she was shaking with the passion of her fear and her need to be believed charlotte could no longer avoid it her stomach felt hard and cold inside her there could be only one question that mattered she asked it where did you find it millie in my bedroom miss her face flushed painfully it was under the bed when i turned the mattress it fell from round the bedstead onto the floor miss thats why its all creased and dusty it was there from before i came miss i swear it charlotte felt as if her world had exploded a voice whispered inside her that she should have expected it she hunted in the chaos for something worth saving to start rebuilding with that had been lilys room for years sarah had never slept there there had never been legitimate reason for dominic to go to it could lily have taken laundry there for some reason could lily have taken it to mend that possibility was excluded simply enough there was no tear in it could millie be lying a glance at her face was enough to dismiss that notion im sorry miss millie whispered desperately did i do wrong charlotte put out her hand and touched the girls clenched arm no millie you did the right thing and there is no need to be afraid but in case anyone should misunderstand dont speak of it again unless she did not want to say it unless what miss millie stared at her gratitude in her eyes what should i say if im asked miss charlotte i dont see any reason why you should be asked but if you are then tell the truth millie just exactly what you know nothing else dont make any guesses do you understand yes miss charlotte andthank you miss thats all right millie and youd better get that thing washed and put it with the rest of the laundry please do it yourself dont let miss sarah know millies face whitened miss charlotte do you think i dont think anything millie and i dont want miss sarah to think anything either now go and do as youre told yes miss millie bobbed a little curtsey and almost tripped over her feet going out as soon as she had gone charlotte collapsed onto the seat behind her her legs shaking her fingers stiff with pins and needles dominic and lily dominic on lilys bed dominic taking his tie off his shirt perhaps more and then putting them on again in such a hurry he forgot his tie she felt sick lilylittle lily mitchell she had loved dominic with all her heart not asking anything in return and he had gone to lily the maid was there something wrong with dominic with all men or with her was it her tongue was she unfeminine people had liked her but only that wretched pitt had ever admired her been enamoured of her because she was a woman this was ridiculous selfpity helped no one she must think of something else lily was dead had she loved dominic too or was it justno dont think about that dominic was handsome charmingher heart lurched why shouldnt any woman admire him verity had and she had seen it in chloes eyes too and they were both dead she sat frozen it could not be dominic had seen papa in cater street the night lily was killed that meant he had been there himself they had forgotten that they had only thought about papa it had never even occurred to her that dominic what was she saying she loved dominic she had always loved him as long as she had been a woman how could this even be entering her mind what was the love she felt for him then what was it worth if she knew him so little she did not even know in her heart whether he could have done such things could she really love someone whom she knew so little before this afternoon she could not have conceived of his sleeping with lily and now in less than an hour she had accepted it was her love little more than fascination love for love itself love for something she imagined him to be even love for his face his smile his eyes the way his hair grew did she know or love anything of the man inside what did he feel or think that had nothing to do with her or even sarah was it possible he loved lily or verityor hated them the more she thought about it the more confused she became the more she doubted herself and the love she thought she had felt so passionately all these years she was still sitting oblivious of the room of the house and certainly of time when there was a knock on the door it was dora to say that the vicars wife had called and should she bring tea since it was approaching four oclock charlotte recalled herself with a massive effort she had absolutely no desire whatever to see anyone least of all martha prebble yes dora by all means she said automatically and show mrs prebble in martha prebble looked less weary than the last time charlotte had seen her some of her spirit seemed to have returned and there was a look of purpose in her face again she came forward with her hands out frowning a little my dear charlotte you look very pale are you well my dear oh yes thank you mrs prebble then she thought she had better explain herself if she looked anything like she felt a little tired perhaps i didnt sleep very well last night nothing to be concerned about please sit down she indicated the overstuffed chair she knew it was comfortable martha sat you must take care of yourself you have been such a help to poor mrs lessing dont now wear yourself out charlotte forced a smile you should be the last person to offer such advice you seem to be everywhere helping everyone a thought occurred to her and now you are here alone did you walk through the streets alone you really shouldnt do that i shall send maddock back with you it will be growing darker by the time you leave it could be quite dangerous that is most kind of you but i fear i cannot become accustomed to having an escort wherever i go then you must stay at home at least at least as long martha leaned forward a faint smile on her strong face as long as what my dear until the police catch this man and how long do you imagine that will be i cannot stop my parish work there are many who need me we are not all equally fortunate you know there are those who are alone old perhaps sick women whose husbands are dead or have abandoned them women who have children to bring up without any help the comfortable in the parish do not wish to know about them but they are here in this area charlotte was surprised she thought everyone near cater street was at least satisfactorily placed had the necessities of life even a few comforts she had never seen any poor not that lived here oh very respectable marthas eyes looked out of the window the poverty is underneath the clothes are patched sewed over and over perhaps there is only one pair of shoes perhaps only one meal a day appearance selfrespect are everything oh how dreadful charlotte did not mean it as tritely as it sounded it was dreadful it hurt it was not like the grinding starving poverty inspector pitt had told her about but it was still painful a constant wearing pain she had never in her life been hungry or even had to wonder if something could be afforded true she had admired clothes she knew she could not have but she had more than she could possibly claim to need im sorry can i help martha smiled putting her hand out to touch charlottes knee you are a very good girl charlotte you take after your mother im sure there will be things you can do things you already have done it is a great tragedy not all the young women in the parish conduct themselves as you do she was interrupted by dora bringing in tea after dora had gone and charlotte had poured and handed her her cup she continued there is so much lightmindedness seeking ones own pleasure charlotte reluctantly thought of emily dearly as she loved her she could not recall emily ever having pursued any ends but her own im afraid so she agreed perhaps it is only lack of understanding ignorance is something of an excuse but not entirely so often we do not look because if we looked we should feel obliged to do something it was undeniably true and it struck a note of guilt in charlotte inadvertently she thought of pitt he had obliged her to see things she would have preferred not to things that disturbed her destroyed her peace of mind her comfort and she had disliked him intensely for it i tried to make verity see it the same way martha was saying her eyes on charlottes face she had so many good qualities poor verity and i understand you knew chloe fairly well too the minute charlotte had said it she wished she had not it was a cruel reminder a wakening of pain she saw marthas face tighten and a spasm pass through the muscles round her mouth poor chloe she said with a tone charlotte could not understand so frivolous so light laughing when she should not have pursuing society im afraid there were sometimes sinful things on her mind things of the she caught her breath but let us not speak ill of the dead she has paid for her sin and everything that was corrupting and corruptible in her is gone charlotte stared at her the strong fair face was full of confusion and unhappiness let us talk of something else charlotte said firmly i have been copying out some recipes i am sure you would be interested in at least one of them because i remember sarah saying you had enquired after a recipe for fricandeau of veal with spinach i hear mrs hilton has an extremely good cook or so mrs dunphy was saying to mama yes indeed and so willing martha agreed she does so much for church fetes and so forth an excellent hand with pastry it is not every cook who can make a good puff pastry you know put their fingers in it too much light and quick one needs to be and also very clever with preserves and candied fruits she was always sending her maid round with she stopped her face pale eyes distressed again charlotte put out her hand instinctively i know let us not think of it we cannot alter it now ill find you the recipe for the fricandeau she pulled her hand away quickly and stood up martha followed her and charlotte moved round the other side of the table she wanted the interview to end it was embarrassing she had handled it badly she was deeply sorry for martha both particularly because of her distress for the dead girls and generally because of her life with the vicar a fate which right now seemed quite as bad as anything pitt had spoken of here she held out a slip of paper i have already copied the fricandeau i can easily do another one please and i insist that maddock walk home with you its not necessary martha took the recipe without looking at it i assure you i refuse to permit you to leave my house alone charlotte said firmly she reached for the bell rope i should be guilty all evening i should worry myself sick and so martha had no choice but to accept and ten minutes later she took her departure with maddock trailing dutifully behind charlotte was not permitted to have a peaceful evening in which to sort out her chaotic feelings emily arrived home from visiting with the bombshell that she had invited lord george ashworth to dinner and would be expecting him a little after seven oclock emilys news drove the entire household into immediate panic only grandmama seemed to derive any unalloyed pleasure from it she was delighted to observe the frenzy and gave a running monologue on the proper way to order a house in such a fashion that even an unexpected visit from royalty itself could be managed with dignity and at least an adequate table emily was too excited and caroline too worriedand charlotte too overwhelmed by her own problems to reply to her it was eventually sarah who told her sharply to hold her tongue and thus sent grandmama into a paroxysm of righteous rage so severe she had to go upstairs and lie down well done charlotte said laconically sarah gave her the first real smile she had offered in weeks everything was calm at least on the surface a full five minutes before george ashworth arrived they were all sitting in the withdrawing room emily dressed in rose pink which suited her very well even if the extravagance of another new gown had not suited papa sarah was dressed in green also very becoming and charlotte in dull slate blue a colour she had disliked until she caught sight of herself in the glass and saw how it flattered her eyes and the warm tones of her skin and hair she blushed uncomfortably when ashworth bowed over her hand and his eyes lingered on her with approval she disliked him and thought him to be trifling with emily she replied to him formally with no more warmth than courtesy demanded throughout the evening however she was obliged to revise her opinion to some extent he behaved without appreciable fault in fact if he had not been in danger of hurting emily both publicly and privately she could have quite sincerely liked him he had wit and a certain outspokenness although no doubt in his social position he could afford to say what he chose without fearing the consequences he even flattered grandmama which was not difficult since she loved a handsome man and loved a title even more charlotte looked across and saw emilys face pucker in a little smile apparently she knew perfectly well what he was doing and it suited her once again charlottes anger rose damn the man for hurting emily she was a child in the ways of the world compared to him the next time charlotte spoke to him it was with a considerable chill in her voice she saw dominic staring at her in bewilderment but she was too angry to care and then all her old confusion about dominic returned she had loved him so much and now all she could feel was a heartsickening urge to protect him fromfrom what from pitt the policeor himself it seemed as if the evening stretched forever it was only eleven however when george ashworth took his leave and charlotte excused herself and gratefully escaped to bed she had expected to lie awake in a fever of thought all night but she was hardly aware of lying down before the sleep of exhaustion overtook her the following day something infinitely worse awaited her it was no more than ten oclock in the morning when maddock came to say that inspector pitt was in the hall and wished to see her me she tried to fend it off hoping he would see someone else perhaps that he had even come to see papa and was here now only to ensure that papa would be in that evening yes maam maddock said firmly he especially asked for you make sure it isnt really the master he wants to see this evening will you maddock yes maam maddock turned to leave and as he was at the door pitt himself opened it and came in inspector pitt charlotte said sharply intending to embarrass him into withdrawing he was the last person in the world she wanted to see dominics tie loomed so large in her mind it seemed as if pitt would only have to speak to millie go into any part of the kitchen or laundry and it would stare him in the face with all its appalling implications she was even more afraid of what she herself might say the sheer concentration on not mentioning it the fear kept it in the forefront of her mind good morning miss ellison he watched maddock disappear into the hall and closed the door behind him charlotte i came to tell you about george ashworth relief flooded through her it was nothing to do with dominic you know he said with surprise what an extraordinary face he had his feelings were so easily reflected almost magnified in it she was confused no what about him did you discover something again she was afraid thinking of emily was it ashworth after all that would at least mean he would not be able to hurt emily any more humiliate her by leaving her for someone else the thought was touched with deep regret which was ridiculous it was only a very small part of her that had liked him pitt was watching her you like him he observed with a smile his eyes were gentle i dislike him intensely she said with considerable sharpness why because you are afraid for emily afraid he would kill her or afraid he will eventually get bored with her and move on to someone else perhaps someone with money or a title she resented his accuracy his intrusion emilys humiliation and hurt were none of his business afraid he might kill her of course what is it you came to tell me mr pitt he ignored her terseness still smiling that he probably did not even know the hiltons maid and he certainly did not kill lily mitchell his actions are very fully accounted for all that day and night she was pleased very pleased which made no sense it meant ashworth would remain free to humiliate emily and she cared very much that that should not happen so you have eliminated one more person she said looking for words anything to say to him to banish the silence and avoid his eyes watching her smiling seeing every expression every thought in her face yes he agreed not a very satisfactory method of detection is that all you can do she meant it as a genuine question not a criticism he smiled a little wryly a selfdeprecating gesture not quite im trying to build up in my mind a picture of the kind of person were looking for of the sort of man driven to do such things involuntarily she voiced the same thought that had so horrified dominic do you think perhaps hes a manwhodoesnt know himself what hes done doesnt know why doesnt even remember afterwards then he would be just as ignorant and as afraid as the rest of us yes he said simply it was no comfort she wished he had said no it brought the person the hangman closer it removed the gulf between them he could be any one of them only god could know how he would feel when he discovered himself im sorry charlotte he said quietly it frightens me too he must be found but i am not looking forward to doing it she could think of nothing to say her minds eye could see only dominics black tie big enough to strangle the world she wished pitt would go away before the very dominance of it in her mind made her tongue slip i saw your brotherinlaw the other day he went on she felt herself tighten fortunately she had her back to him and he could not see the spasm in her throat the terror she tried to speak to sound casual but nothing came was that what he had really come for because he knew or guessed already in a coffeeshop he continued indeed she managed to speak at last he did not reply she knew he was looking at her she could not bear the silence i cannot imagine you had a great deal to discuss the hangman of course but not much else except a few other crimes he seemed to feel this was the most important isnt it she turned back to look at him to judge from his face what he meant yes of course it is but there are many others my sergeant lost his arm a week ago lost his arm she was horrified how what happened she remembered the little man vividly how could he have had such an appalling accident gangrene he said simply but she saw the anger in his eyes for a moment she actually forgot about dominic he got an iron spike through it he went on when we went into the rookeries after a forger he told her what had happened thats horrible she said fiercely does that sort of thing happen toto many of you she saw the flicker of hope in his face then selfmockery as he derided his own feelings emily was at least partially right he did care what she thought of him no not many he answered its as often tragic pitiful or even funny as it is violent most people would prefer to serve their sentences and stay alive the punishments for violence are too savage to be taken lightly murder is a hanging offence funny she said incredulously he sat sideways on the arm of one of the chairs how do you suppose people stay alive in the rookeries without a sense of humour without a rather bitter notion of the ludicrous without wit one could drown in it you wouldnt understand the costermonger the prostitutes the dollyshop owners but if you did youd find them funny sometimes savage giving no quarter and expecting none inventive greedy but often funny as well thats the sort of world they live in the weak and the disloyal die what about the sick the orphaned the old she demanded how can you regard that with humour they die just as they often do even at your end of society he replied their deaths are different thats all but what happens to a divorced woman in your world or one who has an illegitimate child or a woman whose husband dies or cant meet the bills hes politely driven to ruin and often suicide as far as youre concerned he or she is ruined from the day of their disgrace you no longer see them in the street you no longer call on them in the afternoons there is no possibility of work of marriage for the daughters no credit with tradesmen its a different kind of death but we usually see the end of it all the same there was nothing to say to him she would like to have hated him to have denied it all or justified it but she knew inside her it was true little bits of memory returned people whose names were not to be mentioned anymore people one suddenly did not see again he put his hand out and touched her arm gently she could feel the warmth of him im sorry charlotte i had no right to say that as if it were your fault as if you were part of it willingly or consciously that doesnt alter it though does it she said bleakly no tell me about some of the things that are funny i think i need to know he leaned back taking his hand away she felt a coldness from the move she would have expected to find his touch offensive it surprised her that she did not he smiled a little wryly you met willie at the police station involuntarily she smiled also she recalled the thin face the friendly mixture of interest and contempt for her ignorance yes yes i imagine he could tell a few colourful stories hundreds some of them even true i remember one he told me about a costermonger family and a long and picturesque revenge against a shofulman a what a passer of forged money and bellei was going to say you would like belle but shes a prostitute i might still be capable of liking her charlotte replied then wondered if she had committed herself too rashly perhaps his face softened in amusement belle came from bournemouth her parents were respectable but extremely poor in service in a middleclass house belle was seducedi understand with more force than charmby the son of the house and as a result turned out she was henceforth marked as soiled naturally it was never considered that he should marry her she came to london and discovered she was pregnant to begin with she worked as a seamstress sewing shirtscollars and wristbands stitched six buttonholes four rows of stitching down the front for two and a half pence each do you sew charlotte do you know how long it takes to make a shirt do you do household accounts do you know what two and a half pence will buy she tried the workhouse but was turned away because she did not have an official admittance order at that point she was propositioned by a gentleman not old enough to be rich enough to make an advantageous marriage but with plenty of natural appetite it earned her enough to feed her child and buy him a blanket to sleep in and it opened a whole new world to her she wrote to her parents every week she still does and sends them money they think she earns it dressmaking and what good would it serve to let them discover otherwise they dont know what dressmakers earn in london she found a landlord who protected her but then he started taking more and more of her money but this time she had friendsof many sorts not just customers shes a handsome girl shrewd but not unkind and ive seldom seen her when she couldnt smile about something what did she do charlotte cared she had a steady lover who was a screever a writer of letters a forger of certificates false testimonials and so forth he had an uncle who was a kidsman he organized all his little proteges to plague the landlord every time he went out of the door his watch was stolen his seals his money but worse than that they jeered at him pinned notes to him and made him a laughingstock if he was robbed why didnt he call the police she felt compelled to ask especially if he saw who did it and it continued oh he did thats how i came to know of it you arrested them she was horrified and angry he smiled at her meeting her eyes squarely unfortunately i had a stiff leg that day and i was unable to run fast enough to catch any of them sergeant flack got something in his eye was obliged to stop and get it out and by the time he could see again they had gone she felt a wave of relief and belle she got a reasonable rent and kept the rest of the earnings and did she continueasas a prostitute what else go back to stitching shirts at two and a half pence each no of course not i suppose it was a silly question it makes me realize a little how lucky i am to be born as i was i always used to think it was unjust that saying about the sins of the fathers being visited on the children to the third and fourth generations but it isnt is it its just a fact of life we reap what our parents have sown she looked up and found pitts eyes on her the softness in them embarrassed her and she turned away what about the hangman do you think hecant help it i think its possible he doesnt even entirely know it which is perhaps why even those closest to him dont know it either he answered the black tie came back to her mind with cold horror for a while she had forgotten it forgotten pitt as a threat and thought of him only asno that was ridiculous she stood up a little stiffly thank you for coming to tell me about lord ashworth it was extremely courteous of you and has set my mind at rest at least from the worst fear he stood up also accepting the dismissal but there was disappointment in his face she was sorry for it he did not deserve it but she was too afraid of him to let him stay he had an ability to anticipate her to understand her thoughts too well his quick sympathy his intelligence would lead her into betraying herself and dominic he was still looking at her damn him oh god had she dismissed him so hastily he sensed her fear had she dismissed him so soon after their mention of the hangman and his possible ignorance of his own actions that he guessed she knew something she must make amends im sorry mr pitt i did not mean to appear rude i have not even offered you any refreshment she forced herself to meet his eyes she smiled her face stiff she must look ghastly may i ring for something for you no thank you he walked to the door then turned frowning a little charlotte what are you afraid of she drew a deep breath her throat tight a moment passed before she could make any sound come why the hangman of course isnt everyone yes he said quietly possibly even the hangman himself the room swung round her an earthquake must feel like this it was ridiculous she must not faint dominic might be weak give way to his appetites but then one must accept that all gentlemen were like that but dominic could have had nothing to do with murder wires round choking white necks in the street she must have been insane weak and treacherous to have let such suspicions come into her mind yes charlotte agreed i imagine so but you must catch him all the same for everyones sake she deliberately put a lift into her voice a positive sound as if it were all only peripherally to do with her a social concern and not a personal one his mouth curled a little at the corner and with a tiny gesture like a bow he turned and went out of the room she heard maddock opening and closing the front door for him her knees gave way and she collapsed onto the sofa tears running down her face when dominic returned in the evening she could not meet his eyes sarah also sat through dinner in silence emily was out with george ashworth and a group of his friends grandmama delivered a monologue on the decline of social manners edward and caroline maintained the rudiments of a conversation that no one else listened to afterwards sarah said a little stiffly that she had a headache and retired to bed mama accompanied grandmama up to her sitting room to read to her for an hour or so and papa went into the study to smoke and write some letters dominic and charlotte were left alone in the withdrawing room it was a situation charlotte had dreaded and yet it was almost a relief to face it the reality might not be as bad as her fears had become she waited for a few minutes after the others had gone then she looked up afraid that if she did not speak soon he might also leave dominic he turned to face her she was alone with him she had his entire attention the dark eyes were fully on her a little worried it should have turned her heart over but all she could think of was lily mitchell and sarah upstairs unhappy over a trifle when there was so much more sarah did not even guessor did she and pitt she could see pitts face in her mind the light probing eyes that made her feel so close she shook herself hard the thought was ridiculous yes dominic prompted she had never been gifted with tact never been able to approach things obliquely mama would have been so much better at this did you like lily she asked his face puckered in surprise the maid lily lily mitchell yes did i like her he repeated incredulously yes did you please answer me honestly it matters it did matter although she was not sure what she wanted the answer to be the thought that he had cared for her was sharply painful and yet the thought that he had used her without caring was worse it was shabbier dirtier wider in its meaning there was a faint colour in his face yes i liked her well enough she was a funny little thing used to talk about the country where she grew up why do you want to do something about her she was an orphan you know actually illegitimate i think theres no family to speak of no i wasnt thinking of doing anything she said a little sharply she had not known lily was an orphan she had lived in the same house with her all those years and for all the interest she had shown lily might as well not have existed was dominic really any worse i wanted to know because of you me was she mistaken or had the colour deepened in his face yes there was no point in lying in trying to be evasive he was staring at her why on earth should she want so much to touch him now to reassure herself he was still the same person the dominic she had loved all her womanhood or was she feeling something like pity i dont understand you he said slowly she met his eyes with an honesty she could not have imagined a month ago for the first time she looked deep into him without fluttering heart or beating pulse she looked at the person and forgot the man the beauty the excitement yes you do millie brought me the necktie she found at the back of the bed when she turned the mattress it was yours it seemed not to occur to him to lie the colour came to his face painfully now but he did not look away yes i liked her she was veryuncomplicated sarah can be desperately stuffy sometimes so can you she said brutally and to her own surprise a new angry thought occurred to her and as soon as it was in her head it too was on her tongue how would you feel if sarah went and made love to maddock his face dropped in amazement dont be ridiculous whats ridiculous about it she asked coolly you lay with the maid didnt you lily wasnt even a butler just a maid sarah wouldnt dream of such a thing she isnt a trollop its extraordinary and degrading of you to have said it even in fun the last thing i intended was to be funny why are you insulted that i should speak of it hypothetically for sarah and yet you can admit it of yourself without any shame at all youre not ashamed are you the colour came back again to his face and for the first time he looked away from her im not very proud of it because of sarah or because lilys dead why was she suddenly seeing him with such clarity it was painful like morning light on the skin showing all the flaws you dont understand he said exasperatedly when youre married you will understand what that he stood up that menmen sometimes go he stopped unable to finish it delicately she finished it for him that you have one set of rules for yourselves and another for us she said tartly her throat hurt as if she wanted to cry you demand perfect loyalty from us but feel free to give your own love wherever you like its not love he exploded for gods sake charlotte what its appetite license you dont understand then explain it to me dont be naive you are not a man if you were married you would perhaps understand that men are different you cant apply womens feelings womens rules to a man i can apply rules of loyalty and honour to anybody he was angry now this has nothing to do with loyalty or honour i love sarah at least god help me i did until shesuddenly his face was whiteuntil she started to think i could be the hangman he was staring at her and she could see helplessness and pain in his eyes she stood up also and without thinking she put her hand out to touch him catching his hand he clung to it charlotte she does she clearly said so she believed emily she said quietly and perhaps she knew about lily as well but for gods sake thats hardly the same as murdering four helpless girls and leaving their bodies in the street if she knew about lily and believes something about me then you have hurt her perhaps she merely wanted to hurt you back but thats preposterous she cant be so hurtthat he stared at her she looked back gravely i would be if id given you all my love my heart and body and been loyal to you and thought of no one else i would be hurt beyond anything i could imagine if i knew you had slept with my maid and if i thought you had courted my sister i might hurt you as deeply as i could if you could betray me that way murder might not seem so very much worse charlotte his voice cracked a little and went higher charlotte you cant think that oh please heaven i mean i didnti never hurt anyone he grabbed at her hand again holding it so tightly he crushed her fingers she did not pull away except sarah and perhaps lily did she love you too or are maids allowed to have appetites like men charlotte for gods sake dont be sarcastic help me i dont know how to she gave him for a moment an answering pressure of her own hand i cant make sarah feel differently i cant take back whatever she said or make you forget she said it he stood still for a long time close to her looking at her eyes her face no he said at last he closed his eyes and dear god he said very softly you cant make me absolutely sure i didnt do it that damnable policeman of yours said this man could be unaware himself of what hes doing that means it could be me i could be doing this and not know it i saw your father in the street no one else seems to have realized yet that that means i was also there and i knew all four of the girlsand was out when each one of them was killed she could think of only one thing to say that would be of any comfort and still be true if pitt thought you could have done it he would have been back here questioning you he wouldnt exclude you just because youre a gentleman do you think he really has any idea he said eagerly it was painfully clear how much he wanted to believe her and how hard it was for him i know you dont like him but do you think you could deceive him for long his mouth turned down in selfmockery i dont think i really dislike him i think im afraid of him because you think hes clever yes he sighed thank you charlotte yes i suppose pitt has looked at us closely enough perhaps if it were one of us he would be closing in now you dont think he is do you the sharp fear was back again this time she lied as if to protect a child no he let out his breath again and sat down how can sarah think i could have done it surely anyone who knew me at all you said she loves me how could you love anyone and think that of him because being in love with someone is not the same as knowing them she said hearing her words harshly and clearly in her head would they mean as much to him as they did now to her she doesnt really love me he said slowly or she would not have thought it you thought it of yourself thats different i know myself but i never thought ill of her not in any way then you dont know her any more than she knows you charlotte meant it although she was discovering her thoughts even as she spoke them what do you mean we all have faultssarah too if you expect her to be perfect that is a wrong youre doing her that is as great as the wrong she is doing you i dont understand you charlotte he frowned sometimes i think you dont know what youre saying no she agreed it hurt because she realized he really did not understand no i thought you might not she made up her mind quickly from a deep feeling im going up to see if sarah is all right sarah he was surprised she went to the door and turned yes he was looking at her with a pucker between his brows she ached inside all down her throat and in her stomach she wanted to put her arms round him to comfort away the fear she knew was in him but her love for him was quite different it was no longer mysterious romantic bloodquickening she felt older than he and stronger charlotte she knew what he wanted to say he wanted to say help me and he did not know how she smiled im not going to tell her anything and every man near cater street who has thought at all must have the same fears as you do he let out his breath and tried to smile thank you charlotte good night good night upstairs she found sarah sitting in her bed staring at the wall a book lying open face down on the covers how are you charlotte asked what do you want sarah looked at her coolly can i get anything for you a hot drink no thank you whats the matter wont dominic talk to you there was a bitter edge to sarahs voice and charlotte thought she was near tears she sat down on the edge of the bed yes he talked to me for quite a while oh sarah affected disinterest about what the hangman how gruesome it will make you dream charlotte put out her hand and took sarahs sarah you shouldnt let him think you suspect him has he been complaining to you crying on your shoulder its easy to see what youre thinking sarah she held onto her more tightly as sarah tried to pull away even if you think so cant you have the kindness or the sense not to let him know it if he were guilty there would be time enough to know it when it couldnt be denied if hes innocent and you suspect him wrongly youll have built a gap between you that will be difficult to bridge later the tears brimmed over sarahs eyes i dont suspect him she said gulping not really it just crossed my mind for a moment is that so hard to understand i couldnt help it hes been out so much lately he hardly takes notice of me anymore is he in love with you charlotte tell me honestly i think i would rather know now no charlotte shook her head with a smile i used to be in love with him which is what emily meant but he never even saw me the tears were running down sarahs face oh charlotte im sorry i didnt know i didnt want you to charlotte made herself smile her own feelings were suddenly very clear she was desperately painfully sorry for sarah because sarah had wounded dominic and irreparably hurt herself and even now sarah did not understand how or seem able to undo it sarah was staring at her pity showing through the tears oh its all right charlotte said easily im not in love with him anymore i like him very much but im not in love sarah smiled and sniffed your wretched policeman charlotte was shocked good heavens no sarahs smile widened charlotte leaned forward a little more than anything on earth she wanted to help and protect sarah to take things back to the way they used to be sarah tell dominic you dont suspect him really that it was just a momentary thought of how awful it would be even lie if you have to but dont let him go on thinking he wont come to me then go to him no sarah shook her head sarah i cant there was nothing else charlotte could say silently she touched sarahs hair pushing a strand out of her eyes then stood up and walked away slowly she was too tired too shaken with the upheaval in her life to feel anything more tonight tomorrow the fear and the pity would all come back chapter eleven sarah thought about the things that charlotte had said but she could not bring herself to go to dominic he had been so cold lately so unapproachable she was afraid of another rebuff and if he really were hurt he could so easily come to her or was there something more than hurt could it be quite a different guilt he felt she remembered small smug looks on lilys face and laughter at the time she had refused to understand although half her mind knew women too well for complete ignorance she had thought it was all over and for her own peace of mind had learned to forget it now it was resurrected in all its ugly embarrassment was it lilys death that had reminded him but if he were to ask even once she would immediately tell him in such a way that he could not help believing her that she had not really thought him capable of murder it had been only a passing absurd fear which reason had dismissed as soon as she recognized it but he did not come and she did not speak of it to him one thing it had altered was the way sarah felt about charlotte her admission explained so many things now she understood why charlotte had had so little interest in all the eligible young men mama had contrived to introduce to her in the new light of knowledge she remembered odd little incidents words looks tempers and unexplained tears she could not comprehend how charlotte had kept it from herfor her complete insensitivity if not merely for marrying dominic how could she have been so blind she had taken her own happiness for granted and never stopped to think of charlotte emily had seen it and in a moment of anger betrayed it that was hard to forgive at least that part was over now charlotte had fallen out of love again could she possibly be attracted to that fearful policeman surely not but if anyone were capable of such a social lunacy it would be charlotte well time to worry about that if it actually happened no doubt papa would sort it out quickly enough although he did not seem to be doing much about emily and that dandy ashworth she would have to remind him or emily might not only be hurt but ruined as well at the moment sarah was tempted to think it would serve emily right for her betrayal of charlotte but perhaps fortune would hurt her quite enough without any hand from her family it was two days later when she was visiting martha prebble on some parish business that mrs attwood the invalid woman whom papa had been visiting on the night lily was killed was mentioned poor soul martha said with a slight sigh she really is a trial sarah recalled what papa had said i hear she is prone to exaggerating rather a lot and gets memory confused with imagination a little wishful thinking perhaps martha raised her eyebrows i didnt know that when i saw her she just talked unceasingly and always of past glories although i must confess i didnt trouble to listen closely enough to judge whether they were true or not i imagine the poor creature is merely lonely does no one visit her sarah asked feeling a quick pang of pity and at the same time a reluctance to do it herself not many people im afraid as i said she is more than a little trying i believe she is an invalid restricted to the house sarah felt obliged to pursue it she would feel guilty if the woman were in need and she had ignored herespecially if in the past her husband had really done papa some favour oh no martha was quite firm she suffers nothing more than the usual small ailments of age not bedridden sarah frowned could she have misunderstood papa she tried to remember exactly what he had said and could not oh no not at all but im sure she would be most grateful if you visited her just to talk a little while is she in any need i mean financially sarah would rather have given practical help than her time my dear sarah how very generous you are it is so like you to want to help not to spare yourself but to think only of others needs but she is not poor i assure you except in spirit she needs friends she said hesitatingly her hands tightening on sarahs shoulders and a little warmth her voice was suddenly husky as though she were labouring under some strong emotion for an instant sarah was embarrassed then she recalled the icy righteousness of the vicar and tried to put herself in marthas place oddly enough dominics recent coldness helped her she answered marthas grip by reaching out and touching her in return of course she said quietly we all do i shall call on her this afternoon i cannot take her anything this time i will just visit socially while i have the opportunity of using the carriage but i will call another time perhaps with charlotte or mama and take her something just as a token martha was staring at her her eyes fixed do you not think that is a good idea sarah asked looking back at the pale face should i not go until i have been introduced do you think marthas eyes cleared of course she said catching her breath you should go yes go today mrs prebble are you all right sarah now felt anxious for her she looked very strained a little overwrought had sarah said something to distress her or was it the sudden recollection of her own emotionally barren life sarah put her hands over marthas and gripped them hard then as she felt the older womans muscles tense she leaned forward and kissed her gently on the cheek and moved to the door i shall tell you asked kindly after her im sure she will appreciate it you do so much for so many people there can hardly be a house in the parish that doesnt think of you with kindness and before martha could fumble for a reply to this she excused herself and took her departure sarah did not know precisely what she had expected but the woman who finally opened the door to her was such a surprise to her she could only stand and stare yes the woman raised her eyebrows enquiringly sarah swallowed and recollected herself my name is sarah corde i have not had the pleasure of meeting you before but mrs prebble spoke so well of you i decided if it would not be inconvenient to you i would like to make your acquaintance the womans face lightened immediately she was a handsome creature and perhaps twentyfive years ago she might well have been beautiful the remnants of beauty were still there in the bones and the elegant sweep of hair faded but not yet thinning there seemed nothing even remotely pathetic about her and if she was lonely it was not obvious please come in she invited standing back so sarah could accept the invitation the sitting room was small and furnished with unusual simplicity but sarah had the impression that it was a matter of taste rather than poverty she found the effect surprisingly pleasing it was more restful than the usually crowded rooms she was accustomed to with dozens of photographs and paintings stuffed birds dried flower arrangements embroidery samplers and ornaments and furniture in almost every available space this seemed much lighter much less oppressive thank you she sat down in the offered chair she was profoundly glad now that she had brought no gift of food it would have seemed redundant here perhaps even offensive it was kind of mrs prebble to speak well of me the woman said im afraid i dont know her as well as i might i find church functions she stopped obviously recollecting that sarah probably attended them and revising what she had been going to say sarah found herself smiling tedious she filled in for her the womans face relaxed thank you so much for your frankness yes im afraid so she does a great deal of good work but she must be a saint to persevere through all those endless idle conversations and the gossip and my dear it isnt even interesting gossip is gossip ever interesting except to those who are spreading it of course some gossip has great wit and of course some carries the burden of genuine scandal or it used to i havent heard a good scandal for years but then hardly anyone ever comes to see me these days i have grown respectable what a fearful epitaph sarahs curiosity was mounting who precisely was this woman so far she appeared nothing at all like the pathetic and wandering creature papa had described on the contrary she was entertaining and very much in command of herself isnt an epitaph a little premature sarah asked with a smile you are not dead yet i might as well be sitting here in a room in cater street watching the world pass by outside and ive no one to listen to me even if i were able to make witty remarks its a terrible thing my dear to have wit and no one on whom to exercise it may i offer you some refreshment a dish of tea perhaps i have no maid as you will have observed but i can easily enough prepare it myself if you will excuse me oh no please sarah put out a hand as if to restrain her i have just taken tea with mrs prebble that was a lie but she did not want to disturb her unless of course you wish it for yourself in which case let me make it and bring it to you good heavens child you are anxious for good works very well it would be most charming to be waited upon you will find everything in the kitchen if there is anything you cannot put your hand on pray ask me fifteen minutes later sarah returned with a large tray and tea set for two she poured it herself and they resumed their conversation how long have you lived in cater street she asked the woman smiled ever since my husband died and dear edward found me this place she answered edward is he your son the womans graceful eyebrows arched in amused surprise good heavens no he was my lover a long time ago now over twentyfive years i was forty then and he was in his thirties you didnt marry him she gave a rich laugh of course i didnt marry him he was already married with a very handsome wife so i heard and one daughter my dear whats the matter you look pale did you swallow something amiss sarah was stunned an unspeakable thought had entered her mind she stared at the womans face trying to see her as she must have been twentyfive years ago was that why papa had really been here was that why he had lied at first saying he had been at his club all evening until dominic had given him away was that why he had refused to give pitt either the womans name or her address the more she sought to evade the conclusion the more inescapably it entrenched itself in her mind she heard her voice asking as if willed from outside herself i suppose it was a sort of parting gift to make sure you were all right how very romantic the woman smiled a grand goodbye all hidden tears and momentoes to be kept forever in tissue and ribbons he isnt dead my dear nor did he emigrate in fact hes perfectly well and we remain moderately good friends as far as discretion and the alterations of time will allow nothing as romantic as you imagine merely an affair that became a friendship and then little more than an acquaintance with pleasant memories then he must live near here sarah was compelled to continue hoping that even now something would disprove her fear every new fact was a chance to discover one that would not fit papa the woman smiled her eyes bright with humour indeed she agreed so perhaps it would be indiscreet of me to tell you anything more about him he could be someone you know yes i suppose sarah was answering mechanically her conversation became stilted but her mind was in chaos trying to find a way through the fragments of all sorts of beliefs about papa about dominic did mama know had she always known and been prepared to turn a blind eye to it did she even mind or was it one of the things she had been brought up to expect to accept as part of the nature of man but men in general were quite different from ones own papaor husband sarah did not and could not accept it she had never even entertained thoughts of any man other than dominic and her concept of love did not permit that she might love incorporated fidelity one gave promises and one kept them one might occasionally be selfish unreasonable or illtempered one might be untidy or extravagant but one did not lie either in word or deed she stayed a little longer talking with the woman although she had no idea what she saidpolite nonsense stock phrases that everyone said and no one listened to then she took her leave and stepped into the carriage to return home caroline sat alone in her bedroom sarah had just left and closed the door behind her she felt numb her mind refusing to move stuck fast on the one thought repeating it over and over as if use would make it easier to bear edward had been having an affair with another woman and for twentyfive years he had retained her acquaintance still visiting her even now was it love the embers of past romance or some kind of debt that could not be shaken off even pity poor sarah sarah had come to her for guidance assurance that she was not alone and peculiarly betrayed and caroline had been able to give her none sarah had been confused too shocked herself to understand what she was doing and to realize that caroline had known nothing about it sarah had broken a thirtyyear peace in thirty minutes caroline stared at herself in the mirror it was not even a matter of growing old this other woman was older what had edward seen in her that caroline had lacked beauty warmth wit sophistication or was it just love love without reason why had he left his mistress to avoid scandal the children could it even have been anything as mundane as finance she would never know because she would never know whether whatever he said was the truth and that raised the other question was she going to tell him she knew there could be little purpose now on the other hand could she conceal it she could not possibly feel the same way about him the years had brought familiarity a certain contempt for patterns of life the habit of overlooking small failings and weaknesses but there had always been a trust a knowledge that the bad things were superficial her mind kept going back to the woman what kind of a woman was she had she loved edward committed any lasting part of herself to him or was it an affair something to be set against profit and loss so much social prestige so much money or security so much fun what was it she gave him that caroline could not she tried to think back to the way she had felt in those first years sarah must have been a small child charlotte newly born emily not yet thought of was that it had she been too involved with the children had she ignored him surely not she thought she could remember many hours spent together long evenings at home nights out at dinners parties even concerts or were they later time was confused telescoping had he loved that other woman or was she a diversion something to fill a need an appetite was all the past a lie the thought that he had loved mrs attwood was appalling something that hurt profoundly altering years of feelings shattering peace destroying anything of tenderness or trust even if it had been appetite was that any better she shivered suddenly she felt unclean as if something soiled had entered her and she could not wash it out the memory of his touch of their familiarity became offensive something she wanted to forget because she could not undo it she stood up tidying her hair automatically and pulling her dress straight she must go downstairs and present a face to the family that masked at least some of the misery and the confusion inside her grandmama knew there was something wrong with both sarah and caroline at first she presumed they had had a quarrel of some sort and naturally she wanted to know what it was about sarah was in the rear sitting room the following morning and grandmama went in ostensibly to enquire about the arrangements for afternoon tea and what visitors they might expect but actually to learn the facts of the quarrel good morning sarah my dear she said purposefully good morning grandmama sarah replied not looking up from the letter she was writing you look a little pale didnt you sleep grandmama pursued sitting down on the sofa yes thank you are you sure you seem a little agitated to me im perfectly all right thank you dont distress yourself on my account grandmama seized on the suggestion immediately but i am distressed my dear i cannot help worrying about you when i see both you and your mama looking tired and upset if you have had some sort of disagreement perhaps i can help to see that it is sorted out if sarah had been charlotte she would have said bluntly that grandmama was more likely to add fuel to it than sort it out but being sarah she remained at least nominally polite there is no quarrel grandmama we are very close she smiled with unconcealed bitterness in fact we are fellows in misfortune misfortune what misfortune is that i didnt know anything had happened you wouldnt it happened twentyfive years ago what on earth do you mean grandmama demanded what happened twentyfive years ago sarah retreated nothing that need concern you it is all over now if it still distresses you and your mother it is not all over grandmama said sharply what has happened sarah men sarah replied life perhaps it even happened to you once she gave a tight little smile i shouldnt be surprised i shouldnt be surprised at all what are you talking about what about men they are shallow disloyal and hypocritical sarah said furiously they preach one thing and practice quite another they have one set of rules for us and another for themselves some men do of course that has always been the case but not all there are upright and decent men as well your father is one of them im sorry if your husband is not papa sarah spat you old fool hes the worst of them all dominic may have cast his eyes where he shouldnt but he never set up a mistress and kept her for twentyfive years the words had no meaning for grandmama they were a preposterous lie sarah must be out of her mind temporarily deranged by the shock of discovering dominic had behaved badly of course marrying a man as handsome as that was bound to lead to disaster she knew it from the beginning she had said as much to caroline but of course caroline never would be told nonsense she said crossly that is a childish thing to say and quite ridiculous i will excuse you this once on account of the obvious disturbance you have suffered in your mind on discovering things about your husband which i could have told you in the beginning indeed i did tell your mother but if you repeat such a wicked calumny about your father outside this room or in the presence of others i shall she hesitated not quite sure what might be sufficiently awful to threaten sarah with you will do what sarah said harshly prove it untrue you cant if you have a spare afternoon i shall take you to meet her shes old older than papa but still very handsome she must have been quite a beauty sarah this is not in the least amusing i order you to control yourself immediately if you cannot then go upstairs and lie down until you can take some smelling salts and wash your face in cold water cold water papa is keeping a mistress and you suggest i cure that by washing my face in cold water sarahs voice rose in vicious ridicule did you offer smelling salts to mama as well and is that what you did did grandpapa keep a mistress somewhere old distasteful memories returned sarah you are becoming hysterical grandmama snapped leave the room you are behaving like a servant pull yourself together and remember your dignity you had better lie down until you have come to your senses as sarah did not move she became angrier immediately she raised her voice i shall explain to your mother that you are unwell i have no wish for you to make an exhibition of yourself and i am sure you havent either what if one of the servants were to come in do you wish to become the talk of the servants hall and no doubt the servants halls of the entire street with a look of deep malevolence sarah departed grandmama sat down hard what an appalling morning whatever could have overcome sarah to make such a shocking allegation she must have completely lost control of herself edward had no doubt committed the usual indiscretions but nothing could warrant an accusation of dishonesty to expect a man to behave without fault for thirty years of marriage was asking too much any woman knew that one accepted such things and bore them with fortitude and above all with dignity but to keep a mistress to set up an establishment and provide regular financial assistance was quite a different matter it was unpardonable how dare sarah suggest such a thing whatever she had discovered about dominic to blacken her fathers name in such a way was inexcusable it could not possibly have any foundation could it grandmama was considering the impossibility of edwards behaving in such a manner when charlotte came in she also looked grim and decidedly strained still she was a peculiar girl most impractical and given to unreliable moods possibly she was also disappointed in dominic very foolish her infatuation with dominic she really should have grown out of such childish romances by now whats the matter with you charlotte she demanded surely you havent been listening to sarahs foolish vapourings charlotte turned round sharply grandmama took another breath she is naturally somewhat upset to discover dominic is fallible but she will get over it if you help instead of wilting around like something out of a tragic poem pull yourself together girl and stop being selfish and mama charlotte said bitterly will she pull herself together and get over it as well there is nothing to get over grandmama snapped im surprised that you should be so foolish and so gullible as to believe sarah cant you see she is upset of course shes upset so am i if you are not upset by it i can only presume that your moral standards are different from mine that was really too much grandmama felt outrage rise inside her till she found it hard to catch her breath charlottes insolence was beyond any bounds she could tolerate certainly my standards are different from yours she said acidly i did not fall in love with my sisters husband im perfectly sure you never fell in love at all charlotte said icily i never lost control of myself grandmama said viciously if that is what you mean by falling in love i do not consider an emotional excess any excuse for immoral behaviour and if you had been properly brought up neither would you that was the chance charlotte had been waiting for her face lit with fierce triumph you are hoist with your own petard grandmama if upbringing is to blame what happened to papa how is it that you did not explain to him that one does not betray ones wife and children by keeping a mistress for twentyfive years grandmama felt the blood rush to her face she was dizzy with outrage fearand the fact that her stays were extremely tight how dare you repeat such malicious and irresponsible lies go to your room if it would not be both embarrassing and hurtful to your father i should demand that you apologize to him im sure it would be embarrassing to both of you charlotte said with a cynical smile you would see from his face that he is guilty and then you would be obliged to retract your words and a good many of your ideas nonsense grandmama said icily she would not have edward criticized by this insolent child how dare sarah have spread this slander everywhere it was unforgivable i dare say your father may have indulged in certain tastesgentlemen dobut nothing dishonest or dishonourable as you suggest to talk of betrayal is ridiculous charlottes lip curled with disgust i admired dominic although i never did anything about it never even spoke and i am immoral yet papa keeps a mistress for twentyfive years buys her a house and supports her and he is only behaving as gentlemen do there is nothing dishonourable in it you hyprocrite i know there is one standard for men and another for women but even you cannot stretch it as far as that why should it be unpardonable sin for a woman to betray a man but a mere peccadillo nothing to raise the eyebrows if a man betrays a woman surely a sin is a sin whoever commits it only some may be extended forgiveness because of ignorance or greater weakness is that mans plea greater weakness they are always saying it is we who are the weaker ones or is that only physical are we supposed to be morally stronger dont talk nonsense charlotte but the sting had gone out of her reply she was remembering carolines face at breakfast unless she was very much mistaken there had been the marks of tears carefully powdered over but grandmamas eyes were still perfectly good enough to see through that caroline believed it was it possible had edward kept another woman all these years and what kind of a woman was she she looked at charlottes hard hurt face charlotte saw her waver saw the doubt contempt flickered in her eyes grandmama felt the chill of disillusion trickle through her mind leaving her with the bleak acceptance that there must be at least some truth in this story she had always loved edward clung to the image of his father in him and in some way her own youth and the things that had been good in it she had seen in edward the epitome of all that is fine and admirable in a man the best of his father without the worst now she was obliged to face the fact that she saw him this way because she saw him from a distance had she looked more closely as caroline must she would have seen the flaws then this would not have been such a blow it was not only beliefs about him but beliefs about herself that suffered old values were soiled and there was nothing new to put in their place she felt old and bitterly lonely the world she belonged to had died and the remnant of it in edward had betrayed her she hated charlotte for having exposed her to the truth you are not strong charlotte she said viciously in answer to the question you are hard that is why dominic chose sarah and not you she searched for something that would hurt even more no man will ever love you you are totally unfeminine even that wretched policeman only admires you because he is vulgar and doesnt know the qualities of a lady he imagines that he could better himself through you and of course even if you accepted himit might well be the only offer you getyou would not raise him to your social station he was born common and he will remain common you would sink to his station which may very well be where you belong charlottes face was white youre a vicious and ugly old woman she said quietly i shouldnt be surprised if grandpapa kept a mistress as well to get away from you perhaps she was someone gentle perhaps thats where papa learnt it he may not be so very much to blame thats something ive learned from your vulgar policeman how much our parents make us what we are how they influence not only our education our wealth or poverty our social standing but our beliefs as well when i look at you i realize maybe papa is not as much at fault as i thought and with that she turned and went out the door leaving grandmama gasping for breath her throat tight her stays digging into her like knives she cried out for help hoping instinctively to elicit pity but charlotte had closed the door luncheon was awful it was eaten in almost total silence and afterwards everyone made separate excuses to leave as soon as possible emily said she was going out to the dressmakers and would mama accompany her to prevent her being in the streets alone grandmama gave a vicious look to charlotte and said she was retiring upstairs as she felt profoundly unwell sarah expressed a desire to visit martha prebble a sympathetic and virtuous woman the vicars house might be a little selfconsciously righteous but freedom from carnal thoughts and the sins of the flesh were coming to appeal to her more and more sarah you should not go alone charlotte said quickly do you wish me to come with you it was the last thing she wanted to do but recently she had felt closer to sarah than at any time since dominic had first come to the house and she had been barely more than a child she ached for sarahs sense of loss her disappointment and shock she felt some of it herself because she too had loved dominic but for her the commitment was different and she was amazed at herself for finding it so easy to recover she feared her love had been a great deal shallower than she had imagined a love based not on any knowledge but on her fancy for sarah it was different hers was the loss of intimacy of things shared of fact not dreams sarah was looking at her no thank you she said with the best smile she could manage i know how you dislike the vicar and he may well be home and if he is not i would rather like to talk to martha alone ill come and leave you at the door if you like charlotte pressed dont be ridiculous then you would have to walk back alone i shall be perfectly safe i think perhaps this madman has gone anyway nothing has happened for ages we were probably wrong probably he did come from the slums and has now gone back to them inspector pitt didnt think so charlotte half stood up are you as taken with him as he is with you emily raised her eyebrows he is not infallible you know i shall go straight to the vicars then from door to door on parish work sarah said firmly and i dare say martha will even accompany me i shall be perfectly safe dont fuss i shall see you all this evening goodbye the others departed also and charlotte was left alone with nothing in particular to do she searched quickly for a job to prevent her from allowing her mind to dwell on papa or dominic the hurt that disillusion caused the foolishness of building dreams around peopleand behind it all the dark fear of the hangman because in spite of what sarah and emily had implied she did not think for a moment that he had returned to whatever slum one might delude oneself he came from he was local from cater street or its immediate proximity she knew it in her heart it was twenty minutes to three and she was busy writing a list of letters to distant relations to whom she had owed correspondence for some time and had put off as a chore when maddock came to say that inspector pitt was at the door and wished to see her she felt a quite unreasonable pleasure almost a sense of relief as if he could somehow ameliorate her sense of disillusion and yet she was also afraid of him everyone in the house knew about papas behaviour even though no one spoke of it to more than one other person at a time it was never discussed except as a confidence yet it seemed as if the house itself knew and pitt would only have to come into its walls to know also and if papa were capable of one such betrayal one deceit of twentyfive years what else might he not have kept from them this other life that they knew nothing of might incorporate all sorts of things perhaps even he himself was not fully aware of it that was the monstrous thought that had been at the back of her mind for hours it was out now was it possible for a man to behave in such a way could he have had other mistresses perhaps have made some advances towards the murdered girls and then rather than be exposed have killed them surely not papa what on earth was she thinking she had known papa all her life he had held her on his knee played with her when she was a child she could remember birthdays christmases toys he had given her but all that time he had been intimate with that other woman less than a couple of miles away and poor mama had never known it miss charlotte maddock brought her back to the present again oh yes maddock you had better ask him to come in i suppose do you wish me to bring any refreshment miss certainly not she said a little sharply i doubt he will be here more than a half hour at the most yes maam maddock withdrew and a moment later pitt came in he was as untidy as always and with the usual broad smile good afternoon charlotte he said cheerfully she gave him a frown to indicate she resented the familiarity but it seemed to be entirely wasted on him good afternoon mr pitt is there some further way we can assist you in your enquiries do you feel any nearer success oh yes we have excluded many more that we believed to be possibilities he was still smiling did nothing penetrate the thickness of his skin im glad to hear it tell me do you have a large population to go through he raised his eyebrows something has upset you it was a statement although touched with a note of enquiry several things have upset me but none of them is in any way your concern she replied coolly they are not to do with the hangman if they upset you then it concerns me she turned round to find him looking at her with an expression in his eyes that was unmistakably gentle and something that was more than gentleness she had never seen such a look in any mans face before and it disturbed her profoundly she felt the blood coming to her face and a totally unaccustomed warmth inside her she looked away quickly confused that is courteous of you she said awkwardly but they are family matters and no doubt will sort themselves out in due course are you still worried about emily and george ashworth she had entirely forgotten them but it seemed an obvious escape from the truth and he had offered it to her yes she lied i am concerned that he will hurt her she is not of his social position and he will tire of her presently then she will find her reputation damaged and have nothing to show for it but a deep hurt to her feelings you believe that because his social position is higher than hers he will not consider marrying her he asked it seemed a foolish question she was a little annoyed with him for having asked of course he wont she said tartly men of his situation either marry for family reasons or for money emily has neither do you admire that she turned round sharply of course not it is weak contemptible but that is the way it is then she saw the smile on his face and something else could it conceivably be hope she felt her skin flame it was ridiculous she drew a deep breath and tried hard to control herself he was still staring at her but there was selfmockery in his face now very gently he helped her out of her embarrassment i think you worry about emily too much he observed she is far more practical than you credit ashworth may imagine he is calling the pace but i think it will be emily who will decide whether he marries her or not a wife like emily could be an advantage to a man in his position she is far cleverer than he is for a start and wise enough to hide it sufficiently so that he may suspect it but never be sure enough for it to make him feel in any way less superior she will be right but she will convince him that it was his idea you make her sound extremelyconniving she is he smiled she is in every way opposite from you where you charge headlong emily will outflank and come up behind and you make me sound stupid his smile broadened into a grin not at all you could not win ashworth but then you also have the sense not to want him she relaxed in spite of herself indeed i do not what have you come for mr pitt surely not to talk about ashworth and emily again are you really no nearer the hangman im not sure he said honestly once or twice ive thought we were almost onto him but then we were proved wrong if only we knew why if we just knew why he did it why those girls why not any of a hundred others was it no more than chance but surely she faltered if it were no more than thathow will you ever find him he could be anyone at all i know he held out no false hope no comfort and for that she both praised and blamed him she wanted comfort and yet she wanted honesty as well it seemed she could not have both is there no connecting link no person they all knew who might have we are still looking that is why ive come today i would like to speak to dora if i may and also to mrs dunphy ive heard that dora was friendly with the hiltons maid more friendly than she has told us possibly she denied it out of fear a lot of people hide information because they feel murder is scandalous and even to know anything somehow rubs the scandal onto them guilt by association his mouth turned down at the corners and mrs dunphy she might have held something back she hates scandal im sure all good servants do even more than their masters if such a thing were possible but actually i only want her confirmation it might serve to prevent dora from being evasive again dora might lie to me but if she is anything like most housemaids she will not dare lie to the cook charlotte smiled it was perfectly true then another thought occurred to her was that all he wanted to ask and even if it was would dora or mrs dunphy accidentally betray the anguish in the house at the moment it was a fallacy of selfpreservation of dignity to suppose that the servants did not know the private quarrels and tears above the stairs they had eyes and ears and curiosity someone would have overheard gossip would be discreet even sympathetic but it would be there of course it would never go outside the house loyalty and pride of establishment were fierce but they would know do you wish me to call her in here she asked thinking she would be able to control the situation if she were there to prevent any slips of the tongue she wont lie to me either pitt looked at her eyes narrowed very slightly please dont trouble yourself besides i think she might well be reticent in front of you i dont wish to question her in mrs dunphys presence either only to confirm with mrs dunphy first and then use the information to press dora if she did something you would not approve of she wont say so in front of you but she might tell me alone she wanted to argue to find some reason to be present but she could think of nothing that sounded honest yet she must prevent his learning of papa and the woman she believed he would feel as she did that it was a betrayal a moral dishonesty that one might try to pardon with ones mind but could never forget respect was gone one could not trust again that was foolish pitt was a man and would no doubt feel as other men did that such things were quite ordinary and to be acceptedas long as women did not do the same of course perhaps she was afraid unnecessarily murder was quite a different thing from adultery to men how is your sergeant she asked in an attempt to delay him until she could think of a reason to prevent him from seeing dora alone getting better thank you if he was surprised he did not show it do you have to have another sergeant now she went on yes he smiled you would like him hes quite an entertaining character a little like willie oh the interest she expressed was quite genuine and it was a few minutes respite i see willie as a very uneasy policeman oh dickon was uneasy to begin with but he was obliged to find work very early and naturally found dishonest employment easier to come by he gained an excellent knowledge of the underworld and then after an extremely narrow squeak decided it might be safer to profit from his expertise on the side of the law rather than against it he grinned broadly actually he fell rather seriously in love with a girl socially above him he promised her he would become respectable if she would marry him so far hes kept at it why did he have to go out to work so young she was interested to know as well as still wishing to keep him from the kitchen the memory of willies wry face was clear and in her mind she saw this dickon with the same features his father died at a hanging in fortyseven or fortyeight and his mother was left with five children of which he was the youngest and the other four were girls oh no however did she manage how irresponsible of him to commit a crime that got him hanged she could think only of the poor woman with five children to feed he wasnt hanged pitt corrected her he was killed at a hanging they used to have public hangings then and they were considered quite a sporting event she did not believe him hanging dont be ridiculous what kind of a person would wish to see some wretched creature taken out to a gibbet and hanged she swallowed hard flaring her nose in disgust many kinds he answered seriously it used to be quite a spectacle hundreds of people came to watch and others came to pick their pockets to gamble to sell their muffins and winkles and hot chestnuts in winter and of course the odd dogfight to warm them up the poor crowded into the square while the quality the gentlemen booked rooms in nearby houses with front windows thats obscene she said fiercely its disgusting they let them for very high rents he continued as if she had not spoken unfortunately the excitement of the actual hanging often spilled over into the crowd and fights broke out dickons father was beaten to death in one of these he smiled bleakly at her horror they dont have public hangings anymore now let me speak to dora i dont know whether i shall discover whatever it is you are so afraid of but i must try she swallowed hard again i dont know what you mean ask dora anything you wish theres nothing i am afraid of except the hangman himself and we are all afraid of him but you are afraid that he is someone you know arent you charlotte isnt he isnt he someone we all know she demanded there was no point in lying anymore at least im not afraid its me in some black terrible other side of myself i dont know about but any man who has any imagination at all must have feared just that at least once in the dark hours of the night and youve thought of it for them he finished softly your father dominic george ashworth maddock probably the vicar and the sexton too which one are you afraid for now charlotte she opened her mouth to deny it then realized it was futile instead she simply refused to commit herself pitt touched her hand lightly and went out of the door into the hallway and the kitchen to find dora chapter twelve charlotte went back to her letters since pitt would not question dora in her presence she did not know whether he intended to speak to her again before leaving or whether he would tell her what dora had told him if it were of any value for the first fifteen minutes she could only think of what might be said in the kitchenwhether pitt would ask about anything other than the hiltons maid or whether even by accident he might stumble on the knowledge of papa and the woman in cater street when she finally settled to writing the letters were scrappy and she feared full of repetition and irrelevancies but even so better than letting her mind dwell on the kitchen by four oclock it was darkening outside with fog swirling up from the river and already hanging in haze round the gas lamps in the street mama and emily returned a few minutes later cold and dissatisfied with the dress they requested tea immediately and asked if sarah were home yet no charlotte replied with a slight frown inspector pitt was here earlier im not even sure if he has gone now mama looked up agitatedly why was he here she asked with an edge to her voice was she harbouring the same fear as charlotte that somehow he would find out about papa and the woman charlotte did not wish to ask in case her mother had not even thought of it something to do with dora knowing the hiltons maid and not having said so before she replied why should dora lie emily enquired putting down her cup still untouched too hot to drink there could be nothing wrong in it if she had fear i suppose charlotte answered her scandal and all that didnt want to be mixed up with the police easier just to deny it perhaps she didnt know her and pitt is wrong emily suggested it hardly matters anyway you know its quite dark outside surely sarah cant still be trailing around with martha prebble on parish work at this hour caroline stood up and went to the window there was nothing to see but opaque fog and darkness if she is i shall speak to her very sharply when she returns unless someone has been taken ill there is no need whatsoever to be out as late as this and on such a wretched night we shall have to send maddock to bring her back she cannot possibly travel alone in this i dare say the vicar will accompany her emily observed calmly i dont care for him any more than charlotte does she looked sideways at her sister but he is not so completely without manners or breeding as to let sarah walk home alone after dark no of course not caroline came away from the window and sat down making a determined effort to control herself i am just being foolish i dont know why i should be afraid we know where she is and no doubt she is doing excellent work neither death nor birth unfortunately restricts itself to convenient weather or times of the day and illness certainly doesnt i heard old mrs petheridge was very unwell perhaps sarah is sitting with her yes possibly charlotte agreed quickly she tried to think of some other topic of conversation sufficiently interesting to hold their attention do you think sir nigel will marry miss decker she has certainly tried hard enough probably emily said drily he is a very silly creature they managed to keep the conversation alive for another hour interspersed with small jobs till edward returned a few moments after five wheres sarah he asked immediately with the vicar and mrs prebble caroline replied glancing instinctively towards the window at this hour edward raised his eyebrows has there been some emergency they can hardly be doing ordinary parish work in the dark have you any idea what kind of an evening it is of course i have caroline said sharply i have been out in it myself and i have eyes to look at it even from here yes my dear im sorry edward said gently it was a foolish question i am a little concerned about sarah she is putting far too much time into this work i am all for charity but it is requiring too much of her at the moment she will wear herself out and on a night like this she could very well catch a chill he had said nothing about the hangman only about a chill from the fog and charlotte felt a sudden rush of warmth towards him for it perhaps the woman was an indiscretion he regretted and had been unable to cast off she stood up and kissed him quickly on the cheek and he was too surprised to respond she turned at the door and caught his eye could it even be gratitude she saw there she was going to the kitchen to find out what dora had told pitt im going to see if dinner is progressing satisfactorily she announced i dont imagine dora is upset but i had as well make sure why would dora be upset she heard edward ask as she closed the door it appeared the questioning of dora had elicited very little other than the details of her friendship with the hiltons maid and she returned to the withdrawing room perfectly satisfied it was twenty minutes to six when the door from the hall opened and pitt stood grayfaced on the threshold maddock was nowhere to be seen edward turned and then when he saw who it was half rose he was about to require some explanation for pitts coming unannounced when he saw the mans face more closely it was always a mirror of his feelings and now it showed shock and distress beyond anything they had seen before his eyes flickered just once to charlotte and then back to edward again for gods sake man what is it edward stood up are you ill he must be to look so dreadful pitt struggled forwards and seemed unable to find them charlotte felt a bitter coldness inside her sarah she said quietly its sarah isnt it pitt nodded he shut his eyes im sorry edward did not seem to understand what about sarah whats wrong with her has there been an accident he teetered a little on his feet charlotte stood up and went to him putting her arm in his and holding on to him hard she faced pitt her heart choking in her throat pins and needles already numbing her fingers and creeping up her arms she knew before she spoke what the answer must be the hangman she asked she did not want to know if sarah too had been molested it was unbearable yes his face was wracked with misery and guilt it cant be edward said shaking his head a little uncomprehending unable to believe why sarah why should anyone want to hurt sarah his voice wavered and he struggled to continue she was so he stopped tears running down his face behind them emily moved to sit with caroline putting her arms round her clinging hiding her face caroline wept deeply and agonizingly shaking with her grief i dont know pitt answered god i dont know is there anything to do charlotte asked huskily the pins and needles were up to her elbows and pitts face seemed to swim far away no he shook his head wheres maddock im afraid hewasnt well he took it very hard i sent him to fetch some brandy and smelling salts in case he trailed off not knowing what else to say charlotte gripped her father even harder papa you had better sit down there isnt anything to do there will be things tomorrow but tonight its all finished edward backed obediently towards his chair and his legs seemed to buckle underneath him a moment later maddock came in with a tray the brandy decanter and glasses he looked at the ground without speaking emily and caroline did not see him and he put the smelling salts on the table awkwardly he was leaving again when charlotte spoke maddock you had better cancel dinner and ask mrs dunphy to prepare something cold for about eight oclock if you please he gave her a look of incredulity and she knew he found her inexplicably cold as if she did not care she could not explain to him that she cared abominably so much that she could not bear to think of it that doing something practical concerning herself with the grief of others was more bearable than thinking of her own she turned from maddock to pitt and saw again in him the tenderness that had so embarrassed her before but this time it was like warmth and sweetness enveloping her she knew he understood what she was doing and why she looked away quickly tears choking her it was far harder to bear than misunderstanding there was nothing to fight against thank you inspector pitt she tried to keep the wavering in her voice from obliterating her words perhaps if you would ask whatever questions you have tomorrow there is little we can tell you tonight except that sarah left in the early afternoon to visit mrs prebble and we presumed to do some parish visiting afterwards if you ask mrs prebble no doubt she will be able to tell you what time she found herself unable to finish suddenly they were not talking about facts but about sarah she could see her clearly in her mind she forced the picture out she wanted him to leave before she lost control tomorrow we shall be better able to answer any other questions of course he agreed quickly it would be better for me to speak to the vicar and mrs prebble now anyway he turned to edward again he seemed unable to look at caroline imim sorry he stammered edward rose to the occasion of course he said im sure you have done everything anyone could sane men are at a loss in the face of madness thank you for coming in person to tell us good night inspector there was nothing to say in the silence after pitt left there were no questions except the one that could not be answered why sarah it was a long time before anyone moved and then it was edward who went to the kitchen to tell the servants formally emily took caroline upstairs supper was a cold plate served in the withdrawing room all except caroline forced themselves to eat something at nine oclock edward sent charlotte and emily upstairs to bed and waited alone to tell dominic whenever he might return charlotte went gratefully her control was slipping away from her quickly as the evening dragged on she was suddenly very tired and the effort of stopping the tears was becoming too much in her room she undressed hung up her clothes washed her face in hot water then cold took her hair down and brushed it then climbed into bed and at last cried with all her heart until she had no more strength left the following morning was bleak and cold charlotte woke up and for a few minutes everything was as always but then memory returned sarah was dead she had to say it over several times it was a little like the morning after sarahs marriage then too a lifelong relationship had gone sarah was no longer her sister but dominics wife she could look back on all the years of her childhood it was sarah who had first showed her how to button her own shoes sarah with whom she had played at dolls sarahs clothes she had grown into sarah who had taught her to read sarah in whom she had confided her first admirations and heartaches something had gone from her life when sarah had married and was no longer especially hers but that was a natural part of growing up she had always known it would happen one day this was different it was not natural it was monstrous and this time there was no envy in it only wrenching unbearable loss had sarah known had she seen the face of her murderer had she felt the choking hearttearing fear please god let it have been quick there was no point in lying here thinking better to get up find something practical to do it would be worse for mama there was something terrible beyond understanding to lose a child a person to whom you have given life from your own body downstairs everyone else was also up and dressed searching for something to do breakfast was almost silent dominic looked white and his eyes did not meet anyone elses charlotte watched him for a little while then afraid that he would notice she looked down at her toast the mere mechanics of eating became exaggerated something to do to occupy ones mind where had dominic been last night was it fair to wonder if sarah would not have gone out if he had been at home or if she had expected him or had the hangman wanted her and if not yesterday then some other time was he some lunatic from the fogbound slums driven mad by filth and poverty till all he could think of was to kill or was he someone from cater street who knew them all who watched and waited for his chance who followed perhaps even spoke to them walked with them and then suddenly drew out the wire and she must not think about sarah it was past now whatever pain there had been whatever terror or knowledge was finished had she known him what did he feel this morning was he sitting somewhere at breakfast was he hungry was he alone in some dirty room eating bread or was he sitting at a polished dining room table with a family round him eating eggs and kidneys and toast perhaps talking to others even children what would he talk about had his family even the faintest idea of what he was where he had been were they afraid as she had been afraid had they been through all the same suspicionsthe first idea the selfdisgust and guilt for having thought of such things then the examination of little things remembered from the past fitting them in with the facts and at last having the phantom of fear take definite shape and what was he thinking himself or did he not know was he sitting somewhere wondering as much as she was perhaps even thinking the same things looking at others his father his brother fearing for them she looked across at dominic again where had he been last night did he knowexactly pitt would ask him breakfast was cleared away and everyone sought something to do until the police would arrive and begin the questions which had to come mercifully they did not have long to wait pitt and his new sergeant arrived before nine pitt looked tiredas if he had been up long into the nightand unusually tidy oddly enough it made him look uncomfortable prepared for some ordeal good morning he said formally im sorry but this is necessary everyone acknowledged that it was easier to get it over with they all sat down except dominic who remained standing and waited for pitt to begin he did not temper his approach you were out last night mr corde yes dominic coloured painfully watching him charlotte felt that he also wondered whether if he had been at home sarah would not have gone out where what dominic seemed to be lost where were you pitt repeated at my club again was anyone with you the blood drained from dominics face as he realized the possibilities in pitts mind even though it was sarah who was dead he was not excluded as a suspect yes yes he stammered several people i cant remember all their names ddo you need them id better have them mr corde before you forgetor they do dominic opened his mouth perhaps to protest and gave up he reeled off half a dozen names ii think those are correct i think they were all there last night i didnt spend all evening with any one of them you understand no doubt we shall be able to piece things together why were you at your club last night mr corde was there some particular function dominic looked surprised then confused as he understood pitts meaning why was he not at home erno nothing special pitt did not pursue it further he turned instead to caroline decided against it and spoke to charlotte mrs corde left in the early afternoon to visit the vicars wife yes a little after luncheon alone yes charlotte looked down she remembered with pain and now guilt the scene of such a short time ago it was impossible to understand how the whole of ones life could change so quickly why she looked back at him i offered to go with her but she preferred to go alone she wanted to speak to martha prebble in private and then perhaps to go on and do some parish visiting she found it hard to speak her throat ached and she had to stop she did a lot of parish work emily said quietly parish work you mean she visits the poor the sick unconsciously he used the present tense yes do you know whom she intended to visit yesterday no what did martha say mrs prebble that sarah mentioned several people to her but that she left the vicars house quite late and she did not say precisely whom she meant to visit or in which order mrs prebble herself was feeling unwell and said she advised her against going alone but sarah would not listen apparently there were several sick his voice trailed off do you think she began just chance i dont know perhaps possibly he was just waiting for someoneanyone then how in gods name will you ever find him edward shouted you can hardly fill the streets with policemen till he strikes again hell merely wait until you leave he could walk past you speak to you tip his hat and you wouldnt even know him fromfrom the vicar or one of your own no one answered him you said she did a great deal of parish work lately pitt began again did she do it at regular times and always with the same people dominic stared at him you think he wanted sarah i mean sarah in particular i dont know mr corde do you know anyone who loved or hated her enough to do that loved dominic said incredulously god do you mean me it was the first time anyone had said it aloud charlotte looked at their faces trying to see who had thought of it before it looked as if only papa had not she looked back at pitt waiting i dont know who i mean mr corde or the hunt would be over but it could be me dominics voice rose in hysteria even though it was sarah this time you still think it could be me are you sure it isnt dominic looked at him in silence for several moments unless im completely insane capable of becoming another person i know nothing of i couldnt have hurt sarah im not really sure how much i loved her how much i love anyone but far too much to have hurt her deliberately accidentallyi knowand through stubbornness both of usbut not not anything like that charlotte could not keep the tears back if only sarah could have known that much for certain why is it that one does not tell people things while there is time one lets such trivial things matter now she must not upset all the others by weeping in front of them she stood up excuse me she said quickly and walked out to run would betray her need and its urgency it was not dominic emily was afraid for but her father she had never considered the existence of a darker side to her sisters husband he was no more than he seemed to be handsome pleasantnatured if a little spoiled witty when he chose and quite often kindbut also without great imagination it was funny that charlotte should have fallen in love with him he was utterly wrong for her and would have made her dreadfully unhappy he would never have matched her depth of feeling and she would have spent her whole life seeking for something that was not there but papa was quite different there were obviously hungers in him that none of them had recognized before and he had been either unwilling or unable to prevent himself from satisfying them was the woman in cater street the only one she was an old woman now according to sarah when papa had finished with her who had replaced her that was something that she thought had not occurred to the others but it occurred to emily as she sat sewing in the afternoon and she wondered if it would occur to pitt when he found out which he undoubtedly would either from some gossip in the neighbourhood about sarahs visit or from some slip of the tongue by one of the servants or possibly even from charlotte she was about as transparent as water or perhaps he had even been to speak to the woman himself he might be inelegant and of very ordinary birth but he was far from stupid anyway emily thought she had better accustom herself to thinking well of him because no doubt he would have the courage to make an offer for charlotte and she might well take him if she had the courage and the sense papa would hum and haw and grandmama would have a fit but that did not matter unless of course papa really had done something more serious than keep a mistress or even a series of mistresses in which case they would all be ruined and the question of marriage to anyone would be moot surely he could not have she could not really believe it but neither could she dismiss the fear from the back of her mind until she had done something about it she knew that he was alone in the library the abominable vicar would be dutybound to call some time today or tomorrow now that the police had gone for the time being at least better to get this over with edward looked up with surprise when she went into the library emily are you seeking something to read no she sat down in the other big leather chair opposite him what then you find it hard to be alone i confess im glad of your company also she smiled very slightly this was going to be harder than she had anticipated papa yes my dear how very tired he looked she had forgot how old he was papa the woman in cater streethow long is it since she was your mistress better to be direct she could be devious with most people but she had never been able to deceive him with any success how very like charlotte you are at times he smiled with profound regret and she knew instinctively he was thinking neither of her nor of charlotte but of sarah how long she repeated it had to be got over now to have to try again would only extend the pain he looked at her was he weighing up how much she knew whether even now he could lie evade we know about her she said cruelly sarah went to visit her as a charity she discovered the truth please papa dont make it worse her voice wavered she hated doing this but the doubt hurt even more the suspense was a cancer deeper than the clean wound of knowing she must not let him lie now degrade himself he was still looking at her she wanted to shut her eyes to withdraw the question but she knew it was too late he gave in a long time he answered with a little sigh it was all very brief that part of it it was all over a year or two after you were born but i still liked her your mother was often busywith you you didnt know her then but she was not unlike sarah a little stubborn always thinking she knew best suddenly his eyes filled with tears and emily looked away to save him embarrassment she stood up and walked to the window to give him time to regain his control was there anyone after her she asked better to get it all over in one attempt no he sounded surprised of course not why do you ask emily she wanted to think of a lie quickly so that he should not ever know what she had suspected idiotically now she wanted to protect him she had thought she would never forgive him for having hurt mama but instead here she was wanting to shield him as if he had been the injured one she did not understand herself which was a new experience but not an entirely unpleasant one for mama of course she answered one can overlook one mistake especially if it happened a long time ago one cannot forget something that has been repeated over and over again do you think your mother will feel the same way his voice sounded pathetically hopeful she was a little embarrassed by it i should ask her she said quickly i believe she is lying down upstairs she is grieving very much for sarah you know he stood up yes i know i dont think i realized how much she meant to me either he put his arm round her and kissed her gently on the brow she found herself suddenly clinging to him crying for sarah for herself for everybody because it was all too much to bear in the late afternoon george ashworth called to express his condolences naturally these were extended to the entire family and therefore he was seen formally in the withdrawing room by edward it was necessary that afternoon tea should be offered and equally necessary that it be refused afterwards ashworth asked if he might speak with emily she received him in the library as somewhere where they might be sure not to risk interruption he closed the door behind him emily im so sorry perhaps i should not have come so soon but i could not bear to let you think i was unaffected that i was not concerned for your grief i suppose it is foolish to ask if there is anything i can do emily was touched and surprised that he should have feelings deeper than those required by good manners she had desired indeed planned to marry him for some time indeed she quite genuinely liked him but had not perceived in him such sensitivity it was a pleasant revelation and curiously robbed her of some of the control she had just recently managed to acquire thank you she said carefully it is kind of you to offer but there really isnt anything to be done except endure it until we can feel it is time to take up our lives again i suppose they still have no idea who i dont think so im beginning to wonder if they ever will in fact i heard some silly servant the other day suggest that it was not a human being at all but some creature of the supernatural a vampire or a demon of some sort she made a little choking sound which was intended as a laugh of scorn but died away you havent entertained the idea he asked awkwardly have you of course not she said with disgust he is someone from cater street or nearby someone who is afflicted with a terrible madness that drives him to kill i dont know whether he kills people for any reason or just because they happen to be there when his madness strikes but hes perfectly human of that im sure why are you so sure emily he sat down on the side of one of the armchairs she looked at him curiously this was the man she intended to marry to spend the rest of her life dependent upon he was uncommonly handsome and far more importantly he pleased herthe more today because of his unexpected concern for her because i dont believe in monsters she said frankly evil men certainly and madness but not monsters i daresay he would like us to believe he is such for then we could cease to look for him among ourselves perhaps we would even cease to look for him at all what a practical creature you are emily he said with a smile do you ever do anything foolish not often she said frankly then smiled also would you prefer me to great heavens no you are the ideal combination you look feminine and fragile you know when to speak and when to remain silent and yet you behave with all the excellent sense of the best of men thank you she said with a flush of genuine pleasure in fact he looked down at the floor then up at her again if i had any sense i should marry you she took in her breath held it for a second then let it out and have you she said very carefully his smile widened into a grin not usually but i think on this occasion i shall make an exception are you making me a proposal george she turned to look at him dont you know i would like to be quite sure it would be uncommonly silly to make an error in a matter of such importance yes i am he made it a question by the expression in his eyes he looked vulnerable as if it mattered to him she found herself liking him even more than she had thought i should be most honoured she said honestly and i accept you had better speak to papa in a few weeks time when it is more suitable indeed i shall he stood up and i shall make perfectly sure he finds my offer acceptable now i had better take my leave before i have outstayed propriety good afternoon emily my dear chapter thirteen that evening edward decided that he would no longer require caroline to attempt to soothe grandmama or to put up with her criticism and bad humour he sent maddock with a message to susannah that as soon as possible grandmama would be dispatched with her necessary clothes and toiletries and that they did not look to see her return until such time as they should feel themselves recovered from their bereavement it would be no pleasure for susannah but that was one of the burdens of family life and she would have to make the best of it grandmama complained with bitter selfpity and at least one dizzy spell but no one paid her the least attention emily was in a world of her own edward and caroline seemed at last to have come to terms with the whole subject of mrs attwood the previous evening they had talked for a long time and caroline had learned many things not only about edward but about loneliness about the feeling of being outside a close circle of dependence and about herself now there was a new perception between them and they seemed to have much to say to each other dominic for once exercised none of his usual diplomacy and charlotte was even less than ordinarily inclined to mince her words accordingly the following morning caroline and emily assisted grandmama with her packing and at ten oclock accompanied her in the carriage to susannahs charlotte was thus alone when the vicar and martha prebble came to formally convey their sympathy and deep shock at the loss of sarah dora showed them in my dear miss ellison the vicar began solemnly i can hardly find words to express our grief to you charlotte could not help hoping he would continue to fail to find them but such was far from the case what a monstrous evil walks among us he went on taking her hand that could strike down a woman like your sister in the prime of her life and leave her husband and her family bereft i assure you all the righteous men and women of the parish join me in extending all our deepest condolences to you and your poor mother thank you charlotte withdrew her hand i am quite sure of the best wishes of you all and i shall inform my parents and my sister and of course my brotherinlaw of your kindness it is our duty the vicar replied apparently unaware that his remark would rob the visit of any value in charlottes eyes is there anything we can do martha offered charlotte turned to her in relief but it was shortlived marthas face was more haggard than she had ever seen it before her eyes were bedded in dark hollows her hair hanging like string in loops over her ears your sympathy is the greatest help charlotte said gently moved to a profound pity for the woman surely to live with such a dutysuffocated creature as the vicar must be almost more than any human caring woman could stand when will it be convenient for me to consult with your father about theerarrangements the vicar went on without looking at martha these things must be done you know a proper order preserved we return to the dust from which we came and our souls to the judgement of god there was no answer to that so charlotte returned to the first question i have no idea but i would have thought it appropriate to speak with my brotherinlaw at least to begin with she was delighted to find some point of propriety on which to correct him if he feels unable to do so then of course im sure papa will deal with the matter the vicar endeavoured to hide his annoyance he smiled showing his teeth but his cheeks coloured faintly and his eyes were hard of course he agreed i had thought perhapsan older manthe grief it may quite possibly be so charlotte was not about to give him the slightest victory she smiled also equally coldly but it would be an added unkindness not to consult him an unnecessary rudeness i feel the muscles along the vicars face tightened have the police made even the slightest progress towards discovering the perpetrator of these horrendous crimes i understand you aresomewhat closeto one of thepolicemen he invested the last word with the same tone he might have used for rat catchers or those who remove the kitchen waste there was a gleam of pleasure in his eyes i dont know whom you can have been listening to vicar to gather such an impression charlotte looked him straight in the face have the servants been talking the colour washed up his face in a wave of anger i do not listen to servants miss ellison and i take it unkindly that you should suggest such a thing i am not some gossiping woman it was not intended as an insult vicar charlotte lied without the slightest qualm since i am a woman myself i would not have chosen that phrase in order to be derogatory indeed of course not he said tartly god made woman as he made manthe weaker vessel of course but still the creation of the almighty i understood everything was the creation of god charlotte was going to push every prick home but it is indeed comforting to be reminded that we are to answer your question i am not aware that the police have made any further discoveries in the course of their investigations but of course it is not incumbent on them to advise me if they have i see the whole matter has preyed upon your mind the vicar altered his tone to one of sententiousness quite natural it is far too great a burden for one of your tender birth and years to bear you must lean upon the church and put your trust in the lord almighty to help you through this crisis read your bible every day you will find great comfort in it observe its commandments diligently and it will bring joy to your soul even through the darkest vicissitudes of this vale of tears thank you charlotte said drily she had hitherto enjoyed her bible but this was quite enough to sour it for her i will pass on your advice i am sure we shall all benefit from it and never fear that the wicked shall escape punishment if they do not meet the justice of this world then gods vengeance will catch up with them in the eternities and they shall perish in hell fire the wages of sin is death the lusts of the flesh consume in everlasting fire the souls of the wicked and no man shall escape no not the least thought that pursues the pleasures of the flesh shall go unknown in the great judgement charlotte shivered she found the idea of comfort in such a philosophy appalling she had thoughts she was ashamed of hungers and dreams she would far rather were not known and as she needed her own forgiven she would forgive anothers surely thoughts that are controlled she said hesitantly and not acted upon martha looked up suddenly her face white the muscles in her jaw clenching her voice was rough when she spoke as if it would not entirely obey her all sin is sin my dear the thought is father to the wish and the wish father to the deed therefore the thought itself is evil and must be plucked out eradicated like a poisonous weed that will rise and choke the seeds of the lords word in you if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out better a limb should be chopped off than the whole body should become infected and perish i i hadnt thought of it like that charlotte stammered she was embarrassed by marthas intensity by the passion she felt just beneath the surface of these words she was almost tangibly conscious of some deep pain in the room with her something beyond all her previous experience it frightened her because she did not know how to comfort martha you must martha said urgently that is how it is sin is everpresent deep in our hearts and minds the devil striving to claim us for his own seeking the weaknesses of the flesh seeking to govern us he is cleverer than we are and he never sleeps remember that charlotte always be on your guard pray continually for the saving grace of our redeemer to show you the evil one in his true light that you may recognize him and tear him out of your bosom destroy his influence and remain clean she suddenly stopped and stared down at her hands in her lap i have the great blessing of a man of god in my house to guide me god has been extremely good to me to save me from all my weaknesses and show me the way i am not sure i can ever be worthy of such a blessing there there my dear the vicar put his hand on her shoulder i am sure we all receive blessings appropriate to our deserts ultimately you have no need to chastise yourself god made women to be the handmaids of his servants and you have acquitted yourself excellently in your calling you never cease to labour for the poor and the fallen im sure it does not go unseen in heaven it does not go unseen on earth either charlotte said quickly sarah was always saying what wonderful work you do she found herself embarrassingly near to tears again at the mention of sarahs name above all things she did not wish to weep in front of the vicar sarah an indescribable look came over marthas face she seemed to struggle with some inner torment a mighty effort to control herself which lasted visibly and to charlottes unbearable pity for several moments im sure she rests in peace now charlotte put her hand over marthas forgetting her own grief and attempting to ease the other womans if all we are told of heaven is true we should not grieve for her but only for ourselves because we miss her heaven martha repeated may god be merciful to forgive her all her sins and remember only her virtues and wash her clean in the blood of christ amen the vicar said sonorously now my dear miss ellison we must leave you to your deliberations and such privacy as you may require please advise your brotherinlaw that i shall be available to him at whatever hour is convenient come martha my dear we have other duties to perform good morning miss ellison good morning vicar charlotte held out her hand to martha good morning mrs prebble i am sure mama will be most touched by your sympathy the vicar and martha departed and charlotte sat down hard on the overstuffed chair in the withdrawing room feeling suddenly cold and painfully unhappy naturally charlotte reported the substance of the vicars call when mama and emily returned for luncheon no comment was passed except the acknowledgement required by courtesy mama returned to her room to spend the afternoon writing the necessary letters to inform other members of the family godparents cousins of sarahs death emily found something to do in the kitchen charlotte busied herself with mending it was really millies job but charlotte wished for something to keep her from idleness millie would have to find another task perhaps even doing the ironing again it was nearly three when pitt came again for the first time she admitted freely that she was pleased to see him charlotte he took one of her hands gently his touch was warm and she did not wish to withdraw indeed her mind went ahead of her wishes to think of more good afternoon inspector she said formally she must keep control what can we do this time have you thought of some further questions no he smiled ruefully i can think of nothing else i came merely to see you i hope i do not need an excuse she found herself embarrassed and unable to answer it was ridiculous no man had embarrassed her in this fashion except dominic and with dominic it had been an empty confusion without any end she could see this time she hoped profoundly with shaking heart what the end might be she withdrew her hand still i should like to know if you have any further information some beliefs perhaps some he looked at the chair questioning if he might sit down she nodded and he relaxed into it still watching her but it is only the faintest idea as yet i cannot see it clearly and perhaps when i do there will be nothing there she wanted to tell him about the distress she felt for martha prebble the sense of her deep pain that had filled the room her own helplessness in the face of something she thought she had seen but not understood charlotte what is troubling you has something happened since i was here last she turned to look at him for once she was not quite sure how to put her thoughts into words a failing she was not accustomed to it was difficult to express the sense of oppression that had weighed on her during and after the prebbles visit without sounding foolish overimaginative yet she wished to tell him it would comfort her profoundly if he understood perhaps he would even be able to dismiss it show her it was a fancy he was still waiting apparently knowing she was seeking words the vicar and mrs prebble were here this morning she began natural enough he was listening he was bound to call he shifted his weight i know you dislike him i must say i have the greatest trouble being civil to him myself he smiled wryly i imagine it is even harder for you she glanced at him not sure for a moment if he were mocking her he was but there was tenderness in his face as well as amusement for a moment the warmth of it the sweetness of pleasure it brought her drove martha prebble from her mind why should that have upset you he brought her back to the present she turned away so his look should not disturb her ive always felt ambivalent about martha she was seriously trying now to tell him what was still struggling for form in her mind her talk about sin is so depressing she sounds like the vicar seeing evil where i believe there is only perhaps a little foolishness which passes anyway with time and responsibility people like the vicar always seem bent on spoiling pleasure as if pleasure itself were against god i can see that some pleasures are or that they beguile one from the things one ought to do but perhaps he sees that as his duty pitt suggested its clearcut easier than preaching charity and certainly easier than practicing it i suppose so and if i lived with someone like him for a long time i should learn to feel the same way as martha prebble does perhaps her father was a vicar too i never thought of that before and what is your other feeling he asked you said you were ambivalent oh pity of course and i think some admiration too you know she really does try to live up to all that that wretched man teaches and more she is always visiting caring for the sick and the lonely i sometimes wonder how much she believes what she says about sin or if she just adds it out of habit and because she thinks she ought to because she knows he would i dare say she doesnt know herself but that is not all charlotte why did they disturb you especially today they have always been like this you could not have expected anything else what was the unease she had felt she wanted to tell him indeed she needed to she was talking about the need for punishment even things like if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cutting off hands and things it seemed so so extreme as if she were frightened of iti mean really panicked she talked about washing in the blood of christ and things she looked at him and she spoke about sarah as if there were evil in her i mean not just general weakness as there is in all of us but as if she knew of something i suppose thats what upset meshe spoke as if she knew something i didnt he frowned charlotte he began slowly please dont be angry with me but do you think sarah confided in her something that she did not tell you is it possible charlotte was repelled by the thought yet she remembered that sarah had wanted to see martha alone she had trusted martha sometimes it was easier to speak to someone outside the family perhaps she admitted reluctantly i dont think so i dont know what sarah could have done but it could be he stood up and came closer to her she could feel his presence as if it were a warmth she did not wish to move away indeed she wished it were not immodest improper to touch him it could be something very slight he said gently something that was of little importance but to martha prebble in the vicars eyes a sin needing forgiveness and for heavens sake dont confuse the vicar with god im sure god is nothing like as selfrighteous in spite of herself she smiled dont be ridiculous god is love im sure the vicar never loved anyone in his life she was touched by a bleak knowledge including martha she took a deep breath no wonder poor martha is desperate underneath all her good works and her condemnation of sin not to be loved not to love he touched her arm very lightly and you charlotte do you still love dominic she felt herself colour with shame that she should have been so obvious what made you believethat i of course i knew there was regret in his voice a memory of pain i love you how could i remain unaware that you loved someone else oh you havent answered me do you still love him dont you know that i dont or does it not matter to you now she was almost sure of what the answer would be and yet she needed to have it spoken he turned her arm firmly till she was facing him it matters to me i dont want to be second best there was a lift in his voice making it a question very slowly she looked up at him at first she was a little afraid embarrassed by the power of feeling in his face and by the depth and the sweetness of her own feeling then she stopped hiding let go of pretence you are not second best she said clearly she put up her fingers and touched his cheek at first shyly dominic was only a dream im awake now and you are the first best he reached up and took hold of her hand keeping it to his face his lips and you have the courage to marry an ordinary policeman charlotte do you doubt my courage mr pitt surely at least you cannot doubt my selfwill slowly he smiled more and more widely until it was a grin then i shall prepare for battle with your father his face became sober again but ill wait until this business is settled and a suitable time has passed you can settle it she asked doubtfully i think so i have a feeling the answer is just beyond us only just i have caught a glimpse of something grotesque something we have not even dreamed before i cannot grasp it yet but it is there i have felt its darkness and its pain touch me she shivered be careful he has not killed a man yet but if his own life is in danger i shall now i must go there are a few more questions things that may help to make it plain to put a face to the shadow it is so close a little thought she moved away slowly the shadow of the hangman outside her and a white singing happiness inside she showed him to the door herself the following day arrangements were being made for sarahs funeral and everyone was busy when millie came in with a note to say that martha prebble had been taken ill and been confined to her bed oh dear that really is too much caroline said in exasperation she was going to deal with so many of the details especially at the church and i dont even know what she has done so far she sat down hard in the wooden chair behind her i suppose i shall have to write a list of questions and send one of the servants round to her it seems heartless if the poor creature is ill but what else can i do and its raining we cant send a servant mama charlotte said wearily the least we can do is go ourselves she visits all the sick in the parish takes them things even sits up with them all night if they are alone it would be unpardonable if now when she is ill all we can do is send a servant with a message to know how far she has got in making arrangements on our behalf one of us must go and take her something she will have plenty of things emily pointed out we cannot be the only people to know it will be all round the parish you know what gossips they are and quite possibly they will all think as you do that someone else will call charlotte argued anyway that isnt the point what is the point the point is that we should take her something even if her house is bulging at the walls with things to show that we care emily raised her eyebrows i didnt think you did care in fact i thought you were indifferent to martha and positively disliked the vicar i do that is especially when one should take something she cannot help being unlikeable so would you be i daresay if you had lived all your life married to the vicar i should be worse than unlikeable emily said tartly i should be quite mad by now i think he is an appalling man emily please caroline was almost to the point of tears i cannot spare both of you emily will you make sure we have informed everyone we should have go over my list again and check those we can be sure will attend then go over the catering arrangements with mrs dunphy charlotte you had better go to the kitchen and find something to take to martha if you insist and for goodness sake find out as tactfully as you can how far she has got with the arrangements at the church and you had better not forget to find out precisely what is the matter if it is tactful it may not be i must know or i shall appear to be callous yes mama what shall i take her since we dont know what is the nature of her illness it is a little difficult to say see if mrs dunphy has some egg custard she is very good at it and i know marthas cook has a heavy hand mrs dunphy had no egg custard ready and it was the middle of the afternoon before she had prepared one and sent a message upstairs to charlotte to tell her it was ready charlotte put on her cloak and hat then went down to the kitchen to collect it there you are miss charlotte mrs dunphy gave her a basket neatly packed with a folded napkin on the top egg custard in a dish there and i put in a small jar of preserves and a little beef tea as well the poor soul i hope she feels better soon too much for her all this tragedy i expect she knew all of those poor girls and she does so much for the poor and the like never stops time someone showed her a little kindness i say yes mrs dunphy thank you charlotte took the basket im sure shell be very grateful take her my best wishes will you miss charlotte of course she turned round to leave and felt a sudden icy fear as she saw on the side table a long thin wire with a handle on one end the coldness rippled through her as if someone were holding the thing as if only lately it had been pulled tight into the flesh of someones throat mrs dunphy she stammered whwhat in heavens name mrs dunphy followed her eyes oh miss charlotte she said with a laugh why thats only an ordinary cheese cutter bless my soul if you were a little fonder of cooking youd have known that what did you thinkoh my saints alive did you think that was a garotting wire oh my she sat down hard oh my why just about every kitchen has one of those cuts the cheese nice and clean better than a knife knife sticks to it miss charlotte should you be going out alone itll be dark in an hour or two and i shouldnt be surprised if the rain stops and theres not a fog i have to go mrs dunphy mrs prebble is ill and apart from that we need to know about the arrangements for miss sarahs funeral mrs dunphys face dropped and charlotte was afraid she was going to dissolve in tears she patted her on the arm and made her escape quickly it was cold and clammy outside and she walked as rapidly as possible keeping her cloak wrapped tightly round her and drawn up round her neck it stopped raining just as she turned the corner into cater street the sky was dry but heavy when she reached the prebbles the maid let her in and she was led straight to marthas bedroom it was very dark full of furniture and surprisingly comfortless so unlike her own with its pictures and ornaments and books with pictures in them relics of childhood martha was sitting propped up in bed with a treatise on the sermons of john knox her face was haggard and she looked as if she had woken from a nightmare its figures still shadowing her she smiled as soon as she saw charlotte but it was an effort charlotte sat down on the bed and put the basket between them im so sorry to hear you are ill she said genuinely ive brought a few things i hope they will comfort you she took the napkin off the basket to show her what was inside mama and emily send their regards and mrs dunphy our cook you know wished to be remembered to you spoke of how much you do for everyone that was most kind of her martha tried to smile please thank her for me and of course your mother and emily is there anything i can do for you charlotte offered is there anything you wish do you need any letters written any small duties that i can help with i cannot think of anything has the doctor called you look exceedingly pale to me no i dont think i have any need to trouble him you should im sure he would not regard it as a trouble but rather his duty and his calling i promise you i shall send for him if i do not recover soon charlotte put the basket down on the floor i dislike having to mention such a subject when you are ill and have already done so much for us but mama would like to know what arrangements are yet to be made for sarahs funeral with regard to the church an indescribable look passed over marthas face and again charlotte had the uneasy feeling she had touched some deep nerve of pain you dont need to be concerned please tell your mama it is all taken care of fortunately i was not overcome before i had finished everything are you sure it seems too much for you to have done i do hope it was not work on our behalf that hastened your illness i doubt it but it was the least i could do it behooves us wellto her voice became strained and she licked her lips to do what we can for the dead they are no longer of this world they will put off the corruption of the flesh rise to a just judgement and washed in the blood of christ the elect will sit at the feet of god forever sin will be done away with charlotte was embarrassed she could think of no answer but it seemed as if martha were talking more to herself than to charlotte anyway it is our duty to clear away the dross that is left behind martha went on her hollow eyes staring somewhere over charlottes shoulder at the wall all that corrupts and decays must be cleaned away buried in the earth and the words of cleansing said over them that is our duty our duty to the dead and to the living yes of course charlotte stood up perhaps you should rest you look feverish to me she leaned forward and put her hand onto marthas brow it was hot and damp she pushed the stray hair away gently you are a little hot may i fetch you something to drink a little beef tea perhaps or would you prefer water no no thank you marthas voice rose and she moved from side to side pulling the bedclothes charlotte looked at the bed it was untidy and must be uncomfortable the pillows had not been rearranged and were dented almost flat in the centre here she offered let me remake your bed it must be most difficult to rest with it like that and without waiting for a reply because she was anxious to do something positive and then excuse herself and leave she leaned forward again and began to make the bed around martha she eased her up to tidy the sheet under her and to puff up the pillows then put her arms round her and laid her gently back again next she moved round the bed quickly and straightened the covers and tucked them in i hope that will be better she said surveying the bed critically martha looked a little flushed now there were two spots of colour in her cheeks and her eyes were feverish charlotte was concerned for her you dont look at all well she said screwing up her own face unconsciously again she put her hand on marthas forehead leaning forward have you any eau de cologne she said and looked for it as she spoke it was on a small table by the window she crossed to get it and brought it back with a handkerchief in the other hand here let me brush your hair for a little and then perhaps you will be able to sleep i always find if i am unwell that sleep is the most effective cure martha said nothing and charlotte avoided her eyes because she could think of no conversation fifteen minutes later charlotte was in the street again having left martha propped up in bed eyes cavernous face spotted with colour and beads of sweat on her face if she were not better tomorrow it was to be hoped the vicar would send for the doctor first thing in the morning it was colder outside and the fog had already gathered quite alarmingly her footsteps were muffled on the wet stones and the gaslights were blurred like so many yellow moons she shivered and drew her cloak more closely round her it was a wretched night cater street seemed a mile long better to think of something happy make the distance seem less and the evening warmer she smiled immediately as yesterdayand pittreturned to her mind of course papa would not be very pleased at the prospect of her marrying socially beneath her but then on the other hand he ought to be somewhat relieved that she had the offer of marrying at all especially if she were anything like as awkward as grandmama believed anyway whatever papa said she would marry mr pitt she had never been surer of anything in her life the very thought of him lit a warmth inside her enough to dispel the fog and chill of the november dusk could that be footsteps behind her nonsense and what if it were it was early yet there must be other people in cater street she would not be the only one abroad nevertheless she hurried it was foolish and quite irrational to imagine the footsteps had anything to do with her they were still a little distance behind her and sounded more like another woman than a man she walked a little faster and what if it were a man she knew almost every man who lived in this area it could only be some friend or acquaintance perhaps they would even accompany her home the fog was really quite thick now like wreaths and garlands now why should she think of wreaths natural enough sarah was to be buried in a few days time poor sarah oh god had sarah been hurrying along the street like this with footsteps in the mist behind her when suddenly dont be foolish there was no point in thinking like that would she make a fool of herself if she were to run and what did it matter if she was a fool she quickened her pace yet again the footsteps were very close now she still had the basket in her hand was there anything in it she could use as a weapon glass a weight no hadnt someone used a heavy pickle jar her hands were empty at least she would face himif it were him she would see his face and she would scream scream as loudly as she could scream his name so that every house in cater street would hear it house of course she would go up to the very next house past this length of garden wall and bang on the door till someone let her in what did it matter if they thought she was a hysterical fool someone would take her home everyone would say she was foolish but what did that matter the footsteps were right behind her she would not be taken by surprise she swung round to face him he was there in front of her her own height no more but broader far broader the gaslight shone on his head as he moved dont be idiotic it was martha only martha prebble martha she said in an ecstasy of relief what on earth are you doing out of bed you are ill do you need help here let me but marthas face was twisted into an unrecognizable distortion her eyes blazing her lips drawn back she raised her powerful arms and the gaslight caught on the thin silver of a cheese cutting wire in her hands charlotte was paralyzed you filth martha said between her clenched teeth there was saliva on her lips and she was shivering you creature of the devil you tempted me with your white arms and your flesh but you shant win the lord said better you should not have been born than that you should have tempted and brought to destruction one of these my little ones and brought them to sin better you should have a millstone tied round your neck and be put into the sea i shall destroy you however many times you keep coming with your soft words and your touch of sin i shall not fall i know how your body burns i know your secret lusts but i shall destroy you all till you leave me alone in peace satan shall never win charlotte only barely understoodsome tortured haze of love and loneliness of twisted hungers suppressed for long years till they broke loose in violence that could no longer deny itself oh no martha her own fear was consumed in pity oh martha you misunderstood you poor creature but martha had raised the wire stretched taut between her hands and was coming towards her less than a yard away the spell was broken charlotte screamed as loudly as her lungs would permit she screamed marthas name over and over again she swung the basket at her at her face hoping to scare her to blind her temporarily even to knock her over it seemed like eternity and marthas hands were already on her arms gripping her like steel when the enormous figure of pitt came out of the fog and a second later two constables they grasped martha hauling her off forcing her arms behind her back charlotte collapsed against the street wall her knees seemed to have no strength to support her and her hands were tingling with pins and needles pitt bent down to her taking her face in his hands very gently you blazing idiot he choked what in gods name were you doing going to see her alone do you realize if i hadnt gone to see you again today and they had not told me where youd come youd be lying on this very stone dead like sarah and all the others she nodded and gulped tears beginning to run down her face yes youyou he was lost for a word fierce enough before he could struggle any further there were more heavy feet on the pavement and a moment later the vicars solid form materialized out of the fog whats going on he demanded whats happened whos hurt pitt turned to him bitter dislike in his face no one is hurt mr prebblein the way you mean the injury is a lifelong one i think i dont know what you mean explain yourself martha what on earth are those policemen doing with martha she should be at home in bed she is ill i found her missing thats why i came out you can let her go now i shall take her home no mr prebble you wont im afraid mrs prebble is under arrest and will remain with us under arrest the vicars face twitched are you insane martha could have done nothing wrong she is a good woman if she has been foolish his voice hardened a little in irritation as if he had been trespassed against she is not well pitt stopped him no mr prebble she is not she is so ill she has murdered and disfigured five women the vicar stared at him his face working as he struggled between disbelief and rage he swivelled to stare at martha sagging eyes wild saliva on her lips and chin policemen holding her up he swung back to pitt possessed he said furiously sin his voice rose oh frailty thy name is woman pitts face was frozen with his own anger frail he demanded because she cares and you dont because she is capable of love and you are not because she has weaknesses hungers and compassion and you know none of these go away mr prebble and pray if you know how the fog swirled in and he was lost i was sorry for her charlotte said softly she sniffed i still am i didnt even know women could feel like thatabout other women please dont be angry with me oh charlottei he gave up stand up youll get cold sitting on the stone its wet he pulled her to her feet looked at the tears running down her face then put his arms round her and held onto her as tightly as he could not bothering to push the hair out of her eyes or to pick up the basket just clinging to her i know youre sorry for her he whispered dear god so am i
