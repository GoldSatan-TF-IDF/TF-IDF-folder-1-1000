there is some justice in this world just not enough dead in the alley nadia guaman died in my arms seconds after i left club gouge i heard gunshots screams squealing tires from the alley behind the building i ran across the parking lot slipping on gravel and ruts and found nadia crumpled on the dirty ice blood was flowing from her chest in a thick tide i ripped off my scarf and opened her coat the wound was high in her chesttoo high i knew thatbut i still made a pad of my scarf and pressed it against her keeping pressure on the pad i struggled out of my coat and placed it under her left hand on chest right hand underneath pushing my coat against the exit wound without looking up or stopping the pressure i shouted at the people surging around us to call now at once nadias eyes flickered open as i cradled her the ghost of a smile flickered at the sides of her wide mouth alley alley shhh nadia save your strength i thought it was a good sign a hopeful sign that she spoke and i kept pushing against her wound singing snatches of a cradle song trying to keep us both calm when the paramedics arrived and pried my hands free from her wounds they shook their heads shed been dead for several minutes already i started to shiver it was only when the medics forced me to my feet that i felt the january wind cut into my bones the medics brought me into the ambulance but left nadia lying on the ground waiting for a tech team to photograph her the crew wrapped a blanket around me and gave me hot sweet coffee from their own thermos you did the best that could be done no one could have done more the tech was short and muscular with wiry red hair she was bleeding out within minutes of being shot im guessing the bullet nicked a major vein but the me will tell us more was she a friend i shook my head wed barely spoken and at that point in fact i only knew her first name a cop poked his head through the open ambulance door you the gal that put her coat on the dead girl dead woman i started to say but i was too exhausted to fight that battle tonight nadia was dead and whatever one called her it wouldnt bring her back to life i didnt move from the bench facing the stretcher but croaked out a yes can we talk inside maam the cop said the emts are going to take the dead girl to the morgue as soon as the photo team is through and its five degrees here in the parking lot i handed the blanket back to the ambulance crew and let the cop give me a hand as i jumped off the back nadia was lying where id left her her face silver under the blue strobes the blood on her chest black my coat was still underneath her i walked over and fished my car and house keys from the pockets despite outcries from the evidence team my handbag was lying a few feet from the dead woman i muttered out loud i picked up the bag also against the outraged shouts of the officer in charge thats evidence its my handbag which i dropped when i was performing first aid you dont need it and i do i turned on my heel and walked back into the club gouge the bag was handmade from red leather an apology of sorts from the friend of a dead missing person and i wasnt going to risk losing it or my wallet in an evidence locker everyone whod been in the club or the parking lot except those crafty enough to escape ahead of the team in blue had been herded into the building a minute before id been too cold but the club atmosphere hot nearly airless made me ill i started to sweat and fought a rising tide of nausea the club staff including my cousin petra were huddled by the bar after a moment when i decided i wasnt going to vomit i shoved my way through the crowd to petras side vic what happened petras blue eyes were wide with fear youre covered with blood i looked down and saw nadias blood on my jeans and sweater on my hands my scalp crawled maybe her blood was in my hair someone shot a woman as she left the club i said was itwho was it i heard her called nadia i said slowly fixing petra with a hard stare i dont know if thats her name and i dont know her last name if the cops or a reporter ask you questions about what happened tonight you can answer only truthfully about things you actually know and saw you shouldnt answer questions about things that are just guesses because that could mislead the cops it would be best if you dont consult the other witnesses a voice said a female officer had fought through the shouting texting twittering chaos to appear at my side under the club lights i could see her face narrow with pronounced cheekbones and lank black hair cut so short the ends only just appeared below her cap rim i read her badge e milkova e milkova didnt look much older than my cousin too young to be a cop too young to be telling me what to do butshe had the badge i let her guide me to the small stage at the back of the club which the police had roped off with crime scene tape so they could use it for interrogations she lifted the tape so i could crawl under then dragged a couple of chairs from the nearest table i reached a hand out and took one of them from her i was in that numb place you inhabit after youve been part of violence and death it was hard to focus on milkovas questions i gave her my name i told her id heard gunshots and run to see what the problem was i told her i didnt know the dead woman but you knew her name milkova said that was just from hearing someone call her nadia i dont know her last name most people run away from gunshots i didnt say anything you ran toward them i still didnt say anything and she frowned at me why why which i said why did you run toward danger when i was younger and more insouciant i would have quoted the great philip marlowe and said trouble is my business but tonight i was cold and apprehensive i dont know did you see anyone in the club threaten nadia tonight i shook my head i hadnt seen anyone threaten her tonight earlier that was another story but my years as a public defender had taught me to answer only the question asked did you come here tonight because you thought there would be an attack on someone its a club i came because i wanted to see the acts youre a private investigator they tell me youve been involved in a lot of highprofile investigations someone had idd me to the police i wondered if it was the clubs owner out of malice thank you i said milkova pushed her short hair back behind her ears a nervous gestureshe wasnt sure how to proceed but dont you think its a strange coincidence you being here the night someone got shot cops have days off even doctors and pis have been known to take them too i didnt want to throw petra to the wolves and thats what would happen if i said anything about wanting to keep an eye on my cousins workplace no one had bothered to turn off the body artists computer and the plasma screens on the stage kept flashing images of flowers and jungle animals it made a disturbing backdrop to the interrogation vic what are you doing here i looked around and saw terry finchley a detective ive known for a long time terry i might ask you the same question finchleys been out of the field for five or six years now on the personal staff of my dads old protégé captain bobby mallory i was surprised to see the finch at an active homicide investigation he gave a wry smile captain thought it was time i got my hands dirty again and if youre anything to judge by theyre going to get mighty dirty indeed on this investigation i looked again at my stained hands i was beginning to feel twitchy covered in nadias blood terry climbed the shallow step to the stage and told milkova to get him a chair what have you learned liz finchley asked officer milkova so the e stood for elizabeth shes not cooperating sir she wont say how she knew the vic or why she was here or anything officer milkova ive told you i didnt know the victim i said it makes me cranky when people dont listen to me pretty much any damn thing makes you cranky warshawski finchley said but out of curiosity how did you get involved i was leaving the club i heard gunshots i ran across the parking lot and saw a woman on the ground she was bleeding i tried to block the wounds so i didnt take time to follow the shooters but on the principle that no good deed is left unpunished im being treated as though i had something to do with the dead womans murder my voice had risen to a shout vic youre exhausted and i dont blame you terrys tone was unusually gentle the sharp planes in his ebony cheeks softening with empathy hed felt angry with me for a lot of yearsmaybe i was finally forgiven his voice sharpened the techs are annoyed because you took evidence from the crime scene and for that i not only dont blame them but need you to turn it over to them okay not forgiven he was just doing goodbad cop all in one paragraph it wasnt evidence these were my personal belongings that i dropped when i tried to administer first aid i picked them up when officer milkova told me to leave the scene i think your techs would be grateful to have extraneous items removed although i did abandon my coat my throat contracted and i looked involuntarily at my hand my right hand which had been pushing my coat against nadias bleeding back you can keep the coat ill never wear it again finchley paused briefly and decided to let my handbag ride did you know the dead woman no why were you here its a club you can come in if you want a drink and want to see the show i was doing both those things finchley sighed you know anyone else in this town id nod and take your name and phone number and urge you to wash the blood off and try to forget the horrors you witnessed but v i warshawski chooses to come to a club the one night in the year a woman gets murdered at their back door you know what the captains going to ask when he hears that why were you here tonight performing artist why had i been at club gouge the night nadia guaman took two bullets terrys question kept running through my head as i drove home the simple answer had to do with my cousin petra except petra had been in my life less than a year and i was rapidly learning that there are no simple answers where shes concerned in a way that was unfair it was really jake thibaut who first took me to club gouge right after thanksgiving jakes a bass player who moved into my building last spring weve been dating for a few months now he plays with a contemporary chamber group as well as the earlymusic group high plainsong trish walsh a friend of his from high plainsong was doing a strange blend of medieval music with heavy metal lyrics accompanying herself on electric hurdygurdy and lute when trish walsh singing as the raving renaissance raven got a gig at club gouge jake put together a party to hear her a number of his musician friends joined us but he also invited lotty herschel and max loewenthal along with my downstairs neighbor mr contreras my cousin petra wheedled her way into the invitation the raving renaissance raven petras eyes glowed jake i didnt realize how totally cool you are i have the ravens ravings on my ipod but ive never caught her act club gouge itself was one of a string of new nightspots that had taken over the abandoned warehouses under the lake street l just west of downtown somehow it had become the hippest scene on the strip mostly because the owner olympia koilada apparently had a sixth sense for knowing when to book performers right before they became big the raven who was opening for an act billed as the body artist sang and played for about forty minutes max was intrigued by her hurdygurdy which was handmade of beautiful woods the raven had attached an amplifier to it and the sound filled the club jake and his musician friends didnt like the distortion that the amp brought to the musical line between sets they argued about whether their friend could have achieved a better effect with a local mike petra and mr contreras argued about the lyrics she thought the ravens songs were awesome he found them disgusting it was max who put my own reaction into words she perhaps never has had a wide audience in her earlymusic performance now she can show a young generation that even a gifted musician can shock and thus build a market for herself thats so cynical petra protested shes just being brave enough to put herself out there where art and commerce intersect jake said you make art you sell itto make a living to get some validationyou make compromises with your art to make a livingwhy not go the whole way which isnt to say she doesnt believe as deeply in heavy metal as she does in early music we had planned to leave before the body artist came onstage but the lively arguments in our partyaccompanied by the amount of beer and wine everyone was putting awaywent on until the houselights were dimmed again for the evenings main event young men at tables around us gave catcalls and stomped their feet in anticipation during the intermission id been watching a table in the middle of the room the five young men sitting there were all drinking heavily but two in particular had been banging their beer bottles on the tabletop demanding that the body artist get going when the lights went down theirs were the shrillest whistles in a noisy room we sat in the dark for perhaps thirty seconds when the lights came back up the body artist had appeared onstage she sat on a high stool very still she was naked except for an electronsized thong but creamcolored foundation covered her body including her face only her brown hair swept up from her neck in a jeweled clip belonged to the world of the living the artist was completely at ease her bare legs crossed yoga style her palms pressed together in front of her breasts it was the audience that was disturbed little rustlings as people crossed and uncrossed legs or fiddled with zippers explosions of whispered laughter behind the woman photographs of body art appeared on a series of screens a field of lilies grew out of a vagina with the flowers blooming across the breasts a face painted like a tiger magnified so that each whisker each stripe around the muzzle was visible the tiger was replaced by a jungle scene that covered the back elephants trumpeted on the shoulder blades a giraffe straddled the spinal column the jungle was followed by a giant blue eye lid lowered on an abdomen seeming to wink at the vulva below the slides changed in time to a sound track of middle eastern music at the front of the stage two figures clad in burkas gyrated in time to the music i hadnt noticed them at first but the burkas somehow exaggerated the eroticism of the dancers movements and made them almost as disturbing as the body art itself i was as uncomfortable as the rest of the audience the spotlight on the artists breasts the sense that this was a mannequin sitting there not a woman was both arousing and unpleasant and i resented my body for responding to what my mind rejected jake thibaut shifted away from me involuntarily while mr contreras said in a loud whisper this aint right it just aint right the artist let the tension build until we were all ready to claw at each other and then she lowered her hands palms open toward us in seeming invitation art is in the hands of the maker its in the eyes of the beholder its in the air we breathe the sunsets we admire the dead bodies we wash and wrap in linens for burial my body is my canvas but tonight its yours as well tonight is a night to let your imagination run free and to paint the way you used to paint in kindergarten before you started worrying what someone might say about your work your art im your canvas yourbarecanvas the five guys whod been pounding their table demanding the start of the artists act now whistled and called out one of them shouted take it all off girl take off that thong thing lets see some pussy i half turned to look at them one of them was trying to signal for another round all five were big guys and the one shouting for the body artist to take off her thong had the kind of muscles you get from lifting heavy stuff all day long the room was lit dimly but i could make out a thicket of tattoos along his arms the woman on the stool smiled maybe she was used to drunken vulgarity maybe she enjoyed it cant we get a drink here the tattooed man cried slapping the table cool it chad one of his tablemates said i looked around for the bouncer and saw him at the back of the room talking to the owner they had their eye on the table and seemed to think the quintet didnt need professional attention just yet but as i watched i saw the owner shake her head at the waitstaff no drinks right now at least not in chads part of the room the body artist held out her arms to the tattooed man so that her breasts drooped forward hanging like fruit above her thighs you and i both like body art dont we come on up i wont bite draw your hearts desire on my body go on chad his buddies urged him go for it do it like the lady says she dont bite or at least not in front of all these other people she wont the group began to laugh and pound each other and the tension eased out of the room the body artist picked up a brush from a tray of open paint cans on a cart beside her and began painting on her leg for a moment we forgot the strangeness of her nudity and watched as she picked up different brushes she worked quickly talking the whole time about the body art convention shed just attended about gallery shows around town about her childhood cat basta as she painted the two burkaclad figures posed on the stage periodically shifting legs or arms into new positions that mimed pleasure or excitement in the artists work after five minutes the body artist stood showing off her painting only people in the front of the club could see it but they all clapped and cheered the rest of us craned and chad and his friends got restive again before their complaints grew too loud one of the burkaed figures picked up a camera from the cart that held the artists paints and other supplies the artist beckoned a man from the table directly in front of the stage he had the embarrassed exchange with her that people often do when theyre called up from the audience by the magician after a moment though he joined her on the raised platform that served as club gouges stage one of the dancers handed the camera to the man and the artist directed him to point it at her leg the image appeared on one of the screens a cat elongated disdainful in the egyptian style underneath it the artist had written lets see some pussy the room roared with laughter everyone had been upset by the catcalls from chad and his drunk friends and was delighted to see them put down chads face seemed to darken in the dim room but his buddies kept their hands on his arms and he didnt try to get up from the table the body artist kidded and prodded the man whod joined her onstage into taking up a paintbrush he drew a red stripe down her left arm now your work will be internationally famous the artist said she handed the camera back to her dancers one of them focused on her striped arm which appeared on the middle of the three screens these go up in my picture gallery she said you can sign it if you want or just tell your friends what to look for the man who was as red as the stripe hed painted said he didnt need all that recognition youre the artist he said you get the credit he bowed to her awkwardly and left the platform to another burst of applause after that several other people felt bold enough to draw on the artist no one was able to match any of the elaborate paintings that kept flashing on the screens but after a bit theyd covered her breasts with blue and green streaks and someone had drawn a yellow smiley face on one of the artists shoulder blades mr contreras grew more disturbed as the painting progressed he wanted to have it out with petra but jake persuaded him that a noisy club wasnt the place for an argument max sizing up my neighbors agitation said he had a meeting in the morning and lotty had an early surgery call they were leaving they would take mr contreras with them the old man grudgingly agreed much to my relief the thought of riding home with him while he vented his frustration on me was a treat i hadnt been looking forward to i gave lotty a grateful kiss and returned to the table with jake mr contreras tried to force petra to leave with them but she gave him her biggest brightest smile and said shed stay until the end of the act the body artist kept up a sort of patter while people painted on her occasionally someone would say something that seemed to genuinely interest her but most of her responses sounded aloof almost amused at our expense even while her words celebrated the community of artists in which we found ourselves one heavyset man walked up to the platform with a kind of rolling gait that made me think of a beat cop in fact as he bent to inspect the cans of paint i was pretty sure i could see the outline of his holster i wondered for a moment if he was going to try to arrest the artist for indecent exposure but he dipped a brush into the can of red paint after inspecting her body for bare spaces he drew some numbers and letters on her buttockseveryone else had been too squeamish to touch those he picked up the camera himself and pointed it at his masterpiece ignoring the applause and jeers from the audience he rolled back to his seat just as jake and i decided we also had seen and heard enough another woman stepped onto the small stage she didnt say anything to the body artist or the audience but began painting with the kind of focus none of the other volunteers had shown the two dancers had mimed enthusiasm throughout the show but now they seemed genuinely engaged by the work in progress they began filming and we all saw the womans work stylized flames that covered the artists back were overlaid with an intricate design scrolls of fleursdelis done in pink and gray the painter was adding a face to her composition when the tattooed man began shouting again are you dissing me bitch are you dissing me chad stood so quickly his buddies couldnt hold him his chair clattered to the floor and he tried barging past the customer tables to the stage by that time the bouncer had reached chad he used some moves that i hadnt seen since i left south chicago chad was doubled over and out the door in under a minute the bouncers speed and ability subdued chads buddies when a server suggested they settle their tab and join their friend outside one of them pulled a fistful of bills from his pocket and laid them on the table without counting or even looking at the check all four left as quickly as they could the owner a tall woman about my age climbed onto the small stage in her own way she was as striking as the body artist her hair was black except for a streak of white that fell artistically over her forehead and she was wearing a big white satin shirt tucked into skintight black pants she introduced herself as olympia koilada we all owe a big round of applause to our body artist have fun but be safe use protection she flashed a peace sign and walked back to the bar canned music began to throb and whine through the room and the noise in the audience grew loud with relief jake and his friends decided to take the raven out for a late dinner he was goodnatured enough to include petra but she announced that she was staying on to talk to the manager i heard them say at the bar that theyre shorthanded and i need more work petra said you know my ninetofive were kind of going day to day on whether well even have jobs at christmas so this would be great a club job would be great i said it would be even more unreliable than your day gig petra was working for a webbased design firm have you seen the way people are tipping petras eyes sparkled i used to work as a hostess you know in the summers at my folks country club the waitstaff never pulled this kind of change and we still had some pretty good tips i wondered if i should try to do more to stop her petra was only twentythree and in some ways i felt responsible for her shed stopped taking money from her parents after learning about a serious crime her father had spent his life covering up and she wasnt used to looking after herself fulltime jake waited a little impatiently while i tried to talk petra out of applying for work at the club dont be a snob vic he said i was a roadie in clubs like this all through my twenties didnt do me any harm lets go i told the others wed catch up with them at the restaurant i followed him into the bitter night the backup at the parking lot exit looked as though it might take twenty minutes but an alley ran behind the club i turned my mustang around and eased my way against the flow of the traffic petra was right it was awesome jake said and at the same time disturbing especially those dancers in their burkas i suppose anyone doing art is manipulating public emotions i do it myself so why does her expression seem to cross a boundary its the body i said you cant get away from it whether we like it or not we live in a world where the exposed female body is a turnon music only suggests the erotic or the private self the body artist forces you to see the private maybe bass players we have a reputation as the crudest of musicians so if im uncomfortable at a public display of nudity it makes me think im not a genuine bassist i will confess in private and to you alone that i sat there feeling like i didnt have enough clothes on i laughed speaking under cover of darkness i also confesshello what are they doing i had turned in to the alley chad and his friends were hovering outside club gouges back entrance i stopped the car vic please dont get out to fight them ive had enough excitement for one night i never get to have any fun i whined but added of course im not going to fight them but i do think the clubs nifty bouncer needs to know these guys are hanging around i made sure the car doors were locked and pulled out my cell phone but when the quintet saw us they moved on down the alley ice packed with dirt made the going treacherous and one of the gang tripped and fell which gave me time to trail them while i looked up the clubs phone number by the time id bumped through the ice and potholes to the street the men were circling back along lake street toward the main entrance to the club vic not that im trying to tell you what to do but you know im not going to risk my fingers if you go after them jake said and im pining for bouillabaisse his tone was light but he wasnt jokinghis fingers were his livelihood i didnt know whether to laugh or feel hurt do you really see me as someone whos so pining to fight that id take on five drunks twice my size and half my age my only weapon right now is my cell phone ive seen you come home covered in burns and bruises ive never been with you when you got them how was i to know jake squeezed my shoulder to take the edge off his words of course when i used to cruise south chicago in my cousin boombooms wake there were plenty of times i found myself fighting for no reason i could ever figure out i decided not to tell jake about it it would be hard to persuade him that id matured since then someone finally picked up the clubs phone a latenight l clattered overhead as she answered and at her end the music and crowd noise were just as deafening but she finally realized i wanted to speak to the owner olympia koilada by this time i was back in front of the club in time to see chad and his friends get into their rav olympia didnt seem concerned about the guys i dont know who you are or why you think its your businessyoure a private eyeand you think your nose belongs in my business i dont think so controversy brings people to the club and the artist knows it she also knows how to look after herself ive got a live show coming on in two minutes ciao the girders to the lake street l and all the similar suvs streaming in and out of the clubs parking lot made it hard to keep an eye on the rav i finally gave in to jakes plea that we get to the restaurant brush attack the next monday at breakfast i was startled to see my name jump off the heraldstars around town page in a small paragraph about the body artist and club gouge angry customers who objected to her nudity tried to lie in wait to attack her but local pi v i warshawski quickly sent them about their business i called the club owner to find out if shed leaked the story do you know who used my name to prop up some bogus story what do you mean bogus story you called me yourself to tell me that bunch of guys was hanging around the club i figured i was a little short with you so i did you a favor giving you credit next time hire your own publicist ms koilada those punks didnt object to your artists nudity i dont know what pissed them off whether it was her mocking them with her cat drawing or the woman who was painting her when they charged the stage but but nothing she snapped you dont know what they objected to neither do i but the idea of a nude artist offends some people and titillates others i interrupted in turn so this little story will bring more people to club gouge congratulations i hung up making a face at myself a phone call like that was a waste of energy and i should have known better than to make it i went down to my office and tried to put the club out of my mindnot so easy since my cousin petra had taken a job there i learned this from her texts she like totally loved the club tps r aweso cows gr i got the tps but didnt understand the cows petra sent back one impatient word coworkers two weeks after our outing to club gouge petra bounced in midafternoon on sunday mr contreras her honorary uncle sal so adores her that she was taken aback when he started lecturing her over taking the job at club gouge youre a young gal petra warshawski but not too young to know right from wrong what are you up to wanting to work in a degenerate place like that and thatthat woman that olympia who owns itshes no better than a madam in a brothel i saw plenty like her in italy during the war and i know one when i see one are you talking about the body artist she is not degenerate her performance is totally cuttingedge you live like in a cocoon here you dont know anything about art or youd know that just because someone is naked up on a stage it doesnt mean theyre a bad person if some man painted a picture of her naked and hung it in a museum youd think wow hes a totally great artist well shes a totally great artist and she doesnt need a man or a museum to make her famous you saw her vic explain to uncle sal how shes reclaiming her body and how that helps all women reclaim their own bodies i eyed her thoughtfully in the seven months id spent around my cousin this was the first time shed revealed any awareness of womens issues in the arts or anywhere else pretty sophisticated analysis petra the body artist tell you this or did you think about it in the middle of the night and have one of those lightbulb moments petra flamed crimson and shifted her weight in her highheeled boots does she have a name i asked of course she does but she likes to be called the body artist so we all respect that so what did you think of her if you can say it without being a total snot youre right i was a snot sorry i found it disquieting to watch her the way she talks the way she holds herself she seems contemptuous of her audience or at least of people like me maybe shes bold and heroic turning stereotypes on their heads and i only was uncomfortable because im not liberated enough but maybe liberated mr contreras exploded sitting stark stone naked in front of an audience im ashamed of the both of you victoria youre a grown woman you shouldnt sit back while the kid gets into bad company and petra this isnt healthy watching a woman take off her clothes in public he was seriously upset using our real names like that instead of cookie and peewee petra made her pouty face and went to put her arms around him she danced him back down the stairs hoping to coax him back to his more usual good humor or perhaps to persuade him that the body artist wasnt degenerate as i was shutting the door behind them i heard her say but really uncle sal you cant tell me you didnt look at girlie magazines when you were in the army why is someone nude onstage any worse when i was alone i felt hollow restless i didnt want to be with mr contreras and petra and their argument i wanted a relaxing evening with good friends i could hear jake across the hall playing with a group of students or colleagues maybe girlfriends and tried to suppress a sense of jealous exclusion at the end of january he was leaving for a european tour between rehearsals and the runup to christmasthe busiest season for a musicianmost of his life was spent away from me these days i cleaned the weeks dishes out of the kitchen sink and then inspired by jakes group did a few breathy vocal exercises finally out of nervous irritability i looked up the body artists website it was an odd site she had a blog which was mostly a series of ramblings on women in the arts but the bulk of the site was dedicated to her body painting you could actually buy pieces of flesh as she called themphotographs of the various images wed seen last night at club gouge each picturepriced from a hundred to a thousand dollars depending on size format and contenthad the number of buyers clocked under it the most popular were the lilies growing out of her vagina and the winking blue eye looking at her site added to my rumpled feelings who was exploiter who was exploited i finally went down to mr contrerass place and collected the dogs petra was curled up on the couch mitch at her side but she was still arguing her case with my neighbor i took the dogs and fled before the combatants could drag me back into battle the december night was cold but clear we ran east all the way to the lakefront by the time we returned home petra had left i gave the dogs back to mr contreras but refused to let him reopen his grievance over the body artist and club gouge pitchers and catchers report to mesa in two weeks i said everything will get better after that except cubs fans dont go trying no fake smiles on me doll im not in the mood spring training means lowlifes getting ready to piss on the grass mr contreras was a sox fan hed grown up west of old comiskey and he hated being here in wrigleyville during the baseball season at least loutish cubs fans meant a change of grievance for him but i didnt feel like listening to that either the year was winding down and my own workload was heavy hard times meant a big upswing in fraud even though my clients were slower in paying their bills and negotiating reduced fees for big inquiries i still had more business than i could comfortably handle the only times i saw jake were when i could make it to one of his concerts now and then id go out for a late supper with him and some of his fellow musicians we spent christmas day together and then he left to visit his mother and sister in seattle lotty and max flew to morocco over christmas petra went skiing in utah with her mother and sisters even mr contreras left although it was only to drive to hoffman estates near ohare where he spent a few days with his unhappy daughter and her two sons i didnt like the feeling of isolation home alone in chicago i put the dogs in a kennel and flew down to mexico city for a week of art music and warmth the return to chicago the day after new years felt in some ways like the descent to the underworld no sun bitter cold sick friends and a dozen messages from unhappy clients who wanted to know if i really cared about their business or if i was just living it up on their money within twentyfour hours sun and dancing seemed as remote as the end of the galaxy the thursday after i came home i left a client meeting in the loop that had run until almost nine i was walking east toward the dearborn l imagining dinner a drink and a bath when petra texted me rgent biz cll surgent business call at once i felt young and hip when i realized i had translated it effortlessly vic you have to come over right now she cried when i phoned over where i demanded the club someone just tried to kill the body artist i ducked into a building entrance so i could speak to her away from the street noise and the cold when have you called the cops she wont let us she says its nothing can you please come let you you dont need her per petra cut me off with a hasty gotta go table is screaming for their drinks and hung up i thought wistfully of my bath and my bottle of johnnie walker but hopped around the slushy curbs on dearborn and continued east to wabash and the lake street l this time of night the l is full with students getting out of night school and weary late workers like me heading home most of my companions had little white wires snaking from pockets to ears making them look as though their heads were being transfused a number of them were texting at the same time or listening to their earclips they looked like the descendants of alien nation getting commands from the mother ship i got off the train at ashland and hurried to club gouge as fast as i could on the icy sidewalk even though it was a weeknight the parking lot was almost full the people coming and going through the clubs doors seemed to be chattering normally not with the hushed excitement theyd show around a crime scene the bouncer was inspecting peoples bags and backpacks before letting them in that was the only sign that something unusual had happened no one protestedwere all inured these days to being searched pretty soon well have to get undressed before we walk into our apartment buildings at night and well probably submit to that without a murmur when i reached the front of the line i showed the bouncer my pi license and explained that petra had summoned me the bouncer mark looked me up and down but nodded me into the club i dont know if the artistll talk to you he said but shes in the back her performance starts in about twenty minutesill get petra to take you to her what happened mark shuffled his feet shell tell you herself im not a hundred percent sure i looked at him narrowly wondering what he didnt want to reveal but went into the club olympia was behind the bar helping the two bartenders keep up with the orders as the body artists performance time was drawing near the club was filling and drink orders were piling up olympia was striking with her dyed black hair and the thick streak of white over her left eye she was dressed in black and white too as if she like the body artist were a canvas on display tonight she was wearing a pantsuit that shimmered like oilcloth under the lights the jacket was open to her breastbone where you could see the fringed top of a white camisole my cousin was easy to find at fiveeleven with her halo of spiky hair adding another three inches she towered over most of the room when i tapped her arm she finished delivering drinks to four tables without missing an order and then waltzed me behind the stage to the small changing room set aside for performers she knocked perfunctorily on the door but opened it without waiting for an answer the body artist was sitting in the lotus position eyes shut breathing slowly she was already naked except for her thong which was covered with the same kind of cream foundation paint as her body close up she looked more like a mannequin than before which was somehow more disturbing than her nudity petra cleared her throat uncertainly uh this is my cousin the detective you know i told you i was calling her when you said you didnt want the police here vic body artist body artist vic ive got to get back to my station she backed out of the room the feathery ends of her hair brushing against the top of the door frame the artist looked up at me i dont want to be disturbed before my performance come back later nope i said later im going to be home ive been working since eight this morning and im beat who attacked you i dont know where did it happen here in my dressing room the first time i was here some big guy with tattoos tried to attack you was it him it was an indirect assault not a mugging were you attacked at all i asked or is this a publicity stuntwill i see a paragraph in tomorrows paper that i repelled yet another customer infuriated by your nudity the artists eyes were hard to read inside the mask of paint it was a real assault she rose with the fluid motion of a dancer and showed me her left leg beneath the foundation paint i could just make out the long line of a cut a piece of glass was hidden in one of my brushes its in the garbage now i put on my gloves and extracted the brush from the pile of tissues and sponges that was filling the can it was soft made of sable the bristles about an inch wide and two inches long a glass shard had been attached to the bristle head with a piece of wire painted the same color as the handle even so it was easy to spot how come you didnt see the glass i asked ive done this so many times i dont think about it she said i unroll my brushes stick them in the paint containers ready to take onstage and apply my foundation so your brush was rigged before you got here tonight maybe but i dropped everything off here this afternoon so that i could run some errands and i dont lock the case she waved a hand at a large metal suitcase under the dressing table you need to give this to the cops if theres poison on it or tetanus ill get a tetanus shot tomorrow morning but i dont want the police here for the first time she sounded agitated even angry why not someone injured you i dont want police in here slobbering over me and i dont want to put clothes on over my foundation period end of story olympia had appeared in the doorway without my noticing who are you oh right warshawski the detective who craves anonymity the artist has to go onstage in five minutes and youre going to hurt her performance badgering her like this you need to leave i asked olympia the same question id put to the body artist about the tattooed guy at the table of drunks whod tried to jump the artist the night i came with jake and his friends chad i think i heard his pals call him drunks dont have the subtlety for something like this the artist said she was staring at olympia when she spoke the heavy foundation made it impossible to read her expression but it flashed through my mind that olympia had rigged the brush or at least that the artist thought she had get out now warshawski olympia said go sit at a table in the backwell treat you to a drink thanks olympia but im way past my limit tonight over objections from both women i put the brush into a plastic bag the body artist had used to hold cotton balls wrote down the date and place id found it and tucked it into a pocket of my handbag on my way out of the club i scanned the crowd i didnt see chad or his friends but the heavyset man who looked like a cop was there again he was nursing a drink at a table by himself morose offduty policeman without friends the kind who makes headlines by using his weapon in a crowded bar another person sitting close to the front also looked familiar i studied her for a moment and then decided she was the painter whose work had provoked chad her thin shoulders were hunched up around her ears her hands were on the table tensed so tightly that i could see the tendons raised across the back she too seemed to be alone individual of interest it was a week later that petra dropped by my office on her way home from her day job she was drooping even her spiky hair had collapsed and she looked less like a radiant valkyrie than a houseplant in need of water i was in the middle of a complicated transaction with an ajax insurance auditor trying to unravel a fraud committed by one of their claims adjustors but i gave my cousin an extrabright smile to show that i loved her and was delighted to see her while i talked the accountant through the entries id made in my audit software petra wandered around my office she fiddled with stacks of documents studied her teeth in the glass over my antonella mason painting and then spun a crystal paperweight a gift from a grateful client on its edge she was so distracting that i finally beckoned her over and told her to go across the street for a couple of espressos by the time shed returned her hair damp from the snow that was starting to fall id finished my phone call with ajax i sat her down in the alcove reserved for clients the sole clutterfree place in my office whats up babe i uh vic did you ever find out who put that piece of glass in the body artists paintbrush no why has it happened again petra shook her head no i just wondered she had taken off her ski jacket underneath she had on a big sweater topped by a fringed buckskin vest she wasnt taking money from her dad but her mother had restocked her closet during their christmas ski trip she started braiding and unbraiding the fringes on the vest i tried to curb my impatience she was troubled and like all troubled people who come to that corner alcove it was hard for her to get to the point i sent the brush up to a forensic lab i use i said the glass didnt have any germs or poisons on it and they couldnt lift any fingerprints from the handle do you think you know who did it petra looked up no no i dont but i sort of wondered the atmosphere at the club ever since that nightreally ever since after christmasits changed olympia is like i dont know youre wondering if olympia spiked the brush i cut into her dithering she made a face its nothing so concrete but theres this woman who comes in almost every time the body artist is performingi think her name is nadiaand she does this same picture over and over shes really good compared to all the weirdos and sleazoids who want to paint their names or you know something gross but was she there when jake and i came right after thanksgiving she was painting pink hats and a womans face and she got that tattooed guy all wound up thats her well olympia and the artist have been arguing about her its almost likewell the way they talkits sort of like olympia and the artist are lovers or were loversi dont knowsomething like that and now this nadia is coming between them or something it is tiresome when people bring their love life to work but unless you feel threatened i wouldnt worry about it just stay out of the middle or quit if it gets too rocky im not a baby i dont care who sleeps with who although it is like being back in tenth grade when they flaunt it at you she leaned forward in her earnestness her hands on her knees vic i know you and uncle sal both were kind of down on me working at a club but when i started there i loved it i loved everything about it the energy my coworkers the acts olympia shes amazing her music is so cuttingedge shes so bold shes only a few years younger than my granmy moms mombut shes so together i loved working for her now though she doesnt seem the same and its not just the stuff with nadia and the artist her voice trailed away and she started pulling at a loose thread in her jeans hiding her face from me whats going on petra what arent you telling me drugs i added sharply when she didnt answer she looked up at me her mascaraed lashes brushing her brows i dont know i mean i know people there are usingyoure running around waiting tables you see whos putting stuff up their noses or into their drinks or whateverbut i never saw any sign that olympia was using or even dealing i did ask markmark alexander her bouncerand he says olympia doesnt tolerate drugs in the club at least not staff bringing them in i nodded but took marks assurances with a grain of salt if people were doing drugs in the club it was because olympia was turning a blind eye its really nadia and the artist that seem to causewell they dont cause itbut whenever nadia shows up even though all she does is paint on the artist everyone is out of whack like those guys the tattooed guy and his friends the one guy chad he gets so furious i think he might have a heart attack on the spot i dont know why he keeps coming back but its like he cant leave the club alone and olympia shes like let him come in as long as he isnt violent because his gang runs up these huge tabs she grinned briefly and then his buddies leave these humungous tips because they feel embarrassed so of course in a way we all welcome them on the nights they show up she started tearing pieces from her coffee cup the problem is this guy has been hitting on me and when i put him down olympia behaved really oddly what guy i demanded chad no chad only cares about nadia i mean shes the person who winds him up or maybe its the artistits hard to be sure this older guy hes kind of crude and he cant keep his hands to himself so first i kidded him you know going whoa buster seems like your fingers kind of forgot curfew better tell em to stay home where they belong well that was like slapping a whale with a goldfishtotally useless so next time i kicked him good on the shin and he talked to olympia and she came to me and said i couldnt go around kicking customers so i explained what happened and she said are you sure and i said i know what a hand feels like when its inside my pants and she said if i overlooked it thered be something extra in my pay envelope but quit i said flatly if olympia is running drugsand a bar is a perfect laundromat for drug moneyyou dont want to be there when the cops shut her down and if shes pimping for some sleazoid you need to run for the exit i will if i have to but vic its almost four hundred a week in tips im getting there pretty much taxfree and my day job i dont know how much longer theyll keep me on would youi know its a lot to askbut could you what shoot him i asked when she broke off that made her laugh if you could do it and not get caught id be your slave for life no but could you check him out do you think see who he is see if theres something you could do to make him stop do you have his name i asked olympia calls him rodney im not sure what his last name isstrangerdanger maybe she scrolled through her cell phone and held it out to me this is what he looks like shed taken his picture from above when she was passing his table it wasnt a good likeness but it didnt surprise me to see it was the guy id pegged as an offduty cop petra wasnt working tonight but she said shed be at the club the next night i promised to stop in although it bugged me that my cousin insisted on staying on at the joint petra zipped up her ski jacket her face brighter now that shed unburdened herself and gotten a promise of help even her hair matted down by her ear warmer seemed to be springing up vicdont tell uncle sal okay hes already on me about the club being so degenerate and all and sweet pea im not so sure hes wrong if i see coke or ecstasy or some damned thing passing between olympia and mr strangerdanger you are quitting on the spot you hear sure vic i promise she held up three fingers in the girl scout salute and danced out the door i finished my number crunching for ajax insurance the claims manager seemed to have the intelligence of an eggplant he should have been able to generate the report himself but a hundred fifty an houri wouldnt complain what on earth is going on i returned to the club the following night the body artist was appearing and the joint was alive practically shaking with twenty and thirtysomethings rodney was there and so were chad and his friends i didnt see nadia i took a table near the back but olympia swept over as i was pulling out a chair at one of the rear tables tonight she was wearing a black sweater with a deep cleavage over black velvet pants her touch of white was a corsage of feathers that brushed the swell of her breasts that tables reserved warshawski i dont have a free seat in the house youll have to stand not a problem olympia i got up and moved to the railing that created a kind of foyer between the audience space and the club entrance i wasnt going to give her an excuse to throw me out by losing my temper and theres a twentydollar cover on the night the body artist appears all drinks are six dollars more for name brands i stuck a hand inside my sweater and pretended to be fumbling with my bra want the money now she frowned a private eye is bad for business warshawski if you interrupt the show or harass the artist ill see that youre thrown out ill tell you whats bad for business ms koilada you dealing drugs or laundering money or whatever you and rodney are up to i want you to know that my cousin petras safety is very important to me she flicked her eyes across the room again petra is safe here no one will hurt her shes popular with my customers and with the staff she has the kind of goodnatured high spirits that make a server popular some of our customers may get overenthusiastic in their reaction to her but she seems levelheaded id be surprised to know she was blowing up something trivial into something major me too thats why i took her reaction seriously olympia even if im not a goodnatured highspirited kind of gal you could do worse than trust me with your problems if this guy rodney is posing a threat maybe being a detective makes you think you can pry into peoples affairs whether they want it or not but my club is my business not yours who is rodney i asked is he a cop are you deaf i told you to mind your own business she turned on her heel the club needed too much supervising on a packed night like tonight for her to waste more time arguing with me i didnt see her stop to talk to rodney but she must have because he got up from his table and came over to me girlie you put one foot wrong here and ill personally stuff your body in a snowbank girlie you sound like a bad movie script rodney his lips curved into something like a sneer maybe but you could look like part of a bad movie yourself if you try to mess with me got it i leaned against the railing and yawned go put on a sheet and dance around a cross if you want to scare people that how you got olympia so rattled he pulled his hand back as if he were going to hit me but thought better of it in the nick of time no one messes with me girlie not you and not that smartmouthed cousin of yours either people who mess with me or my cousin tend to spend a lot of years in stateville rodney when they arent picking themselves out of guttersor snowbanks ask around anyone will tell you the same now go back to your chair the band is packing up the artist will be onstage soon and the rest of the audience will be peevish if you block their view his face scrunched together in ugly lines like a thwarted toddlers he flipped his coat open so i could see the outsize gun in his shoulder holster but i pretended to be looking at the stage he finally hissed just watch yourself girlie and swaggered back to his seat a few seconds before the houselights went down i made a face in the dark maybe i hadnt changed so much from those days of trailing around south chicago with boomboom looking for fights the lights came back up and the routine followed its usual course with the artist appearing magically on her stool the audience reacted in their usual way gasping with amazement at the intricacy of the work on the plasma screens shifting nervously with sexual excitement at the more graphic imagery rodney at his central table was staring moodily at his sixth bottle of beer he didnt seem to be in the mood to paint tonight nadia had appeared without my noticing perhaps when the lights were down or maybe when rodney was threatening me she was at a table near the front twirling her hair around her fingers she didnt wait as she had the first time id seen her for the rest of the room to paint i studied chad while nadia painted but he seemed to have himself under control maybe he was getting used to her or maybe his friends had persuaded him to stay calm he seemed to be more intent on nadias drawings than on nadia herselfhe was watching the screens onstage where the webcams were broadcasting her work again she was creating her intricate design id remembered them as pink hats but they were pinkandgray scrolls when she finished covering the artists back with them she began drawing a womans face a beautiful young woman with dark curly hair and then she took a palette knife and slashed it i looked over at chad he was sweating and his tattooed arms were shaking his buddies were holding him but he didnt make any effort to get out of his chair as soon as nadia had finished she went back to her table and gathered her coat and backpack from the floor she skirted the back of the stage and disappeared chad suddenly broke away from his friends and followed her most of the club including the waitstaff was focused on the artist who was stretching and preening to make nadias work as visible as possible those who saw chad might have assumed he was heading for the mens room since the toilets were along a narrow corridor that also led backstage i pushed my way through the crowd at the back as fast as i could a young man in a worn army windbreaker hurried after me hed been with chad at their table his face pitted and craggy despite his youth was unmistakable we got backstage just in time to see the alley door shut behind chad man dont be doing something stupid now the guy seemed to be talking to himself more than me but we sprinted together to the door so many cars filled the area that we couldnt see chad or nadia at first but we heard chad shouting why are you doing this who sent you here as we slipped and stumbled along the icy gravel of the parking lot toward his voice chad under one of the streetlamps was standing over nadia he wasnt touching her but he was leaning down so his face was close to hers hed left his coat in the bar and the lamp picked up the tattoos along his bare forearms he was holding a black object something that looked like an outsize oven mitt under her face even in her bulky parka nadia looked frail next to him we reached them in time to hear nadia say who sent you are you spying on me while chad was yelling dont pretend you dont know what this is why are you doing this to me chads friend sprinted to his side and wrapped an arm across his neck affection and restraint in one gesture you dont want to be out here in the cold man come on lets go back inside warm up get another beer i pulled nadia away leading her across the parking lot toward lake street nadia whats going on here why is chad so upset by your painting who are you she blinked at me my names v i warshawski im a private investigator and if theres something a detective go to hell she wrenched free of my hand im sick and tired of people spying on me tell them that tell who that im not spying on you i just want to know ive seen you in the club i know what youre doing there no one is going to stop me from painting i dont want to stop you please nadia can we talk where its warmer its brutal out here we cant talk at all if you come near me again ill ill spray pepper in your eyes she broke away from me stomped down lake street to the l stop i watched as she climbed up to the platform puzzled by the whole exchange chads and nadias accusations of spy versus spy made them seem like a married couple in the middle of a bad divorce but what was the black oblong chad had held under her nose when i returned to the club the body artist was finishing her act no one had painted over nadias work but the artists front and arms were covered with crude drawings stripes a tictactoe board and a few sunflowers all of you are amazing amazing artists feel good about who you are in the world how creative you are and come see your work on my website at embodiedartcom remember its a cold cruel world out there but art can keep you warm even if it cant keep you safe she held up her hands in a peace sign and left the stage olympia kept the images running on the screens while she turned canned music back on and the audience relaxed into explosions of laughter the release of sexual tension made everyone order drinks and my cousin and the rest of the waitstaff were running around madly for the next twenty minutes id had enough of everyone at club gouge but i went back to the body artists dressing room thinking i should at least talk to her olympias bouncer was standing outside her door sorry but she doesnt want to be disturbed after her performance it takes a long time for her to clean up and shes exhausted i know just how she feels i smiled and ducked under his arm and was in the dressing room before he could grab me he followed me as the artist started squawking in outrage id wondered if she wanted privacy to do drugs after her act but she was in fact putting some kind of paintremoving cream on her arms and legs then wiping it off with hand towels the floor around her was littered with paintsmeared towels i wondered if she was a big enough star that someone cleaned up after her or if she had to do her own laundry ms artist did you tell nadia i was in the club to spy on her the artist kept wiping herself off with towels and refused to say anything but her flat almost transparent eyes studied me in the mirror shes sure shes being spied on i said is she paranoid or is someone really after her youd have to ask her wouldnt you the artist said nadia waits in here doesnt she while the band plays she gets special treatment from you and that annoys olympia but it makes me think shes told you why shes so nervous are she and chad in the middle of a bad divorce the artist smiled for the first time with contempt not good humor im not going to help you build a dossier on anyone she said now its time for you to leave unless you want to clean my cunt for me she used the shocking word deliberately as if to goad me into blushing or flinching i looked at her steadily until she bit her lips in discomfort and turned away mark get her out of here or call the cops mark took my shoulder you heard her dont make me break your arm or something or your hand i said or the mirrors in here im not going to fight you mark at least not tonight i let him escort me out of the room feeling grumpy with everyone including myself i had been an ineffectual cousin with petra and a lousy detective i felt even worse the following night that was when nadia was murdered that was when i was up past two am talking with terry finchley and his team blood blood blood by the time i finally finished talking to terry finchley to lesser cops saw my cousin safely into her pathfinder and argued with olympia it was almost three none of us got much out of our night together i learned from finchley that nadias last name was guaman i learned she had been a graphic designerhence her skill with the paintbrushand that she had turned twentyeight this past fall i learned that she had died from the massive bleeding caused by two bullets entering her chest and that she had been shot at a range of about fifteen feetthe distance from the back door of the club to the alley where the shooters had waited while i was talking to terry one of his team came over with a report about chad and his friends no one could provide a last name for any of them but finchley took their descriptions and put out an alert they hadnt been in the club tonight but that didnt mean chad hadnt been lying in wait for nadia when terry asked me what i knew about chad and his friends i only shrugged i dont know why i didnt tell him about the heated exchange id heard between chad and nadia the previous night maybe it was nadias vulnerability or the fact that id cradled her in my arms as she died or the discomfort id felt when she accused me of spying on her she thought someone was after her and id thought she might be paranoid now she was dead i didnt feel like discussing it with the police i told finchley most of the rest of what i knew including finding the glass in the body artists paintbrush he demanded that i retrieve it from the cheviot labs but he also revealed that hed been able to pry the body artists name out of her karen buckley not a very jazzy name for a stripper maybe thats why she wouldnt let anyone around here know it finchley added shes not a stripper i said shes an artist and a fine one a woman who takes off her clothes on a stage for men to drool over is a stripper in my book bobbys right i said youve been breathing the rare air on south michigan way too long you need to buy yourself a new book what about this guy rodney you find anything out about him what guy rodney finchley demanded didnt anyone here mention him big guy with a gut looks like an offduty cop with a big old ninemillimeter under his jacket it looked like an hk when he shoved his armpit in my face and why did he do that vic finchley said you werent in his face by any chance were you i was telling him to stop sticking his hand into my cousins pants when shes waiting tables does that constitute being in his face to you and whether it does or not does that mean he gets to wave a gun at me finchley pressed his lips together hes a good cop and a good detective but hes close to a police sergeant i used to date he still holds it against me that conrad rawlings got shot while he was involved with me the human heart or thyroid gland or whatever it is that controls our emotions is too tangled for me to understand conrad survived but our affair didnt and ive never been sure which the finch blames me for morethe breakup or the shooting finchley sent an underling to fetch olympia to the small stage where the police were conducting interrogations she looked briefly frightened or maybe angry when he asked her about rodney but then gave him her brightest smile and said im sure i know who vic means hes a regular he loves karens show butare you sure his name is rodney vic i thought it might be roger or sydney i gasped at the brazenness of her lies but before i could speak finchley was asking if she had had any complaints from her staff or from other customers i gave one of vics cousins a job here and vic is a mite overprotective maybe jumps too fast to conclusions if petra cant handle a little goodnatured kidding with the customers then im afraid she shouldnt work in a club is that why you comp his drinks olympia i asked to encourage the goodnatured kidding and why you offered petra a bonus if shed overlook his gropiness olympias eyes seemed to glitter but that might just have been the bright lights on the stage your cousin needs to get a handle on her imagination i dont comp drinks here i know shes young but this is a bad economy i can take my pick of waitstaffi dont need petra warshawski she turned back to finchley leaning so close that the white feathers of her corsage almost tickled his nose detective im sorry vic is trying to involve you in her cousins problems when everyone knows it was that disturbed guy who must have shot poor nadia chad you mean yes weve heard about him well keep our eyes open a last name would help olympia gave her best imitation of a silly ignorant female spreading her hands with a little hiccup of a laugh we dont seem to go in for last names here i only learned poor nadias from you tonight i dont know rogersor rodneys if vic insistsand i dont know chads either while officer milkova took olympia back to her office the finch looked at me you may be telling the truth vic guy may be rodney not roger he may have wandering hands and she may comp his drinks but i dont have the resources to check all that out unless it turns out that nadia guaman was shot with a ninemillimeter hk shes very good ms olympia koilada i guess depending on what good means to you smooth as silk lingeriegood like that i guess theres some relationship between olympia and rodney more than customer and patron i dont know if hes selling drugs here or is blackmailing her but its important to her that he be kept happy ill keep that in mind vic finchley said his voice tight right now the most likely person of interest is this guy chad once weve found him well see if we need to look for rodney if your guys name is rodney i got to my feet good night terry let me know how it all turns out you have to sign a statement warshawski like everyone else when you have something for me to sign you know where to find me i climbed off the shallow stage and started toward the exit but before i could get out the front door olympia hustled me into a cubbyhole behind the bar that served as her office there was just room for her computer table and a stool she stood so close to me that i could smell the mix of sweat cigarettes and opium in her body stocking why cant you mind your own business the cops are on the trail of this guy chad why did you have to drag one of my best customers out for them to sniff at because hes a violent guy sports a weapon isnt afraid to show it in an effort to intimidate not that i really care but what hold does he have on you youre the one whos a problem in my club ever since you started coming here ive had nothing but trouble save your femmy ignorance for rodney it wont work on terry finchley and it definitely wont work on me youre the one who said controversy was great for your business for all i know youre the person who put glass in the artists paintbrush how dare you make an accusation like that against me in my own club i leaned against the thin plywood wall olympia i said im so tired im about to fall over i dont care what youre hiding or doing as long as its not something criminal that might hurt my cousin but dont try to jack me around i dont have the patience or the time for it i pried open the door but olympia grabbed my arm im sorry im beside myself inadia getting shot like thatits so horrible okay try to think clearly tell me whats really on your mind why are you protecting rodney but sacrificing chad who also seems to be a good customer one who pays for his own drinks if i thought rodney had killed nadia so you agree thats his first name what about his last name or have you paid for protection youre not willing to sacrifice the color drained from her face what do you know about him i tried to push my tired brain into sorting out what she was revealing not enough apparently but believe me i have the resources to help me find out more i ignored her bleating and stomped through the club to the rear exit i picked my way across the ruts in the clubs parking lot my path well lighted by the blue strobes on the squad cars it was a disconcerting juxtaposition the strobes outside the club and the strobes inside as if there were two performance spaces it worried me that both looked artificial as if a woman shot at close range were no more real than a naked woman on a stool painting her body as soon as i got home i ran inside to turn on the shower while i waited for the water to heat i inspected myself in the mirror i did have blood in my hair i stripped and dropped my clothes in the tub i didnt know if it would ruin the sweater to get it wet like this but i wasnt sure id ever feel able to wear it again anyway i climbed into the shower and shampooed my hair twice i used a coarse brush to scrub my fingernails i climbed out and put my sodden clothes onto the radiator but i felt a trickle on my spine and shuddered it was only wateri was sure it was only waterbut i couldnt stop myself i climbed back under the shower i understood lady macbeths fetish now every time i got out i would feel blood on my scalp again it was only when the hot water ran out that i finally dried off and went to bed nadia and karen buckley the body artist filled my unquiet dreams buckley was in the parking lot painting the icepacked ruts under the blue strobes of the cop cars when i bent to see her work the ruts filled with blood olympia was trying to scoop it out with her hands before i could see it and as she paddled it between her legs it covered my cousin i tried to call a warning to petra but couldnt speak in the next instant rodney had grabbed petra and was forcing her face down in the blood alley nadia cried as she had in my arms alley i woke soaked in sweat and shivering nadia should have had a mother or a lover with her at her end she should have died in her great old age surrounded by her grandchildren her last thought shouldnt have been that she was dying in an alley with a stranger i got out of bed pulling the comforter around me and went into the kitchen it was sixthirty saturday morning the winter sky still black as midnight i sat crosslegged at the table staring sightlessly out the window the air gradually lightened to a ghostly graywhite but i couldnt see anything another snowstorm was slamming the city i went to the window searching for signs of life but couldnt see even across the alley to the apartments beyond finally hoping mr contreras would look after the dogs i went back to bed and slept until noon by sunday the storm had passed leaving eight inches of new snow and a bright bitter day in its wake after taking the dogs for a long exhausting walk i spent the afternoon with jake we watched some like it hot which inspired him to rummage through his storage closet for a ukulele he put on one of my sunhats and a skirt and preened around like marilyn monroe so effectively that i laughed away some of the horrors of friday night we were walking up racine for a late supper when olympia called me have you seen the news what club gouge is doubling its space in the wake of fridays homicide you have a weird sense of humor warshawski no the police found nadias killer that huge tattooed guy who kept tearing up the club they picked him up with the gun used to shoot nadia such a relief theyll let us open on tuesday that is a relief olympia and wonderful that you could keep such a focused perspective on nadias death i hung up on her demand to know just what do you mean by that nosmoking zone olympias call effectually ended my brief sense of wellbeing when we returned from dinner while jake practiced i looked up the news of nadias killer web news sites can be as obnoxious as any tabloidmaybe more so since its so easy to play with images from war hero to club killer screamed the heraldstars blog an anonymous tip led police to an apartment on a quiet street in lakeview where the troubled vet who allegedly murdered nadia guaman was living chad vishneski awarded the bronze star for valor in iraq couldnt take civilian life he returned with a ferocious anger that moved him from random acts of vandalism to the sinister when he began stalking and finally murdered a young graphic artist at club gouge on friday the chicago native was a lane tech football star who went to grand valley state on a scholarship but dropped out to join the army where he served four tours before his discharge last summer i clicked on a link to a video report and saw footage of a woman her face swollen with fury the police broke down the door she said the video showed a door with the wood splintered behind a yellow crime scene banner when i heard the noise i thought it was chad he was so angry all the time since he got home so i went in the hall to look only it was the police come to arrest him mona thats his mother shes out of town she let him sleep there even though everyone knows how unstable he is the condo board is going to have to take action maybe evict herwe could all have been murdered the video footage shifted to terry finchley standing solemnfaced in the lobby of the police headquarters building holding a gun in the approved fashionsuspended from a stick passed through the trigger guard we found the perpetrator passed out in bed with this baby glock next to him on the floor our forensics tests prove that this was the weapon that was used to kill nadia guaman someone asked if it was true that chad had been brought in drunk terry said chad had apparently taken a drug overdose he was in the intensive care ward at cermak hospital on the grounds of the cook county jail complex over at twentysixth and california i skimmed the rest of the story childhood friends recalled chad as a lighthearted funloving guy he hadnt been a football standout but hed been big enough to get a division ii scholarship back then his life was like girls beer games the war it gave him a reason to quit school and serve his country one high school buddy said when he got home he was so different just angry all the time the war really messed with his head you couldnt be in the same room with him the county had assigned him a public defender although right now it was an open question as to whether chad would regain consciousness let alone have enough brain function to stand trial still the pd gallantly told the press that his client was innocent that this was all a terrible mistake he didnt add that the county public defenders office didnt have the resources to sort out mistakes even if chads arrest turned out to be one poor nadia crossing paths with a distraught veteran poor chad another casualty of the endless iraq war poor public defender and poor mona vishneski chads mother shed been spending the winter in arizona looking after her own mother but was flying back to chicago to be with her son mona vishneski responded to the heraldstars invasive questions with the ageold litany of mothers chad is innocent hes a good boy he never would have killed a girl at a nightclub of course the maniacs in the blogosphere were out in full force some braying that nadia guaman had been asking for it since only an evil woman would frequent a place like club gouge others claimed that soldiers in iraq got a taste for blood because of all the iraqi civilians theyd been encouraged to torture and murder and vets were bound to take out their bloodlust on innocent civilians once they returned home still others cried out against liberals who hated america and wanted to ban guns obama used one of his constitutionhating liberal stooges to commit the murder so hed have an excuse to take away our guns warned one hysteric i switched off the computer chads life nadias death werent my business except for the way her face haunted me asleep and awake alley shed whispered her expression arrested almost happy as if this were a pleasant surprise to be dying in an icy parking lot i went to put my arms around jake he smiled but didnt stop playing his fingers dancing up and down the strings were sinuous erotic my grip on him tightened finally torn between desire and annoyance he put his bow down and went to bed with me in the morning i left while he was still asleep it was dark but i drove to the lakefront with the dogs and ran almost to the evanston border and back seven miles in the thin january air hoping to sweat nightmares of nadias blood out of my pores by the time we returned home the sky had lightened to a dull pewter when id showered and changed i accepted mr contrerass offer of french toast hed been a little hurt that id spent sunday with jakeits his job to fuss over me when ive been involved in violent crimebut this time his fussing had included ragging on me for getting petra involved with club gouge wed had a fight about it saturday night but after a twentyfourhour cooling off we were both prepared to let bygones be bygones more or less when i reached my office a car was parked in front engine running my first thought was the cops but this was a grimecrusted corolla with a lot of years under its hood as i typed in the code on my door keypad the driver turned off the engine and climbed out of the car all he had on against the cold was a worn khaki field jacket unzipped you the detective he pitched a cigarette butt into the gutter as he limped across the sidewalk im v i warshawski and yes im a detective what can i do for you mr vishneski im john vishneski his face was lined and scarred and his voice was a soft tired rumble i paused with my hand on the doorknob youre related to chad vishneski his dad he shook his head as if the relationship were new or surprising to him yes im his dad i shoved the door openit always sticks more in the winterand held it for chads father when he got inside vishneski carefully wiped his boots on the hallway mat three or four times the gesture of a man who wasnt sure he was welcome and wanted to minimize any evidence hed been there i directed vishneski to the couch in the client alcove and switched on the coffee machine in the back while i turned on lights and put my coat and case away vishneski sat completely still looking at nothing in particular the cold didnt seem to bother him even though my office was barely sixty degrees its such a barn of a place i keep the thermostat turned low on weekends i brought a space heater over from my desk and sat down myself im sorry for the trouble youre going through mr vishneski yep its a hard time he made it a statement not a complaint a minute or so went by when he didnt say anything else a lot of people have trouble getting to the point when theyre in the detectives office like visiting the doctor you have this lump in your breast but now youre in the office you dont want to ask you dont want to be told is chad your only child i asked just as a way to prod him into speaking my only one and i didnt even know he was in trouble not until one of the gals in the office called me saturday night my own boy and i didnt know thats what that iraq war did turned him into a boy who couldnt call his old man when he was in trouble would he have before the war he nodded we used to talk every day even when he was off at grand valley state even when he first deployed but then the war got to him the violence he saw his whole unit die around him during his third deployment and that did him in it was like he blamed me in a way blamed you i thought a lot about this he said i think he felt i should have protected him i was his dad see and he always oh looked up to me at least when he was small i worked construction my whole life although im a project manager now for mercurio i was stronger than most guys and chad he thought i could always take care of trouble around him or me and i always thought so too until he went off to iraq where no one could protect him its in my dreams all the time that i should have saved him from seeing what he had to see i couldnt save him and he couldnt talk to me anymore he stuck a hand reflexively inside his jacket pocket then looked a question youre right i said this is a nosmoking zone smoking in the cold outdoorsdont know why pneumonia hasnt carried me off by now he ran his fingers through his graying hair theyre holding my boy in a prison hospital ward do you know it cermak hospital ive been there terrible place terrible terrible place just getting in to see my own boy they searched me i had to take off all my clothes just to see my son strip searching its so humiliating when youre worried about your child the violation is even more acute my boy is in intensive care vishneski was continuing hes unconscious but they got him chained to the bed how can anyone get well if theyre chained to the bed like that i begged them let me move him to a real hospital where he can get real care but the judge he set the bail at seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars if i cant pay the bail chad has to stay there in the jail hospital i could hear my office phone begin to ring behind the partition monday morning everyone wanted me faster than yesterday why did you come to me mr vishneski he rubbed his bloodshot eyes they told me you were at this nightclub this club gouge they told me maybe you saw what happened maybe you can explain what that dead gal did to chad to get him so upset whos they mr vishneski oh secretary in the office the gal who called to tell me about chad she read the whole story going back to before christmas she came up with your name she says you were in the club the first time chad well started carrying on she looked you up on the computer read about your work she told me you have a good reputation youre honest you do a good job i do my best but im not sure i can explain what happened between your son and nadia guaman was there something specific you wanted to know i sat quietly hands easy at my sides letting the calls roll over to my answering service the woman who owns the club shes kind of a hard case isnt she she says chad kept attacking this nadia whenever she showed up is this true you talked to olympia i was puzzled surely she wouldnt have been in bond court or at the prison hospital i went over to her club yesterday afternoon after i went to see chad i wanted to see what kind of a place it was the cops shut it down while they did their investigating if thats what you call it but she was there working on accounts or something like i said im a project manager at least i was until this economy destroyed the construction industry you meet tough women in constructionwell they have to be to survive in that worldbut this olympia shed chew up my crew chief for dinner and spit him out and not think twice about it she claims chad tried to assault the dead gal she says after someone broke it up chad mustve lain in wait so he could shoot her is any of that true i hate it when people ask questions for which theres no happy answer i was at the club two times when both chad and nadia were there and im afraid that both times chad boiled over when nadia did her drawings the first time he tried to jump her onstage and the bouncer did throw him out im not going to lie to you mr vishneski i heard a snippet of a conversation between your son and nadia in the parking lot each was accusing the other of spying my first reaction was that it was an ugly divorce case but if they werent lovers if they hadnt met outside the club what was that about i dont know he stuck his hand inside his jacket pocket again and then remembered we werent smoking in here one of his buddies called me says at the time that gal was being murdered chad and them were all in a bar watching a hawks game and when it ended chad announced he didnt feel well he was going home going back to my exs that meant did any of them actually see him go home vishneski hunched a shoulder this one friend he dropped chad off but when i told the cops that they said even if chad watched the game it ended an hour before that woman was shot plenty of time for him to pretend to be sick and get over to the club to lie in wait for her the office phone had continued to ring while we talked now my cell phone chirped out a few bars of mozart my signal that one of a handful of key callers wanted me i looked at the screen my answering service was texting me that the cops the media and my clients were all getting restless over my inaccessibility what is it you want from me mr vishneski i tried to mask my impatience i want to know what really happened imy boy he came back from iraq in a bad way ill be the first to admit that he bounced off the walls you couldnt talk to him without getting your head bit off he ran around with his army buddies got drunk got in fights couldnt hang on to a job but its hard for me to see him shooting a helpless young lady like that i just dont believe it the cops theyre happy to write case closed on their file and that public defender the county gave chad if he can remember chads name when he gets into court ill be surprised if hes guilty i cant prove hes innocent mr vishneski i said quietly i wouldnt want you to but i need to knowwhat is it they always say on those lawandorder shows beyond a reasonable doubt he smiled a painful crack in his lined face what about the gun the news reports say the cops found the murder weapon next to chad when they went to arrest him its not his im sure its not maybe he found it in the street and picked it up i didnt even try to respond to that parental fantasy i rubbed my eyes with the heels of my hands and nadias face appeared behind my lids death chasing away anger catching her by surprise you said you werent sure you could afford bail for chad mr vishneski but i cant take on a case like this pro bono im not asking you to ive been running the numbers every which way all weekend im still working threequarter time jobsharing with some other guys at mercurio although who knows how long that will last sorry getting sidetracked monas getting into town tonight ill talk to her but if she agreesshes retired took early retirement last year was an office manager with mercurio one of their buildingsanyway i think we can afford to hire a detective and still have something for a good defense lawyer if were careful if you can work without running up the bills on us if you can recommend a good lawyer wholl give us a bit of a break the hind at bay after wed signed a contract and vishneski left for work i did a background check on him just to see if he really could pay his bills he was indeed on mercurios payroll and his credit history had no more hiccups than any other person whod lived as long as he had for the present he could pay my bill and maybe that of my own defense lawyer freeman carter i put away vishneskis file and started returning the phone calls that had come in during our meeting it wasnt until the end of the afternoon that i had time to get back to chad vishneskis problems john vishneski wanted to believe chad was innocent but he had confirmed the picture of a young man whose anger was close to the surface at all times he never was like that as a boy he had such a happy disposition even after mona and i split up we got two places mona and me sold the house and got two condos pretty near each other so the boy could be both places and not feel he was in the middle of our problems he always had a bunch of friends boys girls always in and out of both apartments all having fun clean fun no drugs no drunks mona and i set the same rules according to vishneski iraq had changed chads personality jekyll and hyde and which was the mean one he could never remember as he talked vishneski finally pulled a cigarette from his breast pocket he played with it tapping it on the tabletop running it between his fingers a prop to help him get through his story he didnt tell me he was joining up i knew he wasnt one for the books but he just wandered into an army recruitment office on addison street during spring break next thing i knew he was off to basic training that must have startled you i said i was pissed off him doing it without even talking to me throwing away his college scholarship but then i saw how much the army suited him and i thought well maybe he knew best after all he needed that discipline that and the activity he used to send us these pictures of him and his unit theyd be laughing chad teaching iraqi boys how to play american football that soccer thats for sissies he says he told them vishneski rubbed his face i wasnt supposed to see the unexpected spurt of tears as he thought of his sons happygolucky past but those endless deployments they put the big hurt on all the kids out there and they saw stuff no person ought to have to see grown women fighting over a piece of bread babies with their arms blown off other things chad wouldnt even talk about it was too much for him i went back to the murder weapon that the police supposedly found next to chad when they picked him up what kind of guns did chad have he was a soldier they dont get handguns chad he likeslikedto shoot but mona wouldnt let him keep a gun in her place any moren i would in mine anymore than they allowed drugs or alcohol which is to say parents often see what they hope will be in front of them but did he own a gun guns john claimed chad didnt and certainly not the baby glock that the police had found in bed with chad so whose gun was that i asked if youre going to clear his name youll have to find that out wont you he gave me a ferocious glare as if anger with me could keep grief and uncertainty at bay youre not hiring me to clear his name but to find out what happened i reminded him he argued with me a bit about that but in an unfocused way not sure what he believed about his son i asked him for names of chads friends those boys and girls who used to have good clean fun with him vishneski said the kids he hung out with before he deployed they couldnt understand why chad was so angry all the time when he got home so he kind of lost touch with them the guys he sees now theyre army buddies he picked up after he got home last summer most of em i dont know but tim radke hes the one who called me after he heard about chad hes the one said theyd been at a bar vishneski didnt know radkes number but maybe mona would i asked if there were any women in chads life not counting nadia guaman whose connection to chad we were tiptoeing around he dated a sweet gal in high school but she married someone else while he was overseas since he got home i dont think hes been meeting any women but his ma would know you ask mona when you talk to her women are the repository of personal details in the lives of all who intersect their worlds even my own brief husband had expected me to know his clients and his parents birthdays back in my office that afternoon i typed up all my notes from the day and entered them into everyones separate case fileswhich i religiously backed up on a portable drive as well as the office backup drive oh the computer age its been good for me in a way i used to write my notes on scraps of paper and lose them in the landfill on my worktable now everythings tidily laid out in my investigators casebook spreadsheets which automatically updates my handheld somethings missing though the personal touch on archives you see things when youre handling documents that you miss on the world wide web the winter evening had closed in on the city hours ago i felt cold and lonely in my office although my leasemate was still hard at it with a blowtorch across the hall if we still lived in caves wed be asleep not driving ourselves to work in the dark i logged on to the body artists website embodiedartcom it opened to the slide show id seen on the screens at club gougethe eye winking down at her vulva the jungle scenes up her spine the middle eastern music twanged with the changing screens the text which was also disquieting changed along with the pictures what is thy servant a dog that she should do this thing my eye winks at my muff my beaver my little animal the female of the species is deadlier than the male the bashful audience member drawing a few squiggly lines a few people attempting actual figurative work with varying degrees of success were staples of the shows and so was rodney you didnt actually see him stride up to the stage his paunch swaying slightly with his rolling gait but you almost always saw the crude sets of letters and numbers on the body artists buttocks i found one of nadias drawings the pinkandgray scrolls the woman with a slash down the middle of her face and tried to print out a copy of that and of rodneys crude work unfortunately the artist had a slick printprotection feature built into her site all you got was the text around the edge of the page not the picture itself you had to pay fifty dollars to print your own version seventyfive would get you a signed print from the artist two hundred and it would arrive framed i copied down rodneys contributions ci he wrote on one occasion on another lo i looked at five different examples of rodneys work each entry had a set of numbers separated by an exclamation point but other than that i couldnt see what they shared the strings of numbers werent the same length from entry to entry i wondered if they might be phone numbers perhaps for disposable phones in an overseas market europe doesnt share our fixation with the tendigit phone number or perhaps rodney was a spy for a burglary ring and used the body artist to broadcast safe combinations or hed picked pockets at the club and was relaying credit card numbers no matter what he was transmitting why do it like that at all in an era of instantaneous communication this was incredibly cumbersome the only thing he really seemed to gain was a sense of power over the body artist and over olympia before i left embodiedartcom i looked again at the changing images and captions on the home page stopping each slide to study it more closely many of the pictures were overtly cruel the hind at bay for instance showed dogs mauling a deer that had a womans face crucifixus est depicted a woman on a cross a spike hammered through her vulva her face was divided in two one side expressing bliss the other agony as i went through the exhibit i realized id misread one of the captions deader than the male it said not deadlier than the male and the face was the one nadia had been painting on the body artist a young woman with curly dark hair her face cut in two where nadia had sliced it with the palette knife i found myself shivering women savaged by dogs women crucified through the vagina women with their faces slashed it was horrible and horrifying if a man had done these paintings id say he hated women what was going on with karen that she hated other women or hated herself so much she had to dismember her female body and nadia guamanwas that what had drawn the two women together slasher art i rubbed my arms and got up to walk around the room trying to dispel the images or at least push them far enough away that i could think i needed human company i crossed the hall to see if my leasemate was willing to be interrupted at least for five minutes tessa was hovering over a steel bar with a blowtorch her dark face wet with sweat underneath her protective eyewear she looked up at me briefly continued her work until shed finished the cut to her satisfaction then turned off the flame and came over to me i need someone alive and wholesome for a minute before i go back into my computer i explained what id been looking at tessa was interested enough to wipe her face and neck dry and come across to look at the body artists slide show she went through it twice pausing at several of the images before she said anything shes a skilled representational painter no doubt about it and she knows her art history the hind at bay its constructed like the stag at bay even if landseers dogs were more genteel and not actively attacking the stag and the crucifixion thats modeled on one michelangelo painted she brought up a new window and found reproductions of both paintings so i could see how similar they were to karen buckleys work i see why you find them disturbing she continued theres no life here theres a kind of rage under these and a kind of exhibitionism but not vitality id rather see something like these uncertain lines she pointed at one of the slides of customer art from a club gouge night the person who held that brush was willing to take a risk you dont think its a risk being naked on a stage letting strangers put paint on you i think its an extreme form of selfindulgence tessa said every time you put paint on canvas or flesh youre taking a risk but your body artist isnt doing that come to think of it im surprised she isnt cutting herself onstage i dont like the performance art of people like lucia balinoff but she works along the same themes the savaging of the female body your performance artist isnt doing anything new and shes not taking any risks shes exposing herself but not her self tessa left on that stern note a moment later i heard her blowtorch fire up again the deadbefore they got that way i tried to map out a course of action the most important thing seemed to me to get the clients son better care that meant i needed sophisticated medical as well as firstclass legal help i started with freeman carter he had been in court all day and wanted to get away he had tickets to the opera and wasnt going to miss the curtain on my account i gave him a thirtysecond rundown and told him i wanted a court order asap so we could move chadi hoped to beth israel lottys hospital ill get a doctor over to cermak tomorrow morning if you can organize the legal side are you being donna quixote freeman asked or do you really have evidence that the wrong person is in custody from everything ive read this was a ptsd vet who lost control not that it matters you understand im used to the odd alignment you make between the law and facts vishneski is a ptsd vet but im beginning to think he was framed ill tell you why when you have more time and is this on your tab or can your client pay freemans bill is one of the things that keeps me from ever getting ahead of the game financially but the alignment between the law and me is such that i need the best defense lawyer in town even though my outstanding balance right now was close to sixty thousand i assured freeman that if the client couldnt pay him id take care of it i hung up knowing that the phone consult itself had just added a hundred dollars to my bill i called lotty who was also going to the opera but who gave me a little more attention eve rafael is a very fine surgeon new to our practice but she has a lot of experience with head trauma and coma ill see if shes free but the billing is going to be complicated you know and it would help if i could tell her what your young friend had ingested i wont know that for a few days but chads been at cermak since saturday morning i hope its not too late for a worldclass neurosurgeon to rescue his brain medicine victorianot a science not an art somewhere in between how badly chad vishneski wants to recover will also play a role in this but ill talk to eve on my way to the opera as long as someone else is driving lotty lottys driving on a sunny day and with no one else on the road was still a fine test of anyones nerve endings in the snow with a cell phone in her ear i wouldnt want my life to depend on her you worry too much about trivialities victoria that will shorten your life as much as fried food as she hung up on that crisp note i realized i should have talked to the client first before making all these arrangements for his son fortunately when i reached john vishneski he was so grateful for my arrangements that he didnt question my protocol i gave him freemans number call him first thing in the morning hes going to get a court order to allow him to move your son and either dr herschel or dr rafael will be on hand to oversee his care i have to be at a jobsite at seven vishneski said itll be best if you let someone else take care of that you told me yesterday that chad depended on you to look after him and this is one place where you can do that even if hes unconscious your voice in his ear will reassure him he agreed after a moment of rambling talkhow hed have to talk to someone named derek how mona needed to knowshould he call her or would i before we hung up i told him i was sending him a form to sign that would give his and his exwifes consent to my talking to chads doctors and he agreed to that as well as a courtesy i called terry finchley to let him know what i was doing like most sensible people hed gone home for the day so i left a detailed message with the officer who answered his phone by now i was too hungry to think clearly i hadnt eaten since grabbing a sandwich in the loop at two and it was after eight now i drove back downtown to the south loop and went into the golden glow sal bartheles bar in the financial district right after the closing bell the glow is packed with hysterical traders this time of night the atmosphere is mellower business travelers mingle with regulars from the highrises and converted lofts along printers row and everyone relaxes more in the light of sals tiffany table lamps sal stood inside the mahogany horseshoe bar where most of her clients like to sit sal is tall majestic in build and her wardrobe doubles her impact like olympia sal knows her business depends on showmanship showwomanship tonight she was eyestopping in a shimmery black sweater and pants topped by a silver vest that hung to her calves her afro was cropped close to her head and earrings the size of chandeliers swept her shoulders she patted the hand of the man shed been talking to and moved across the horseshoe to the empty side where i was sitting that was quite a todo at olympias place i saw on the news that some stressedout vet went off the rails and killed a woman thats the word on the street sal brought out the black label bottle and you dont agree i shrugged the evidence such as it is points to the guy his father says ptsd had seriously damaged him but that it wasnt in his nature to lie in wait for a woman he barely knew just to shoot her so you think he didnt do it she cocked her head catching the earring on her left ear in her sweater i reached over and untangled the metal from the threads you should wear football pads with these i am committed to a client who believes chad didnt do it he hired me just to get the facts but underneath it all he wants the facts to prove chads innocent so im working on that assumption you practice for half an hour a day like the white queen so you can learn to believe in the impossible whats olympia saying olympia is behaving oddly do you know her sal shook her head were not old pals or even lovers if thats what you want to know i know her because we belong to an organization of women restaurateurs and thats a small group in chicago olympia can be good fun but shes definitely pushed herself to the top by having the sharpest elbows in the heap i mean so have we all in a way but some of us we put on velvet elbow pads so the suckers along the way dont realize theyve been hit until they get home and study their bruises aint that the truth i said thinking of the pushing id had to do to get taken seriously as a detective i gave sal a précis of my nights at the club gouge my encounters with nadia and karen buckley and olympias insistence that nothing was going on sal left me several times to check on other customers but she sent a minion to the restaurant across the foyershe supplies their liquor they feed her customersto get me some broiled halibut when id finished the story she shook her head if petra were working here and she brought you in without my permission id be seeing red white and blue id fire her ass and probably shoot yours if i could get you in my sights your cousin is lucky olympia hasnt let her go but if someone in here were injured the way karen buckley was when she cut herself with that glass in her paintbrush would you refuse to bring in the cops devils advocate vic butolympias got a naked woman onstage cops could get her written up for a million violations if they thought it was a dyke scene and they wanted to be ugly i thought of detective finchleys reaction to the body artists act and pulled a face when you put it that way its hard to argue with you but there are other things this guy rodney olympia pretended she didnt know his name when detective finchley was talking to us but he is there most nights and he threatened me with violence im wondering if the club is a front for him to run drugs sals brows contracted ifand thats a mighty big ifolympia is doing or dealing get your cousin out of there asap its a big chance to take though i wouldnt think olympia would risk her license and her property by letting a dealer operate so blatantly maybe so but theres something going on there you stop by one of these nights and youll see what i mean i picked at a loose corner of the label on the scotch bottle you said you and olympia werent old lovers but what about her and nadia guaman or her and karen buckley were nadia and karen around the club scene at least as far as you know i never heard of this nadia vic karen buckley ive caught her act its a startling piece of performance art for this town the kind of thing you expect in san francisco or new york but not conservative chitown gal like that could sleep with anyone for any reason i mean maybe shes having an affair with olympia maybe she slept with the dead woman but im guessing buckleys not a dyke i wouldnt even say she was bisexual she just does what she wants when she wants with whoever she wants an omnisexual i wondered what that felt like to do what you wanted when you wanted buckley hadnt struck me as a very contented person despite her yoga poses and deep breathing that paintbrush with the glassat the time i wondered if the artist or olympia did it as a publicity stunt im still not convinced they didnt but nadia could have sabotaged it or even chad i suppose could be olympias been hurting along with the rest of the economy if she thought it would bring in business shed cut her own wrists in front of a webcam would you sal laughed hell no im quite attached to my own good looks thank you very much i looked at her seriously youre tough sal and one of the strongest people i know but youre sane what you just said about olympia you may have meant it as a joke but the very fact that such an image came to your mind means you feel what im talking about that edgy dangerdaring quality youd be the expert on that particular bit of human nature warshawski you going to drink that whisky or just play spin the bottle all night neither i handed sal my amex card she used to run a tab for me when she and i first opened our businesses twenty years ago but those days have disappeared with the rest of the economy i took side streets going home i was tired and whisky at the end of a long day hadnt been the smartest move before getting behind the wheel sals response to my questions about olympia hadnt done anything to dampen my enthusiasm for my case that was because my enthusiasm level had been low to begin with chad with a glock on the pillow next to him was a high hill to climb over and i didnt think id find an easy path on the other side i hadnt actually seen any ballistic or forensic evidence in the case in the morning id check with the me on that in the meantime before going to bed i turned on my laptop and logged on to my subscription databases they could spend the night hunting for information about nadia guaman for good measure i also asked about olympia karen buckley and chad vishneski when the alarm woke me at six i wanted to shoot it or scream or something ive never been much for early mornings and when it is pitchblack with the kind of cold that makes you feel your head is strapped inside iron bands it takes every ounce of will not to pull the covers over your head and wait for spring bunter i cried bunter get that cappuccino machine fired up and look smart about it what a strange fantasy to imagine someone who was dressed and ready to do your bidding at whatever hour it pleased you to bid him so very obviously politically and socially incorrect and yet how much i longed for my own bunter i flung the covers back and ran across the cold floor to the kitchen where i put on my espresso maker before tiptoeing to the bathroom i turned the thermostat up to sixtyeight before collecting the dogs from mr contreras when i got home and thawed out i sat at my laptop with my second espresso lifestory an innocuoussounding outfit for whose detailed searches into everyones lives i pay eight grand a year had sent me a profile of nadia guaman guaman had gone to columbia college in the south loop after a childhood in pilsen and high school at st teresa of avila her father lazar worked as a baggage handler up at ohare her mother cristina was a cashier at a pilsen hardware store they still lived in the bungalow on twentyfirst place where nadia had grown up nadia had been the oldest of lazar and cristinas three surviving children another daughter alexandra had died three years ago the youngest clara a high school senior was also at st teresa their only son ernest had been training as an electrical engineer when his motorcycle flipped him onto cermak road two years ago his brain injuries left him unable to work i squeezed my eyes shut the pain the guamans lived with every day one child already dead their son terribly disabled and now a daughter murderedi couldnt imagine how you survived such losses and kept any vestige of your sanity or humanity i returned to the screen and studied the financial details another of my subscription databases the monitor project had dredged up nadias bank account was modest she had earned about forty thousand in a good year her rent on the onebedroom on the fringe of humboldt parkthe part where gangs and gentrifiers lived in uneasy proximityran just under nine hundred a month she didnt own a car the computer hadnt come upon any financial instruments if such things still existed in her name nadia hadnt been party to any lawsuits lifestory and the monitor project arent a substitute for routine surveillance they didnt give me any details on nadias private lifewho she dated how well shed known chad vishneski if she and karen buckley or olympia had been lovers all i could tell was that shed never filed an order of protection or complained of stalking or harassment the reports did give other more intimate information the kind you assume is private to you alone i felt filthy exploring nadias medical history but i wanted to know if shed had any treatment that might imply an abusive relationship no recent broken bones no stds by the time id been through the whole file i just had time to shower and change for my first appointment of the morning id look at the reports on chad olympia and karen buckley later now that the police had identified her killer theyd released nadias body to her family the funeral was scheduled for this afternoon at ayuda de cristianos in pilsen i put on my tailored black suit so that i could go directly to the church from my downtown meeting a kiss in the coffin nadias family was gathered around her open coffin the parents in black the surviving daughter defiantly flaunting turquoise eye shadow and a pink jersey minidress their son ernest was wearing a black suit and tie but he was twitching and shaking his arms and occasionally letting out little yipping noises an older woman perhaps a grandmother was scolding him i joined the obligatory parade up to the family lazar guaman stood like a statue unable to respond to anyone who spoke to him seemingly unaware of his son for cristina guaman ernest seemed to provide a welcome distraction rubbing his neck or taking his hands when he started sticking them down his trouser front or hushing his shriek of a laugh seemed to calm her to give her a kind of purpose i murmured condolences and ms guaman directed me to the coffin our nadia looks like the angel in heaven shes become i moved reluctantly to the open coffin id last seen their daughter in club gouges parking lot in pain and covered in blood but here she lay as calm as if she were in a tranquil sleep her face stripped of the tormenting anger id witnessed at club gouge looked heartbreakingly young in death almost a childs face the effect was heightened by the lacy white pillow on which she lay the funeral people had covered her tornup chest with a pale blue frock a girlie outfit very different from the jeans and outsize shirt shed worn for her body artist painting was it good was it bad to turn the dead into dolls like this someone who seemed to know the family was speaking to ms guaman when ernest shouted so abruptly that i jumped nadia flew she flew to jesus allie is a dove flying around and around and around and he started to laugh the outburst didnt startle his family your sister is an angel not a dove scolded the woman whod been speaking to ms guaman while the daughter said not in church ernie dont yell in here ayuda de cristianos was one of those cavernous old churches that dated to the time when czech immigrants settled this part of chicago back then it was known as st ludmilas and the grim details of the saints life still filled the narrow stainedglass windows the nave was made of concrete with a vaulted ceiling that must have stretched a good hundred feet above us everyones footfalls echoed and reechoed each time the street door slammed ernest roared with laughter and imitated the noise as more people came up to the coffin i retreated to a pew near the back of the church the building was bonechillingly cold we should have all huddled together in a few pews i didnt see anyone i knew among the few dozen mourners who dotted the space no one from club gouge for instance and none of chads army buddies nor rodney the heavy from the club most of the people looked like relatives or perhaps coworkers of the guamans a man in a black cashmere coat his hair cut strand by strand the way they do in those oak street salons stood to one side until he could speak to the family alone their doctor perhaps or someone from the airline where lazar worked as a baggage handler i built a fantasy for the family that the airline saddened by all the guamans losses was setting up a college fund for the remaining daughter the priest appeared from a side door and the family moved to the front row eternal rest grant unto them o lord the priest began in my childhood although i wasnt a catholic i attended a lot of funeral masses for classmatesone of the byproducts of growing up in a rough neighborhood the mass was said in latin then and im still disconcerted to hear it in english i joined the congregation in a mumbled response to the prayers our voices swallowed by the building before they could travel to the altar we had reached the homily where the priest was explaining what a devoted daughter and sister nadia had been when a door slammed and footfalls echoed hollowly through the nave everyone turned to look and ernest once again jumped excitedly and shouted an imitation of the sound i didnt recognize the woman at first in a navy wool coat and furry boots she looked like every other cold person in the church her brown hair hung below her coat collar a lock fell across her eyes and she pushed it aside as she marched up the aisle it was only when she passed me that i realized who it was karen buckley the body artist for her act she pinned her hair up on her head and her heavy foundation drained all expression from her face now i saw the muscles around her mouth and eyes quiver she paid no attention to the priest or even to ernest but walked up to the coffin and stared down at nadia the priest interrupted himself to demand that she sit down that she not disrespect the service karen treated him as if he were a heckler at her body art act he didnt exist after a moment while we all watched in silence karen bent to kiss nadia the people closest to the coffin gasped and ms guaman half rose in her pew but karen turned and left her furry boots squeaking slightly on the stone floor when the street door shut behind her the sound vibrated through the building like thunder i got up from my pew and hurried out after her while ernest shrieked theyre shooting all the girls are dying youre next clara better get down youre next the great door shut behind me as ms guaman and one of the older women tried to hush ernest karen buckley was already opening the door to her car a subaru with the zipcar logo painted on the side i sprinted to the curb skidding in my dress boots calling her name ms buckley im v i war i remember youre the detective she had a lot of practice keeping her face neutral and her eyes gave nothing away they were a blue so pale that they seemed transparent in the winter light i want to talk to you about nadia where can i meet you nowhere i dont want to talk to you she started to get into her car i moved quickly and braced myself against the open door you knew her well i gather and i need to find out more about her did she ever talk to you about chad vishneski chad vishneski oh the crazy vet who shot her i hardly knew her she tried to pull the door shut but id wedged myself into the opening then why are you here and why did you kiss her so dramatically i came for the same reason you did to pay my respects to the dead perhaps my respects take a more dramatic form than yours i shook my head if you came for the same reason i did its because you have unanswered questions about her murder its not at all clear that chad was her killer or even that hes crazy she turned her head so that her long hair brushed the steering wheel her voice when she again spoke was barely audible i feel responsible for her death thats all something about the painting she did on my body stirred up chad and i came here to ask her forgiveness she shot me a sidelong glance does that satisfy you i almost believed you i said until you put in the coda im in the phone book when you start feeling like telling me the truth she flushed and bit her lip but she wasnt going to give herself away any further i slammed her door shut and headed back to the church but it wasnt until i reached the big bronze doors that i heard her start her car when i got inside communion was being distributed i stood in the rear until the mass ended and the coffin was finally sealed i moved to the side while the pallbearers carried the coffin down the aisle the family in its wake the rest of the mourners straggled to the exits the subdued chatter the relief of still being counted among the living began to grow as the coffin left the building i stood on the steps and watched the undertakers bend over the family one man helped cristina guaman settle ernest into the backseat a second gently shepherded the numb and gray lazar through a door on the other side clara the surviving daughter was standing by herself scowling despite the cold she wasnt wearing a coat over her pink jersey minidress i walked over to her i was with your sister when she died im sorry for your loss under the outrageous makeup claras eyes were wet but she held her head defiantly how come i was briefly confused its a hard loss no no she gave me the look of withering contempt that only adolescents seem able to produce how come you were with her the woman who came into the funeral to kiss your sister goodbye her name is karen buckley she performs at club gouge karen buckleys safety had been threatened im a detective i was trying to see that she didnt get hurt you did a good job didnt you it was my sister who got killed i smiled painfully but held out my card would you talk to me if i came to your school or your home claras eyes slid past me to someone behind me the man in the black cashmere coat appeared next to me clara he took one of her bare hands between his two gloved ones this is no time to be standing around without a coat she pulled her hand away and gave him the same angry stare shed turned on me a minute earlier but didnt say anything this is a hard time for your whole family the man said your mother needs to be able to count on you so get into the car before you add to her worries by catching cold okay he put a hand on her neck to shepherd her to the car but she twisted away from him she climbed into the limo and the man in black cashmere leaned in over her head to say something to the guamans he spoke so softly i couldnt hear him but cristina replied loudly i do understand you dont need to repeat yourself he shut the door and slapped the cars top a couple of times i guess as a signal to the driver to take off claras a tough kid to talk to he had a light pleasant baritone all kids that age are or can be you a family friend i was close to nadia at one time i didnt feel like explaining my connection as a private investigator and you im sort of an honorary uncle to all of them especially since poor ernie had his accident he stuck a hand inside his coat and pulled out a card rainier cowles attorney they seem dogged by misfortune theyre lucky to have an honorary uncle whos a lawyer i didnt give him a card of my own a la salle street lawyer like him probably wouldnt take kindly to a pi sniffing around the guamans i dont know the family well can ernest be left alone not really its not that hes dangerous but his impulses are out of whack cristina worries about him leaving the stove on that kind of thing lazars mother lives with them helps keep an eye on ernest so how do they manage i tried to imagine what home life must be like for clara and her parents hard work for the parents but painful for a teenager who had to put her own life on hold are you a social worker looking for a customer his eyebrows were raised i smiled like you i was worrying about the guamans welfare wondering how they cope and i gather there was another sister who also diedalexandra they dont like to talk about her his voice was bland but all the muscles in his face tightened how did she die one of ernies outbursts came back to me allie allie is a dove when nadia lay in my arms her last word had been allie not bitterness at ending her life in an alleyshe thought my face bending over hers was that of her dead sister my insides twisted in an involuntary spasm of grief you dont know cowles said it doesnt sound to me as though you ever knew nadia at all we were close once i repeated but not for long she let me know allie was very important to her but she didnt spell out why his face relaxed again id let that dead dog lay then its too painful to cristina and lazaryoull never hear them talk about alexandra by the way who was the woman who interrupted the service she knocked poor father ogden off balance i shrugged her name is karen buckley and what was she to nadia i shook my head anybodys guess whats yours i smiled again not enough data to begin to guess so youre a careful woman are you not a risk taker hmm for some reason the time id swung from a gantry and landed in the sanitary canal flashed through my head and i laughed but didnt say anything he eyed me narrowly annoyed at my frivolity but smart enough not to expose himself to possible ridicule he looked at his watch the conversation was over he asked perfunctorily if i was heading to the cemetery and when i said no he strode briskly down the street to his car it was a bmw sedan which looked a bit like himexpensive cut shiny black exterior sleek lines i moved slowly to my mustang this was its third winter in chicago and it didnt look sleek at all it looked like me tired and even confused since the front and rear axles seemed to be pointing in opposite directions the mama and the papa in concert back in my office i found messages from lotty and freeman carter lotty had called to say that her neurosurgeon dr rafael had visited chad at cermak hospital rafael had insisted on his removal to beth israel freemans message let me know hed provided the court order to expedite chads movehe should be at beth israel already i called freeman to thank him and tried to reach lotty both to thank her and to try to get an idea about chads health unfortunately she wasnt available and the charge nurse had a scrupulous sense of protocol i wasnt part of the family or one of the lawyers i didnt get any news john vishneskis phone was turned off that probably meant he was with his son in the icu i asked him to call me and opened the case file id started on chad i added rainier cowless name to the vishneski file but the name sounded so bogus i did a lexisnexis check on him he was a partner at palmer statten one of the globes megafirms whose chicago presence occupied eight floors of a wacker drive highrise cowles had grown up in the northwest suburbs and was respectably educated with a ba from michigan and his jdmba from penn hed joined palmer statten right after passing the bar and during the next twenty years had moved steadily up the path to partner the palmer statten website listed his particular expertise as corporate litigation with a specialty in multinationals i didnt find a record of a name change but it still seemed incredible that parents had burdened their child with such a name prince rainier i murmured to the computer hed probably been called that a ton in his subdivision growing up maybe its why hed put on the carapace of corporate success imposing trial presence important car but he must have a soft center or he wouldnt be involved with the hardluck guamans or maybe hed represented them in litigation over ernies injuries none of this speculation was helping me look at chads relationship with nadia the client is the boss his son is innocent get to work proving it i said aloud in my sternest voice and phoned mona vishneski mona had left her mothers as soon as she learned of her sons arrest and was now back in chicago she was staying with her exhusband in wrigleyville which john hadnt bothered to tell me she agreed to meet me for a cup of tea at liliths a little café on southport near johns apartment around five the snow had started again liliths was six blocks from my apartment with the ice and snow packed along the curbs making street parking a challenge it was better to put my car in my buildings alley garage and walk i carried my laptop with me in a waterproof case it was already dark by the time i got to the café the warmth and lights inside seemed feeble against the wind whipping snow pellets against the windows i ordered a double macchiato and found a table as far from the door as possible while i waited for mona i started to download the reports lifestory and the monitor project had given me on olympia karen buckley and on chad himself i was especially curious about karen after her performance at nadias funeral the most important questionwho had known whom and howwasnt one the computer could answer reliably although i took a stab at the question through myspace and facebook olympia had a facebook page but you had to have her permission to see any details such as her cyberfriends chad had a myspace page but none of the women were among his friends i couldnt find karen buckley on any of the social networks fishing around to see where karens and nadias lives might have intersected i checked to see if they had gone to art school together i already had looked up nadias detailsher training at columbia college in the south loop her job at a big design firm followed by precarious freelancing after she was laid offbut i couldnt find any information on karen buckley a quick search revealed hundreds of karen buckleyssingers quilters doctors lawyersacross the country but only four dozen karen buckleys or k buckleys in our fourstate area about six of those seemed to match the body artists race and age none of them had a findable history as an artist unlike most artists who are at pains to tell you where theyve trained where theyve held shows what museums own their work karens history wasnt just sketchy it was missing altogether she didnt list her education or her shows on the embodiedartcom website she didnt offer any personal information at all i needed her social security number but i couldnt find a home address for her let alone a credit history that might yield information on her background i went back to embodiedartcom if you had to pay her for her work she must have a bank account or a credit card somewhere but she took payment only through paypal which meant she could be collecting the money under another name maybe even in another state i sat back in my chair here was a woman who was aggressive in exposing herself before audiences and yet shed left no trail in our hyperdocumented age i could imagine a fear of stalkers might require total anonymity in her life these days but it was strange that someone so purposefully selfexposing left no public trace of her private life i transferred addresses for the handful of k buckleys who might be the body artist i could do oldfashioned legwork see if any of them had a home studio but i wasnt expecting to find her i was so lost in thought and files that i didnt notice mona vishneski until she appeared at my table and hesitantly said my name ms vishneski i sprang to my feet she was a lostlooking woman around my age her clothes hanging on her as if worry over her son had made her lose a dress size overnight close up i could see how rough her skin was she didnt seem to have washed her face or combed her hair since chads arrest she took off her gloves and then looked at them puzzled trying to figure out what they were she was carrying a scuffed leather handbag big enough to hold a computer and a change of clothes she finally stuck her gloves into one of its side pockets john told me he hired you to clear chads name i used to work with detectives back when i was managing a building for mercurio wed hire them to find out where people had skipped off to without paying their rent but i dont remember we ever hired you i agreed that id never worked for mercurio companies that size tend to use big agencies not solo ops like me but ms vishneski your husbandexhusbandhired me to find out what happened friday night at club gouge you both need to understand however painful it is to think about that the evidence points to your son having shot nadia guaman if you think hes guilty then i dont think we should be working with you her eyes were bright with emotion i kept my voice level im committed to approaching this situation with an open mind but i cant ignore evidence and the evidence is that the murder weapon was found next to chad another thing i was present myself for two extremely angry encounters between your son and nadia guaman i plan to look into their relationship to see what lay behind his rage but if youd be more comfortable working with one of the detectives you used to know at mercurio i can respect that if mr vishneski agrees then well void the contract he signed yesterday and return his retainer i would ask you to pay the fee my lawyer is charging for providing the court order we needed to move chad from the prison hospital to beth israel mona vishneski shifted her weight from foot to foot uncomfortable at being put on the spot do you want to think about it overnight i suggested oh i guess we should go ahead if were going to do anything at all her shoulders sagged again as the anger went out of her john said youve done criminal work and that you come highly recommended its not that im not grateful for you getting a real hospital and good doctors for chad just dont expect me to agree that my son shot a woman when i know he never could have clients who blow hot and cold theyre always the most annoying to work with one day they want evidence at any cost the next they dont think youre up to the job maybe a smart detective would have voided the contract just to keep from being squeezed between a divorced couple instead i bought mona vishneski a drinkginseng peppermint teaand ordered another macchiato for myself tell me about chads guns i said when we were finally both sitting john says you wouldnt let him keep them in your apartment but he did anyway didnt he for a moment her anger spurted up again but then she made a little fluttery gesture like a butterfly settling down i didnt like it but where else could he keep them he had two which i hated even though everyone in construction carries even john but you look at guns and you think of death i asked chad how he could stand having a gun anywhere near him after all the death hed seen in iraq and hed just say no ones ever going to sneak up on me again like the way suicide attackers and them sneak up on our troops in iraq chad lost so many buddies there it was just a miracle he didnt get killed himself that time his whole unit died around him like her exhusband she pronounced the country iraq i used to go to mass every week thanking god for sparing me what so many other mothers had to bear their sons dead or missing arms and legs but watching how chads been since he got homeand now thismaybe im not so lucky maybe wed all be better off if he had lost his legs instead of his mind mona a voice said how can you talk like that it was john vishneski mona and i had been so intent on each other that we hadnt noticed him come into the café john mona cried i told you i wanted to see this detective of yours for myself john gave the smile that seemed to crack his cheeks i looked away it was so painful to watch i got too lonely sitting around the hospital he said looking at chad hooked up to all those machines that dr herschel shes something isnt she the way she made those county soandsos stand up and salute its the one good thing ive seen this week mona you want more tea do i order at the counter the glock i said to mona while john was ordering drinks was that one of chads guns how should i know i told you i hate them i dont know one from another you should ask those army friends of his they probably know ask his army buddies what john vishneski said pulling up a chair about his guns chad didnt own john whats the point in lying mona asked when its you who used to take him to target practice its not a crime is it to teach your own son how to handle a gun vishneski cried you know the glock is his and you cant bring yourself to acknowledge it i said in a flat voice vishneski reached for his cigarettes as he seemed to do any time he didnt want to talk about something studying the pack not me he said not know not for sure before he shipped out he had two a beretta and a smith and wesson i kept them while he was overseas but when he came home and i saw how how well how he was i worried he might hurt himself so i told him thered been a breakin someone had stole those guns out of my place but im pretty sure he went down to indiana picked up something down there you can you knowno one even wants to see your drivers license so maybe he does own a baby glock how do i know the hair at the nape of my neck prickled mr vishneski everything youre saying makes chad sound unstable why do you think he didnt kill nadia guaman vishneski sucked in a breath as if it were a lungful of smoke shit ms warshawskisorry ladiesyou have to know chad he might have put a bullet through his own self to put an end to his nightmares but he wouldnt go out killing some girl in an alley or anywhere else he just wouldnt he wasnt that kind of boy mona nodded vigorously chad wasnt that kind of boy none of us spoke i listened to the espresso machine hiss and to the snow sting the window the bad weather the awful economy they had already pushed my spirits low without adding an unstable iraq vet to the mix i wanted to get up and walk away but the vishneskis were both looking at me as if i were all that tethered them to the planet okay i finally summoned the energy to speak chads friends that he hung around with since getting home how do i get in touch with them mr vishneski said theres one called marty another one named tim something tim radke mona said marty i dont know what his last name is probably theyre on the speed dial on chads phone chads phone was still at her apartment when the cops rushed him to the hospital saturday morning theyd left everything behindphone walleteverything but his army dog tags and his field jacket hed been wearing those thats why i went to stay at johns mona said it got me down too much all his stuff and then the police they broke down the door when they came to get him why did they have to do that and its me that has to pay to repair it the city sure wont i should have been here instead of in arizona my ma shes got nurses around her she only made me come down so she could run me around i should have been here taking care of chad shouldnt have expected that john would know how to keep him out of trouble mona vishneski expostulated i interrupted before they could get into the kind of argument that probably led to their divorce all those years ago she said he didnt do back and forth we agreed all three of us to go to her apartment where i could collect the phone and study chads habitat to see if hed left any clues about his life that could prove his innocence we gathered up our things and walked out into the storm the wind drove fine snow between my muffler and my sweater and seemed to be scouring my face down to the bone by the time wed reached johns honda a block from liliths even he was panting mona sat in front staring at the snow i dozed in the backseat while john crept the two miles to her apartment shooting up mona lived in an old building that had probably been rather grand when it went up in the s back then each of the six floors held only two apartments those big tenroom jobs with a cubicle behind the kitchen for the maid in the nineties some developer had gutted the place converting grandeur into shoe boxes the elevator itself was a small box barely big enough to hold the three of us husband and wifeexhusband exwifemoved together unconsciously as we rode to the fourth floor when we got off monas apartment was obvious at once wooden slats were nailed across the hole left by the cops and a padlock had been screwed into the wall to keep the door shut the sight was ugly and shocking monas hand shook as she burrowed in her giant bag for her keys john silently accepted the scarf the book the billfold the wad of tissues she pulled out as she hunted i had that prickly feeling that makes you think someone is watching you when i turned to look i didnt see anyone but down the hall there was a soft thud as a door was quickly shut some neighbor cared that we were here i wondered if it was the woman whod been screaming on television that shed sue the condo board that mona vishneski ought to be thrown out at last mona located her key ring a plait of twisted metal as laden with keys as a medieval jailers it seemed to take her forever to go through them as she muttered no thats mas storage locker oh i think thats chads bike lock i resisted the desire to push her aside and work my picks into the lock when she finally had her door open and had stretched an arm around the corner for a light switch i peered over her shoulder into the long rectangle that made up her living space it had probably been an attractive shoe box a week ago before the police tracked mud and salt across the newly sanded wooden floors and the area rugs that dotted them one wall was lined with blond builtin shelves and cupboards craning my head still staying near the front door i saw a stereo and a flatscreen tv mona didnt have many books but the shelves around the tv held pottery and treen those small wooden objects whose original purpose always baffles me the pieces were unexpected and i looked at mona again what other unexpected depths might lie beneath that flat surface the kitchen stood at the far end separated from the main room only by a kind of work island or maybe peninsula since it was attached to the wall at one end mona and john started into the room but i put out an arm to hold them back what all have you handled in here since you came home mona was startled i dont know how can i remember the phone i called an emergency service to put up the board and the padlock like you saw just now a place i used to use when i was at mercurio they remembered me and came right away and while i was waiting im sure i had a glass of water i went into the bathroom it was such a mess in there chad probably hadnt even washed the tub while i was gone i wondered if hed taken his toothbrush she gave a hiccup which was half sob i stood looking at the sink and shaking my head over his messy ways like he wasnt in a coma they dont know if hell recover but you think these things automatically after twentyfive years have you washed your hands have you brushed your teeth john put a hand on her shoulder and squeezed i cleaned the sink it i dont know cleaning when im upset i clean when im upset i add to the landfill in my apartment and then im more upset because the apartment is squalid i wondered if there were drugs that could turn you into a neat freak then i went to my closet i needed to get some sweaters it wasnt this cold in phoenix of course and i knew id freeze to death at johns he doesnt pay for heat and do you have to go through every detail of every sweet minute of your life john asked his moment of empathy passing okay okay i said you touched everything is that bad if someone came in while chad was asleep and planted the gun on him it will be harder to find that someones traces thats all so you do believe he didnt shoot that woman she said eagerly oh mona whyd you have to go destroying evidence john said how was i to know she defended herself hotly its not like you were doing please i put my hands up traffic cop style dont argue least not on my dime it doesnt help the investigation and before you get too carried away blaming mona for her glass of water look at the mud and scratches the cops left behind if someone else was here ahead of them the police did a good job of wiping out all signs of them let me see the bedroom mona took me across the big room to her bedroom parting the blinds i looked out at an enclosed courtyard big enough for a bit of garden and some tables and chairs the skeleton of a swing set rose out of the snow the building had been carved up in a way that created small alcoves in the bedroom one held a desk where chad had left a partly eaten chicken dinner on top of a heap of bills and papers while i inspected the bed i heard mona clucking over the bills under her breath chad promised to pay the phone bill and the car insurance but here are the envelopes not even opened and chads mastercard who let him have a credit card when he didnt have any income and these holes in the wall she cried out so loudly that john came into to the room we both went to look at the wall three ovals that cut deep into the drywall made a little triangle over the desk the paint had come away in a lip around each hole they werent here before you left for arizona my goodness no you notice a thing like that was he trying to put up a picture i think he was using your wall for target practice shooting at a wall chad but thats just ridiculous i took a letter opener from the desktop and dug around in the lath behind the drywall i was able to recover one bullet which i showed the vishneskis both of them were shocked mona suggested in a feeble voice that one of chads friends had come home drunk with him and shot at the wall its possible of course i agreed but i thought about the way chad had behaved when id seen him in club gouge he was angry enough and drunk enough to do just about anything a disheartening thought if i was the lead member of the defense team john shouted so what if he shot up the wall it doesnt mean he shot that gal at the nightclub means he knew to take his anger out on a wall not a person i smiled and patted his arm right you are im going to finish searching in here you go find me some clean garbage bags for things i want to show to my forensic lab vishneski left the room relieved to get away from the empty beer cans the moldy chicken dinner mona continued to hover behind me talking worriedly under her breath the bed was unmade of course the cops had come in guns drawn everyone knew chad was big and angry so theyd tossed the duvet aside grabbed him as he lay there cuffed him maybe it was then they realized he was unconscious not asleep and the glock that had killed nadia guaman where had it been i sniffed tentatively at the pillow and detected a hint of sour vomit but not of gunpowder i didnt think the cops had searched the room but even if they had i would bet theyd overlooked something i started with chads army duffel bag which sat open on the far side of monas bed it was like a mountain spring with clothes spilling out into a small stream that eddied around the bed and the floor i photographed the bag and the room with my cell phone before touching anything why are you doing this mona asked what good does it do to see chads mess well know what it looks like today so if someone comes in and rummages well be able to tell the chaos seemed overwhelming i poked through the clothes chad had dropped on the floor not sure if it was worth taking any of them to the lab for forensic analysis most of his wardrobe seemed to be left over from his army servicefatigues a second summerweight field jacket he had a handful of civilian tshirts including one with bart simpson copping an attitude i felt in the pockets of the field jacket and the jeans and found the usual detritus of modern life atm receipts a stick of gum the earpiece for his ipod none of it seemed particularly meaningful my shoulders drooped as i looked around at the rest of the room empty beer cans littered the place two were buried in the duvet i photographed them in situ with my cell phone then picked them up using a corner of a sheet to hold them i laid them next to the pillowcase ready to pack into a bag mona clicked her teeth chad never was really tidy but when he got back from the war it all got worse i knew he was drinking you dont like to think that about your child but if i called after six or so i could tell by his voice we tried to get him to go to a counselor john and me both and he did see this lady at the va for a bit but then he said she was just a waste of time and he wouldnt go back you said his phone was still here i cut in but i dont see it oh yes it was on the kitchen counter ill go get it i searched through the pile of clothes spilling from chads duffel bag and looked into the bag itself i didnt see the black object chad had been waving under nadias nose the night before she was killed i stuck a hand between the mattress and box springs and found two guns a magnum baby eagle and a beretta i smelled them both had been fired and not cleaned but it was hard to say how long ago that had been maybe chad had lain in bed one night shooting at the wall and tucked the guns back under the mattress i laid the guns under the pillowcase so his parents wouldnt see them and start fussing over them id get the cheviot labs to give me an idea how long it had been since theyd been fired a further search under the mattress turned up a copy of fortune magazine tucked inside were a couple of steamy publications magslads from britain filled with giantbreasted women committing extraordinary athletic feats the other in arabic had similar pictures both english and arabic readers favored blondes with a sprinkling of redheads someone who read only ancient sanskrit would have no trouble accessing the content of either i heard monas nervous murmuring as she came back to the room and slipped the athletic blondes back into fortune then put the magazines into my briefcase chads mother didnt need to see his reading material i thought i saw his phone yesterday but its not there now you probably just thought you saw it john had appeared behind her holding a couple of black plastic bags you were tired and flustered you know how you get ive looked all over your living room and its not there it was on the kitchen counter she fussed i saw it when i got my glass of water i put all my specimens into the bags conscientiously writing down labels on some scrap paper from monas desk and sealed them with her packing tape if chads phone turns up give me a call ive seen everything i need for now its late we all need some rest if you want to talk to a criminal defense lawyer freeman carter is good hes the person who got the court order that let you move chad this morning he has a new associate in his office who seems very capable to me a woman named deb steppe whose fees wont be as steep as freemans i wrote freemans details down for them while mona took the chicken dinner her son had left in the bedroom to the garbage when shed turned out the lights she couldnt find her keys while she hunted through her purse i picked them up from the chair where shed dropped them on her way into the apartment i had a feeling chads phone was in that big shoulder bag of hers but i was getting impatient to take off if i couldnt find a phone number for tim radke the one friend whose name john and mona knew maybe id mug her and search her bag the door at the far end of the hall opened again as we waited for the elevator if id actually believed in chads innocence at this point i would have talked to the watchful neighbor the trouble was i thought he was guilty i was sloppy it came back later to haunt me the storm had stopped when we finally got back downstairs the building super was running a snowblower around the walks and strewing salt but beyond the building perimeter the snow was ankledeep i didnt want to trudge through it carrying all the souvenirs id collectedchads guns his beer cans his porn collectionso i waited at the curb while john and mona went off to fetch the car when they dropped me at home it was past eight i knew i had to do something about the dogs and now that i was away from the mess and tension in monas apartment i realized i was hungry as well i was about to call jake to see if he wanted to walk up to belmont for a snack when my cousin phoned vic didnt you get my messages id turned my phone off when i was meeting with mona and had forgotten to turn it back on petra had been trying to call all afternoon to say that olympia was reopening the club tonight karen buckley was going to do a special tribute performance in nadias honor i thoughti know they arrested that guy that vetbut do you think you could come everyones so totally on edge and olympia is behaving strangely its like something else is going to happen id like you to be thereif you can of course i looked wistfully at my cozy living room and my dogs who were panting hopefully in the doorway petra darling on friday i gave you my best advice and you ignored it but let me repeat you dont have to keep working at club gouge oh vic i know i know im a pest but you will come tonight wont you maybe i could talk to karen buckley maybe she would be more forthcoming after her performance than she had been at nadia guamans funeral this afternoon i wasnt too hopeful but i told petra id come down to the club after id run the dogs and eaten something oh vic thank you thank you youre the best the best chump she meant i was more annoyed with myself than petra why did i cave so easily to her demands i was worn out when i finished taking care of the dogs i lay down for almost an hour before heading back out into the cold a show for the dead despite the storm the club gouge parking lot was crowded olympias marquee announced that the body artist was back for a special memorial performance in honor of nadia guaman killed so tragically five days earlier olympia had put it out on twitter myspace youtube wherever the millennium gen gathers and theyd responded in force oh the dead do us so much good from the other side of the grave the room was almost full when i got inside rodney was planted in his usual spot twothirds of the way back from the stage i squeezed into a spare seat at a crowded table near the back of the room where i could watch people as they came in i didnt see any of chads army buddies which was a pity id hoped they might show up to save me the trouble of trying to find them online tonight perhaps because of the short notice there wasnt a live act as a warmup the sound system was turned up loud but we were listening to enyas shepherd moons whose haunting melodies conveyed a suitable sense of mourning my cousin working the far side of the room caught sight of me she hurried over with a glass of whisky johnnie walker black vic its on me thank you so much for coming olympia standing next to the bar like a captain on the bridge of a ship saw me then and swept over to my table what are you doing here i thought the object of a club was to invite customers not drive them away youre not a customer youre a detective and detectives are bad for business now that very much depends on the kind of business youre conducting doesnt it i watched her face but she played poker with bigger gamblers than me she showed no signs of any emotion besides impatience so i added i went to nadias funeral this afternoon karen came but i guess you were too busy setting up here karen went to the funeral olympia lost some of her commanding poise why better ask her i was trying to figure out why she kissed nadia on the lips in front of the altar i couldnt decide if they had been lovers or if karen was asking forgiveness of the dead what would she need forgiveness for creating the situation in which nadia became the target for a shooter or maybe someone shot nadia by mistake maybe the person who put glass in karens paintbrush a few weeks back was trying to do the job right this time and missed a second time you got any security in place here besides your bouncer and that guy i nodded toward rodney my insecurity you mean olympia gave a laugh with an edge to it besides the police caught nadias murderer as you know very well the police made an arrest i acknowledged but that isnt the same thing as catching nadias murderer are you saying that the vet isnt guilty her eyes widened with alarm dismay or even pretensehard to read in the dimly lit room the setup calls for further exploration i said primly chad vishneski was asleep in his mothers apartment with the murder weaponthe alleged murder weaponon the pillow next to his head when the cops picked him up who phoned them why was the gun there if it was in fact his gun why didnt he stow it with his other weapons how did he know nadia thats a raftful of unanswered questions come to think of it olympia that wasnt you or rodney here who phoned the cops was it she sucked in a sharp harsh breath and looked involuntarily at rodney in another moment shed taken off she stopped at the bar to check on her staff paused at rodneys table with a glance at me and then worked her way through the crowd stopping to banter with regulars or to check on peoples orders just the good host making sure her guests were happy i sipped my whisky and pretended not to be watching her in a moment she slipped across the small stage and disappeared behind the curtain that led to the changing rooms i waited thirty seconds then snaked my own way through the crowd to the back of the stage olympia was standing in the dressingroom doorway hands on hips talking through the halfopen door my hiking boots made it hard to tiptoe but i moved as close as i could your contract requires that the audience be able to put their art on your body that was olympia if people walk away disappointed they wont come back and well both suffer im not the person who got into debt and i dont care about your suffering any more than you care about mine for once you and your precious investor will have to appreciate real art instead of kindergarten doodles i spent four days on these stencils it took rivka six hours to paint me im not wiping all this off so you can titillate people with death or save your club damn you karen you know damned well you have to do something and not just to save olympia spun around to bare her teeth at me what the fuck are you doing here in my effort to eavesdrop id kicked a screw so that it banged against the dressingroom wall i wanted to make sure karen was all right shes not or she wont be if she doesnt remember that were here to please our public not ourselves olympia said get back to the theater detective or ill have mark throw you out she went into the dressing room and shut the door before i could follow her i heard a bolt snap into place i put my ear shamelessly against the door but could only make out the angry rise and fall of olympias voice the door to a smaller neighboring room opened and i saw two slim young men peer into the hall i realized with a jolt that these were the dancers who gyrated in burkas during karens performance is olympia murdering karen one of them asked or karen killing olympia both laughed im v i warshawski i said im a detective and im investigating nadia guamans murder what did you see the night that nadia guaman was killed nothing the first one said kevin and i were long gone we dont do makeup for this gig as soon as the artist finishes back we come dump the rags hit the road did you leave through the back door here did you notice anyone in the alley we steer clear of the alley drunks smokers druggies not our scene time to stretch lee the two disappeared shutting the door firmly in my face i hate it when people do that i made a ferocious facethat would teach them a lessonand went onto the stage the crowd noise dipped for a moment as people thought i might be the start of the act but when they saw i was just inspecting the equipment the babble rose again i touched the mike and didnt get electrocuted i inspected the webcam and wasnt sprayed with noxious gases when i pressed the on button i turned it off and moved to my position at the back of the room petra zipped by with a trayful of drinks she shot me an anxious look i havent killed olympia i assured her yet a moment later olympia herself appeared onstage carrying a tray of paint cans and brushes the crowd noise grew more intense again catcalls began rising demands for the artist to get onstage at once the lights dimmed went out for the usual thirty seconds when they came back up the body artist was on the stage she was as always nude but i joined in the gasps and applause from the audience at the artwork covering her no wonder it had taken the unknown rivka six hours to paint her a lily stem grew from the artists vulva but instead of a flower it sprouted nadia guamans head which covered karens breasts karens left arm was painted black the right arm white colors of mourning in the west and the east a cypress branch drooped along her white shoulder on the black shoulder a field of poppies grew the artist stood and turned around an angel covered her back its wings spread across her shoulder blades its head was bent in grief in one hand it held a pomegranate but the other carried a sword i looked at rodney who was scowling he snapped his fingers in olympias direction she went to his table and bent so that the feathers at her cleavage brushed his earan erotic gesture that seemed wasted on both of them he was angry the clubs owner was trying to placate him on the stage the body artist stood with her back to us her head lowered she must have had a mike in her upswept hair because her voice carried easily through the room a beautiful tormented spirit went home today to jesus if you believe hes the resurrection and the life to the great goddess if thats how you think of life beyond these frail coverings of skin and bones nadia guaman who briefly honored my body with her art was slaughtered last friday night tonight i offer up my body in tribute to her the artist held her arms wide the angels wings lifted their feathers flowing down her arms the young men now anonymous feminine in their burkas each took one of her outstretched hands no one in the audience moved or spoke until rodney pushed his way to the stage he grabbed the paint cans and with large strokes began to put his usual work letters and numbers on karens buttocks his gestures were so aggressive that his painting looked like an assault so he wrote bi i copied the codes into my handheld even though i didnt expect to decipher them as rodney painted karen said in todays news the taliban in pakistan publicly flogged a seventeenyearold girl her brother was among the floggers she was accused of using her body as she chose not as the men around her wished in other news two hundred twenty thousand girls under the age of eleven were raped in america last year if nadia is in heaven now or someplace like it we know she will intercede on behalf of all assault victims the audience began to stir restively and some people booed it wasnt clear whether they were booing the artist or rodney when rodney finished his work he threw down his brush karen came to the lip of the stage for those of you who come regularly you know that i dont interfere with your art i respect all sincere efforts at selfexpression through painting tonight is different rivka is going to clean the canvas and recreate our work just as long as you broadcast my painting first bitch rodney grabbed the artist and dragged her across the stage to the webcams rodney couldnt hold her and operate the cameras at the same time and the two dancers refused to move when he commanded them to photograph his work olympia pushed through her audience to the stage and held karen while rodney operated the camera rodney nodded in satisfaction and left the stage karen wrenched herself free of olympia she grabbed a brush and painted a long red stripe that ran from olympias nose down her cleavage and onto the black leather jacket that opened below olympias breastbone the artist dropped the brush on the floor and strode to the back of the stage where she disappeared behind the curtains the crowd cheered and yelled so olympia pretended to take it in good humor she signaled to someone behind the bar to turn up the houselights we never know what the body artist will produce for us when she appears but we all know by now it will be entertainment we wont see anywhere else in chicago we here at club gouge respect art and artists and were contributing tonights profits to a scholarship that columbia college has set up in nadia guamans honor the images of death and innocence disappeared from the plasma screens on the stage they were replaced by blueandwhite shadowy dancers as a hot beat began pounding through the speakers as always the end of the artists performance signaled a frenzy of drinking for ten minutes or so the waitstaff were moving like crazed ballerinas from table to bar to table several couples hopped on the stage and began to dance olympia quickly directed her staff to move the paints and webcams out of the way whatever kept the customers happy i scanned the room hoping to spot some of chads buddies in the mob as far as i could tell none of them had come rodney was still at his solitary table working on what looked like his seventh beer although the room was so crowded that thirty or forty people were standing along the perimeter or even on the stage looking for seats rodneys sullenness created a force field that no one wanted to cross beyond him was a table of men who looked incongruous in this club settingfour men in their forties in wellcut business suits as i stared i realized one of them looked vaguely familiar and he was watching me in turn of course prince rainier cowles the lawyer whod been at nadias funeralhad it been this afternoon it felt like a hundred years had passed i squirmed through the bodies around me to his side mr cowles v i warshawski we met at nadia guamans funeral this afternoon his brows contracted what are you doing here i smiled down at him its a cold night on top of a cold and stressful day i thought an evening at an art club would cheer me up how about you a man at his table laughed is that what you call this place i would have said skin joint i thought about sticking a twenty up that girls sunshine but no one else was doing it that would have been artistic and creative of you i said and a bold statement of leadership the speaker frowned at me but before he could fire back one of his tablemates said thatd be good for the annual report mac we go into danger zones that no one else dares enter we should buy a piece of her tail mac looked at me as if to emphasize that he was directing his crudeness at me did you write down the web address cowles id like her tits where i could look at them from time to time this caused not just another outburst of laughter but some congratulatory high fives i dug my hands into my pockets to keep from flinging their drinks in their faces i grinned down at cowles this is the kind of evening that the guamans would enjoy isnt it witty banter about womens bodies right after burying their daughter he got to his feet anyone who comes into a place like this can expect to hear that kind of comment and more besides if you cant handle it then you shouldnt be here are you saying that nadia deserved to be shot he made an angry gesture of course not but this is a rough place i dont want to cause the guamans more pain than they feel already so im going to whitewash my report of what goes on in here but you know as well as i do that its a strip joint going under a classier name look at that guy there he pointed at rodney you cant tell me hes the kind of person a woman who respects herself would hang around youve got me there mr cowles i admitted he looks like a class x felony waiting to happen what was all that about his painting on that womans ass dont tell me you didnt want to join him cowles one of his friends said what would you have put there the man theyd called mac said maybe the same numbers the first man said theyd be his billable hours for the last month the three who were sitting down all laughed and cowles after a brief hesitation joined in but he said to me if youre here because of nadia guaman id advise you to leave her and her family strictly alone whoa mr cowles you told me you were their honorary uncle you didnt say you were their legal guardian or their mouthpiece if they want to talk to me they have a right to and vice versa just who are you anyway i smiled again i am v i warshawski good night mr cowles i returned to my own chair which had been taken over by a couple who were sharing the small seat as i extracted my coat from beneath them i saw cowles flag down a server and point at me the server smiled and gestured within a few minutes cowles probably knew i was a private eye there wasnt any real point in my keeping my identity a secret after all and besides the wench is dead as i handed two twenties to petra for my drinks rodney got to his feet and swaggered to the exit i told petra id be back for my change and hurried behind the stage down the corridor that led past the toilets and dressing rooms to the rear exit i reached the alley just in time to see rodney climb into a mercedes sedan i squatted behind another car and managed to copy his license plate before he bounced out of the lot when id corralled petra and gotten my changefifteen dollars more than i wanted to leave her or anyone on a twentyfivedollar tabi went backstage again this time to the stars dressing room two women were with karen one very young and white was sponging the angel from the artists back the second an africanamerican with a soft short afro was perched on a stool playing with the paintbrushes the artist looked at me and said to her companions the detective i was telling you about i smiled at the women my name is v i warshawski im sad to see you destroy the angel it was stunning and amazing that you could create all these images in one day its ephemeral art like goldsworthy only even more ephemeral than leaves along a lakeshore karen spoke gruffly but she turned away from me as if to hide any pleasure in my compliment this is rivka who did the tedious work of painting the designs on me and now is doing the equally hard part of removing them again shes my most reliable aidedecamp when im doing serious work of my own the younger woman flushed and said you have to take them off even though theyre so beautiful because its hard on the artists skin if she sleeps in the paint thats vesta on the stool the artist didnt pay any attention to rivkas interjection shes a thirddegree black belt did you bring her to protect you from overeager fans or from rodney i asked i think she was just trying to impress you vesta said im not a bodyguard she sat easily on her stool with a kind of confidence in her bearing that id seen in other experienced martial artistsno need to be aggressive in the world id learned to fight the hard way on the streets of south chicago and it made me too pugnacious too willing to believe the worst in the people i met although someone like rainier cowles and his friends demanded that one think the worst i asked the body artist if nadia had ever talked about him i hardly knew her she said her back still turned to me rivka said i thought you said she came to you because rivka darling dont think so much it will put wrinkles in your forehead the younger womans neck turned pink at the crude putdown when the artist realized vesta and i were both looking at her in disapproval she turned and kissed rivka on the mouth i just mean the artist added you must have misunderstood something i said why did nadia seek you out i asked as if the interruption hadnt taken place she didnt the artist said rivka mis girl enough of the lies vesta said nadia is dead allie is dead who else is going to die you knew allie i asked tell me about her theres nothing to tell the artist said we met at a music festival she was deep in the closet and wouldnt see me back in chicago because she was afraid someone would tell her parents shed only go to remote places like festivals to pick up women and then shed hop home like a frightened rabbit back to mass back to being a good hetero girl end of story not quite how did you find nadia shoes on the other foot rivka im freezing can you start cleaning and stop looking as if your dog just died rivka flushed again and resumed her scrubbing working on the artists vertebrae with the intensity of a sailor sanding a ships deck how did nadia find you i asked dont know she never said just showed up and started painting her designs i was surprisedits not very often that someone with actual ability paints me i was even more surprised when she asked me about allie what did you tell her i didnt remember allies name that pissed off nadia but what was i supposed to do keep track of every fuckedup woman who crawled into bed with me it got her more pissed off to know i hadnt kept track of allie i didnt know the woman was dead it was like the whole world was supposed to worship at alexandra guamans shrine and when i didnt it made me a cold bitch in nadias eyes in the mirror i saw tears spilling down rivkas face when she realized i was watching her she started scouring even harder which led the artist to utter a sharp complaint the artist turned inside rivkas grip took the sponge from her and brushed her hair out of her eyes take a break rivulet its been a long hard day ill work on my front while you get yourself some juice or a glass of wine rivka rubbed her eyes with the back of her hand smearing paint across her face she opened a small refrigerator tucked under a ledge and pulled out a bottled smoothie karen spread cream over her breasts and started removing nadias face its almost like a metaphor for life isnt it one minute youre here the next minute youre not her voice was toneless it was impossible to tell if she had any strong feelings about nadia or rivka or even herself did she ever mention rainier cowles to you vesta flipped the brushes shed been playing with onto the counter and looked at me who is rainier cowles a lawyer i said he claims a special interest in the guaman family he may still be out fronthe came here tonight with a tableful of corporate types he said he wanted to examine the strip joint where his protégés daughter spent her last night the body artist isnt a stripper rivka cried how could you say such a thing and then to pretend you admired the angel whoa there i interrupted im just reporting what he said not my own beliefs vesta doesnt need to be my bodyguard while i have rivka the artist said the younger woman flushed again her slender neck with little tendrils of hair curling from sweat made her look as vulnerable as a daylily vesta had slipped out of the room during rivkas outcry she came back in now to report that the house was still rocking i think your corporate guys are there near the back of the room left side go take a look buckley maybe itll refresh your memory i dont need to refresh a memory i dont have if thats why you came ms detective im exhausted and id like to finish paint removal so i can go to bed the artist didnt stop sponging her breasts while she spoke im tired too between the weather and death and people lying to me i said tell me what nadia told you about chad vishneski she didnt tell me anything the artist said rivka finish my shoulders so i can put on a sweater its freezing in here rivka jumped up and began scouring the cypress branch and pomegranate away from the artists shoulders vesta cant you help cant you see how shes shivering youve got her covered or uncovered rivka said vesta youre doing fine she leaned against the counter and started fiddling with the brushes again chad vishneski i repeated every time nadia painted on the artist here chad exploded if all nadia cared about was her sister then im guessing chad knew her sister right youre the person making up the story the body artist put on a camisole and then pulled a heavy sweater over it something about nadia bothered him so much he shot her and it could have been her cunt since thats what most guys see when they look at a woman and so you display yours as a defiant statement if thats all you think i am thats what ill be i asked nadia found you because youd slept with allie but how did she learn about your affair she never said or if she did it was after i stopped listening to her the artist slammed her palm against the dressing table she was more fucked up than her sister if thats what you want to know she pretended she wanted to have sex with me when obviously she was a virgin or at least not a dyke and backed away into a corner when i started kissing her and then she laid this heavy trip on me about her sister as if it was me not god who chose allies sexuality the artist pushed her straggling hair into a clip i told nadia to go home and get a dildo and leave me alone but she kept coming back to the club and doing her stupid painting i am so bored by her and her hangups and her crush on her sister i cant tell you how uninterested i am in all those girls right warm and fuzzy you are safe from ever hearing that criticism from me i started to zip my coat whats the story on rodney why did olympia insist that he draw his chicken scratchings even tonight youll have to ask olympia i dont understand why she does anything shes in financial trouble i gather not my problem the artist took off her thong and put on a pair of conventional underpants then pulled her jeans up over her legs interrupting rivkas efforts to finish cleaning them if youre having fun i hate to ask you to leave because i am an entertainer and i like my audience to have a good time but the evening is over talking to you is definitely my idea of a funfilled evening but ill let you go home i opened the dressingroom door then turned back there is one last question what did your mother call you when you were born the artist had been buttoning her jeans but her hands dropped to the side she stood completely still not speaking until she realized her friends were staring at her with the same interest or even astonishment that i was showing i dont remember that far back she finally drawled but going on experience she probably said here comes trouble rivka cackled in delight but vesta said are you investigating buckley why why dont you think karen buckleys her real name she was part of the situation that got nadia guaman murdered and im having a hard time getting any real information either about nadia or the people she was involved with so im digging and for all the public exposure of herself the body artist is surprisingly modest about her past which makes me wonder whether she had a past under a different name the artist was listening to me her lips curled in a sardonic smile id been hoping to provoke a response but whatever else she was whoever else she was she had schooled herself to reveal nothing so what if she did vesta persisted people change their names for a hundred different reasons and none of them are any of your business especially since the police arrested the guy who shot her his parents dont believe their son was the killer i said i agreed to investigate even though i didnt see much reason to question the arrest but karen has made me realize that i was wrong chad vishneski may well have been framed she didnt say any such thing rivka cried shes made you look pretty stupid all night she brought vesta along i explained even after someone wired glass to her paintbrush the artist didnt think she needed a black belt on hand but now murder has happened for real and shes scared its a natural reaction to murder rivka protested im scared too its me who told her to bring vesta nice try rivulet the body artist said but it was my idea to add vesta to the entourage vesta frowned your entourage dont put yourself on so high a pedestal you break your neck falling off buckley i left but vesta followed me into the hall to ask if i thought karens life was in actual danger i shook my head right now im so bewildered i dont know which way to look let alone what i think this is the first i heard of a connection between nadia and the artist at least a connection through nadias dead sister now im having to reorganize my ideas maybe nadia was looking for everyone her sister slept with maybe she tracked down some prominent woman who didnt want her sexuality coming to light maybe this unknown mystery woman murdered allie and then nadia and all the fuss with rodney and chad and the body artist belongs to a completely different story not the story of nadias death vestas face showed warmth trouble intelligent concern karen lives a life of great secrecy even though she has to be the center of attention she almost never says anything personal about her past the most ive ever heard her say was that she ran away from home when she was a teenager but i dont even know where her home was when chad vishneski first started acting up i thought maybe he was part of her childhood coming after karen but she says she never saw him before and you believe her vestas wide mouth twisted i dont know if i believe her when she says theres ice on the lake but shes a lonely scared girl under all that paint i know shes maddeningat least she maddens mebut i still dont want to see her get hurt what about her relations with alexandra guaman do you think she genuinely forgot alexandras name vesta smiled sadly buckleys universe pretty much begins and ends with her own self the affair was brief it ended with buckley being angry with guaman for not being willing to come out of the closet and it all happened a long time ago in another place i smacked the wall in frustration who else can i talk to who can tell me how nadia guaman found the artist or what the two of them talked about or who else alexandra might have slept with perhaps shes confided in rivka but i wouldnt think so she guards herself very carefully vesta turned back to the dressing room but paused her hand on the doorknob if someone is really trying to hurt karen what should we do get a real bodyguard i said and even so shes putting herself out in public shed be just about impossible to protect vestas worried gaze followed me back up the corridor as i made my way through the crowd to the main exit i saw olympia had joined rainier cowles and his friends she had her head flung back laughing at something they were saying putting all her considerable energy into wooing the group if she was in financial trouble as the scrap of conversation id overheard before the show indicated maybe she thought this quartet of wealth could rescue her from rodney i wondered again about rodneys codes billable hours one of cowless friends had suggested but the numbers were too long for a single dollar transaction back before the lottery put the numbers racket out of business i would have thought they had something to do with running numbers maybe it was something else just as simple although nothing around olympia and karen buckley was simple clueless in chicago later that january came back to me only as a blur of ice and darkness short nights trying to keep pace with people in the entertainment world long days stumbling through snowdrifts with the dogs before blearing my sleepdeprived eyes in front of the computer every now and then id connect with jake thibaut or lotty and feel a moment of warmth and sanity but all i really remember was my alarm calling me an hour before dawn to start the whole routine all over again it had been almost one am before i got to bed the night i saw rainier cowles at club gouge when my radio woke me a scant five hours later it was with the cheery report that we were in the middle of a new snowstorm and it was seventeen degrees at the lakefront if only i could have brought myself to stay married to richard yarborough i could have huddled under the blankets in his oak brook mansion until the spring thaw of course he would have wanted to huddle there with me at least when he got back at midnight from entertaining his walletwielding clients that thought got me to my feet and into the bathroom surly but mobile murray ryerson phoned just as i returned from floundering through the drifts with the dogs you lead an exciting life warshawski but youre too selfish to include your friends in your adventures yep its a round of nonstop thrills you want to walk the dogs for me eat dinner with mr contreras i take it back i take it back he said hastily youre not selfish youre noble but you still couldve called me after nadia guaman died now im picking up thirdhand that the perps mom hired you murray is an investigative reporter for the heraldstar which used to be a great newspaper until like papers all over america they began cutting staff and pages to keep wall street happy these days the paper looks more like my weekly reader than a serious daily murray is still a good reporter but he has less and less incentive to keep digging since so many of his stories get killed he has a tv gig through the stars global entertainment news channel so i never worry about his starving to death but hes depressed a lot of the time and turns to me way too much for news your sources are as lazy as you are these days murray i was too tired to be tactful a chad vishneski is not the perp and b it was his father who hired me i know im late to the party but i hear you held the dying woman outside a strip club doesnt seem like your kind of venue go there yourself i said its a great show im surprised you havent caught it yet truth is ive been on vacation buenos aires in january beats chicago to hell i got home last night and saw that the girl detective had been superbusy in my absence can i buy you a drink tonight and hear all about it golden glow at eight murray if youll do one little thing for me first not the dogs or the old man you still have friends in the dmv and i dont if i give you a license plate will you tell me who owns it i read off the number from the sedan that rodney had driven last night it was a relief to offload even one of my chores when i finished changing for work and went back outside i wished id given him something more challenging like cleaning off my car and shoveling a path for it it took twenty minutes to dig it out but there wasnt an easy way to take public transit to nadia guamans apartment and if nadia had managed to track down her dead sisters lovers then i needed to go through her apartment to see who else she might have been targeting nadia had lived about a mile from my office in the snow it was a quiet neighborhood but the telltale gang graffiti were present on the bus stops and overpasses nadias apartment was in a wellkept courtyard building on one of the side streets just north of north avenue people were leaving for work and i didnt have to stand on the sidewalk long before a woman emerged she held the door for me her eyes on the weather outside not on the face of a stranger entering in the entryway away from the wind and blowing snow the quiet fell on me like a blessing i brushed the snow from my pant legs stomped my feet clean and climbed up to the third floor nadia had respectable locks but nothing out of the ordinary even with my hands stiff from cold i worked the tumblers in under ten minutes i was lucky i was just opening the door when a man came out of the apartment across the landing who are you he asked miss nadia isnt at home and she doesnt live with anyone im a detective you know miss nadia is deadher family buried her yesterday i want to look for evidence in her apartment he shook his head youre too late someone else was in here yesterday and they said the same thing that they were detectives looking for evidence i saw them going in and when i asked them for identification they showed me their guns instead did you call why when everyone knows the police themselves are operating burglary rings in this neighborhood and you are you also a detective whose identification is a gun i fished my wallet out of my briefcase and showed him the laminated copy of my pi license im a private investigator ive been hired to uncover the reason for miss nadias murder they made an arrest i saw it was some lovers quarrel they make wrongful arrests every day i said the neighbor nodded and started an involved story about his sisters second son i went into nadias place and found a light switch the neighbor still talking followed me in but he fell silent when he saw the chaos created by yesterdays detectives whoever had been searching whatever theyd been looking for theyd done a thorough job of tossing books from shelves and dvds from their cases like every artist ive known nadia covered her walls with pictures masks unusual found objects most of these had been flung to the floor the hooks and the dust outlines on the walls showing where theyd once hung have you been in here before i asked the neighbor i didnt take anything he said you cant accuse me of that i looked at him closely so you have been in here that was you in here yesterday not people pretending to be detectives that isnt true he cried they really came i only wondered why and they hadnt locked the door when they left so you locked up behind them how did you have a key to ms guamans dead bolt she gave it to me in case there was an emergency or to feed her cat when she was out of town i had a hard time picturing the shy intense nadia with a life that took her out of town although maybe shed gone around the country hunting for her dead sisters lovers people do odd things when theyre gripped by an obsession i walked through the apartments three rooms in the bedroom i found the one piece of art left on the walls a crucifix where the head of jesus had been replaced by the head of a girl taken from an old doll the hair had been pulled from the dolls head and wrapped around the hands of the crucified christ the image was profoundly disturbing not what i would want to wake to i realized there were no signs of a cat no litter box no food or water dishes where is the cat in my home when i learned miss nadia was dead i took in the cat she called it ixcuina after some old goddess a strange name for an animal but it is a strange animal i looked from the dismantled apartment to his flushed face i didnt believe that he hadnt been here yesterday but i also didnt think he would have destroyed the apartment if hed been inside surreptitiously so mr urbanke he muttered defensive so mr urbanke as a frequent visitor to ms guamans can you tell me what yesterdays fake detectives might have taken with them can you tell if any of her art is missing he looked around slowly but shook his head iti cant tell with everything on the floor like this maybe if i put the pictures back on the wall we spent the next hour or so matching artwork to dim outlines we worked our way through the apartments three rooms but at the end even though there were still some gaps on the walls urbanke couldnt tell what was gone besides he added she was always bringing in something new taking down something she was tired of it was like a museum her private museum where the exhibits were always changing the one thing i dont see is her computer she kept it here he pointed at a worktable in the corner of the apartments big front room the table was built for artists or drafters one half could be lifted up and down at different angles depending on how the person liked to work while the other half remained flat the flat space nadias office worktop held bills and a scattered pile of sketches the charger for the computer was still plugged into the wall but of the computer itself there was no trace urbanke stood next to me looking through nadias sketches who knows if this artwork is valuable those detectives didnt take it but her computer definitely you could sell it for drugs we walked out together i left mr urbanke to lock nadias door since he had a key no matter how hed gotten hold of it i wanted to know what hed taken besides the cat ixcuina i wondered too why lazar and cristina guaman hadnt come but maybe collecting their daughters belongings was too much for them right now in the entryway i stopped to look at the mailboxes urbankes first name was julian i bumped across the slushpacked roads to my office my leasemate and i contribute to a service that shovels the walks on our street along with the parking area that we share with the other two buildings abutting it i thankfully abandoned my car in the small lot and went into my office to catch up with my messages now i felt bewildered almost split in half by the two lives i was looking at did chad vishneski and nadia guaman have anything at all in common had her killer trashed her apartment and if her killer wasnt chad why was he being brought into her story at all all i could do was plod forward with what little i had to go on the beer cans pillowcase and guns id collected from mona vishneskis were still in my car and i had chads girlie magazines in my briefcase i had taken these things yesterday for no good reason except trying to put on a show for the client and his exwifethe ghost of sherlock holmes dictates that the detective sees something in the detritus of everyday life overlooked by ordinary mortals i packed up the guns and the empties and pillowcase and called a messenger to carry them to cheviot labs there may be nothing here i wrote in my cover letter but please check to see whether anything besides beer was in these cans and see if you can trace the purchase history on these guns i didnt include the magazinesi didnt think i needed a comparative analysis of arabic and british porn directed at us servicemen i put them into the vishneski case file to keep until the matter was resolved once the messenger had left i leaned back in my desk chair and studied my mothers engraving of the uffizi someone had gone through nadia guamans apartment i didnt trust her neighbor he had nadias keys hed helped himself to her cat but he hadnt needed to point out that her computer was missing and he could have searched her place at his leisure no need to turn it upside down it was possible that shed stiffed advances from him and that hed murdered her himself and then trashed her apartment to finish off his furybut even that meant chad vishneski wasnt the killer the story was too complicated for me to follow without a chart i drew one up on a big piece of newsprint and taped it to my wall rodney the thug who had the run of club gouge i needed his last name i needed to know who he was what hold he had on olympia then there were all the murky sleeping arrangements among the body artist nadias dead sister olympia and the two women id met last night rivka and vesta whose last names id also need to get vesta a black belt had once been one of karen buckleys lovers when wed spoken last night shed seemed calm dispassionate even in discussing the body artist it was hard to believe she might have killed nadia in a jealous frenzy besides according to the artist thered been nothing in her relations with nadia to make anyone jealous i didnt believe much of what karen buckley said but her account of nadias advances and retreats had a ring of truth to it the younger woman rivka was a different story she didnt have much skin between her feelings and the world judging by last nights behavior she was jealous of everyone who captured the artists attention she could have believed there was more between nadia and the artist than ever really took place and what about alexandra i needed more information about her that was clear if nadia had known about the artists private life would the youngest sister clara have known as well or would the two older girls have protected the baby of the family i toyed with a fantasy in which the guamans murdered their daughter so that her sexuality would remain a deeply buried secret speculation is the detectives enemy facts i needed facts about the guamans and about the body artist i tried to put together a list of questions about the artist vesta and rivka believed shed run away from home as a teen maybe shed changed her name to protect herself from a violent fatherbrotherlover i looked for legal name changes to karen buckley during the past decade but drew another blank she seemed to think that her performances gave her power you can get this close as close as my skin but you cant get inside me i control the boundaries i imagined standing naked in front of an audience and my skin crawled it felt like a horrible kind of exposure i flung my pen down i couldnt find anything out about karens past so i needed to concentrate on what i knew about her in the present her relationship with olympia who had financial woes that bore more exploration somehow olympia had established a modicum of control over the body artist and the artist was a woman who definitely liked to be in control of her relationships the biggest questions had to do with the outbursts nadia or nadias paintings had provoked in chad vishneski and neither the artist nor nadias family was giving me any insight into what that was about maybe chad had written his buddies or his parents explaining why nadias paintings had gotten so deeply under his skin i called the client john vishneski was in the mercurio office on huron going over drawings no one was out on a building in this weather of course i asked if chad had said anything to him about nadia or the body artist i never heard of those two women until they came and arrested chad i guess he thought the idea of a club like that would shock me or disgust me kids have such funny ideas about parents dont they like we dont have basic human feelings or needs or something i expect i was the same way about my old man i thought of my own mother how painful id found it to think she might have the sexual impulses common to us all parents arent supposed to operate in the world of desire perhaps thats the only way children can grow up feeling safe what did chad do for email his phone a computer computer i guess his phonehes like all the kids his agemostly he texts he has a lenovo thinkpad i bought it for him when he first shipped out he took it all over iraq with him he even kept a blog the way so many folks do these days the computer isnt at your wifes place your exwifes do you have it i knew the answer would be no before he gave it mona hadnt imagined seeing her sons cell phone someone had been in the apartment ahead of us the previous afternoon someone had helped themselves to chads phone and his laptop i hung up i was starting to feel as if i were in one of those dreams where you are running from some menace you cant see and the whole time the menace is shutting every door you turn to someone with a lot of organizational talent was running faster than me cutting in ahead of me at every exit i looked at my hands i am a street fighter i said no one can stop me trouble was i didnt really believe it nada about nadia i had to go downtown for a meeting a routine inquiry where id been able to do all the work without any shadowy menaces blocking my path i pulled my documents together put on some makeup and my dressy boots and went back out into the bracing winter air the snow had stopped after a mere four inchesnothing really to a thirddegree street fighter as i rode the l down to the loop i knew i needed to talk to the guamans id only been on the case for two days but it had been five days since nadia had died it was strange that they hadnt sought me out the woman whod been with their daughter when she died i decided to go over to pilsen to try to speak with cristina guaman at the hardware store where lifestory told me she worked as soon as my loop meeting ended i took the l west and south to damen and cermak and walked the three blocks to the hardware store sopladores de nieve palas todo para el invierno se habla inglés the placard in the window had advertised everything for winter but the store really had everything period snow shovels ice melt mittens space heaters fans kitchen utensils tvs microwaves coloring books it was a small space but not only was every surface covered long hooks dangling from the ceiling held dried tomatoes and garlic dvds dog collars trusses the place wasnt well lit and i didnt see cristina guaman at first but after stumbling against a rack full of hard hats i found her near the back at a computer someone was talking to her in spanish but the conversation was apparently desultory because cristina only nodded her head while she typed i stood next to the woman who was speaking to her waiting for a lull but the woman saw i was a stranger perhaps a customer and asked in spanish if i needed help i need a word with ms guaman i said hoping she really did know english my spanish is pretty rudimentary the woman moved away from the counter and cristina guaman stopped typing to look at me yes she said what do you need i pulled one of my cards out of my bag im sorry to interrupt you at work ms guaman but im the woman who was with your daughter when she died is there a place where we could talk we can talk here she folded her hands on top of the keyboard not the gesture of a woman at ease but to create a barrier between herself and me i dont want to broadcast your familys business to the whole store isnt there someplace private my family has no business that the whole world cannot attend to are you the owner of that terrible place that club where women take off their clothes so men can draw nasty pictures on their bodies i wondered if family ties would make her unbend so i explained my role as petras cousin my desire to protect her my observation of nadia and nadias anguish or anger she kept drawing a face the face of a beautiful young woman with short curly hair and then she would slash a line through it im wondering if that might have been her sister claras hair is long and it is almost blond cristina guamans eyes were wary alexandra do you have a photograph of her it was her name nadia was calling as she died at that cristina sucked in a breath alexandra has been dead a long time nadia couldnt let her rest in peace so she was painting alexandras face i have no desire to know what pictures nadia might be painting on a womans body she knew how strongly i felther father tooabout her going to that place when did you last talk to her cristina guaman looked around to see if anyone was in earshot many months went by nadia was angry always for the last two years so angry she would not speak to her father or me my heart is broken at her death but she cut herself away from her family she moved into that apartment in a dangerous neighborhood she stayed away from mass even though i knew she would pay no attention to my words i had to call her when she started making a spectacle of herself in that degenerate club i asked how she had learned nadia was painting on the body artist but of course people had been using their phones to take video footage of the performances these inevitably ended up skipping around the world wide web where more than one neighbor had shown them to the guamans the picture was poor the light was bad but everyone could see that woman sitting there naked showing off her breasts and people could easily see nadias face can you imagine how you would feel when your daughter has flaunted herself in public for the whole world to see i had to call her i had to try to tell her how very worried i was to see her in such a corrupt place and was it alexandras face she was painting cristinas nose twitched as if she were smelling something bad it was enough to see nadia together with a naked woman if she was involving her sainted sister then i am thankful to god that i was spared that sight how did alexandra die cristina backed away from me in a painful hard way that i prefer not to discuss did she have a boyfriend a girlfriend anyone i could talk to what are you trying to ask cristina hissed so she knew her daughter had women as lovers alexandra wouldnt come out of the closet for fear her mother would learn and her mother had known all along had alexandra committed suicide because of the pressure had nadia known and moved out after fighting with her mother over allies sexuality i couldnt think of any good way to ask these questions so i asked in a bad way who told you that alexandra was sleeping with women cristina gasped if you came here to slander my saint my angel i will call the police leave im not trying to upset you ms guaman just to figure out who killed your beloved daughter nadia they arrested a man its enough enough that were dragged through the dirt by nadia without you coming to me and pouring it over me i went to nadias apartment this morning i said someone had broken in had stolen her computer and all her discs all her artwork is missing at that she became very quiet she shook her head slowly as if unhappy at whatever she was thinking but even though i tried several different gambits she wouldnt share her private thoughts with me i told her about nadias conviction that someone was spying on her who would that have been do you think i asked the person who murdered her cristina shook her head again nadia had many unhappy ideas and not very many of them areweretrue was it she who told you those filthy lies about alexandra nadia believed them and wouldnt accept my word that her sister was pure a good christian not capable of such acts but enough anger nadia is with her sister now in the arms of the blessed mother i thank god that she has no more pain on this earth that was all i was going to learn from her nada about nadia i walked unhappily from the store wondering just what it was cristina guaman didnt want me to know about her daughter daughters i stopped in a taquería across the street for a bowl of rice and beans ernie couldnt tell me anything even if i could get past security at ohare to reach lazar guaman it was hard to convince myself that such a gray and beaten man would talk to me that left the surviving daughter poor young clara it was twothirtywith luck id make it to her school before she left vow of silence i rode the green line to halsted and walked the few blocks to st teresa of avila prep school got out at three and the city buses were already lined up unless the guamans selfappointed protector could leave his la salle street practice to collect clara the easiest route home for her was on the number bus down blue island avenue i reached the school about ten minutes ahead of the exodus i shivered in the bus stop cattycorner to the school until the tall doors opened and the students poured out they seemed to arrive in one giant wave of screaming jostling teens but as they passed me they broke into little clotsgroups of highspirited boys or girls laughing and kidding together or couples in that adolescent embrace that doesnt allow a single molecule of air between their bodies a number were walking alone shoulders hunched to avoid the glances of a pitying world most were bent under their giant backpacks looking much as their peasant forebears must have lugging cotton or corn or wood and all it seemed were madly reconnecting to their cell phones and music players after a day of forced withdrawal my dressy boots were elegant but they werent very warm i was beginning to think id have to amputate my toes if i stood outside much longer when clara guaman appeared in the middle of a knot of other girls unlike yesterday when shed gone barearmed to her sisters funeral she was dressed sensibly in a parka although she hadnt bothered to zip it shut she also had foresworn the gaudy eye shadow shed sported at the funeral when she and her friends had boarded their bus i followed them and swiped my cta card through the machine the driver a thickset woman in her forties nodded at the kids as they climbed up the steps she looked at me in surpriseadults dont usually ride the school routesbut she didnt say anything when the bus was packed from stem to stern she rolled away from the curb the shrieks and shouts of sixty or so kids moaning over tests over boyfriends or girlfriends hotly arguing whod said what to whom made my head drum but the driver just smiled to herself focusing on the potholes that littered blue island avenue like the rest of the world she had her own little soundstage plugged into her ears i worked my way to the back where clara and her friends had found seats she was talking animatedly but her skin was gray and there were dark circles under her eyes v i warshawski i said when she looked up at me we met yesterday at your sisters funeral her face shut down into the arrogant angry lines id seen at the church are you here to apologize some more dont bother i want to know when i can talk to you youre doing it right now i guess i cant make you shut up her friends stared at us with frank curiosity privately you cant if theres something you want to say to me do it right here and then get out of my life we had both been bellowing to be heard over the ruckus around us but the noise began dying down as kids nearby caught what we were saying one of them asked if clara wanted him to call shes harmless clara said roughly i didnt want to say too much in front of this texting tweeting audience but i needed some way of getting her to talk to me when i heard the shots i ran to your sisters side i held her as she died her last word was a call to allie the silence around us became absolute clara sucked in a breath her face as shocked as if id slapped her her friends gazed at her with vampirelike avidity when clara didnt say anything i said could we go someplace to talk about nadia and your other sister you cant talk about allie clara cried why not she looked around wildly and then said her name is sacred you cant use it no one is allowed to talk about her the kids around us began murmuring excitedly among themselves even if i hadnt been tired and cold the chatter made it hard to think it certainly made the bus a stupid place to try to talk but i plowed ahead when did you last talk to nadia i dont remember and its none of your business anyway the lurching of the bus meant i couldnt keep my eyes on her face but i thought clara looked more scared than angry despite her defiant words your mother says she called nadia when your sister was seen on youtube painting on the body artist how did nadia respond have you been talking to my mother she has enough to worry about without someone like you butting in karen buckley put on a special program in your sisters honor last night karens the body artist who came to your sisters funeral i remember who came to my own sisters funeral what did nadia tell you about alexandras death at that question clara definitely looked more frightened than angry i told you we cant talk about allie so butt out all right if we cant talk about allie lets talk about the body artist how did nadia find her clara looked at me but didnt speak one of the boys near her left the bus i took his place the club was full last night for the artists program in your sisters memory rainier cowles brought a party one of the men clara bounced to her feet and bent to stick her head in my face if youre a pal of rainiers you can leave me alone go back to prince rainier and suck his dick the raw language was meant to shock she stared at me for a few seconds hoping for some sign that shed hit home when i only smiled sadly because her youth and pain were so poignant she marched to the front of the bus deliberately shoving people as if vicariously punching me her friends gave me the kind of frigid looks i remembered from my own adolescence they sniffed as if smelling garbage and pointedly turned away from me then started giggling loudly it would be more to the point if youd help clara i said shes frightened and lonely this made them laugh more loudly the bus was stopped for the light at nineteenth street i pulled out one of my business cards and scribbled on the back rainier cowles is not a friend or business associate of mine and i would never repeat anything you told me call or text me when you feel up to talking enough kids had left the bus that it was easy for me to walk to the front and stand next to clara her rigid posture despite the weight of her backpack told me she was very aware of my presence i tucked the card into her parka pocket but she refused to turn her head i got off at the next stop and crossed the street to pick up a northbound bus as the winter twilight closed in on me i rode buses and trains back to my office my leasemate tessa was hard at work her half of the building flooded with spotlights and the flame of her blowtorch my own half was dark i didnt bother turning on a light just took off my boots and sat with my feet curled up under me on the sofa to warm them trying to decode clara guamans response to my questions allies name is sacred clara had been told never to discuss her sister but why because the family was afraid alexandras sexuality would leak out it was hard to accept that a parent still thought of homosexuality as so shameful but of course many people do clara thought or feared i was connected to rainier cowles last night at club gouge he had claimed he was there to make sure the club respected nadia but he and his friends had definitely felt they were on a boys night out and not at a wake nor did i place any credence in cowless casting himself as an honorary uncle lawyers like him bill themselves at five hundred dollars an hour or more they dont waste their time on the families of baggage handlers but if he wasnt protecting the guamans what was he doing hanging around their lives he was certainly protecting something and that something had to be himself or possibly a highflying client allie nadia had cried she wanted her sister not her mother as she was dying or she knew she was dying and hoped alexandra would be there to greet her in the country of the dead at length i turned on a light and walked over to my computer find me alexandra guaman fetch boy the floor was numbingly cold underneath my panty hose i rummaged in my back storeroom and found an old pair of running shoes to wear as slippers while lifestory was searching out alexandra guamans details i logged on to embodiedartcom the body artists website i wanted to look again at the paintings nadia guaman had made on the artist to see if i could understand why they had roused chad vishneski so thoroughly instead of the slide show id found on my previous visit to the site the screen was blank except for the message out of respect for the dead we have temporarily taken the site offline i somehow had not expected so much sensitivity on karen buckleys part it forced me to think of her as less completely selfcentered than shed seemed i made myself a coffee and opened the report id ordered on olympia which had been sitting in my computers pending folder since the previous afternoon the details of olympias life were sketchy as were her financials she owned a loft apartment on the near north side in the stretch made newly hot by the destruction of the old cabrini green highrises she didnt actually own it she was paying a mortgage on it as she was on a summer place near michigan city the debt on the two properties was around half a million olympia didnt own the building where she ran the club that was held by a blind consortium managed through the fort dearborn trust i whistled through my teeth trying to pick apart what i could of the clubs finances olympia had been running club gouge for almost three years her background had been in restaurants and entertainment shed managed a restaurant at one of the metroarea casinos then opened a nightclub of her own in west suburban aurora the aurora borealis proved so successful that shed apparently decided she was ready for the big city three years ago shed sold her aurora place and opened club gouge olympias first two years at club gouge even during the boom economy had been disastrous shed run through almost a million dollars maxed out her credit cards and overdrawn her line of credit and then as the bottom fell out of the economy just as everyone else in the country was losing their jobs and their homes olympias bills were wiped clean there was no way of seeing who her godfather had been but someone had put a million dollars in cash into her account santa claus rodney claus he was the person olympia was trying to keep happy he was the one shed called her insecurity but he wasnt olympias savior he was the foot soldier sent to keep an eye on the investment nadia had sought out the body artist because buckley had known allie i couldnt get away from that but how had nadia found out that her sister had known the artist if murder happened because of the guaman familys sensitivity over allies sexuality why was nadia dead and not karen buckley i was making myself crazy with all these unprovable scenarios it was close to five pm now id planned on going home to walk the dogs and eat a bowl of pasta before meeting murray but i was too exhausted from my day in the snow i called mr contreras and asked him to let the dogs out i was heading to the daybed in my back room when my computer pinged to tell me one of my requested reports had arrived alexandra guaman the file on her wasnt very big but when i opened it the first thing i saw was her high school yearbook picture her face framed by curly dark hair didnt have a knife slash across the middle other than that she looked like the portrait nadia had drawn on the body artists back that didnt particularly startle me id been expecting it what jumped out at me was where she died alexandra guaman had been working for a private security firm in iraq shed been driving a truck on a supposedly safe route when an ied exploded and killed her and the wheel goes round and round i printed out the files on alexandra guaman and took them with me into the back room to read while i stretched out on my daybed an hour later when i came to the pages were strewn across me and the floor like dead leaves i struggled upright washing the sleep out of my eyes under tessas shower making myself coffee in our kitchenette i had an hour before i had to meet murray and i was feeling so tense about my lack of headway that i wanted to get through as many documents as i could what i had on alexandra guaman didnt tell me much so many people have died in iraq since we invaded that journalists now dump them all into a journalistic mass grave fifteen killed in an explosion outside basra seven dead in a baghdad market thirty obliterated in a bombing run on fallujah alexandras bio was correspondingly slim the oldest of the guaman daughters the first to attend st teresa of avila prep followed by college at depaul here in chicago a degree in communications then a job at tintrey the big security contractor tintreys headquarters were in chicago or at least the suburbs in the corporate corridor along the north leg of the tristate alexandra had gone to iraq for tintrey four years ago tintrey had contracts for everything from overtheroad trucking to providing field firstaid kits alexandras job title a level employee in communications could have meant anything creating pr monitoring computer networks getting realtime information to field personnel chicagos latino paper had an obituary showing the smiling yearbook picture i was getting to know by heart i squinted at the page picking my way through the spanish the anguish of the parents the long wait for news the sad realization when alexandras boss wrote a letter of condolence to the family an ied had exploded when she was heroically driving a truck as part of a convoy to the baghdad airport nothing in the story or in any of my skimpy reports about her sex life or about the body artist maybe alexandra had been a lesbian but shed been in iraq at the same time as chad vishneski it was her face on the body artist that roused him to fury had she turned chad down in baghdad had an affair with him that shed regretted or maybe chad had attacked alexandra his service record was cleancertainly no assault chargesbut that didnt mean the two didnt have a history together and then when he saw her face pop up out of the blue hed gone after nadia i knew i was committed to chads innocence but these connections did not look innocent maybe terry finchley was right after all maybe chad had doped his own beer out of guilt over murdering nadia if that was the case though who had broken into her apartment yesterday the ideas spun round and round uselessly like wheels unable to find traction in a snowbank frustrated i looked up reports on tintrey if i couldnt find enough about alexandra i had the opposite problem with the company that took her to iraq i started with their website which showed heroic warriors defending america from terrorists in the middle east and africa but also stressed that tintrey is more than just a group of highly skilled fighting men and women were there when you need us whether its at the px or the rx tintrey provided base security they had a division that produced protective gear they built base housing they bodyguarded visiting vips and they helped staff the post exchanges the website flashed me through the pxs which looked like giant shopping malls electronics warehouses clothes fastfood restaurants banks even car dealerships you might be twelve thousand miles from home but you couldnt escape mcdonalds or multiplexes i was astonished somehow when people talked about base pxs id thought of small general stores the kind they show in old westerns but if the us needs to get everyone on board our farflung military operations of course ordinary vendors need a piece of the pie too it cant all go to lockheed martin the news reports were more tempered and more mixed as one of some hundred thirty private security contractors working in tandem with us military bases tintrey had made their share of missteps billing the department of defense for phantom supplies building a bridge that collapsed the first time a tank rolled across it everyone agreed though that tintrey owner jarvis maclean had a classic ragstoriches story or at least jeanstoriches the most enthusiastic report came from wired into the north shore a webzine that covered news in the metro area glenbrook grad hits the jackpot jarvis maclean was flipping burgers while he went to glenbrook high school but those days are long behind him hes traded his deepfat fryer for a ferrari and has a home chef whos more likely to serve him burgundy than burgers maclean home from his eighth trip to baghdad talked to us about life in a war zone and the dangerous but rewarding work his nine thousand iraqbased employees do while he was in high school flipping those burgers maclean started a firm that provided security at suburban functions the company grew and branched out and he made some smart acquisitions including the purchase of tristate health which had turned into tintreys medical division and achilles which made protective gear will jarvis macleans golden touch change achilles fortunes asked an article in fortune making a fresh start from the ground up and the top down maclean has also replaced achilles advertising firm with the highflying dashiellparker company perhaps dashiellparker can improve morale in a firm plagued by cost overruns as it ramps up production of its patented nanoparticles for shielding both tintrey employees and us soldiers in iraq another story in the financial times gave a thumbnail sketch of tintreys rise the company was still relatively small when maclean tied his fortunes to ws coattails in after the invasion of iraq maclean was rewarded with one of the many lucrative security and rebuilding contracts the us handed out to private companies between and jarvis macleans annual revenues bloomed from under a hundred million to over a billion mazel tov i snarled under my breath you got rich while alexandra guaman got dead and barely merited a line of type my phone dinged to let me know i needed to leave to meet murray id been so wrapped up in my reading i hadnt even noticed my feet getting cold i was just logging off when i did a double take on jarvis macleans name mac the happy boys at rainier cowless table last night had called one of their party mac i went back to tintreys corporate site and looked for photos of maclean sure enough he was the guy whod said he wanted to look at karens breaststits hed called themfrom time to time the report showed him accepting an award from president bush in one picture solemnfaced in battle fatigues in another and flanked by rainier cowles what was cowles to them their outside counsel another person in the photo had also been with cowles at club gouge last night according to the caption this was gilbert scalia head of tintreys enduring freedom division which oversaw their iraqi operations how cute to call the division after the official name for the invasion i logged off in disgust while i laced up my work boots i looked up the phone number for tim radke the only one of chads friends whose name john and mona vishneski remembered radke responded to the news i was investigating chads death unenthusiastically but he did agree to see me i havent known chad all that long radke warned me but hes not a bad guy id like to help him out that was not exactly a ringing character endorsement but we set a date at a division street bar for the next evening radke repaired computer setups for a local cable company hed be finishing around six and reckoned he could meet me by seven before finally packing up for the night i called terry finchley over at cpd headquarters a detective at his level being groomed for a major promotion didnt keep regular hours any more than i did he was still at his desk warshawski you were next on my list to call id known finchley long enough to hear the tightly reined fury in his thickened voice i could picture the pulses throbbing at his temples turning his ebony skin a deeper black i take it you got the message i left last night just what were you doing moving a murder suspect out of county custody i just got the report you had this guy lawyered up so fast we didnt have a chance lawyered up i repeated coldly that is a disgusting phrase by which you mean i saw chad vishneski had access to some basic constitutionally protected rights aside from the fact that hes in a coma so its hard to believe hes a flight risk and aside from the fact that you arrested him based on no more than a phone tip which came from where exactly i do not have to reveal anything to you warshawski crime hotlines least of all but i will remind you that the gun used to murder nadia guaman was found in bed next to vishneski who was unconscious and unable to answer any questions when your crew picked up the murder weapon what did they do with vishneskis cell phone and his laptop a lenovo thinkpad it was that again is none of your damned business unless you are representing the perp in which case you can present the usual subpoenas for evidence his parents hired me john and mona vishneski when i saw that chads computer and his cell phone were missing i assumed you had booked them in but if not it supports our hypothesis that someone was in the apartment with chad the night guaman was murdered and that whoever was there thought it prudent not to leave his electronics lying around where someone like you or even me could read his files finchley was silent for a minute i heard the clicking of his fingers on his keyboard and then a swearword under his breath but unmistakable if the electronics are missingand im not relying on your word for that or anything in this case warshawskiit doesnt prove squat about vishneskis innocence not in and of itself i said but i went over to nadia guamans apartment this morning which the cpd didnt seem to think was worth searching heres something strange her place had been tossed her computer was gone some of her artwork he tapped more keys she lived in humboldt park plenty of drughappy housebreakers there if it was just guaman or just vishneski whose computer was gone id agree but both come on terry he let out a sigh deliberately loud to signal that i was annoying him we have a solid case against vishneski he assaulted the dead woman twice in the weeks before he shot her hes a textbook stalker and the murder weapon was in bed with him youve tested the weapon i know you think were too inept to tie our shoes without you holding the laces for us but yes it did occur to me to get the weapon tested the glock on the pillow next to chad vishneski fired the bullet that killed nadia guaman and residue you did an atomic absorption test on chads hands i persisted despite his annoyance of co he broke off midword ill get back to you on that as well i was aching to know what finchley was reading on the computer had someone screwed up and forgotten to test chad or was there some anomaly in the result itself that gave him pause by the way i said it would help chads treatment if the doctors knew what drugs they found in his system did they test him over at cermak freeman carter can get a court order if you need to know that raised my hackles i hadnt planned on riding him about sloppy work at the crime scene but i added you might like to know that chad vomited on his pillowcase i sent that and the empty beer cans by the bed out to a private forensic lab for analysis damn you warshawski couldnt you have called me first it was four days after guamans murder i figured if your team had wanted to collect evidence they had plenty of time i thought i could hear finchley gnash his teeth but all he said was if someone jumps you tonight or breaks into your place dont call vic even if we caught the perp redhanded you wouldnt think we knew what we were doing i opened my mouth to apologize then stopped i would not apologize for letting terry finchley know his team had missed evidence and i would not apologize for getting chad vishneski good medical careassuming it wasnt too late the grumpy cousin the client called moments after finchley had slammed the phone in my ear to ask if id found anything its more what i havent found mr vishneski i explained what my search at nadia guamans had turned upor actually hadnt turned up so youre saying you cant prove anything he cried frustrated and i still have to come up with money for your bill if i promised someone a building would go up and he came around and found an empty hole in the ground hed be within his rights to sue me especially if id taken his money detecting isnt like putting up a building its like hideandseek theyre hiding im seeking and right now the hiders are ahead of me theyre very good if you think you can find a better seeker i can understand that i will say that i have not failed a client yet but im sure thats how you feel about your buildings too he wasnt ready to fire me we both knew that he just needed to vent his fears about his son his son who iraq had changed from happy boy to angry man his son who was lying in a coma his son who might have killed a young woman outside i dusted the residue of the snow from my car my cousin had been texting me when id been on the phone with terry her messages increasing in urgency while the engine warmed up i phoned her wondering what new crisis had occurred at club gouge vic i got fired she blurted as soon as she heard my voice im not sure thats such a bad thing i said club gouge is looking more and more unstable you dont understand from my day job thats why im calling i desperately need the club job now and when i called in this afternoon to see if they could add to my hours olympia told me shed only do it if you stopped hanging around the club she says youre bad for her business and she cant keep me on if you keep showing up i massaged my forehead with my gloved handa mistake because i rubbed melted snow into my face how typical of olympia to blackmail one of her waitstaff like this you need to look for a real job pronto olympia is way too erratic for you to count on her for your rent money besides which i need to be at the club as i work on nadia guamans murder if i have to come back ill figure out a disguise but you cant petra cried i just told you petra turn off the temper tantrum and listen to me i just said that ill do my best not to jeopardize your job i need to talk to karen buckley and i dont know where she lives tell me the next time shell be at the club and ill wait for her outside vic no dont not even the bad connection could mask the panic in her voice you dont understand i need this job petra we seem to keep having a version of this conversation surely under the circumstances you could take some money from your mother while you find work shes totally wound up with my dads trial right now im not going to bother her about stuff i can handle on my own i wondered if petra was unconsciously hoping to get into enough trouble at club gouge to force her mother to start paying more attention to her i started to say something then decided my armchair psychology would further raise my cousins hackles petra even in this economy money isnt everything it isnt worth a jail term or worse this guy rodney olympia both fears him and protects him and he and olympia are involved in something rotten you came to me last week because she was essentially demanding that you let him feel you up now its you got that to stop everythings been okay lately okay i squawked a murder is okay your boss threatened your job if i show up which means shes got something going on shes afraid ill uncover that is not okay thats a recipe for disaster if olympia is providing cover for a moneylaundering scheme you could end up in front of the grand jury you could even be implicated then my big grumpy cousin will come to my rescue wont she i could picture petras face the selfmocking pout she puts on when she knows shes being a brat the trouble was of course i would come to her rescue and she was banking on that growing up the way i did my mother dying when i was in high school my father forced to turn the house and meals over to me i felt as though id been born old i was tired of my own kneejerk reaction youre in trouble say no more vi the grumpy cousin will bail you out i wished i knew how to turn off that particular switch i wondered for a moment if my whole detective practice was built on my private history of being an adolescent caretaker the thought upset me so much that i couldnt keep an edge of fury out of my voice when i spoke petra call me the next time the body artist is going to appear its not a lot to ask considering how much hot water youre willing to get me in uh well actually its tomorrow night petra spoke in a kind of mumble that made it hard to understand her shes doing a special show because olympia got so pissed off about her erasing rodneys stuff last night petra cut the connection i put the car into gear and started down milwaukee avenue the bitter winter was acting like a wrecking ball on the city streets as if a band of hyperenergetic gnomes were hacking their way to the surface choosing new spots every night i was almost half an hour late to the golden glow but i did find an open space across the street parking had also become a source of bitterness in the citythe mayor suddenly sold street parking to a private firm which had quadrupled the rates overnight we all had to carry bags of quarters everywhere we went as if we were heading for slot machines which i guess the pay stations had become slot machines completely and permanently skewed in the houses favor murray was already in the glow when i got there drinking a holstein the nasty weather had kept all but a handful of hardcore drinkers at home so sal had pulled up a stool next to his murray lifted the bottle in a token greeting but didnt get to his feet beer in this weather i said it makes me feel colder just watching you drink it warms me up he grinned i imagine the seat behind third base the july sun as hot as your temper the cubs trailing hopelessly lou pinellas iron jaw shooting sparks i get the picture sal reached across the mahogany countertop for the black label bottle how much does murray know try me murray said who had the worst era for the cubs who died first leopold or loeb i dont think we can trust murray i said to sal hes too desperate for a story murray snatched the black label bottle from sal before she could pour me a drink deliver you two feminazis or youll never see this bottle alive again do we go quietly or break his arms sal said a lifted glass sent her to a corner table with a bottle of wine when she came back she said to me you know i told you the other night that your friend was a good manager but that was old news dating back to the aurora borealis olympia club gouge murrays smile was smug i can still do research even if no one wants to print my stories she got in over her head and then a benefactor pulled her to shore i said i told murray and sal about rodney and asked murray if hed tracked the license plate from the sedan rodney had been driving the night before did you get his last name or an address the sedan belongs to a guy named owen widermayer whos a cpa with an office in deerfield and a home in winnetka murray said owen does not have a criminal record and no one named rodney works for him theyre lovers then i copied widermayers address into my handheld i dont understand what rodney is trying to communicate through karen buckleys body but maybe widermayer will talk to me and it will suddenly make sense while sal went over to check on her other customers i showed murray the numbers id found on the body artists site he puzzled over them with me but couldnt offer any suggestions and he had the same objection i did if it was a code of some kind why rely on such crude transmission why not use a cell phone or the net where you knew youd reach your target or if you were afraid of eavesdroppers and hackers why not write a letter sal came back and offered me another drink but it was getting close to ten despite my nap earlier i was beat once again i took the side streets home a few lazy snowflakes were falling just enough to cover my windshield from time to time the blurry view just about matched what was going on in my head before getting ready for bed i went to the safe id built into my bedroom closet its where i keep my mothers few valuable bits of jewelry and my handgun i pulled out the smith wesson and looked it over to make sure it was clean i put in the clip doublechecked the safety and laid it on the nightstand next to my bed it was starting to feel like that kind of case an egghead enters the scene in the morning i drove to the northwest suburbs under a sun that dazzled and blinded i brought along mitch and peppy before going to owen widermayers offices near the tollway i stopped at the forest preserve in winnetka we ran down to the lagoons which were frozen solid enough to hold my weight and covered with a dusting of snow that provided traction none of us had had much exercise the last few days and i was glad for the chance to run the dogs rolled in the snow and chased after balls which bounced high on the ice we passed people on crosscountry skis who cheered us oneveryones spirits were better for this rare day of bright sunshine as we moved on i sang un bel di just because the beautiful day brought the words to mind yet a sense of menace underlies that aria and menace seemed to rise up and greet me when i reached widermayers building the address board listed two tenants for the second floor owen widermayer cpa and the rest ez company i dont know every sleazy operation in illinois but rest ez was hard to overlook about eight months ago the owner anton kystarnik had been in the middle of a messy divorce when his wife conveniently died in a smallplane crash investigators came to the reluctant conclusion that it had been a genuine accident id followed the story with the same enthusiasm as every other conspiracy theorist learning along the way that kystarniks wealth came from payday loans which in my book are just juice loans that arent conducted in alleys say you get caught short near the end of the month no problem you sign over your upcoming paycheck to rest ez as surety they advance you cash at up to percent interest if you repay it in days or even percent interest if you go over the limit see its juice and its legal i stared at the tenant list rodney drove owen widermayers car widermayer shared a floor with kystarnik surely kystarnik wasnt the guy whod bailed out olympia she was supposed to be a savvy businessperson no one would sign up for a milliondollar bailout at percent but why did she give rodney the run of her club if she didnt owe kystarnik some big kind of favor or were she and rodney or even she and anton kystarnik lovers there was a disgusting thought nothing in the building supported the reports of kystarniks wealth estimated at eight hundred million at the time of his wifes death the cheapest gray matting covered the hall floor the doors were that pale faux wood that fools no one and the hall lights had been chosen to save every watt possiblenot presumably because kystarnik was green but because all his money went to his lavish homes here and abroad i didnt remember the reports that clearly but i seemed to recall something in the south of france or switzerland or italy or maybe all three besides a twoswimmingpool affair in nearby suburban roehampton the only money the tenants had spent on their public space went to the security cameras above the doors these were small discreet and highquality rest ezs offices were at one end of the second floor owen widermayer cpas at the other the doors in between werent numbered or labeled so who knew where the cpa began and the juice lender left off i was pretending i didnt know about the juiceman so i pressed the buzzer next to the cpas door there was a pause while someone looked at my honest friendly face in the camera and then buzzed me in widermayers office was as drab as the hallway there wasnt any art on the walls the only decoration was a tired philodendron that wasnt exactly dead but didnt seem to be growing either a beverage stand in one corner held some styrofoam cups and a shaker of fake powdered milk the coffee in the carafe was so overheated that a sickly caramel smell filled the room the woman who sat behind the cheap metal desk looked as tired as the plant she was going through pieces of paperthe little receipts you get from taxis or from restaurants as far as i could telland typing from them into her computer she didnt look up until shed finished the stack under her left hand im v i warshawski i said in the overly bright voice one uses around depressed people id like to talk to owen widermayer you dont have an appointment she wasnt hostile just stating the facts no maam is he in she was tired not ineffectual no one could see him without an appointment if i told her what i wanted shed see if he could fit me in i held out a business card im a detective im investigating a murder and mr widermayers car was found at the scene that did get her attention she started to dial then got up and went to a door behind her desk she shut it behind herself so quickly that i didnt get a look inside i moved around so that i was standing next to her desk half facing the shut door she hadnt bothered to exit her computer spreadsheet my mother had brought me up with very strict rules only una feccia a fecal kind of lowlife ever looked at other peoples private papers or opened their mail sorry gabriella i murmured leaning over to look at the screen as id thought she had been logging in expense receipts for someone named bettina lyzhneska one eye on the door i scrolled across the spreadsheet konstantin feder michael durante ludwig nastase and at the end rodney treffer i scrolled back to bettinas column just as the door opened behind me i was holding my hands over the radiator next to the desk as the assistant reappeared she frowned looking from me to the computer as if wondering what id seen but i merely made a bright comment on the miserable winter mr widermayer can see you for ten minutes so i hope you have your facts organized he likes people to come to the point excellent i beamed i like pointy people myself her frown tightened but she motioned me to the door behind her which shed left half open widermayer like his assistant was communing with his computers he held up a hand like a trainer ordering a dog to sit without looking up from his three monitors i sat in a chair that would have dug into my bones if i hadnt had on so many layers of clothes widermayer as much as i could see of him was built like an eggnot exactly overweight but definitely rounder in the middle narrower at the top his head bald except for a fringe of gray hair looked egglike too i began to feel hungry longing for a fluffy omelet the bosss office was just as spartan as the front room widermayers desk was handsomer being made of some kind of wood instead of metal but the blinds blocking the winter sun were bent and dusty and nothing hung on the walls except a clock which showed seconds slipping past us into eternity widermayer kept his eyes on his monitors i was getting bored you have ten minutes for me mr widermayer i said so why dont you let me know why rodney treffer is using your car to stalk artists in chicago widermayer held up one of his pudgy white hands again i got up and circled around his desk to look at the monitor he was studying there i was on the screen my profile in lifestory my own favorite subscription search engine i dont think youll find anything on rodney treffer in there i said nor about your mercedes sedan but its telling me you dont have any legal standing to ask me questions his voice was deep and booming unexpected from his flaccid body you agreed to see me mr widermayer and my business card explains that im a private investigator ive been hired to discover who murdered nadia guaman rodney is a key suspect the police made an arrest rodney had nothing to do with it no ones been convicted yet and theres compelling evidence that the guy in custody didnt shoot ms guaman i leaned over his shoulder to read the details about me funny how id never bothered to test lifestorys accuracy by checking my own records they had my outstanding mortgage correct but they showed me still driving my old car i tapped the screen they show me owning an old transam which was totaled a few years back i signed over the title when i sold it for scrap makes you wonder how reliable their research is doesnt it he clicked a key to bring up his screen saver and leaned back in his chair to look at me what evidence i just told you theyre listing the transam among my assets when what evidence that chad vishneski didnt murder that mexican gal youre sort of following this story arent you you know the name of the guy whos been arrested but like lifestory youre relying on poor sources no mexicans were killed he opened a new window on his computer and called up the news reports on the shooting nadia guaman mexican gal killed outside some nightclub nadia guaman woman american and you know darned well where she was killed because rodney was there so surely he told you about it and a few nights ago he drove one of your cars to the club if anything happens to rivka darling or karen buckley or even me rodney will definitely be the first person the police will question and then theyll talk to you because you own the car he drives and then theyll talk to anton kystarnik because you lease your office from him i was making up the last itemit just seemed like a reasonable assumption since widermayer actually looked as startled as possible for a boiled egg it must have been accurate tell me about the evidence then ill know whether its worth talking to rodney my clients pay for confidentiality in other words youve got a big fat zero ive been around too long to let someone goad me into revealing confidential information ill tell you in exchange for another fat zero that the police are taking my results very seriously no one ever said it was wrong to lie to anton kystarniks accountant widermayer pretended to yawn i sat on the cheap deal credenza that held his tax and law books it wobbled a bit and i wondered if it might give way beneath me but i liked the way it distracted his attention olympia koilada i said anton kystarnik bailed her out and now she lets rodney run tame around her club if who told you that i smiled sources nadia guaman was getting chad vishneski all wound up when he started attacking her in the club it created a stir and the club got in the news anton cant afford to have a spotlight on him these days the feds are already paying too much attention to him so he gets rodney to shoot nadia and frame chad and two problems are solved at the same time widermayer gave a derisive snort i thought you were a detective not a fairytale writer it doesnt matter if its a fairy tale as long as the states attorney and a jury believe it i drew my feet up under me despite the bulk of my boots and the credenza gave kind of a squawk get off that widermayer said sharply if you break it you replace it fifty bucks at walmart not worth worrying about olympia koilada doesnt figure in your fairy tale i notice but if shes your client id advise her to be very very careful yeah i said whys that she hasnt kept her side of a bargain she made and that means shes not trustworthy the credenza wobbled under my weight widermayer watched it and me with as much alarm as his large plate of a face could express i hopped off i didnt want to impale my spine on a tax book if olympia shows up dead or beaten or something you and anton will definitely be the first ports of call for the cops not to mention your boy rodney nothing to do with me widermayer said i leaned over the desk and smiled into his face hes using your car the law tends to hold you responsible for little things like that if youre threatening me youre wasting your breath i straightened up i wouldnt call it a threat mr widermayer more like information as i left his office i looked back to smile at him not even his eggy face could conceal his expression this time and it wasnt one that proclaimed eternal love and devotion the superrich and their fascinating lives when i got back to my car i wrote down the names id seen on widermayers assistants computer while they were still fresh in my mind bettina lyzhneska konstantin feder michael durante ludwig nastase an eastern european crew except for durante and rodney there were only a dozen or so cars in the lot mostly the nondescript fords and toyotas that people like widermayers assistant might drive i copied down their license plates anyway maybe i could push on my relationship with murray and find out who they were registered to the mercedes sedan rodney had been using was parked there i sat up straighter rodney drove a car registered to widermayer but i had a feeling that anything widermayer owned really belonged to kystarnik or at least was available to him which probably included rodney himself he was exactly the kind of muscle kystarnik might use i dug my maps out from under mitch roehampton where kystarnik had his chicagoarea home was only a few miles up the road while i was this far north i might as well see what eight hundred million dollars bought you i started to query one of my subscription databases for kystarniks home address then realized how exposed i was sitting there i drove back down dundee road and pulled into a strip mall wireless service in the northern suburbs was golden before i could leave the car for a sandwich lifestory was flashing kystarniks address and a few biographical details on my tiny screen i squinted at the text but finally had to enlarge it and read it a few words at a time i hated to think that glasses lay in my future that my eyesight was dimming as my body was slowing down werent there any compensations for turning fifty kystarnik had bought a house on seven acres almost twenty years ago there were two pools stables tennis courts three kitchens nine bathrooms and bedrooms enough to entertain all his visiting thugs at once along with their partners and children i assumed there were flunkies to look after the stables and kitchens and so on but my little screen didnt tell me that kystarnik had been born in odessa but hed lived in america since his late teens hed been married only once to the woman who died eight months ago melanie kystarnik born melanie frisk had been a native of eagle river wisconsin how had they met i wondered where had they met of course eagle river was notorious as the vacation refuge for members of the chicago mob maybe as kystarnik cut his teeth on the extortion racket someone like the outfits late lamented cpa allen dorfman took kystarnik under his wing i pictured anton and melanie meeting at a friday fish boil melanie and kystarnik had one child together a daughter named zina who had died almost fifteen years ago of unspecified causes even juice lenders suffer pain i drove up telegraph road to argos lane and found the gates to the kystarnik place seven acres is a lot of ground even though the bare trees and shrubs let me peer through the gates i couldnt really see the house although i did see little red lights that told me my pausing at the perimeter was being recorded in the city i would have canvassed the neighbors but out here it was hard to imagine a neighbor close enough to see what the kystarniks were doing even if i could weasel my way past their gates to talk to someone and what plausible reason could i provide for asking id passed an indie coffee bar just before turning onto argos lane so i turned around and went back i needed a bathroom stop anyway and some kind of snack the coffee itself smelled rich freshroasted unexpected in this exclusive retaillacking little enclave a utility service truck was in the lot and a couple of cars it was lunch hour some eight or nine people who looked as though they might work on the surrounding estates were perched at the little tables with drinks and sandwiches the two people behind the counteryoung freshfacedkidded with the regulars but they treated me with an impersonal briskness when id ordered my cappuccino and a toasted cheese panino i pulled out my map im looking for argos lanehow close am i one of the men waiting for his coffee laughed youre just about standing on top of it you looking for anyone in particular i flashed a grateful smile melanie kystarnik and i went to school together and i thought while i was in the area id see if i could pay my respects to anton the people in line at the counter shifted a bit as if trying to back away from me i spread my hands i know its been a while since she died but i wasnt able to get back for the funeral wed lost touch after she marriedshe was living in such a different world than what i knewbut we used to go canoeing together in eagle river when we were kids i know it was quite a blow when zina died there was a wordless communication going on among the regulars and then a heavyset woman about my age said you really have been out of touch if you think zinas death was a blow to mrs kystarnik she was off to gstaad for skiing six weeks later maybe the mister felt it harder everybody said zina was more his child than hers someone tried to shush her but the woman continued if this lady what did you say your name was gabriella gabriella sestieri i brought out my mothers birth name glibly if you really were a friend of melanies it would have broke your heart to see how much trouble that girl of hers got into by the time she died thats so sad i exclaimed no wonder melanie didnt answer my christmas cards i wondered at the time but then i decided it was because her life had gotten so glamorous those ski vacations the private yacht and everything but if zina was doing drugs doing drugs a man chimed in they say she was running the ring that supplied all the kids in the northwest suburbs her and pinderos kid clive another woman said you cant know that and this lady doesnt need to hear that kind of talk when mrs kystarnik is dead and the girl too what has it been fifteen years now let the dead bury the dead yeah but steve pindero was a good guy and he suffered as much as kystarnik when his frannie odd more probably clives jaw jutted out the grievance as fresh as if it had happened yesterday and then to find out his girl had been using his own rec room as a drugstore two men at a table in a corner had been watching me they had hard hats sitting on the window ledge behind them but their fingernails were carefully cut and buffed not the kind of manicures that would last long if they had to handle heavy equipment i finished my coffee and wrapped my sandwich in a napkin its like my granny used to say the rich get richer the poor get trouble maybe i wont call on anton after all sounds like he wouldnt want to be reminded of melanie forgot about her already clive said if you go by the blonde whos clive the heavyset woman warned this time he subsided but as i opened the door to leave i heard the others pick up the gossip one woman who worked at a neighboring estate had heard the doctor say the new girlfriend was already five months pregnant another had seen her wearing a necklace that used to belong to melanie diamonds and emeralds worth a hundred grand easy as i got into my car the two men whod been watching me left the coffee bar and climbed into the utility truck they followed me when i turned onto argos lane i didnt slow for the kystarnik estate but the truck stayed with me as the road wound around a golf course and bent south when i connected with a major artery i stood on the brakes and jumped out the passenger got out of the utility truck and came over to me no hurry youre just visiting the area but you drive a car registered to a local person hmm and you drive a truck but youve got computer access to the illinois dmv in it i said you handling the feds stakeout on kystarnik hands on hips he gave me a clint eastwood stare that made him think he looked tough maybe you should get back to the city where you belong maybe indeed i agreed any reason to think my old friend melanie was killed to make way for the new pregnant blonde weve entered your plate number into our database he said by way of reply now i am impressed or i would be if i didnt already have a federal file by the way if you want anyone to believe your work really requires a hard hat nix the weekly manicures when he pulled off one of his gloves to look at his nails i took a picture of the utility trucks license plate with my cell phone he ran to my side dropping his glove and tried to grab my phone offlimits he said i shook my head i have no idea who you are i thought you were with the feds but now im thinking you work for kystarnik the chicago cops need to see whos tied to his operation the other guy got out of the truck whats the problem here problem is she took a picture of our plate problem is i said you guys are hanging out around a thug if youre on his payroll oh chrissake troy show her your badge the first guy scowled but pulled out his id troy murano was with the secret service not the fbi after all in a spirit of generous reciprocity i showed them my pi license besides guarding the president the secret service investigates largescale fraud but when i tried to ask troy and his partner what they thought kystarnik was up to they told me to mind my own business so why is a chicago pi sniffing around him the partner asked just minding my own business i said in the spirit of reciprocity i tucked my cell phone into my pocket before getting back into my car the utility truck didnt follow me when i turned onto the main road i pulled into another strip mall and shared my sandwich with the dogs who were getting restless after spending several hours in the car if the secret service was tagging around after kystarnik they werent being too secretive about itthose security cameras dotting kystarniks fence would have spotted the utility truck long ago maybe the feds were hoping to pressure him into a misstep if he was laundering money maybe they thought hed reveal his bank accounts to their electronic scanners maybe i should have suggested they look at club gouge but for all i knew they already had a lead on rodney and the club more than ever i wanted to get my cousin out of the place i guess it had been instructive to drive up here although it was hard to say what id gained besides seeing my tax dollars at work i turned to my voice mail which had been beeping at me in some indignation you have eleven new messages it cried in my ear one of the calls was from sanford rieff at the cheviot labs saying hed found something interesting since i was in their neck of the woods i drove on west to cheviots complex rieff came out to the lobby to see me vic i dont have anything so dramatic or definite that you needed to make a trip out here i was in the area i explained whats up were still waiting for a report back from a national ballistics clearing center to see if the two guns are involved in any other shootings but weve done an analysis of the beer cans mass spectrometry shows a high concentration of rohypnol roofie you probably call it in beer like thatwhoever drank it is probably very sick roofie the date rape drug hes in a coma i said slowly is there any way to tell if he put it in the beer himself rieff smiled thats the interesting piece of your little puzzle if this comes to court its going to be tricky very tricky lawyers and expert witnesses will battle for days and defendants will watch their bank accounts vanish before their startled eyes thanks sandy but why he led me back to his office and brought my report up on his computer screen so i could see the graphics the fingerprints on the cans are odd at least to louis arata whos our expert if you pick up a can or a glass yourself you press only one finger usually the middle full against it besides your thumb of course you touch the can with the tips of the other fingers here face on we have prints for all five fingers he tapped the screen with a soft pointer to show me what he meant the can is clean except for those five fingers usually you pick a can up put it down pick it up your prints soon overlay one another im bettingor louis arata is bettingthat a third party held the drinkers fingers on the can ill put it all in writing for you i stared at the screen while rieff rotated the image for me who would have gone to so much trouble to frame chad vishneski rodney and olympia karen buckley anton kystarnik and why that was the even more urgent question i got up to go id say this is pretty darn dramatic sandy guard those beer cans and so on in your deepest vault back in my car i talked with lottys clinic nurse jewel kim and told her about the rohypnol can you make sure that lotty and her pet neurosurgeon know asap i dont know if it can help with chads treatment this many days out but thats probably what put him in the coma jewel looked at lottys notes on chad shes ordered a broadspectrum search for drugs but i will let her know that she can narrow it down to rohypnol thanks vic i stared out the windshield for a long time thinking over rieffs report i emailed the gist of it to freeman carter and then even though i knew freeman would advise against it i called terry finchley he answered the line himself but when i announced myself his voice grew cold he was still angry which prompted me to become superperky guess where i am right now if you said sunning yourself on a florida beach now that would cheer me up almost im on the banks of the skokie lagoon at the cheviot labs where they did some nifty forensic work on the beer cans that had been in chad vishneskis bed guess what they found im not in the mood vi just tell me roofies so the perp tried to off himself make my day the fingerprint analysis suggests a third party was present the dogs had been cooped up in the car too long they were whining at me making it hard to hear finchley cheviots building sat in a culdesac that backed into one of the lagoons that dot the area i let mitch and peppy out why are you doing this finchley demanded doing what trying to show me up over the guaman homicide i know you and i have had our differences but terry ive always liked you and i respect you as a cop im not trying to show you up if i were id be giving my news to murray ryerson to broadcast wholesale instead of telling you mitch had found something to roll in peppy was barking at him demanding her turn i pretended i didnt know them i told you yesterday that nadia guamans and chad vishneskis computers were both missing this makes me think that one or both of them knew something a third party wants to keep hidden i just learned theres a story about vishneskis beer cans not only did someone mix rohypnol in his beer they wiped the cans clean and then placed his fingers on them to make prints once hed passed out youd be hardpressed to argue fingerprint pressure in court finchley said that may be true although freeman carter has persuaded juries of more implausible things but i dont think well get to a courtroom i started this investigation prejudiced against my clients son but the more i learn the more i think he was framed poor stressedout vet someones covering their tracks exceptionally well but somewhere somehow theyre sure to have slipped up when i find whatever mistake the real perp made im counting on you to release chad vishneski assuming hes still alive oh damn you anyway warshawski he cut the connection the dogs had moved down to the lagoon i trailed after them stopping where theyd been rolling a dead raccoon when id persuaded them to get back in the car i was annoyed with myself for my stupidity in letting them run free they stank and it was too cold to ride the tollway with the windows open i drove along dundee road until i came to a groomers i had to wait almost an hour until they could fit in mitch and peppy but the wait allowed me to catch up on the rest of my calls even the expense of two shampoos beat wrestling the dogs into my own bathtub at home the road to kufah i stopped at my apartment just long enough to leave the dogs with mr contreras at my office i found a little pot of tulips heavily wrapped in newspaper on the doorstep and a note from the client we got chad moved to beth israel and now monas sitting with him i like your doc she said to bring along some of his music to play when we cant be there so monas got his ipod running and ill play my clarinet for him tonight i guess you know what youre doing jv the candycanestriped tulips made a bright circle of color on my desk heartened by the flowers and the clients goodwill i wrote up my notes for the day i synced my handheld with my machine so that the names id seen in widermayers assistants spreadsheet got uploaded into my case file software ludwig nastase michael durante konstantin feder thered been a woman as well a bettina lyzhneska a truly diverse international crew rounded out by rodney treffer i went back to rodneys cryptic jottings wondering if any of the letters hed written on the body artist corresponded to his teammates names thered been several is and os along with c l and s except for lyzhneska and ludwig i couldnt see a match i wrestled with the numbers ive never been a fan of codes and ciphers and these looked so random that you probably needed a key to uncode them maybe they were page numbers where you counted lines and letters but youd have to know the book first still id had a bit of a break today getting rodneys last name i did a little rooting around on him and on owen widermayer as well rodney had been a cop with the milwaukee pd now lifestory claimed he was an independent security contractor i remembered olympias brittle laugh her referring to him as her insecurity hed been divorcedtwiceand both his exwives had entered orders of protection against him big surprise there widermayers profile was blander he lived in winnetka he was on the board of his temple serving as their accountant other than that i couldnt get a client list out of my databases but that didnt really surprise me i kind of thought kystarnik might be widermayers only client looking after a mob thug could be a fulltime job at sixthirty i left for my meeting with tim radke plotzkys the bar hed chosen was on the western end of division street where nelson algren used to hang out algren probably wouldnt recognize the street anymore west of ashland the newest yuppie invasion had turned the coldwater flats and honkytonk joints into expensive lofts and restaurants with names like suivi and arrêt instead of a shot and a beer you got martinis with funny names and weird ingredients plotzkys was one of the last surviving bluecollar joints with an upscale sushi place on one side and a wine bar on the other i didnt give them much chance it was a few minutes before seven when i got there a handful of men in their forties or fifties were sitting at the bar their parkas unzipped to reveal dirty work clothes unlike my federal friends in roehampton this afternoon these men had earned their hard hats the black hawks pregame show was on the tv over the bar no one was watching it they were rehashing their own lives with each other and with the bartender a middleaged woman with bleached hair and thick pancake makeup like sal at the golden glow she kept an eye on the whole room while nodding empathically at the men talking to her i looked around but didnt see anyone who seemed to be waiting for me i perched on a stool near the street door the bartender put her hand on the arm of one of the men be right back phil whatll yours be honey scotch we got dewars white horse johnnie red i chose dewars the regulars eyed me with a frank impersonal curiosity then went back to their own conversations after twenty minutes when i was beginning to wonder if radke had gotten cold feet a guy in a worn army parka came in i recognized his pitted craggy face he was the man whod run after chad when hed confronted nadia in the parking lot i got to my feet and sketched a wave radke came over to me at once but nodded along the way at the other men at the bar who called out greetings when they saw him gerri dont go bringing him no beer without seeing his id first kids too young to drink in public even if hes trying to impress his date dont pay them any mind honey theyre just jealous that they have to drink alone gerri said to tim bud she slapped down a bottle on the bar in front of him you were at the club werent you radke said to me once the men stopped razzing him yesyou and i almost ran over each other backstage when chad was chasing after nadia guaman that time i told you on the phone that chads father hired me to find out what was going on how chad got involved with nadia guaman radke nodded cautiously over the neck of the bottle im having trouble getting any information about either chad or nadia i said so anything you can tell me would be a help i didnt know him that well radke warned me i thought you were in iraq together iraqs a big country and we were in a big army chad he was in a rifle company me i was in network support network support computers in the field you mean the whole army runs on computers these days i came to be pretty good but i dont have a college degree or anything so when i got out i could only get me a job installing electronics maybe something betterll come along when the economy picks up if i havent forgotten everything the army taught me he gave a tired smile anyway chad him and me we never met until we got home we were part of the same postdeployment group at the va how is he on the news they said he tried to commit suicide and was unconscious but when i tried to go see him they had him in prison not in a hospital he smacked his bottle down on the countertop i couldnt get permission to go see him him and me we fought for our country and some twobit county employee gets to tell me whether i can see my own buddy or not if it was even a cop i wouldnt take it so hardtheyre like every soldier i ever met putting their lives on the line every damned day of the week but these county assholes getting jobs just because they raised so much money for some politician and then lording it over gerri moved within range in case i needed to be thrown out for annoying one of her regulars radke subsided but twisted his beer bottle so ferociously i thought the glass might break in his hands i got the police to let us move chad from the prison hospital to beth israel i told him i havent been able to speak to the doctor in charge so i cant tell you how hes doing but im sure his folks would let you go see him now that hes in a regular hospital radke asked me to write down the address and the name of the doctor and promised hed stop by as soon as he had time itd be better if he was at the va on account of the insurance but i know you went out of your way getting him out of that hellhole well you didnt ask me here to rant and rave what did you want to know when chad and nadia were arguing it sounded like a couple in the middle of an angry divorce but john vishneski says chad didnt know nadia i dont think he did radke drained his bottle and signaled to gerri for a second she had it on the counter almost before his hand went down so what were they fighting about her drawings he told marty and me they gave him flashbacks radke drank most of the second bottle in one big gulp it was something to do with what went wrong when his unit was on the road to kufah what was that i prompted when he fell silent you ever been in a war its nothing like what they show on tv or video games youre tired all the time youre scared you dont know whos a friend whos an enemy if fighting starts its not organized you dont always know where the shots are coming from and if you shoot back will you hit your own guys maybe it was different in world war two but in iraqeven me i was in support but i still got caught in a couple of gun battles because there arent any lines yours or the enemys he shredded his napkin and started laying pieces out on the counter as if he were trying to establish some real battle lines i shook my head at gerri as she started toward us is that what happened on the road to kufah i asked chad couldnt say even at the va when we were with one of those counselors we got five sessions five sessions to undo five years of war radke snorted in derision chad lost his whole squad thats all he ever said not any details about how it happened you know what thats like guys you been eating and sleeping with suddenly theyre lying dead all around you they sent him home after that for four months then he had to redeploy and he was fine he said as long as he was over there but once he got discharged once he got home he couldnt take being around civilians no one here gives a rats ass about what we went through its hell to be there to be going through it but its a hundredno a milliontimes worse to be here where no one cares i lost my whole squad on the road to kufah he mimicked in a savage voice bummer man but what about american idol and the women are worse howd you end up at club gouge he gave me a sidelong look checking me for signs of shockability or maybe prudery we heard this gal sits naked on a stage and the drawings it was something to do id printed out a copy of alexandra guamans yearbook photo i pulled it out and showed it to radke she was nadia guamans sister and she was killed in iraq she wasnt with the army thoughshe worked for one of the private security firms hers is the face that nadia kept painting on the body artist i wondered if chad knew alexandra guaman in iraq radke shook his head he never said its like i told you its a big country and its not just were a big army but the contractors you know they have more contractors than uncle sams soldiers over there some guy he said iraq isnt the war of the willing its the war of the billing and until youve seen it you dont get it the contractors theyre everywhere building crappy housing for us good shit for themselves theyre hustling a buck at the px theyre taking convoys around were busting our asses for base pay and we have to protect the contractors who are drawing double overtime doing less work than we are his voice was starting to rise again so i broke in what would chad say after you left club gouge if he never said whether he knew alexandra or nadia guaman wed come herehere to plotzkys i meana lot of times like the night that gal got shot we were here right on these stools watching the hawks marty one of our crowd who we met at the va you know hed say to chad why are you letting that broad get under your skin did she ditch you or something but chad hed just say shes rubbing my face in it rubbing his face in what happened on the road to kufah or in a busted relationship tim started peeling the label from one of his empties if i had to guess id guess the road to kufah just becauseif some girl is riding you she can make you madder than hell but shes not whats giving you flashbacks maybe chad wrote about her on his blog he kept onea lot of guys did dowhere they write pretty much everything its not just that it passes the time but it makes you think that somewhere someone cares if you live or die chads blog of course i should have been reading that already maybe john vishneski had been right to suggest i was incompetent despite my brave words i was being a slowfooted clumsy seeker something like a twotoed sloth crashing through a jungle i was making it easy for a skilled hider to stay twenty steps ahead of me the night before nadia died when chad confronted her in the parking lot you came out and brought him back to the club he had some kind of dark object looked like a cloth about yea big i sketched the shape in the air did he show you that do you have any idea what it could be tim shook his head a dark cloth about eight or ten inches wide could it have been like a scarf folded into a square maybe he thought shed knitted it for him that hadnt occurred to me dont pretend you dont know what this is chad had yelled maybe it had been something some woman mailed him maybe he thought nadia had been a secret correspondent sending him presents while he was in the desert yet another unprovable idea it seemed impossible to get real information about anything or anyone connected with nadia and chad i tried not to let the weight of impossibility drag me down i thanked tim and signaled gerri for the check tim gave me the names and numbers of the three other guys in his and chads band of postiraq brothers as well as the name of their counselor at the va chad might have told her something privately that he hadnt felt able to say in front of the group whats in a blog eleven american soldiers were killed tuesday on the road to kufah when they were trapped in an ambush and insurgents burned their hummers with incendiary devices the army reported today convoys had been traveling that route with relative safety since may insurgents loyal to amir harith alhassan a dissident shia mullah claimed responsibility that was all i could find about any incidents on the road to kufah only three of the dead were mentioned by name because they were from new york and the story had been carried in the new york times i didnt find any mention of it in the chicago papers which surprised me since a chicago youth had been the sole survivor of the attack no wonder tim was bitter about the american response to him and his comrades i was curled up on my livingroom couch with the dogs and my laptop the dogs still smelled faintly of lavender and they were still tired enough from their morning run that theyd been content to chase tennis balls in the backyard while i made a pot of spaghetti mr contreras had shared it with me even though i only put in mushrooms and peas instead of the tomato sauce he preferred after dinner hed gone out to spend an evening with some of his remaining pals from his old local i turned to chads blog as john vishneski had reported when he hired me the early entries were filled with a kind of happy zest as if chad were writing up a road trip with his buddies when he reached iraq and was reporting in the blistering heat you still got a sense of underlying good humor and a serious commitment to his country a few months ago i was playing football and going nowhere now even though i know its hard on my folks and my friends i feel like im serving my country and doing the right thing so naming no names you guys back home think all i can do is drink beer let me tell you here in iraq i still drink beer plus carry a hundred pounds of equipment into the desert and do a hundred pushups of course football training didnt hurt my conditioning but id like to see the bears forward line go through the workout we get here even after his first year in iraq when hed been under fire a number of times he managed to keep his spirits up in his posts i keep thinking of that tommy lee jones flick men in black when we see men in black here we know were in trouble and i wish to god some alien would rise up out of the desert and put a big old tentacle around their necks or just one of our local little pets vipers are a big deal here something they never talked about during basic we have a snake guy here his name is herb which is so right because a snake man is a herpetologist when hes at home so we call him herbie the herpes but youd better believe its in good fun because old herpes is the goto guy if you find one of his little friends crawling around your tent he tries to get us to love them like they are our brothers in nature but nothing doing for this infantryman anyway men in black came up on us in the middle of the night we fought for three hours i cant tell you how scared i was rpgs exploding around us ieds the whole nine yards how we didnt lose anyone i dont know but we had five guys with bigtime wounds including jesse laredo youve read about him if youve been with me from the getgo great joker littlest guy in the unit but the strongest jesse would give his right arm for a buddy and thats just what he did tonight so all of you reading this blog send a prayer jesses way and for his mom and dad in albuquerque we love you jess were praying for you and a big thankyou prayer to our medics too in here with their choppers in no time getting jess and the rest of them off to the hospital ship out in the gulf chad wrote about collecting food and toys for iraqi orphans during ramadan and setting up a football squad at his forward operating base he wrote about warm showers on hot days cold showers on cold rainy days but it wasnt until his third deployment that his tone turned bitter maybe if i had a wife back home id love my time stateside the way the other guys do but theres no one who can really relate to what im going through here my mom and dad read my posts they send me care packages but its not like having a wife or a buddy who stays up nights hoping ill make it through another day i spent four months in chicago and every day got me longing more and more for the desert and the vipers everyones got their own life to live i understand that mortgages dental bills trips to the mall but does anyone remember were fighting a war over here the blog entries ended there a week before the news report of the incident on the road to kufah i couldnt figure it out the archive list down the righthand column showed thirteen more weeks of posts but when i clicked on them only a blank page came up i did as many searches as i had the skills to figure out but i couldnt come up with chads post about the battle hed survived it was going on ten pm but i called the client anyway to ask him if he remembered chads blogs im trying to read about the battle where he lost all the men in his unit but all his posts after october second that year have disappeared from his website did you or mona print them out or do you remember what he wrote in them why does it matter john vishneski asked that was almost two years ago now what does that have to do with this dead gal maybe nothing but tim radke says nadias paintings were giving chad flashbacks to the road to kufah the dead womans sister also died in iraq when an ied exploded im wondering if the sister was present at the battle for some reason vishneski sighed heavily i read his blog of course i did but i never printed them out you think with a computer itll always be there so no i dont remember except he was trying to give first aid to these guys who had phosphorus burns on them and i think thats when he really started to fall apart he felt so helpless helpless i felt so goddamn helpless myself his voice suddenly cracked i called him every day i could tell he was hurting and i couldnt get anywhere near him to help thats why that prison hospital just about did me in at least now i can sit with him believe me i am real grateful to you for making that happen even if you cant figure out why someone framed my boy for killing that woman i went over and played my clarinet for chad for an hour even though i expect the other patients thought they were hearing a cat being tortured it was a gallant effort on his part not to break down on the phone bet if you played like larry combs chad wouldnt know it was you would he he gave a little laugh i thanked him for the tulips before he hung up another gallant gesture on his part i lacked the computer skills to figure out what had happened to chads more recent blog postings and i havent found a reliable computer forensic expert yet i used to turn to darraugh grahams son mackenzie but hes working in africa these days i wandered restlessly around my living room i dug through my old lps until i found edwin starrs album with war on it it aint nothing but a heartbreaker friend only to the undertaker i didnt realize how loudly i was playing the cut until my phone rang jake thibaut was calling to say hed tried knocking on my door but i hadnt heard him over the music how come youre having a party and didnt invite me he demanded this sounds like sex drugs and rock n roll i lifted the phonograph arm from the turntable rock n roll you could come over and add the sex and drugs if youd like when he came to my door holding a bottle of wine i tried to keep up a light tone but chads blog postings and john vishneskis anguish lay heavy on my mind web pages are disappearing all around me i said i wanted to look again at the body artists site but shes taken it down and now i cant read chads blogs either jake thibaut read the postings over my shoulder maybe you can track down this guy jesse laredo that he mentions it sounds as though they were close they might have kept in touch now that gets you the biggest smooch in chicago i said first good idea ive had all day and i didnt even think of it myself i put starrs involved back on the turntable while jake poured some wine it made me feel young again the wine the black vinyl spinning on the turntable though i have to admit jakes cabernet was better than what i drank in college and adult sex was so much better than teenage fumblings that it almost made up for growing older in the morning after jake left for his first student of the day i lost some of my optimism i tracked jesse laredo down at his mothers home in albuquerque but jesse had died five months ago his wounds had taken too great a toll on his heart his mother said i commiserated with her and told her some of the details of the trouble chad was in jess loved chad i sure am sorry to know hes having problems she said after i explained why i was calling but youll never make me believe he murdered anyone when chad lost his unit on the road to kufah did he call or email anything to jesse i asked im trying to find the blog postings he put up then and the ones hes done this year maybe jesse printed them out she promised to look although she said that chad always tried for a light tone when he wrote or phoned her son he knew jess was hurting bad and he knew jess felt like he was letting his unit down not being in iraq with them but ill see what i can find i thanked her but my hopes werent high nothing was coming easy in this case the thought of all the dead and walking wounded from that pointless war was heartbreaking youve got nothing to complain about vi get back in the trenches i made another cup of coffee and called the people whose names tim radke had given me last night but none of them could tell me anything the guys had all been part of their postdeployment counseling sessions at the va but none of them ever remembered chad opening up about what happened on the road to kufah the therapist actually took my call on the first try but she didnt even remember chads name until shed looked him up in her files she told me she needed to see his parents signed release before she could talk to me but she waited while i faxed it to her i see so many men that i cant keep track of them all she apologized a lot of them are angry im sorry to hear that chad vishneski got in trouble with the law but frankly were seeing it more and more after looking through her file she said chad had never shown up for the one private meeting hed scheduled i rubbed my forehead frustrated trying to come up with anyone who could talk to me about chad or nadia or alexandra finally i decided to put on my business clothes and return to the northwest suburbs inside fortress tintrey tintreys corporate offices were only a quarter mile from glenbrook high as if jarvis maclean wanted to remind his alma mater how successful hed become maclean had built his complex in the middle of a landscaped industrial park rustic bridges crossed the obligatory water feature bits of shrubbery poked through the snow and the walkways that surrounded the building and led into the parkland had all been shoveled and salted i parked in the lot in the same row where senior staff seemed to park judging by the array of bmws mercedeses and land rovers nothing as cheap as a buick i paused behind a green etype jaguar even in this weather its body was clean and polished not a mark on it if warshawski enterprises ever got to be as successful as tintrey i was getting me one of those right after my corporate jet and all those other goodies i sighed wistfully but squared my shoulders and walked into a lobby that made no secret of tintreys success unlike anton kystarnik whose dingy building seemed designed to show the irs that he had no assets jarvis maclean had built to proclaim success to his prospective customers wellkept plants were potted around the entryway along with a couple of sculptures of the kind my leasemate createdbig abstract pieces of twisting steel and highgloss wood a pair of receptionists so highly polished i could almost see my face in their cheekbones staffed a high rosewood counter they were dressed in powderblue blazers with tintrey embroidered on the breast pockets behind them electronic gates blocked access to the buildings interior on the far side of the gates open glassandmetal staircases invited you to walk to the upper floors the elevators were along a far wall but their doors were drab a green architect clearly had been involved in putting the building together may i help you one of the gleaming receptionists asked i produced a business card and asked to speak with someone in human resources im doing a background check on a woman who says she used to work here the receptionist murmured into her telephone and then asked who was the subject of my inquiry we fenced for a minuteme explaining that it was a confidential inquiry she explaining that she was trying to save me time in the end she directed me to the third floor where belinda would see me we smiled widely at each other which made me very aware of my caffeinestained teeth and she pressed a switch that let me through the magic gates as i climbed to the third floor i saw that maclean was an unrepentant supporter of the iraq war the walls held some interesting art photographs but these were overwhelmed by outsize pictures of donald rumsfeld and maclean getting out of a stryker together of maclean with dick cheney at an undisclosed location and a blowup of the photograph id seen of maclean online accepting some kind of award from bush the personnel office was in the middle of the floor three people sat at computers in the outer room the one nearest the door took my name checked it against her computer log and directed me to an alcove with the assurance that belinda would be with me shortly the alcove reminded me of a doctors waiting room it was crammed with worried souls who were filling out forms on clipboards each looking up hopefully when one of the receptionists came to call a name they looked at me suspiciously each newcomer was a potential competitor suspicion turned to hostility when a receptionist came to get me after a mere ten minutes had passed i was here long before her one man called out the receptionist just smiled and said his turn would come soon belinda turned out to be a stocky woman in her early forties she was the first tintrey employee id seen who didnt look as though she were preparing for a photo shoot her nails were cut bluntly close to the fingertips and her clothes had been chosen for comfort not glamour she led me into an office behind the reception area that held four cubicles in the other three job supplicants sat trying to look earnest eager productivewhatever would get them a foot in the door belinda took me to her desk in one of the two middle cubes they told me downstairs that youre a detective who wants information about one of our employees they should have known better than to send you up here we dont give out confidential employee information too many competitors in this business the message got garbled in translation i said im doing a background check on a woman who claims she used to work for you her résumé has two years that i cant verify so im wondering if she lied about her employment history with you i pulled a folder out of my briefcase id stopped at my office before heading for the tollway and produced a résumé for alexandra guaman inserting her yearbook photo at the top of the page id used the information id found online for alexandra including her social security number her educational background and her employment history at tintrey id beefed up her credentialsi made her a cyberfraud expert working for tintrey in baghdads green zone i showed her leaving iraq two weeks after her reported death working for a creditcard holding company id invented in cleveland and looking for new challenges back in the chicago area i handed the résumé to belinda its impossible for me to get any information out of lackawanna systems they seem to have disappeared in the economic tsunami of the last few months and i cant find anyone who can vouch for guaman in cleveland did you go to cleveland in person belinda asked i do what the job requires i kept my smile pasted on my face she was shrewd she knew i could have handled my query with her by phone or email guamans résumé arrived online with a lot of fancy podcasts and video bits but it boiled down to this history if youd just verify the dates with tintrey and let me know if she really can set up the kind of cybersecurity shes claiming ill get out of your hair i can see youre swamped while id been speaking the lights on belindas phone had been flashing and her computer kept dinging to let her know she had im messages piling up these prods from the ether made her decide it was easier to cooperate than argue she started typing and brought up alexandra guamans file without any trouble her monitor was at an angle so that i could see a bit of the screen but not enough to read the text belinda frowned over what she was reading then scrolled down until she was at the end of the file her mouth dropped open in shock and she looked from her screen to me with growing suspicion who are you really really i am v i warshawski thats not what i mean how did you get this womans résumé what is it youre really after who hired you i started to move around her desk to look at her screen but she held up a hand traffic cop style and hit a key that brought up her screen saver a collection of family photos i am a confidential investigator and i dont betray my clients identities so im afraid i cant tell you that is there something wrong id like to know so that i can remove ms guaman from consideration for the job they want to hire her to do belinda bit her lips and looked again at her screen perhaps hoping her toddler could help her decide what to do she finally picked up her phone and tapped in a fourdigit number with her pencil its belinda here mr vijay we have a situation a ql file that someones asking about she listened for a moment then spelled alexandras last name i could hear mr vijay barking with excitement and then apparently he put her on hold after another wait while i kept prodding belinda in my role as baffled visitor a stocky man in a gray jacket and sporting a pale pink tie strode into belindas cubicle ill take over from here belinda you go on with your other assignments ill call you when im through with this person he took alexandra guamans résumé from belinda what did you say your name was i handed him a card v i warshawski whats the problem with ms guamans file he refused to answer but led me down the hall to a door with his name on it it was a small office but it was private what are you up to he asked without preamble i am trying to verify alexandra guamans work history i said its a simple query so id appreciate it if tintrey would stop acting as though i wanted the design specs for the cruise missile his mouth tightened and he consulted the computer in front of him i kept a look of honest bewilderment on my face which wasnt a complete act why couldnt they just tell me that alexandra had died in iraq vijay typed an email and then sat with his hands folded in front of him i asked him about alexandras assignment in iraq but he didnt speak i asked him if he thought indianapolis would make it to the super bowl again and he looked nettled so i expanded on that theme manning is the kind of quarterback a championship team needs reckless and convinced hes invincible teams believe in leaders like that remember im not interested in football vijay snapped before i could dwell nostalgically on jim mcmahon the old bears quarterback then lets talk about alexandra guaman i said what did she do that warrants this kind of reaction vijays door opened and another man came in wearing the kind of handcut wool you can afford only if your stock options survived the market meltdown i recognized him from rainier cowless table at club gouge and from the tintrey website it was gilbert scalia head of tintreys iraqi operations ill take over from here vijay what does she know i didnt ask the policy on ql files right well done scalia looked at me narrowly havent i met you before oh yes at that strip joint the other night youre a detective thats what the owner told us a detective whos unpleasantly obsessed with nadia guaman and now youre up here trying to blackmail us about her sister what an extraordinary accusation i said and by the way an actionable one as your friend prince rainier would be glad to tell you dont try to play word games with me youre way out of your league youre in my building under false pretenses and believe me any legal action will be directed against you by us not the other way around he looked at vijay what was she asking she has a résumé that she pretends came from the guaman woman shes been trying to find out what guaman did for us in iraq scalia shook his head her activities are classified whoa there mr scalia youre a private contractor not the department of defense when were doing dods work their security clearances extend to our employees we all regret the death of alexandra guaman but were not at liberty to discuss it especially not with an ambulance chaser time for you to get out before i bring along a team to throw you out a whole team i said thats flattering but im afraid someoneolympia maybeexaggerated my fighting skills one person would probably be enough if she knows what shes doing two if she doesnt scalias lips tightened before you leave youll hand over whatever document you brought with you wrong again its a private document and you dont have the necessary security clearance to read it where is it scalia asked vijay she put it into her briefcase then call security we need someone up here to take her case and get the document scalia had me backed up where he wanted me which i hated but i opened my case and took out the spurious résumé scalia held out a hand for it but i ducked under his arm and stuck it into vijays shredder which gulped it down with a satisfying growl scalia grabbed my case and dumped the contents on vijays desk his face swollen with rage my field notebooks that i use in client meetings and offline research a tampon that was coming unraveled and a small makeup kit bounced out i crossed my arms and leaned against the door while he looked through the papers scalia suddenly ripped a page out of the center of one of the notebooks and fed it through vijays shredder then dropped the notebook on vijays desk and dusted his hands with a satisfied smirk i fought back the tide of rage that swept through me i had just enough selfcontrol to know that if i slugged him id spend the next week either in jail or a hospital what a heman i said my voice high and bright able to rip a piece of paper with your bare hands no wonder they put you in charge of war operations pick up your shit and get out of my building scalia roared his face swelling again in anger i put the notebooks and the makeup back into my case as soon as i had the door open i turned back and stuck the tampon into scalias jacket pocket a souvenir i said something to put on your wall along with all those pictures of you in uniform inside the war zone i moved briskly to the stairs a couple of guys in heavy security costumes appeared as i reached the front doors but no one shot me or even tripped me as i crossed the walk to the visitors spot where id left my car surviving guaman daughter i drove east until i found a forest preserve where i could take time to pull myself together again i dug through my case for the notebook that scalia had mutilated hed pulled three pages out of a section where id been researching title changes last year the case was coming to trial next month id been deposed id written the report it was just the violation of having my papers attacked that i minded you might say i had provoked him by shredding the bogus résumé but his reaction had been designed to humiliate and unfortunately it had worked my own response with the tampon had been briefly satisfying but not too bright someone who had as much need to be in power over others as scalia did would feel it as real indignity especially since a subordinate had witnessed it who knew what he might do next i opened one of my notebooks and started doodling what had i learned that despite the twenty thousand or so employees tintrey had worldwide and the nine thousand in iraq there was something about alexandra guaman that kept her in the foreground of the company consciousnessso much so that a senior officer had to be summoned when someone asked questions about her i wished i knew what ql stood forthat was what vijay had called alexandras file maybe quit living i stared at the bare trees even if alexandra had known chad in iraq why would that be important to tintrey unless chad had been on some mission that involved tintrey and hed learned a discreditable secret about them if alexandra had died as part of a truck convoy maybe chad had been in one of the trucks that black oblong hed waved in front of nadia was that something hed picked up from the detritus around her exploded truck but a piece of black fabric something that might be a scarf as tim radke had suggested i slapped my notebook shut all this speculation it led nowhere gilbert scalia had come to club gouge with the head of tintrey jarvis maclean if alexandra guaman was this big a hot button at tintrey i had to believe theyd gone down there to see if the body artists tribute to nadia included anything about alexandra more speculation i would have to move fast to get some answers before gilbert scalia closed every door i knocked at rainier cowles was already hovering over the guaman family but maybe if i drove down there now i could find out something from ernest or the grandmother that didnt seem likely but i didnt know what else to do and i felt an urgency to be doing something i pulled onto the road and turned back to the tollway covering the thirty miles south as fast as i could giant tractor trailers roared around me all the way down as the open land bordering the tollway changed to the bungalows lining the kennedy and then to the scrapmetal piles and grocery warehouses that bordered pilsen where the guamans lived it was a relief to get away from the noise and into a residential neighborhood although parking was a challenge people whod shoveled out spaces had blocked them off with garbage cans or brokendown furniture a chicago tradition i found a halflegal space around the corner not quite blocking a fire hydrant bungalows and twoflats stood on lots so small that the buildings almost touched many were decorated with ceramic tiles one even had a mosaic of a jaguar worked all the way across the front nativity scenes and santas still stood in front of some of the houses the guamans didnt have tile or a crèche only a statue of our lady of guadalupe she was kneedeep in snow a black ribbon around her neck serving as a hearttroubling reminder of loss a woman came out of a nearby house she had a wagon a toddler and a drawstring bag filled with laundry that she was carrying down the stairs i hurried over and took the wagon and bag from her she thanked me but looked me up and down frankly in my lario boots and tailored coat i wasnt dressed for the neighborhood is that the guaman home i pointed at the blackribboned lady of guadalupe just trying to get the woman talking are you from the lawyer the lawyer no i was a friend of nadias that was terrible how she died the woman nodded solemnly but why was she in such a place as that nightclub to begin with its very hard on cristina to have her daughter in the news that way nadia told me she and her mother had quarreled that must be hard too on cristina to know her daughter was killed while they were estranged theyre a strange family ever since the oldest girl died i know in iraq alexandras death deranged them all the woman said next thing you know the boy turns into an idiot from a motorcycle accident then nadia fights with her mother and moves away the toddler began to fuss i pulled a sheet of paper from my case and folded it into a cocked hat while i spoke the child stopped whining to watch me poor nadia was angry and upset all the time i said she took alexandras death very hard cristina will never talk about alexandra to anyone maybe to the priest although hes not a man who inspires confidences i handed the cocked hat to the child i guess ill try to pay a condolence call anyway cristina works during the day only ernest is there with lazars mother they take him for therapy they hope hell learn to live on his own one day of course he can walk he can dress himself he can talk but in many ways he acts like a child almost like fausto she pointed at the toddler how they can bring back his memory that i dont understand theyre lucky they got a little extra money extra money i blurted nadia never mentioned that oh everyone knows its why she fought with her mother they got some money i think from ernests accident and nadia she thought her mother shouldnt take it although why not what are you supposed to do live on air and water what the person who caused the accident paid them something the settlement hadnt shown up in any of my databases but if it had been done through mediation it wouldnt be part of the public record the neighbor shruggedthe money was old news not interesting anymore wherever it came from they need every penny of it his therapy all the extra care why couldnt nadia stay at home and help instead of fighting with her mother and leaving it must be hard on clara i suggested two sisters dead her brother seriously injured everyones life is hard the woman settled fausto into the wagon and started down the street my husband he left me when i was pregnant with fausto but i keep going and the guamans do too and maybe the therapy will help ernest two days a week off he goes with his abuela to see if he can learn to behave normally around others he cant work unless he knows how to control himself it was far too cold to stand around talking i walked with her pausing at the guaman home my acquaintance shook her head im sure its hard on cristina seeing her son like he is he used to be such a great boy wonderful brother good son shoveled the walks in the winter took his sisters shopping whatever you wanted he would do and to see him like this she shook her head again pitying and theyre safe living here even though they have more money now everyone knows them no one wants to bring them any more sorrow punks did try to break in twicewe have gangs here same as everywherebut lazar he put in all this new securitywires new glass everything one of the punks cut himself so badly he lost the use of his right hand and then a few days later someone shot another of the gangbangers killed him as he was going into a drug house over on nineteenth street we were all just as happy wed reached the laundromat i held the door for my acquaintance while she wrestled the wagon inside the child had been chewing on the cocked hat and it was pretty much a pulpy mess now but the woman didnt seem to mind i returned to my car and backed into the intersection so i could drive east past the guaman house i dont know what i was hoping to see but just as i was about to turn north the front door opened i stopped at the corner and watched in my wing mirror while ernest and his grandmother came down the stairs she had a firm grip on his left arm but his right arm gesticulated wildly they walked down the street away from me a couple of left turns caught me up with them i drove past them and turned again after a number of similar maneuvers i watched them turn north on western avenue the grandmothers head only reached ernests shoulder but she was definitely in charge of the expedition propelling him along whenever he wanted to stop one storefront completely engaged him and she had a hard time moving him on when i passed a few minutes later i saw it was a pet store puppies in cagesthe kind of thing that makes you want to join an animal liberation army to set them freebut utterly entrancing for children propped in the window was a glossy picture of a puppy licking the face of an ecstatic child on impulse i went inside and got a flyer after a few blocks the grandmother stopped and seemed to be forcing ernest to decide where to go he turned right and she shook her head he waved his arms and shouted loudly enough that i caught the echo down in my own car but finally he turned around and headed west lottys hospital beth israel runs a rehab place down here one of the ten or fifteen healthcare centers that fill up chicagos near south side i figured my quarry was heading there i drove past them and found street parking where i could keep an eye on the entrance sure enough in another few minutes ernest and his grandmother turned up the walk and went through the revolving doors i followed them in not sure what i was hoping to accomplish women with infants women with boyfriends on crutches or in wheelchairs women looking after aging parents old women like señora guaman taking care of grandchildren filled the lobby one television was blaring in spanish another in english children were crying mothers stared ahead in stolid resignation ernest and his grandmother were standing in line to check in the grandmother had found someone she knew sitting nearby the two women were talking in spanish i bent over pretending to pick up something from the floor and held out the flyer with the puppys picture to ernest did you drop this he looked at me not understanding what i was saying but then his eye fell on the picture of the puppy and he snatched it from me my dog nana my dog his grandmother turned she sighed with fatigue when she saw the picture and i felt ashamed for exciting himlooking after her grandson must be a hard enough job without a private eye rousing him your dog ernest she said you dont have a dog this is a picture of a dog her english was fluent but heavily accented im sorry i smiled at her i found this next to him on the floor and thought maybe hed dropped it he wants a dog and maybe we should get him one but i dont want to care for a dog as well as for ernest anyway his sister is allergic hes here for therapy i asked i dont know how much they can do for him but we come two times every week after all if you give up hope you have nothing left its hard i said one of my cousins was shot in the head he can still walk and talk but hes lost his impulse control he behaves so wildly in public we dont know if he can ever live on his own again lies the detectives stockintrade was really making me squirm today with ernie it was a motorcycle she said we kept him out of the gangs he was a good boy always but not a scholar like his sisters they all are brilliant students were brilliant students her face creased in sorrow two of them are dead now im so sorry was it in the same accident where he was injured it seemed disrespectful to talk about ernest as if he wasnt there but in a way he wasnt he was crooning over the picture of the puppy my guilt mounted the oldest she died in iraq these two were close her death hit him in the heart i think thats why he was careless with his motorcycle six months after allies death he ran off the expressway somehow the motorcycle climbed over the railing i dont understand how i wasnt here and my son couldnt explain it to me allie ernest heard his sisters name and dropped the picture allie is a dove she flies around with jesus now nadia is a dove men are shooting my sisters theyll get clara next bam bam poor clara what allie was shot in battle i asked the grandmother they shot allie bam bam no ernesto poor allie was killed by a bomb they shot her nana bam bam they shot nadia bam next clara bam bam he was getting more and more agitated i picked up the picture of the puppy the puppy will kiss clara and make her all better i suggested holding it out to him yes nana we need to get clara a puppy no one can shoot her if she has a puppy in another minute he was crooning happily over the picture again i apologized to his grandmother for stirring him up how could you know she said the death of his sister he still cant understand what really happened to her and his mother she wont allow us to mention alexandras name so he never has a chance to talk maybe one day his poor brain will clear and he will understand what happened to her the third sister isnt really in danger is she the grandmothers eyes clouded i pray night and day for her safety when you have lost twothree reallyshe nodded toward her grandsonyou are frightened all the time the clerk called her by name daydreaming mrs guaman its your turn ernie your friends are waiting for you i slipped away as the grandmother began to chat in spanish with the clerk and drove to my office in a sober mood a show in the dark back in my office i wrote up my conversation with scalia and the odd reaction of everyone id met at tintrey to alexandras name i left out the tamponwhy include that in a document that might get subpoenaed for a trialand threw out the notebook that scalia had damaged the last column in my investigator spreadsheet was labeled dead ends jesse laredo chads buddy from iraq was dead jesses mother had called while i was out to say she couldnt find any trace of chads blogs or emails among her sons things the message wasnt a surpriseit would surprise me if i learned one reliable thing in this wretched casebut it did depress me further i looked up embodiedartcom again to see if there were any new postings but the site was still down out of respect for the dead i took out my notes where id copied some of rodneys code there were several ls but no qs i rubbed my eyes kystarnik had to know he was under surveillance he had to realize he needed multiple avenues to communicate with his thugs so it seemed reasonable to assume that rodneys scribbles were some means of communication even so the feds could also be watching the body artist so it wasnt exactly a secret code so why was he doing it maybe rodneys mission was simply to taunt olympia about the money she owed rest ez when shed been so angry with karen buckley the other night for refusing to let rodney write on her buttocks olympia had told her they were in the same boat together but karen said it wasnt any of her business if club gouge went under i turned the argument this way and that in my mind but couldnt come up with any compelling reason karen had for doing what olympia and rodney wanted i looked at the column i called key players and added gilbert scalia i couldnt see any place that tintrey and rest ez intersected except at olympias club rodney rainier cowles scalia and tintrey owner jarvis maclean had all been there on the same night but what did that prove olympia knew things she wasnt telling so did the body artist all i needed was for one of them to open up and the whole house of cards would fall neatly around me i dug deeper into rainier cowless biography and found that he had handled litigation for tintrey as id suspected palmer statten was tintreys outside counsel but so what i flung a pencil at the wall in frustration as if on cue john vishneski called to say that mona hadnt printed out any of chads blog postings either the docs say hes holding his own still he said what have you found out im trying to see where his life and nadia guamans intersected and im assuming it had to be in iraq where nadias sister died so thats the lead im working right now ill call you when i know something definite or if chad regains consciousness and can talk let me know meanwhile keep playing your clarinet for him i hung up before he could criticize my lack of progress or pry more deeply into what i was or wasnt doing because i couldnt think of anything else to do i looked up ernest guamans motorcycle accident of course injuries like his are routine in a city like chicago like chad vishneskis squadeight men dead and only three mentioned by namethere so many accidents in chicago that youd have to be in a spectacular one for anyone to care finally in the hispanic newspaper i found a brief paragraph on ernest guaman that gave me the dateseven months after allies deathbut no details he was alone on his honda at two in the afternoon but no one has come forward to say how the accident took place i translated laboriously i guess id been imagining someone forcing him off the road to try to silence him id wanted said the article to say ernest guaman crusading for justice for his sister alexandra was forced off the road today by and the blank would be filled in with the name of the person whod gone on to shoot nadia for drawing her sisters portrait on karen buckleys back it was friday night and id had a long week jake had decreed a moratorium on rehearsals i declared a similar moratorium on the vishneskis i put on makeup and a formfitting sweater and we went to an oldfashioned night club one where everyone kept their clothes on jake knew the bass player so we got a table up front we stayed until the club closed at three dancing and drinking we spent saturday catching up on sleep taking a lazy walk along the lakefront with the dogs watching an old alec guinness movie on sunday the brief honeymoon was over jakes early music group came by at four for a rehearsal i headed back to club gouge in the hope of finding a way to get the body artist or olympia to talk to me im not much for disguises not like sherlock holmes or aimée leduc but i did put on makeup using a heavy hand with the eyeliner and mascara and dug through the junk in my hall closet for a pink plastic wig id worn at halloween with that and the smith wesson in my tuck holster if i didnt fool anyone with my getup at least i could shoot my way past olympias bouncer it was just after nine when i reached the club and excitement was building as the body artists performance time drew near i parked down the street and attached myself to a highspirited group waiting in line everyone had to show ids to make sure the drinking age limit was met the crowd was large enough that one of the bartenders was helping the bouncer the two were shining flashlights on the birth dates only not bothering to check pictures against faces so i held my drivers license out to the bartender thumb casually covering my photo and slipped inside it felt like old times rodney at his spot glowering at a bottle of beer my cousin swooping around with drinks laughing and flirting equally with men and women olympia tonight wearing skintight white leather with a trailing black scarf behind the bar captain on the bridge surveying the deck finally the lights went down then came up on karen buckley naked on her stool the two figures in burkas appeared at the edge of the stage miming longing and fear i couldnt take another show i worked my way through the crowd to the edge of the room and went into the corridor where the toilets were id planned on going through the door between the public space and the dressing rooms to wait for karen there but olympia or perhaps karen had posted a guard at the door a stocky scowling man in black in my role as pink plastic bubble hair i smiled and waggled my fingers at him he scowled even more thoroughly i went into the womens toilets where i amused myself by answering emails and finally heard the eruption of laughter that announced the end of the show in a few minutes the bathroom was full of women laughing with embarrassment or chattering excitedly about karens performance i went back into the corridor where a long line was waiting to use the facilities a much shorter line naturally stood outside the mens room the lights suddenly went out again people screamed pulled out cell phones to light up the hallway jabbered in confusion a mans voice heavily accented boomed through the sound system were experiencing electrical problems ill have to ask everyone to leave guests and staff we have a crew with flashlights to help you find your coats and personal belongings if you havent paid your bill yet the last round was on the house see you friday and our apologies for the inconvenience i flattened myself against the wall as the crowd pushed toward the exits panic seemed to infect people in the dark no one seemed to wonder how the electricity could be out while the mike onstage worked perfectly inside the clubs main room powerful flashlights played around i couldnt see who was wielding them but a man appeared next to a table where a couple was still seated and urged them to their feetand not in any gentle way as the lights shone on the bar on the tables on the exit i saw another man in black outside olympias cube of an office i thought olympia would stick around to go down with her ship but couldnt locate her in the crowd i did see my cousins feathery halo of hair heading toward the exit and breathed a sigh of relief whatever was going on i didnt want petra to be part of it while the flashlights were focused on the middle of the room i slipped behind the curtain at the back of the stage a door behind the stage that led to the corridor was partly open i stood flat against the wall and peered between the doors hinges karens dressing room was directly across the hall a man in black wearing a black ski mask stood there making sure everyone moved down the corridor to the rear exit and making sure no one could leave karens dressing room i dropped to the floor so that my silhouette wouldnt show i felt a draft and realized that the stage back here was raised that there was a gap of about a foot between it and the floor i wriggled underneath dislodging my pink wig any noise i was making was masked by the tromping of feet toward the exit that wouldnt go on for long i took my gun out of its holster and felt for the safety i didnt want to shoot it by mistake in the dark in a surprisingly short time the room was cleared voices called to each other male and female affirming that everyone had left the lights came back up bring them out it was the sound of authority a man speaking with the rumbling r of a slavic accent i heard someone open the dressing room door i couldnt see anything only heard a cry of pain suppressed and footfalls overhead one set was heavy boots the other almost noiseless perhaps the body artists bare feet from the other end of the room i heard olympia snap let go of me damn you then the horrible sound of hand on skin a noisy slap and a woman also with a rumbling slavic accent saying you speak when we ask questions otherwise you are quiet youve no right slap this is not an american courtroom you are not having rights you are having only responsibilities and these you are not meeting i fumbled in my pocket for my cell phone and typed a text to petra begging her to call the police and get them to the club i didnt know terry finchleys number by heart so i put in the number for his friend conrad rawlings who works now in south chicago tell conrad call terry thugs r beating olympia above me i heard another slap and a mans voice saying go to the computer bitch and turn your gallery back on that was rodney the body artist said i didnt shut the site down i thought you did i cant get access to it her voice was a little wobbly but she was maintaining an admirable level of control the thugs hit her again and then i heard a crash cascading metal amplified by the wooden floorboards loud cursing in a language not english a paint can rolled across the stage and bounced to the floor near me a scuffle more metal flying about and then another smack of hand on flesh and a highpitched yelp hold that stupid bitch the master voice maybe even anton kystarnik himself you know our agreement olympia i dont want to burn your pretty little club down so no more littlegirl lies and you you nogood whore no more littlegirl tricks from you either fix your website then we all can go home happy but i dont know why my site is again someone hit her harder this time i slid out from my hiding place the man whod been guarding the door to the corridor was gonethey figured they had control of the premises i moved to his spot behind the curtain and peered through the gap the thick wires connecting the plasma screens to the mains came through here and went under the door to a wall outlet in the corridor i stepped carefully so i wouldnt trip and betray myself the stage was covered with paint i saw now what the noise had been karen had hurled the contents of her cart at her attackers brushes and palette knives were scattered wholesale one knife had landed near me i slid a hand through the gap in the curtain and picked it up its blade was too pliable for use as a weapon the thugs all had on those black ski masks so popular with bullies i thought i could tell rodney by his beer belly but the others were indistinguishable one figure had a gun trained on olympia another on the body artist who was still covered in her performance paint someone with red paint all down the front of his jacket forced karen to sit smacking her hard and brought the laptop she used with her slide show over to her open the website he growled karen her fingers shaking typed in the url lights shifted and flicked in the house and i realized the computer was still attached to the plasma screens on the stage by craning my neck i could see the same message id been getting out of respect for the dead we have temporarily taken the site offline now you put online he said someone got into my system and changed the password karen said i cant open it liar the head man growled log on karen typed something and on the screen we could all see the message come back invalid password try again she tried again and got the same message the man giving the orders nodded and the thug holding karen slugged her jaw i couldnt stand and watch and i couldnt take them all on either i knelt and gouged at the insulation around the thickest of the wires snaking through my feet peeled it back my hands were trembling in my panicky haste i finally loosened a strip pulled it away from the wires and stuck the palette knife in between them a crack like thunder an arc of lightning and the theater went dark again the knife blade splintered in my hand and the shock knocked me backward sparks sizzled and spat from the exposed wires i scrambled under the curtains onto the stage on my hands and knees the room was briefly quiet no one knew what had happened then shouting and cursing began in russian or perhaps ukrainian people crashed across the room scattering tables falling someone fired a shot and i could see the spurt of flame the master voice bellowed in russian or ukrainian and no one else fired i ran onto the stage and tried to grab karen but she swung a fist at me and started kicking its v i warshawski i panted come along damn it she flailed at me even harder i pulled her from the stool tried to orient myself to the back of the stage one of the thugs had found a flashlight and pointed it at the stage another gun went off this time aiming at us i let go of karens arm and dropped to the floor i rolled over and fired back but my shot went wide karen karen where are you we need to get out of here the curtain dropped against the fused wires i could smell charring if the curtain caught the wooden floor and chairs would feed a fire in no time i pushed through the curtains looked down the corridor saw movement in the dressing room karen had put on her coat and boots and had her jeans in her hand i slung my left arm under her armpits and hefted her over my shoulder before she realized what i was doing put me down damn you she drubbed on my back as i jogged down the hall to the back exit pushed open the door while she kicked at me i was panting now from the load and from her fighting me and i still had to circle the building to get to my car out on lake street before id gone more than a few steps she managed to break free she ran to an suv parked near us and opened the door she was in luck the keys were in the ignition she got the engine going as i ran to her side i yanked the door wide but she punched at my head you interfering ignorant stupid bitch now youve really fucked me over get out of my way or ill run you down she roared out of the lot the stillopen door swinging on its hinges i just had time to read the plate number before she turned onto lake street thank god for the boys in blue i dont know who was angrier me or finchley we were sitting on stools at the club gouge bar and olympia her cheeks pale but her lips smiling was telling terry that nothing had happened its a club we do performance art i dont think ms warshawski understood that we had a special rehearsal tonight after the club closed she took it too seriously really ms warshawski you need to get out more see whats happening in theater these days and the fire terry asked when he and his team arrived the back curtains were in flames the cops had pulled them down and managed to stamp out the fire but the stage was a mess parts of the floor were scorched and the whole surface was covered in paint from the cans the body artist had hurled at her assailants five squad cars pulled up as i was getting into my mustang to follow the artist the cops pinned me in they wouldnt listen to my frantic cries about going after the suvim the one who sent for you a key witness is taking offand forced me to come back into the club with them most of the thugs had fled but the patrol units grabbed the few whod stayed behind including rodney and cuffed them the fire department showed up a few minutes after the cops a middleaged firefighter dealt with the wires id fused he had sad eyes and a drooping mustache but his thick fingers moved skillfully among the wires and he restored power to the buildinga mercy because the furnace had shut down in the outage finchley walked in a moment or two later you know vic im going to suggest to the captain that we pay to relocate you to new york because i swear chicagos crime rate would drop fifty percent if you werent here conrad relayed your message now tell me why weve all left our beds to do your bidding its not that im not grateful i said because believe me i am these goons are the remnant of a whole swarm of creeps who took over the club and started beating up the body artist and olympia but the body artist took off in a borrowed suv and i was hoping to follow her when your crew hustled me back in here not listening to my suggestion that they go after the artist terry sighed exasperated either with me or his crew i couldnt tell which but he asked me for the plate number and phoned in a bulletin asking patrol units to look out for the suv that was when olympia started her littlegirl act pretending that it was all just a giant but unfortunately truly dangerous misunderstanding on my part the thugs whom the cops had cuffed began to smirk even rodney whod been trying to start owen widermayers mercedes when the police pulled him out of it looked as though he might break into song i wanted to shoot holes in all of them just to wipe the smiles off their faces they knew they were going to beat any rap i might be able to hand out the fire crew chief joined us in the front of the club you the owner miss he asked me you were way over code there with the load you were carrying this was an accident waiting to happen thank you officer olympia surged between him and me this is my building ill get this taken care of first thing tomorrowtoday really isnt it but you know what i meanwhen the rest of the world is awake and going to work you and i are in bed she blinked from the fire chief and his drooping mustache to terry in what was meant to be a helpless appealing way im sorry the warshawski woman was such an alarmist that she roused everyone but were grateful for the quick response let me give you gift vouchers you and your friends are welcome to come here on your nights off as my guests she reached over the bar and fumbled in a drawer for the vouchers no terrys quiet voice carried authority and both his team and the fire crew looked stolidly ahead tell me about the fire the fire on the stage you mean was there another a pulse was starting to throb on terrys forehead sorry to be so silly detective but this warshawski womans wild behavior has me so rattled that i vic tell me about the fire i repeated what id said earlier about thugs taking over the theater going by the voices at least one was a woman maybe more they forced the staff and customers to leave but i hid under the stage the whole point of the attack seemed to be connected with the artists websiteits been down for several days and they wanted her to bring it back up when she either wouldnt or couldnt they started beating up olympia and the body artist both i couldnt take on the whole loti wanted to create a diversion while i hustled the artist off the stage i didnt know my intervention would produce such drastic results so you set the fire finchley said i fused the wires the open wire set the curtains on fire ms warshawski i expect you to pay for the damage you caused here olympia said were you born stupid or did you work hard to get like this it was all i could do not to grab her and shake her you take this to a court of law and you will i will have witnesses that you did malicious damage to my building olympias triumphant tone was startling karen wont testify for you and neither will these men here she waved an arm toward the handcuffed thugs my mouth opened and shut several times but i couldnt get any words out where does this body artist live terry asked we looked in the dressing room shed left her keys but we didnt find any id we need to talk to her get her version of what happened here tonight olympia bit her lips in momentary indecision then told terry shed get it from her computer i tagged along with them to her tiny office she tried to keep us from looking at the screen but terry pushed her aside and scribbled the address into his notebook back in the main room of the club he ordered one of his squad cars over to the address on superior that olympia had given him and ordered another unit to take the thugs to the station for booking you cant arrest them just on warshawskis sayso olympia had given up her littlegirl act im not pressing charges one of the men in cuffs winked at her and said not to be worrying like this olympia lawyer will come all will be well there were a few minutes of bustle with terrys minions shoving the punks out the door followed by the fire crew and the rest of the cops you need to go too warshawski olympias smile disappeared with the disappearing lawmen i warned you to stay away from my club but you came back you set a fire if you keep saying that koilada you are going to be facing such a big lawsuit that even your sugar daddy wont bail you out olympia gave an exaggerated yawn good night vic get out and dont come back not unless youre bringing a check to cover the damages and tell petra shes got to find a new job no olympia darling im not your manager you want to fire one of your staff you spit it out in person to her face and if you think you can do a deal with anton kystarnik in or out of bed do remember that his wife died in a plane crash so well orchestrated that everyone agreed it was an accident it was an accident i gave a tight parody of a smile and so was the fire on your stage good night olympia angels guide you to your rest and all that an unmarked car bristling with antennas was in the lot i felt for my gun but it was terry waiting for a private word with me he got out of the backseat and followed me to my car vic you know theres not a lot we can do if koilada insists on her story not unless theuhartist backs up your statement but just for my own curiosity what was going on in there i dont know terry olympia owes a bundle to someone it could be as much as a million dollars and it could be to anton kystarnik rodney treffer the heavy you picked up tonight works for kystarnik and the boys and girls who took over the place tonight were speaking some slavic language connect the dots your own way but to me it looks as though olympia lets them use the club as some kind of way of getting information to each other without going through any wires thats why theyre so furious that they cant get access to the pictures on her site my opinion only of course i started my engine what were you doing here tonight for a moment i couldnt remember the evening had been so full of drama nadia guamans older sister died in iraq i finally said im thinking nadias murder is connected to that to the fact that chad vishneski was over there when alexandra guaman died terry slapped the roof of my car in frustration i dont know who gets my goat more that piece of work in therehe gestured toward the clubpretending a bunch of lowlifes were rehearsing a show or you thinking you can skate right over evidence of murder because it doesnt fit some damned theory of yours listen to me oh forget it do what you want i fumbled in my bag for a dollar bill this picture of washington bets that when your team gets to the address olympia gave you youll find a vacant lot or maybe an abandoned warehouse you wont find karen buckley he was starting to answer me when his phone rang he had a short biting conversation with someone and then squatted to look me in the eye how did you know he asked have you been over there that was your officer out on west superior its a warehouse but its empty how did you know warshawski are you involved in some con of your own it was a guess ive been around these women awhile now and they are the original shell shufflers oh hell he swore uncharacteristically that explains what i asked when he bit off the sentence just that an alert squad car found the suv your artist boosted shed dumped it on irving near the blue line which means she could have jumped the l to anywhere in town or even the airport we put an alert out at ohare but tsa cant find the bathroom with both hands most days if you know where the buckley woman lives and youre not saying terry on my mothers name i do not know word one about the body artistnot even whether karen buckley is her real name or not he shut my door none too gently and stomped to his waiting car as i drove down lake street my right hand hurt so badly i couldnt hold the steering wheel i stopped at the light on ashland and took off my glove a fragment of the palette knife was lodged in my index finger near the palm i hadnt noticed it during the heat of battle i wasnt about to go to an emergency room and sit for the rest of the night nursing my hand in my lap i went north to ukrainian village to rivka darlings home if karen buckley had ridden the l back down here kystarnik would have found her easily a hummer was parked in front of rivkas building engine running the driver flicked up the brights as i went passed looking to see who was on the street i pretended not to notice although they probably had my license plate in their files i called rivka on my cell phone we had a short annoying conversation she wouldnt say one way or another if karen was there even when i said that the artists life was at risk you werent in the club tonight i said but a gang of serious thugs attacked her at the end of the performance she managed to get away but if shes with you you need to call the cops one of the creeps is in front of your building so if shes there dont let her leave without a police escort if she doesnt want the cops call me do you hear karen can look after herself she doesnt need you i guessed from the quiver in rivkas voice that the artist hadnt shown up i drove to my own home where i looked at my right hand under my piano light the fragment was just visible below the skin i found a bottle of peroxide in my pantry cupboard and poured it into a mixing bowl tweezers and a needle which took a little more findingi dont often mend clothes or dig out splinters when i had my kit assembled i went back to the living room and stuck my hand in the peroxide courage victoria i said im righthanded and digging around for metal splinters with my left was a challenge that brought me close to the screaming point i was beginning to think an emergency room was the answer when jake knocked at my front door we just finished rehearsing and i saw your light he said you interested in a nightcap im interested in someone with long delicate fingers and a surgeons deft touch i held out my hand which was bleeding pretty heavily from my bungled probing vic blood makes me throw up i thought he was joking but his face actually did have a greenish sheen ill rinse it off i said if youll take this splinter out for me please ill even open my last bottle of torgiano for you he made a face but took the tweezers from me you go rinse this off until its not bleeding he said or youll be removing lasagna from it along with the blood when i got myself cleaned up he clamped my hand between his knees as if it were a cello he was sweating but he had the chip out fairly fast he turned his head while i wrapped the hand in a towel what is this he held the chip under the light a metal fragment a palette knife exploded in my hand a palette no dont explain im happier not knowing and i dont know about you but i need something stronger than red wine right now i got out a bottle of longrow it was a smallbatch single malt that my most important client darraugh graham had brought me from edinburgh it went down like liquid gold by the time id had my second glass and followed jake into my bedroom id almost forgotten the throbbing in my hand mourning coffee when my cell phone rang four hours later at first i incorporated it into my sleep i was in kiev and the body artist painted like a russian easter egg was madly pulling ropes to ring church bells all across the city the ringing stopped then started again almost at once i know the bottesini jake muttered i dont have to rehearse it neither do i i said but i got up and found my phone in the pocket of the jeans id dropped on the floor last night my call log showed the same person had called three times the phone was chirruping to tell me i had new voice mail new text messages r u there ansir my head was too blurry from a short night on top of a gun battle to call back i stumbled shivering down the hall to the bathroom seven in the morning still dark i didnt think winter would ever end i stood under the shower washing sleep out of my face while my phone rang again from the towel shelf on the callers fifth try i answered before it rolled over to voice mail who is this it was a husky whisper my least favorite conversational gambit v i warshawski who is this i clara im supposed to be at mass in fifteen minutes i need to see you theres a coffee shop on blue island a block from the school a truck or bus roaring by made it hard to hear her i shouted over the noise that id be there in twenty minutes jake didnt wake up as i banged drawers and doors open and shut pulling on sweaters jeans my practical heavy boots for a perverse moment i wanted to yank the blankets off freeze his toes force him to wake up but hed done surgery on me that turned him green hed spent the night hed made me feel less alone and more beautiful than i usually do my right hand was swollen the palm a purply brown when i couldnt get a glove over it i stuffed it into an oven mitt grabbed my coat and gun and ran down the back stairs to the alley where id parked last night once i was in the car i put the smith wesson on the seat under my coat wondering how well id aim if i had to shoot lefthanded lake shore drive is a parking lot this time of day but the side streets werent much betterparents dropping kids off at school blocked most of the roads it took half an hour to reach the coffee shop a franchise of one of the big chains on blue island i didnt see clara guaman at first and thought shed gotten fed up with waiting however while i stood in line for the espresso i urgently needed clara emerged from the shadows at the back i thought youd never get here i have to get to class before they miss me ill walk up with you we can talk on the way no i dont want anyone to see you with me come over here where its dark she headed toward the back to an alcove near the doors to the toilets i collected my drink and joined her this was the only coffee shop close to her school and it was filled with kids on their way to class so i didnt think shed be particularly anonymous at least so far no one had called out to her once we were in the alcove she couldnt seem to get to the point she fiddled with her phone and kept peering around the corner to see who was standing in line whats going on clara i tried to keep irritability out of my voice but my short night made me not only foggy but grumpy did you go todid you askwere you talking about allie with prince rainier no i said i went up to tintreys headquarters in northfield yesterday did rainier come around like so many chains this place had overheated the milk for the cappuccino which ruins the taste caffeine is caffeine though i poured some into the lid to cool and swallowed it wincing at the bitterness did you go up there to spy on allie why cant you let her and nadia rest in peace the soldier whos accused of shooting nadia lost his whole unit in iraq i was trying to find out if alexandra had died in the same attack why do you care she said in a fierce whisper im trying to understand where nadia and chad vishneskis lives connected it seemed to me that iraq was a place leave allie alone what dont you understand about that everything why cant i talk about alexandra because were not supposed to clara peered around again she did something awful in iraq the company wont publish it as long as we dont talk about her but if we do theyll put it online theyll put it everywhere the company tintrey when she nodded i asked what did she do i dont know mamá and papi wont tell me ernest he knew but look at him now he doesnt remember he just starts waving his arms and saying allie is a dove with jesus when i ask him this doesnt make sense i tried to force my sleepdeprived brain to work what difference does it make if anyone knows the company paid us her insurance clara muttered even though they shouldnt haveat least thats what mamá saysbecause allie had gone off on her own whatever she was doing when she got killed it wasnt part of her job that shouldnt affect her life insurance maybe it was workers comp what difference does it make clara cried and then looked around again afraid her outburst had attracted attention someone asked if we were waiting for the bathroom and pushed past us to use it we moved deeper into the alcove farther from the noise at the front of the shop it doesnt youre right it doesnt matter at least from a legal standpoint the insurance company could demand their money back if they thought theyd paid a fraudulent claim is that how rainier cowles got involved i hate him claras voice was savage mamá and papi were beside themselves when allie died they wanted to sue they said the company was to blame for not taking care of allie but then he started showing up cowles she nodded and what did he tell your folks she grimaced i didnt really know what they were talking about these horrible arguments started round and round i wasnt sure who was on whose side but ernie hed just been in his accident and finally papi said wed better take the money or wed never be able to take care of him nadia she was furious she said allies life shouldnt be for sale in the end she promised mamá not to talk about allie not to talk about how allie died but nadia never stopped being angry so she moved out and then we just went on and pretended like it was all normal ernie flapping his arms around nadia never coming home me going to st teresa of avilas it sounds like your home life is a nightmare it is she burst out you dont even know you cant imagine but its worse now because of nadia dying and what if mamá finds out she cut herself short what if mamá finds out what i asked nothing nothing that allie was a lesbian i suggested she wasnt she wasnt you cant be saying things like that she was so beautiful every boy who ever saw her fell in love with her but she never dated she was saving herself for marriage i sighed oh clara its not a sin let alone a scandal for a woman to love another woman how did you find out did allie tell you herself nadia she muttered after a pause right before she died she told me that allie wasthat allie that shed met this woman this artist whowho i guess she seduced allie and made her do clara the artist didnt seduce your sister or if she did your sister was a willing partner the only sad and shocking thing is that alexandra felt she had to keep her life a secret from her family when did she tell nadia clara looked around the alcove seeking inspiration i dont know how nadia knew i bit back a sharp retort clara you trusted me enough to get me out of bed and down here can you trust me enough to tell me the truth she scowled not so much in anger perhaps as some way of holding back her fears it wasnt rainier cowles who told nadia was it no although i guess he knows somehow someone in iraq they knew theyi dont knowthey wrote nadia because she was the one allie was close to someone in iraq wrote nadia about the body artist and the womens music festival this time i couldnt keep the scorn out of my voice believe me or not i dont care but prince rainier came over last nightit was awful how he talked to mamá and papi he knows you were asking questions up at tintrey you have to stop he thinks we told you to ask questions and if you dont stop hell hell hell what there was another long pause and then she mumbled im not sure what hold does he have over your family if its alexandras sexuality that means your parents already know about her they dont they dont i couldnt budge her and i tried for several fruitless minutes i couldnt put together a plausible story about why tintrey was giving money to the guamans in such a secretive way if it was some kind of compensation for alexandras death that would be a straightforward workers comp payment maybe tintrey had done what so many companies do these days namely taken out a life insurance policy on a highrisk employee with the company not the family as beneficiary maybe the guamans had threatened to go public with that information or maybe tintrey was splitting the insurance payout with them but threatening to reveal alexandras sexuality if the guamans said anything its my fault that allie died clara burst in on my convoluted thoughts i was too tired to deal with an adolescents wild mood swingsone moment attacking me for ruining alexandras reputation the next drowning in fear and remorse over crimes she hadnt committed i took a breath and tried to speak in a warm and compassionate voice what can possibly make you say that you just said you were a kid i dont believe you were in iraq putting your sister in harms way allie she wanted me to go away to college someplace special thats why she took the job in iraq because tintrey pays people in war zones like four times what they pay here allie wanted me to go someplace grand yale or somewhere like that if it hadnt been for me she wouldnt have gone off to war and now with nadia gone and ernie hurt i have to do something big with my life or theyll all be dead for nothing that sounds like a terrible burden to carry around i have these dreams she whispered where nadia and allie push me off a cliff and mamá and papi are holding out their arms like theyre going to catch me only they disappear and im still falling i wake up just before i hit the ground her shoulders began to shake and she was suddenly sobbingthose heaving gutwrenching sobs that make you feel your whole body will rip apart thats what it means to cry your heart out i put an arm around clara tough road youre on kid tough road i murmured into her hair people kept coming to the back of the shop to use the toilets they stared at us and one of them started to call claras name but backed away when clara glowered at her eventually her sobs died down i made her swallow some of my cold overboiled coffee and handed her a napkin to blow her nose what did nadia tell you about chad just that he scared her she thought first he was from prince rainier and that he was going to beat her up for drawing allies picture but chad thought she was making fun of him thats why he was so angry it doesnt make any sense does it none of this makes any sense not the insurance money or why a lawyer like cowles cares although chad has ptsd and things set him off that might not seem logical i have to get to school clara said i left before mass but now im late for first period what are you going to do i made a face i dont understand anything right now but i promise i will act with your safety in mind if you do start feeling scaredi pulled out one of my cards and wrote my home address on itgo to this address ring the firstfloor bell an old man named mr contreras will let you in and look after you hes my neighbor ive known him for years believe me theres no one more trustworthy in this city the pen pressed against my swollen palm and made it hard to write clearly but i added contreras in block letters under my address on racine and handed it to her along with a twenty thats for a cab if you need to run fast dont spend it on eye shadow or coffee drinks its your bolthole money stale act when i got to my office petra was sitting in the lot in her silver nissan the motor running she climbed out as soon as she saw me pull up and started talking before i was out of my car what happened last night olympia just called to tell me im fired she said its because you burned down her club and i couldnt be trusted as long as you were in my life you didnt really did you and the top of the morning to you too my little chickadee lack of sleep was making me dizzy i forgot about my sore palm and picked my gun up from where id left it on the car seat cold metal on open wound made me cry out involuntarily dont snarl at methanks to you im unemployed thanks to olympia you are unemployed i snarled i havent had breakfast olympia kept me up late and another crisis got me up early you can come to the diner with me or wait in my office petra trudged down the street with me everything in her body from the jut of her lower lip to her hunched shoulders designed to tell me how big a burden i was in her life i didnt even try to make conversation let her sulk at the diner i thought about the healthy optionoatmeal fruit yogurtbut i needed protein and i was craving grease fried eggs and hash browns petra petulantly told the waitress that she wasnt hungry what did you do to olympia and why is she taking it out on me i shut my eyes and leaned back in the booth not until i get food as soon as my breakfast arrived petra repeated her plaint she unhungry cousin also helped herself to my hash browns i ate the eggs trying to pretend i was alone or with jake perhaps in a luxury suite at the four seasons finally though i told petra what had gone on last night after the thugs had sent her and the rest of the staff away olympia is playing a very dangerous game if shes playing with anton kystarnik i said frankly since you wouldnt quit im glad she fired you petra took a piece of my toast and spread jam on it but you said you werent sure who those guys were im not sure what makes the sky blue but that doesnt mean i dont believe it is but rodney the guy who stuck his hand in your pants works for kystarnik olympia gives him the run of the club she forced karen to let him put his cryptic messages on her butt when she was doing her mourning piece for nadia look up kystarnik he is one scary dude i glared at her and snatched the last piece of toast before she could get it order your own damned breakfast so how come you set the stage on fire collateral damage i explained how it happened and showed her the purple mess in my palm not that it was relevant just that it hurt and i wanted petra to see that id been wounded in the line of duty olympia is scared shes thrashing around shes blaming me for her troubles and shes taking it out on you as a way to hurt me but what am i going to live on my cousin cried i lost my day job now this dont tell me to beg my folks thats what my friends are saying but i just cant not now that i know how they got their money petra i need help i wondered if i was insane or just too tired to think straight you can work for me for a bit not anything glamorous and definitely not anything dangerous but id pay you fifteen an hour to start really her face instantly lost its sullen pout and came to life oh vic youre the best im sorry i called you names a few provisos i said in my driest voice everything i do is confidential everything people who come to a detective have problems that they cant solve any other way if you text or blog or phone or communicate anything about any client without my permission i will fire you that minute got it she looked instinctively at her phone which had been tweeting at her while we talked gosh vic theres no need to look like darth vader i know how to keep a secret good i said although i didnt really believe her the other thing is you arent licensed you dont have the experience or the credentials for a license so theres a limit to the kinds of tasks you can undertake but the state will view everything you do as happening on my orders so dont under any circumstances start imagining a better way to handle a tricky situation if it backfires i could lose my license and then wed both be in the gutter living on peppys leftover dog food this doesnt sound like fun petra grumbled i put twelve bucks on the check and got to my feet you dont have to do it i can get someone from an agency i will i will my cousin stood up too just dont be a bully i work best when im part of a team not a robot theres a certain amount of robot to the assistant job i warned her youll have to pretend im not your cousin that this job is as important as well as keeping olympias customers happy theres filing theres keeping track of emails phone messagesa lot of all investigative work is sheer unmitigated boring routine petra nodded i will be the unbullied gofer to end all unbullied gofers as long as you dont hog all the good stuff i smiled at her i promise i will let you take the next metal shard to the hand as we waited at the long light on milwaukee i asked if the body artist had ever said anything that suggested she knew rodney treffer as more than one of olympias customers why when i was trying to help her escape last night she fought me screaming that id totally messed things up so even though she fought back against the guys who were pounding her on the stage she didnt want me to save her from them which makes me wonder petra shook her head she likes being mysterious and she likes well fucking with the waitstaff thats about all i can tell you fucking with the waitstaff oh you know shell ask for a drink after her show and you know who she is screwing by who was willing to take it in it was like some kind of initiation rite when i started work there to answer the call and then shed be like oh petrais that your namejust get this makeup off my ass and shed see how far youd go with her i made a sour face but changed the subject you know by the way that chad vishneskis father is my client and that means the warshawski agency is committed to chads innocence petra grinned i love being part of the warshawski agency i renounce all other loyalties i am one hundred percent behind chad wed crossed the street and made it to my building where another surprise visitor waited rivka darling was pacing the sidewalk outside my front door when she saw me she burst out where is she wheres who i asked the artist i typed in the code on the door keypad darling rivka rivka darling what makes you think karen is missing because she is you knew she was when you called last night and she never did come home does she live with you rivka paused shes been staying with me while her life is in danger and i ushered her and petra down the hall to my office i sat rivka on a couch in the client alcove and turned to my cousin petra this is a potential client she also is a potential suspect in a murder inquiry so we ask questions and take notes but we wont volunteer information although we will tell her what we know about last night rivka gasped as if id stuck her headfirst in the icy lake what do you mean im a suspect i came here for help you have to find karen they could have killed her who are they rivka the people who attacked her last night rivka was shrieking with fury at my refusal to join her in hysteria i called over to the club this morning looking for karen olympia was there she told me you set the place on fire and i turned to my cousin petra your first assignment is to phone olympia and tell her that we are making a note of every time she says i set her club on fire and that these statements will form the basis of a lawsuit for defamation petras jaw dropped are you serious yep dont argue with her just tell her youre calling to give her information im sure shes scared but being scared should make you smarter not stupider call from the landline on my desk the law requires you to tell her youre recording the conversation youll see a record button on the phone olympia will try to get under your skin dont let her petra moved toward my desk but slowly nervous about making the call i turned back to rivka whod been shocked into silence i helped your friend escape from the club last night i said which made her furious it was as if she wanted to sit there and take the beating why youre wrong rivka blazed you just hate her because she makes you look stupid i dont have the time or energy for histrionics this morning i said coldly if you know where the body artist lives if youve been there and shes vanished tell me or leave rivka started to storm out but at the door she changed her mind i dont know where she lives thats what i want you to find out and to make sure shes not in any danger do you know whos blocking her website what does blocking her website have to do with its why they were beating her up last night they need the codes rodney keeps painting on her what do you know about those nothing i keep telling her she shouldnt let them desecrate her art and she just laughs and says its all about making art accessible even to cretins so that america becomes an artfriendly country i could hear petra starting to lose her cool saying that since olympia had fired her she didnt have a right to dictate to petra what does vesta say i asked rivka she doesnt care she just says karens a big girl she knows how to land on her feet its all part of the jealousy and smallmindedness that surrounds karens art i need to know shes safe why cant you do that for me youre involved even if you didnt set the club on fire you have to do something i squeezed my eyes shut when i opened them rivka was still sitting there her small face swollen with worry and anger okay i said call vesta and the burka dancers you get them here this morning right now well all talk well figure out where to look for karen until then you sit here and keep your mouth shut because ive got a wheelbarrowful of work to do rivka wanted to argue the point but i told her i wasnt in the mood get your pals or go home no other choices petra had finished her call with olympia and came to me head hanging sorry vic you were right about olympia i did let her get under my skin not to worry it was a tough first assignment anyway the warshawski agency is famous for the crankiness of its operatives i want you to start on some of the backlog of paper until rivka gets the rest of her gang here i showed my cousin where the office essentials werethe bathroom and kitchenette at the end of the hall that i shared with my leasemateand the importance of cleaning up instantly since its shared space refreshments for clients or ourselves in the little fridge we have a goodquality coffeemaker and an electric kettle for tea but i still use the coffee bar across the street for espresso by the time wed finished and id shown petra how to send messages from my computer phone log to my cell phone vesta and the burka dancers had arrived the dancers were well swaddled in sweaters and coats one with a big fur hat pulled so far over his ears it covered his forehead i asked petra to get everyone set up in the client corner while i made one last effort to log on to embodiedartcom the site was still down this time the message announced were rethinking our site come back soon and thanks for visiting when i joined the group the two dancers were on the couch with vesta half sitting on one of its arms rivka had pulled up a straightbacked chair an armchair might make her seem relaxed and her business was too urgent for that petra was prim in the corner of the couch a notepad open in her lap i reminded the dancers that wed spoken backstage a few weeks ago theyd called each other kevin and lee then their full names were leander marvelle and kevin piuma kevin the feather what was on their birth certificates i wondered the dancers shed their coats but leander had a heavy sweaterjacket zipped up to his chin while kevin remained swathed in a long scarf even so i could see they were painfully thin cheekbones jutting mouths extrawide because there was too little flesh along the jawline how did you two hook up with karen i asked leander looked at kevin the hothouse no no thats where we found jerome he told us this chick was trying to put an act together and she was usually at fridas fridas was a club in the west loopnot far from plotzkys where id drunk with tim radke but part of the hip wave that was flooding the neighborhood see wed just come back from a road run of chorus line we needed a gig the body artist dug our act and it was kind of cool you know the disguised genderbending thing but its old now yeah said leander time to move on you cant rivka cried the body artist needs you kevin looked at her coldly she needs to update her act its old its stale shes only done it for six months how can you six months leander flung up his arms that is beyond stale its rotting right i said where does karen live kevins wide mouth gave an exaggerated grimace of contempt we werent dating the chick we worked with her on her act did you rehearse the act outside the club leander explained that one of his ballet teachers was on the faculty at columbia college and let him and piuma use one of the practice studios when they were in town if you want to call the body artist what number do you use email she didnt give us a number i looked at rivka what about you she bit her lips she wanted to claim some special inside knowledge of karen buckley but couldnt the body artist always phoned rivka but she blocked her own number vesta nodded agreement girlfriend liked her secrets vesta had met karen at the dojo where she trained she wanted to study selfdefense she took about four months of classes thats when we she didnt finish the sentence but i assumed from rivkas scowl that vesta meant when she and karen had been lovers what about olympia i asked how did all that get started the act at the club and so on karen goes to all the clubs vesta said she studies other peoples acts she had this thing she wanted to do with body art she pitched it to olympia who thought it was enough of a novelty to bring in a crowd nothing happened for a few months and then suddenly around thanksgiving the act took off why people realized they had the chance to see an extraordinary artist for free rivka said vesta said it was more that people took video footage with their cell phones and put it out on the net when did rodney start taking part i asked leander and kevin looked at each other again as if they could only think in tandem but it was leander who spoke rodneys the big thugly guy right wed been doing the act for about six weeks maybe two months at first it was all about karen painting on herself and wed hold mirrors for her but that was way too hard then she started this public art idea about a week after that rodney the rod man arrived raw sex not a nice man the last phrase hung in the air for a moment allowing us all to wonder if hed had raw sex with rodney or if that was just his way of describing a brutish person im assuming it was anton kystarnik who was at the club last night i said if hes not the person blocking her website who is and why the four of them looked at one another and then at petra obediently quiet in her corner of the couch none of them had any ideas rivka i asked do you have a picture of karen do any of you she hated being photographed except when she had her full body art on rivka said the one time i took her picture she grabbed my camera and erased it youre a good artist i said can you draw her from memory im going to need a picture if im going to canvas for her she wont like it if i do rivkas face was flushed theres no point to my asking around about her if i dont have a picture this is the last discussion well have on the subject either draw a picture of buckley for me or go home and dont bother me again rivka started another protest but vesta shook her head at her youre the only one who pulled the detective into this do like she saysput buckleys face onto a piece of paper or go on home deserted homeor whatever vesta and the dancers left while rivka was working on the body artists portrait whatever rivkas more tiresome qualities she was a skillful artist in less than an hour she put together a couple of sketches that captured the artists elusive quality working only in ink rivka showed the transparent expressionless eyes and the sternness around the mouth that kept people at a distance where are you going to search rivka asked maybe ill throw a dart at the map i pointed to a big map of the city that hangs in my main workroom they say if you pick stocks that way they perform as well or better than a financial advisers portfolio maybe it will lead me to the artist as well im staying with you no youre not not unless youve been lying and know where the woman is or what name she might be hiding behind rivka started to argue the point but i shut her up without finesse you want to find karen buckley but youre wasting my time which i bill at a hundred fifty dollars an hour her jaw dropped i dont have that kind of money then youd better get out of my way before i decide to start charging you hadnt you she scurried out the door so fast that petra burst out laughing but why arent you charging her my cousin asked when id made sure rivka had gone out the front door because i want to find the body artist myself and these pictures may help us where are you going to start at the club if vesta and rivka dont know where she hangs out no one at the club will either nope were going up to irving and the kennedy where karen abandoned that suv im going to assume she raced home picked up what she thought she needed to survive on the run and hopped on the l then you wont find her up there petra objected if we can discover where shes been living we may find the name of someone who knows her well enough to tell us where she might go next i explained she is a remarkably invisible person considering how much she exposes herself and considering how hard it is to hide your life in the age of the internet you make copies of these sketches while i get my maps out ive got those apps on my cell phone that guide you around the streets but i still prefer seeing the big picturehow many blocks did we have to cover and how long might it takealthough the apps would come in handy when we needed to find a bathroom the first challenge was to make sure no one was after us if anton was trying to find the body artist he could get rodney or one of his other minions to stake me out knowing i might be looking for her too i made petra pull a wool cap over her halo of hairit was far too recognizable her height i couldnt do much about we went by l changing trains and directions four times at lessused stops to make sure the same people werent getting on or off with us finally we picked up the ohare train and rode to irving park the l runs alongside the kennedy expressway here and traffic was heavy the irving park stop served ktown socalled because its a corridor where all the street names begin with k we would treat the search like all canvassing going doortodoor looking at the names on the buzzers if there were any seeing who was home showing a picture of karen seeing if anyone recognized her we started at the l ticket booth the woman in the booth shook her head over the two sketches the customers who stood out were the ones who complained or who chatted with the agent on duty i see so many people she apologized im real sorry youre having trouble finding your sis if i see her around here you want me to call you our story was that our sister was developmentally disabled and that shed wandered off shed last been seen here two nights ago and the police said that was too soon to file a missing person report so if anyone knew who was giving her shelter wed be grateful we gave the ticket agent petras cell phone number and moved on to the local laundries a deli a grocery store a coffee bar if karen lived up here she did so as invisibly as she did everything else the manager at the laundromat thought she recognized the picture but wasnt a hundred percent certain i even asked the homeless guys sleeping under the expressway that was the easy or at least less hard part when wed exhausted the public places we moved on to the grim business of going doortodoor i decided arbitrarily to limit the search to a halfmile radius around the l stop petra went east and i took the west stretch it was a long cold day by the time id covered karlov and kedvale id found two german shepherds five terriers three labs two rottweilers petra and i met briefly to warm up at one of the coffee shops near the l she wasnt as discouraged as i because it was her first real detecting job and also because she herself has the eager personality of a labrador the area was mostly a collection of houses and two or threeflats which at least meant we werent trying to get into the lobby of big apartment complexes even so we faced a lot of doorbells with no guarantee that we were even in the right neighborhood by midafternoon as snow began to fall again i was so tired and so numb that i almost overlooked the name on the bell it was a workmans cottage on the west side of kildare divided into a twoflat i was halfway down the walk before the secondfloor name registered with me f pindero f pindero when id been in the coffee shop in roehampton and the regulars had been talking about kystarniks daughter someone said steve pindero had been a good guy and it broke his heart when his frannie odd along with zina kystarnik id assumed frannie was dead too but maybe shed survived and resurrected herself as the body artist i called petra to tell her where i was and went back up the steps to ring the bell again a terrier number nine for the day began hurling itself at the groundfloor door but no humans answered either bell a curtain shifted in the house across the street i walked over and rang the bell a woman about my own age came to the door and opened it the length of a chain fortunately i hadnt worked the east side of kildare yet so i could switch my story from the developmentally disabled sister to one who was married to an abusive husband she thought she was safe here i said but he tracked her down somehow and she called me about two this morning really scared have you seen her today you mean the gal across the street if she acted as stuckup around her man as she does to the neighbors on the street no wonder he hit her i wanted to myself no woman deserves to be beaten surely you believe that have you seen her today i believe a womans duty is to make a good home for her man if she acts like a person who says hello to her on the street is dirt beneath her feet then maybe she earned a black eye or two are you always this warmhearted or does the cold weather bring out the best in you i can see how youre related youre just as stuckup as her i hope youve got a man like hers waiting for you at home she slammed the door in my face i walked back across the street seething so what if my story was fictitious to believe any woman deserved a beatingi serve on the board of a domestic violence shelter and it hurt to know there were women in the community who believed their battered sisters got what was coming to them my hands were shaking with anger and stiff with cold so by the time i worked the picklocks into the cylinders and got inside pinderos house petra had joined me i could feel the woman across the street watching if she called the cops idi broke the ugly thought off midsentence i was as bad as she was thinking of beating her up the terrier barked hysterically as petra and i climbed the stairs to the second floor the stairwell was dark but it was warm and out of the wind i leaned against the wall rubbing the circulation back into my fingers petra also seemed glad of the chance to catch her breath finally as i knelt to pick the lock on pinderos door i explained how id learned her name why would karen use a fake name petra asked i dont know but if she was zina kystarniks friend maybe she was scared anton would be after her for letting zina od i guess petra said doubtfully karen doesnt do drugs you know i mean she never acted like she was getting high and she didnt have stuff in her dressing room if she was frannie pindero she odd ten or fifteen years ago could have been her wakeup call to sobriety here hold my phone so the light shines on the lock lets see if weve found the body artist before we speculate too much it will be embarrassing if it turns this place belongs to felicity pindero a sober bookkeeper the door opened directly into a small square room it was impossible to see any details in the gray light coming through the window when i found a light switch a spartan industrial fixture with a single bulb gave some meager light the room was bare except for two large exercise balls a cold draft was blowing into the room from our left we followed it down a short corridor to the kitchen karen or frannie or maybe a burglar had hurled a brick through a window and climbed in over the kitchen sink glass and puddles of congealed blood covered the floor the brick had landed in the sink petra peered over my shoulder gosh looks like there was a bar fight in here the back door boasted an array of bolts and chains but it wasnt locked i walked out onto a narrow platform that served as a back porch stairs had been built onto the house when it was converted to a twoflat they were made of rough unfinished wood and probably didnt meet city code several large rorschachs of blood stained the ice on the porch and stairs but the snow now falling more furiously was covering the trail she left her keys in the dressing room finch said last night i told petra so she picked up a brickyou can see where theyre stacked by the back gatecame up these stairs came in through the kitchen window she had on her coat and her boots but she was probably so wound up she flailed around and cut herself theres blood in the sink besides whats on the floor and the stairs she parked in the alley came here to collect who knows what and fled again leaving the door unlocked because she didnt have her keys petra followed me back into the kitchen and solemnly inspected the sink where blood had pooled around jagged glass fragments i found a roll of aluminum foil and tore off enough wide pieces to cover the hole in the window in this weather the radiator would freeze and burst and why should p e loder who occupied the ground floor suffer we followed the blood to a bathroom which lay just beyond the kitchen karen or frannie or whoever had cleaned herself in the shower a damp towel and the bathmat were both stained reddish brown a giant jar of makeup remover and a bag of cotton balls stood on a glass shelf over the sink but i didnt see a toothbrush or a comb she had left a tube of shampoo and a bottle of liquid soap in the shower but no body lotion or moisturizer i began to look around for any evidence that pointed to who karen or frannie knew people she trusted enough that she might flee to them it was the barest dwelling id seen in a long time the kitchen held a table and a chair a coffeemaker and two cups and plates i looked in the cupboards and found a few odds and ends plastic salt and pepper shakers a freezertomicrowave dish but no food except a halfempty box of cereal the room with the exercise balls didnt hold anything else no furniture or boxes not even a philodendron on the windowsill in the front room which faced the street the windows were so heavily curtained that no outside light came in when id groped my way to a light switch i found myself facetoface with darkhaired woman in a navy coat petra gasped i reached for my gunand realized i was about to shoot my own reflection the walls were lined with mirrors vic this is totally creepy what does she do in here i waited for my heartbeat to steady before i answered i guess its the studio where she practices her art seeshes got a set of paints a set of stencils this looks like part of nadias memorial i held up a piece of the angels wing which had instructions on the colors she wanted to use she must carry her cameras to the club and back petra said she doesnt have a computer here either paints photographs palette knives and several slitter blades were tidily arranged on a plastic cart a black drop cloth in the middle of the floor had dried paint on it but the rest of the room was clean besides the cart the only thing in the room that might be considered as a kind of furnishing was a dvd player with a handful of discs scattered around it when i knelt to inspect them petra wandered into the bedroom a minute or so later she called out to me oh my god vic this is so amazing i scooped the discs into my bag and went in to join her like the rest of the apartment the bedroom was almost unfurnished a futon with the covers tidily arranged a narrow chest with three drawers and a bedside stand holding a clock and a book which was what had grabbed my cousins attention called remaking the female body the cover showed a naked anorectic woman with multiple piercings and even as i saw when i looked closer stabbings the material inside was just as disturbing ranging from hannah wilkes efforts to use her body as a canvas for responding to her cancer to lucia balinoff who slashed herself onstage along the way were women who used plastic surgery to add animal features to their faces or bodies women who pierced their lips and hung fetishes from them what kind of person would watch a woman cut herself open onstage petra asked no one i know i hope maybe the same person whod go to a dogfight or bearbaiting i handed the book back to her i have to confess it makes me queasy the slashing for sure petra said but the animal surgeryits like being free to decide about your own body how it looks i mean and how you want people to react do you know what its like to be me guys always saying hows the air up there and then they laugh like theyve made the funniest joke anyone ever heard and being blond its a burden but you carry it well i suggested see thats just it even you megafeminist youre laughing at me because im young and blond if i put one of these horns on my head people would think twice before they treated me like i have the brain of a twoyearold she flipped through the pages to a picture of a woman whod had something resembling a rhino horn grafted onto her forehead i squeezed her shoulder petra i apologize youre right if i promise to take you seriously will you promise not to mutilate your face itd be worth it just to see uncle sals expression you know or when daddy is on trial it could freak out the jury confuse them into acquitting him she bit her lip and looked determinedly through the book i dont see anything about karen in here but you know her stuff looks pretty tame compared to this petra was right it made me wonder about the slitter blades in the living room had karen decided she had to up the stakes in her act so she could grab more attention a woman with a hidden identity and a thirst for attention strange combo unstable combo shes gone dont you think i said to my cousin no toothbrush and although shes obsessionally tidy the drawers are open in hereshe snatched socks and underwear and whatever else she needed on the fly im guessing she took the discs she wanted and left the others thrown every which way and there isnt a piece of paper in the place if she owns a bank card or any document with a name or a picture on it shes taken them with her to where petra asked im hoping shell go to her father im going to drive up to roehampton after we get back to the office and see if i can find him all that blood you dont think she got shot do you i think it was from coming through the window she didnt have her jeans on when she left the clubmaybe she was too rattled to put them on before diving into the kitchen but well check with hospitals see if she might have gone in for an expert patchup i grinned at petra im so glad to have my highrise assistant to offload these tasks to youre going to have a fun afternoon on the phone we walked back to the l stop the snow wasnt heavy but we could see the traffic on the kennedy going about ten miles an hour petra wasnt the only one with a fun afternoon in front of her i was going to have a great time on the kennedy myself i dont get it petra said as we got on the train if frannie pindero knew anton kystarnik why didnt she say something last night when those guys were beating her up hard to say without talking to her the other big question is if kystarnik isnt blocking her website who is you any use as a hacker i asked my cousin sheesh vic im not a geek you can be a fashionista and still know how to hack i objected what about your friends or lovers did you completely waste your time in college she pulled a face youre the crime expert dont you know anyone tim radke i finally said he told me he was a systems something in the army but hasnt been able to find civilian work using his trainingright now hes installing consumer electronics i called his cell phone and asked if hed be interested in a freelance systems job something that might help prove chads innocence he was out in the western suburbs again today but he said he could make it to my office by eightthirty or so searching for an artist at my office i left petra with a list of five or six hundred chicagoarea hospitals and picked up my car for the drive to roehampton it was after five pm when i got to the little coffee bar id visited the previous week the couple behind the counter were cleaning their machines while a trio of women sat slumped at a table drinking coffee their clothes and general fatigue suggested they were maids warming themselves before their long bus ride home the two baristas were exhausted too but tried to pretend pleasure at seeing a customer i dont need anything i said and i wont keep you from locking up i was up here last week and a guy named clive was talking about steve pindero and his daughter frannie i need to find steve pindero if you dont know him maybe you can tell me how to reach clive the baristas looked at each other and slowly shook their heads i remember you the male barista said you were asking about melanie kystarnik we cant share information about our customers with you i shut my eyes and thought for a longish moment it was time to put some cards on the table everyone is tired and wants to go home after a hard days work i said including me my hard days work yesterday ended at three this morning after i fought a bunch of thugs who were beating up two women in a nightclub it began again four hours later with a call from a terrified teenager whose family is being harassed by these same thugs the three maids were looking alert someone elses troubles danger faced by a remote party good news all the way round the young man behind the counter kept rubbing a cloth over the steaming spout for the big cappuccino machine but he was paying attention the young woman had stopped rinsing milk pitchers my name is v i warshawski im a private investigator and im trying to find out who shot and killed a young woman outside a nightclub right after new years i took out the laminated copy of my license and the couple behind the bar gave it a cursory look oh my yes one of the maids said softly i read about that shooting it was some crazy vet wasnt it some poor boy who got his mind taken to bits fighting over there in iraq thats who the police arrested i agreed but i dont believe he killed nadia guaman i had never heard of steve pindero before i came in here the other day but either his daughter or someone using frannies name has been performing as karen buckley at the nightclub where nadia was murdered whoever she really is she vanished last night im hoping you can give me some ideas on how to trace frannie or maybe her dad i looked up steve pindero online but i couldnt find him listed anywhere the maids murmured among themselves and then the oldest of the trio said oh no miss you wouldnt find him he died years ago after his girl had the overdose and zina died it took the stuffing out of him he was a cabinetmaker see living over in highwood his wife died when frannie was a child and he loved that girl like he was her mother and father both francine her name was but they called her frannie see steve he used to take her with him in the summer when he was working on a job she was so cute tagging after him with her own little hard hat hard to remember now what a bright little girl she was after everything that happened later you knew her pretty well then i suggested not to say i knew her well but were a small community up here everybody knows everybody elses business and people talk i work for a family called gordon and a long time back maybe twenty years steve did a big job for them little miss frannie she used to stand on a ladder next to him handing him nails it was a pretty picture she sighed everything changed when the kystarniks bought that big old mansion they had a lot of work done rebuilding the stables putting in new bathrooms kitchens who knows what all but that was how the two girls got to know each other zina and frannie they were the same age same year in school see i never did know which was the one leading the other into trouble but by the time they was teenagers trouble was pretty near all they knew the kystarnik girl i heard she had two abortions before she was ever even sixteen and the drugs well these rich kids with too much money and not enough to do thats what they do and what i heard francine and zina were selling anyone pretty much anything lela one of the other maids protested you dont know that do you dont i just noel gordon was in school with zina and frannie and when those girls came over to party it wasnt pepsi let alone beer they had in their cute little pink makeup kits the two baristas had given up any pretense of work the man went to the door and put the closed sign up and then the girls odd i asked it was an ugly scene lela said zina died francine came close and the cops found all the stuff in steve pinderos basement why they didnt arrest frannie as she lay in her hospital bed ill never know but she recovered and steve oh my i guess he tried to convince the cops it was him that had bought the drugs but you didnt have to be sherlock holmes to figure out that steve didnt know word one about what francine was up to while he was trying to get himself arrested frannie took off no one ever saw her again steve took to drink and thats what killed him drinking on the job fell to his death two or three years after his girl disappeared we were all silent for a moment respecting the tragedy of the pindero story and then i asked whether young frannie had shown any gifts as an artist funny you should say that i forgot all about that part of her she could draw pretty much anything got the gift from her daddy i guess he was always drawing up these designs these plans for stuff he was building he was in high demand in all the big houses around here for what he could design and build would there be anyone frannie might seek refuge with an art teacher what about noel gordon lela shook her head id be surprised noel he straightened himself out after zina died went on to medical school works at some clinic in texas down on the mexican border where he treats poor immigrants i cant think frannie would know where to find him even and i dont know any family up here that wouldnt turn her right over to the authorities if she showed up it was my turn to sigh one dead end after another but you said you found her another maid ventured where has she been hiding all this time the times i talked to her i didnt know her real name she was calling herself karen buckley and now as i said shes disappeared i looked at the wall clock long night ahead with tim radke coming to look over the body artists computer thanks for talking to me so frankly i said im headed back to the city anyone need a lift the two baristas lived in waukegan to the north but the maids all lived in the city they crammed into the mustang a tight fit for the two in my small backseat but better than the three buses they told me they took to get from the far northern suburbs down to their homes on chicagos west side when i finally returned to my office petra was still there calling hospitals to see if anyone named karen buckley or frannie pindero had sought care for deep cuts i was so tired that i just shook my head when she asked me if id found steve pindero i went into my back room where my portable bed is my jeans and socks were wet from the snow i took them off and flung them on a radiator and collapsed on the bed i was on a freight train rocking along the tracks were badly scarred and the train kept bouncing jolting me from side to side vic wake up why cant you mr vishneskis on the phone it wasnt a train just my cousin shaking my shoulder i said he could leave a message with me but he wouldnt i staggered upright pulled on my jeans and padded out to my desk in my bare feet there was still an inch of cold cappuccino in the cup id bought this morning i swallowed it trying to clear the thickness of sleep out of my voice mr vishneski sorry to keep you waiting he was too intent on his story to care we have good news my boy came to for a minute hed been restless all night and the docs said that was a good sign and then he opened his eyes thats wonderful news i said did he seem to know you we couldnt tell his eyes werent focusing that great he said a couple of words then he passed out again what did the doctor say she says its a good sign and maybe hell make a full recovery but it could be days or a week before he really regains consciousness for good so we couldnt ask him any questions what did he say anything about the shooting or if someone came home from plotzkys bar with him he wants a vest mona and me we both agreed that that was what he was saying the nurse she heard it too but we dont feel like we want to leave the hospital right now so we thoughtwe hopedwe want you go to monas place and bring it here to the hospital for him a vest i said blankly what does it look like we dont know vishneski said neither mona nor me gave him one so were thinking one of his buddies or maybe a girlfriend if you find any vests bring them all over and well see which one he wants could be he left something in a pocket a goodluck charm or something i started to say id come to the hospital to collect keys but then i imagined the drive through snowpacked streets to the hospital parking waiting while someone fetched mona out of the icu and her haphazard search through her giant bag for her keys it would be easier for me to pick the lock but i didnt share that thought with the client before i left i went over petras work for the hour id been sleeping shed finished checking hospitals but no one who sounded like the body artist had come in to have cuts treated peewee its been a long day but i need you to stay here until i get back tim radke is coming to see if he can find out whos blocking the embodied art website hes probably not going to have a computer with him which means hell use mine theres too much confidential data on the mac proill want you to hover to see what files he looks at what should i tell him you want him to do the artist said her hosting service told her the site was being blocked from her computer but she claims not to know whos doing it i want to know if tim can verify that one way or another petra looked doubtful not wanting to be left in charge wont he need her computer i dont know if he does i think she left it at club gouge last night which means checking at the club if its open while you wait for him can you start viewing some of these discs i took away from frannie pinderos place i dont know what you might see on them but im curious about rodneys codes pay special attention if you find him in any of her videos i hesitated dont let anyone in except tim radke okay or the vishneskis if they show up for some reason you think were in danger i bunched up my mouth i dont know but if anyone gets hurt in the line of duty its me got that petra saluted yes maam i want it to be you too sand in the pocket on my way over to monas place i stopped at la llorona for tortillachicken soup which i ate at traffic lights between my bulky clothes and my sore hand i spilled a lot of it and got to monas building looking like a toddler whod just been introduced to solid food i dabbed at the spots with a tissue but gave up when i realized i was covering my coat with white pilling i definitely should join the slowfood movementthis eating on the run is as hard on the wardrobe as it is on the digestion parking on the north side is always a challenge and with the improvised territorial markers as well as the ridges of ice blocking access to curbs it was impossible i finally left the car in front of a hydrant and hoped the police had too much else on their minds to bother with ticketing side streets up on the fourth floor monas apartment looked much the same as it had on my first visit as i worked my picks into the padlock cumbrously because of my sore hand a door opened at the far end of the corridor i glanced down the hall and saw that it was the same unit where someone had peered out when i first came here with chads parents in the dim light i couldnt tell if it was a man or a woman hello i called can you come here and hold a flashlight on the lock for me the figure scuttled back into its own apartment i laughed softly but hoped they wouldnt feel compelled to call the cops the lock finally clicked loose and i went into monas vestibule i turned on all the lights a week had added a film of dust to the room making the destruction look more wanton and more permanent no wonder mona was staying with her exhusband the room was so cold so dreary that i found myself tiptoeing through it to the bedroom chads duffel bag was still on the floor with clothes spilling out of the top like beer foam over the brim of a glass when id been here before id given the bag only a cursory look now i pulled everything out laying each piece on the bed but i didnt see anything that resembled a vest i looked in monas closets and behind all the doors where people sometimes drape coats or bathrobes i found monas pink flannel bathrobe with a fuzzy rabbit stitched to one pocket and chads parka i searched the parka but discovered only chewing gum a business card from a tattoo parlor and half a bagel rockhard by now i went back into the bedroom to return chads clothes to his bag i ran my hand around the bottom to make sure i hadnt overlooked anything and felt sand i wondered if chad had brought back part of the iraqi desert as a souvenir i probably wouldnt have looked at it except i was frustrated by all the dead ends id run into recently i hunted around the apartment for a newspaper that i could empty it onto and finally found a roll of butcher paper in the kitchen i laid a sheet of it on the bed and carefully emptied the bag onto it the stuff looked like gray sand or maybe crushed gravel i stared at it for a long minute then folded the butcher paper into a tidy oblong i tucked the ends inside each other to keep the gravelly sand from spilling out and stuck the little bundle into my red leather bag i took the duffel into the bathroom to shake the last grains in the tub a black pocket fell out too perhaps it had been caught in the duffel bags seamsi hadnt felt it when i ran my hand through the interior the pocket was made of a thick black cloth about the size of an oven mitt there were a number of holes in the heavy fabric which went all the way through both sides i guess that was how the sand had leaked out i stuck my fingers inside the mitt and felt more sand inside this side faces out had been embossed on the outside although the holes partially obliterated the words a black oblong this was what chad had been holding out to nadia in the parking lot the night before she was murdered dont pretend you dont know what this is hed said but what was it i went back to monas kitchen for a clean plastic bag it was when i was putting the black mitt in the bag that i felt the image stamped into the fabric just below one of the holes i held the mitt under the light the design a kind of trefoil looked familiar and i frowned trying to remember where id seen it as i turned the mitt sideways to fit into the resealable bag i suddenly recognized the designthe pinkandgray scrolls nadia had painted on the body artist looked just like this the hair stood up on the back of my neck this was what connected nadia to chad but what was it when chad saw the scrolls he was sure that nadia was making fun of him i stared at the mitt in the plastic bag then pulled the butcher paper from my purse and put it in the bag with the mitt i looked around the apartment what else had i overlooked when i was here before i went through the garbage in the bathroom the bedroom and the kitchen but i only found a discarded razor blade a bunch of tissues and some fairly ripe banana skins if i had infinite resources id bag all the garbage and send it up to cheviot for analysis but the mitt seemed the one important item i finally left putting the hasp back in the padlock just as the elevator doors opened i decided i needed to be more thorough i went down the hall to see who had come out to watch me as nearly as i could tell it had been the third apartment on the left i knocked several times and finally a woman of eighty or so peered through a crack in the door im v i warshawski i flashed my id at her im a detective working on the vishneski case you seem like the only observant person on this floor have you seen people coming in and out of the vishneski apartment besides the family can i see that id of yours again missy how do i know its not a fake you dont of course i held it up to the crack in the door the state of illinois division of professional regulation had duly certified that i had completed all required training and was of good moral character i could be a licensed private detective the woman frowned from the card to my face and decided we were the same person even though it didnt have my picture on it i repeated my question the hall was so dimly lit i couldnt believe shed be able to identify anyone even if shed noticed them i havent seen anyone of course mona vishneski when she came home monday that was a shock for her to find her door broken in like that i dont know why the cops thought they had to do that when i heard the noise well it woke me upim sure it woke everyone up only you know what people are like dont get involved myob thats what gets people killed too much myob right i interrupted i could tell youre a concerned citizen what about the night before the police picked up chad when did he come home her mouth scrunched up in thought i couldnt sleep i was watching tv in the front room and heard them going down the hall him and his buddies he knew they made too much noise but he isnt careful about it that one time mr dorrit complained chad swore at him in an ugly way and it really did frighten us hes so big you know and hes a soldier if he shot us hed just tell the judge he was protecting america from terrorists and the judged let him go i started to wonder how reliable anything she said might be but she knew where she was heading see that night that night he shot that woman in the nightclub i heard them coming off the elevator and i just peeked you know turned out my light so they couldnt see me like i did this afternoon when you showed up and who was with chad not his usual friends these men they came out of an office not off the streets like the bums he usually brings home they were laughing slapping him on the back like they were encouraging him to get louder and i thought thats not very responsible of you even if you do work in an office instead of digging sewers theres mrs lacey with a new baby and mr dorrit he has cancer you got to be more considerate but then they went into mrs vishneskis place and i will say this the soundproofing in this building is good enough once he gets inside you dont really hear him carrying on when did the other men leave i asked i couldnt tell you that missy id gone to bed i was asleep i didnt hear them but mr dorrit he was out walking his dog hes got that little dachshund he said they took out mona vishneskis garbage with them put it in the dumpster out in the alley those other boys would never have done such a thoughtful thing no indeed i thanked the woman and backed away from her down the hall she was ready to keep talking all night she believed minding your own business got people killed and by gum she was going to keep her whole building safe by reporting every detail that she could when i was here last week i should have followed my first impulse to canvass the building damn it why hadnt i it was inexcusably sloppy detective work id assumed chad came home alone and even after the people at cheviot labs found roofies in his beer can i hadnt tried to see who might have doctored the beer while id been talking to the woman petra had been texting me tim r here dont no wht u want him do on my way i texted back i guessed she was nervous about being left in charge and didnt want to give him instructions on her own before i left though i knocked on mr dorrits door maybe i was doing too little too late but he might be able to describe chads companions the dachshund barked frenziedly hurling itself at the door after a moment i heard a slow step on the other side saw a ghastly eye magnified at the peephole and finally the sound of locks being turned back no solicitation in this building young lady ive never enjoyed the young lady greeting and as i age i like it less and less but i put on my best public face confident friendly no solicitation intended im a detective investigating chad vishneski i hear you saw the men who came home with him last week whered you hear that i jerked my head down the hall toward his neighbor mrs murdstone he sighed always minding everyone elses business but her own what did they look like how should i know i barely saw them i was just trying to keep woode here from going after them he bites strangers he had the dachshund in his arms but the dog was squirming wanting to get at me i tried to look even friendlier how many were there i asked two far as i could tell were they white chinese white i guess he said grudgingly after a moment tall short about average taller than you but not by much about chads age maybe some older more like your age i reckon what are you forty lucky guess in the dim light anything was possible you know how they always have some trick in the detective stories the guy limped he had a scar on his face he wore a ring with a celtic cross in it anything stand out for you a celtic cross i dont think oh i get it you mean did one of them have anything odd that would make you know him if you saw him again he was definitely going to the head of the class after this i nodded my warm empathic smile beginning to make my cheeks ache not so i could say he said real expensive clothesi thought that at the time you know soft overcoat not a parka like the rest of us put on that all he closed the door on woodes disappointed whinemy nose apparently had looked like a tasty snack dorrit was sliding the dead bolt home when he changed his mind and opened the door again one of them he had this gold pin it was like a military medal sort of like my vietnam service medal dont you see the guy didnt look like a soldier but i thought at the time that that was how they knew chad theyd been in iraq together thanks mr dorrit i stopped trying to grin and felt embarrassed instead he really did belong at the head of the class i thought it over as i got on the elevator expensive clothes military service medal maybe tim radke would know maybe one of them had been tim radke true he wasnt anywhere near forty but his pockmarked face made him look older especially in a bad light the building super was out front salting the walks again i asked him when garbage was picked up for the building tuesdays even if id talked to the old woman my first time here i would have been too late to look in the dumpster a very minor consolation i started to build a frame an outline of what had happened the night nadia was murdered two men came home with chad where had they picked him up outside plotzkys bar or had they been waiting for him to come home they took him upstairs they fed him doctored beer they put the baby glock in his flaccid hand when hed passed out and then theyd taken somethingthe vest chad wantedout to the garbage theyd waited until morning to call the cops maybe figuring that chad would be dead by then one of them wore an armed forces service medal but who were they while i waited at the long light on broadway i called lotty who was working late at her clinic your dr rafael worked a miracle with chad vishneski he came to and asked for his vest vic i have eleven people waiting to see me dont bother me with talk about clothes lotty before you hang up we shouldnt advertise the fact that hes recovering i dont want the states attorney to pronounce him fit enough to move to county jail id like to see him live until his trial date if we cant get them to vacate the arrest ill talk to eve about it lottys mind wasnt on my problem im backed up here for another two hours so if thats all lotty if he goes back to the prison hospital or to the jail itself he may be murdered with his death conveniently blamed on some gangbanger in the jail i think he was supposed to die of an overdose and its only because hes got some superhuman genes that hes still alive now we cant risk sending victoria i dont care why you think this it doesnt matter what matters is my intensive care unit i cannot have it turned into a war zone if someone may attack chad vishneski in my hospital then you must move him somewhere else too many other lives are at stake find out how movable he is if he doesnt need to be on a ventilator or whatever maybe i can park him with mr contreras with those dogs bounding around victoria you have no oh never mind i cant think about it now ill call eve rafael tomorrow well go over chads situation and get back to you a new recruit petras voice floated down the hall toward me when i opened my office door and then she shot one of them in the shoulder and another in the stomach meanwhile i was swimming across the riveri totally needed antibiotics after swallowing that waterhave you ever looked at it its like completely brown and green with weird stuff floating on it but anywayoh hi vic petra was beaming shed been a hostess at a country club during her summer vacations from college shed helped run a us senate campaign last year shed been olympias star server at club gouge she knew how to smother clients in youthful charm tim radke sitting upright in an office chair was blinking uneasily i held out a hand mr radke good of you to come out at the end of a long workday do you need coffee beer whisky i offered him drinks vic petra assured me he only wanted tea but we were like not a hundred percent sure what you wanted him to do he logged onto embodiedartcom and we got the message that the site was shut down i want to know if you can find out where the blocking originates i said but before we do that look at this and tell me if you know what it means i pulled the plastic bag out from under my sweater and held it out so that the black mitt with the logo was visible radke frowned at it it looks kind of familiar he said but i know petra had ducked down to stick her head over my shoulder thats the design that nadia was painting isnt it its got the same kind of curlicue at the ends i was impressed that petra spotted it so quickly but said to radke i found this in chads kit is it something he could have brought back from iraq radke turned over the plastic bag more granules trickled out of the mitt you know this thing this looks like the shields they give gunners for their body armor we all wore armor if we went outside the green zone but infantry gunners highrisk guys they had these extra things that supposedly stopped most bullets i never saw an empty one before thats why i couldnt tell what it was at first he went over to my desk and typed a few lines into the computer when i went to look he had pulled up a page about body armor with a photograph of something that looked like a life jacket see this he pointed at a dark line armpithigh in the picture its a slit in the armorthats where you stick these slabs in theyre heavy which is why we dont like to wear emreally you can keep these vests on only a couple of hours before youve sweated so much you could pass out they fill the mitts with what sand gravel it looks kind of like sand but really its some kind of fancypants stuff they invented for body armor tiny particles but superstrong when theyre packed together the israelis thought of them first i think thats what they told us radke started to open the plastic bag but i pulled it away i want to get it analyzed and theres already a fair number of other contaminants in it from lying in the bottom of chads duffel why would he have cut holes into it radke shrugged guys do weird things when theyre bored or stressed i saw this one guy he got burned and he started picking at his skin and the next thing you know hes pulled all the skin off his forearm oh gross petras mouth cocked open in disgust why didnt you stop him he was out of his head in pain kept holding his rifle on us when we tried to get near him the chaplain finally talked him down but it was bad man so if chad was coming unstuck he couldve started cutting up his own armor couldve been testing the odds after he lost his squad survivor guilt it made a certain sense better that than pulling all the skin off your own forearm i just learned that a couple of older guys in suits were with chad on friday night the night nadia died who could they have been tim shrugged again like i told you i dont know vishneski that well he grew up here he could know a ton of guys i never met maybe they were friends of his moms he was crashing at her place after all true enough but one of them had on an army medal a service medal something like that do you know all of chads army friends radke gave a helpless gesture i dont know the five of us who were in counseling together at the va were the ones who hung out went to bars or hawks games or whatever but maybe they were from that college he went to over in michigan you know if they stopped in chicago to see him he wouldnt necessarily mention it to us the difference between cats and dogsif two women had spent two or three nights a week together for four months theyd know each others family histories for four generations back not to mention their taste in everything from linebackers to lingerie how about the computer problem you actually came over to solve i asked think you can find out what computer the command to shut down the site came from i can try radke said but im no computer genius just a guy who fiddles around with them some do you have the password for the site uh no i have nothing for the site radke made a face i cant climb mount rushmore without a rope you know my stomach sank everything was just too damned hard right now does that mean you cant do it i said i can download some software but its pricey or let me talk to the person who owns the site you know herits the body artist from club gouge and shes skipped i explained what had happened the previous night so is it worth going down to the club on the chance her machine is still there anyone could have walked off with it including the body artist herself but the point is she says someone took over the system from her and changed the password i dont know why she would lie about that but even if she did would we be able to get the password from her machine radke fiddled with a pencil thinking it over do you know what her isp is he asked the website is run through wordpress i said but i dont know who the service provider is thats what we could get from her computer easier than by me trying to hack and if i had the isp then i could maybe start figuring out whos controlling the site right now so once more into the breach and all that i tried to sound jaunty about going back into the biting air my earlier nap had given me a brief second wind but it was rapidly dying down petra you want to call it a day are you kidding my cousin let out a gust of laughter this is the fun part where you show me how you pick locks and everything youthful high spirits i murmured to radke we were putting on parkas and lacing up boots when john vishneski called from the hospital to see if id found chads vest i didnt see any vests just a pile of i broke off midsentence his body armor chad thought of it as a vest mr vishneski i think chad may have meant his body armor it looks as though someone took that along with his computer and his cell phone the night nadia guaman was killed the guys who left him to die in monas bed dumped something in the garbage behind her building i cant prove it was the armor but thats my best guess right now chad apparently cut into one of the supplemental shields i found the pouch and some of the special filler in the bottom of his duffel bag why would anyone throw out his vest vishneski demanded no idea chad might have cut into the shield out of anger or frustration at losing his unit but im wondering if he sewed something valuable into it when he was overseas and cut it open when he like what vishneski asked again demanding i dont know something smalla microchip a diamond in case its still in the armor cover maybe stuck inside to the fabric or lost in the sand or nanochips or whatever this filler is im going to take it up to the forensic lab i use and get them to go over it with one of their scanners in the meantime if chad wakes up and asks again for his vest tell him its in a vault that it will be safe until he gets home if its weighing on his mind we dont want him worrying about it i paused then added it would be best not to spread the word that chad seems to be improving whoever framed chad for nadia guamans murder we dont want them getting another shot at him vishneski gave a bark of laughter i dont know why im acting so surprised we hired you mona and me because we didnt believe our boy couldve shot that gal its justyoure making it sound like hes in the middle of some bigass conspiracy and chad he doesnt know any secrets are you sure about all this its guesswork i said but if well if someone came after him again while we were trying to prove my guesses that would be a very bad way to prove me right just to be on the safe side id like to get some bodyguards in place at the icu itll require cooperation from the medical staff and im not sure how willing theyll be but there are a couple of guys i use when i need muscle very reliable ive got friends vishneski interrupted constructions slow and i know plenty of guys whod be glad to look after my boy you should clear it with the head of the icu shell be more sympathetic if it comes from you than from me but id suggest instead of saying youre bringing in a bodyguard that you tell her you want a friend with chad at all hours in case he wakes up when youre not around ill talk to her but man i wish you knew what was going on this is so frustrating you not knowing if my boys in danger or not or who from how could he survive iraq and get caught in some conspiracy here at home do you think its alqaeda stalking an american soldier out of revenge i dont think arabs were with your son the night he was drugged mona vishneskis nosy neighbor would have noticed arabs and if alqaeda was at work here the justice department or homeland security would be tripping over me in this investigation does chad know any older guys who served in desert storm maybe or even vietnam god i dont know maybe he met some guys at the va but he never said anything about them to me i looked across the room at tim radke and petra and remembered that chunks of chads blog had been blocked or deleted ive got to go mr vishneski but if you were going to guess at a password your son might have used on his blog what would it be password what are you talking about now some way to try to get at his missing posts do you have a hunch about a password for him vishneski thought a moment then said probably hed have the number in it on account of hes a big brian urlacher fan maybe something about the black hawks id try those night work we drove down to club gouge in petras pathfinder tim in the front seat with my cousin me drowsing in the back id collected my picklocks from my cars glove compartment and locked my handbag with chads black armor mitt in my trunk i planned to drive straight to the cheviot labs in the morning so is this like your first breakin petra asked tim its myi dont knowdo i count the time you broke into my apartment when i forgot my keys vic she looked over her shoulder at me as she spoke and the pathfinder fishtailed keep your eyes on the road i squawked i dont want it to be my last petra managed to straighten out narrowly avoiding a collision with an oncoming bus do you two gals think because i was a soldier im some sort of outlaw tim radke asked i mean vic here thinks im a hacker and you you think im a breakin artist im the outlaw in this party i said just as petra started to say oh gosh me and my motormouth unless you have skills youre keeping to yourself im the one who can pick a padlock in thirty seconds using the lip of a sardine can petra darling petra put your damned phone away or let tim or me drive okay gosh vic i was just tim took the phone from her i didnt survive five years in iraq to die in a chicago car crash okay okay you two bullies petra said ill get back at you see if i dont without seeing her face i knew she was giving her exaggerated pout the look she assumed when she knew shed been caught in the wrong we were taking her car because neither my mustang nor tims old truck handled well on these slushfilled streets but i was beginning to realize that a good car isnt as important as a focused driver when we got to club gouge i had petra drive slowly past so i could see if olympia had any security in place the fire had been confined to the interior so no boarding alerted you to the damage only the empty parking lot told passersby the club was closed that and a message in the box by the front door used to announce upcoming acts tonight it read club gouge is closed for repairs stay tuned for our grand reopening next week which was clever because no matter when the repairs were complete the grand reopening would always be next week no one seemed to be watching the club either from the alley or the l platform i told petra to park up the street and stay in the car with tim while i worked the lock if i holler take off and leave me on my own tim got out of the car with me i learned a thing or two about keeping a lookout when i was in the army if youre going to become an outlaw to help chad at least i can keep watch petra decided that meant she should join us as well she thought she needed to skulk lurking behind l girders then dashing across the open spaces between them it was radke who told her she was attracting attention act normal he told her act like youve got a right to be here its the only way to be if a patrola cop i meanrides by a keypad worked the front lock but petra had never been given the combo the side door which opened onto the parking lot had a keyhole that sat flat against the panel it was tricky but not impossible although my sore palm enhanced the challenge while i worked the lock tim disappeared into the shadows behind us i trusted him of course i trusted him even if he had a combat medal he didnt own expensive clotheshe wore a faded army parka not a soft overcoat still i was relieved when the tongue of the lock slipped back and he reappeared a shadow sliding up to the door while i held the tongue flat he slid a metal strip along the edge of the door and pried it open when i tried to turn on the hall lights nothing happened the building was bitterly cold olympia or perhaps the city had shut off the power to lessen the risk of the fire restartingor maybe to save money until reconstruction started as we moved deeper into the dark building the acrid stench of charring began to choke us charred and frozen at the same time what a gruesome end i pulled my muffler over my nose and mouth i didnt want to think about what poisons the fire had releasedthe synthetic fabric in the curtains the varnish on the stage floor the polymers in the wire casingsall no doubt grade a carcinogens when they burn i imagined my lungs coated with some kind of black grease that would never go away not all the perfumes of arabia i muttered say what vic petra demanded i hadnt realized id spoken aloud bad sign i shone my flashlight up and down the corridor the shadows made ghastly shapesthe wires looked like the tentacles of a giant praying mantis i shuddered but moved forward even petra was subdued clutching tims arm as we edged our way to the back of the stage the body artists computer was still there still attached to the webcams and the plasma screens i held the flashlight while tim unplugged the connectors we were out of the club and back in petras pathfinder within ten minutes petra turned north onto ashland moving at a fast clip talking in disjoint sentences the adrenaline rush made her higher than a fistful of speed stop tim shouted im just saying he grabbed the wheel from her and shoved his foot on the brake we stopped inches from a green suv that was blocking the intersection at carroll i twisted to look behind us and saw a mercedes sedan pull up as i looked rodney began to work his bulky figure out of the cars passenger side on three you two get out and run as fast and far as you can im getting into the front seat no argument just go my gun was in my left hand as i spoke and tim was already opening his door on my count he jumped from the passenger seat while i slid out of the backseat petra sat frozen in the drivers seat i yanked her door open tim ran around the back of the pathfinder and pulled her out men were climbing out of the suv and heading toward us i fired over their heads and tim and petra took off down a side street away from us someone shot back at me but i was crouching behind the pathfinders open door i climbed into drivers seat put the car into gear twisted the wheel and floored the accelerator the wheels spun on ice then grabbed i crashed into the green suvs left headlight the impact knocked me against the steering wheel but i backed up gears whining someone was firing at my windshield the glass splintered i bore down on the shooter and he fell backwards away from my mad driving i wrenched the wheel around again and managed a uturn away from the shooter and toward rodney and his mercedes sedan i slithered around him but just as i thought i was home free he shot out the pathfinders rear tires i bumped down the road on rims in the rearview mirror i saw him get back into the mercedes and come after me oncoming traffic honked at me or at the sedan blocking the right lane but no one stopped to see what was going on too much myob just like mrs murdstone had said this afternoon i jumped from the car at lake and sprinted toward the l steps id almost made it when a figure in black outran me and pulled me down i rolled over and away got in a crouch gun out but someone else came from behind and hit me on the side of the head send in the marines i never really lost consciousness someone pinned my arms behind me i tried to fight free but i was woozy moving slowly a dream figure another someone stuck his hands inside my sweater feeling my skin i kicked backward connected with a boot not a leg and the groping hand pinched me hard then flung me to the ground i twisted to the side trying to scrabble away where is it rodney treffer was looming over me in the dark his breath stank of too many beers what i kicked at his kneecap i was sluggish and he moved away easily kicking me in the stomach as he came back at me dont get cute with me girlie i know you have it someone came up and seized my feet called to another thug two or three others were in the background i couldnt see rodney bent close to my head grabbed my hair where is it the body artists computer i couldnt remember if it had still been in the front seat when i got into the pathfinder aids you mean i said swine flu is that what you think i have he let go of my hair and punched at my face but i moved my head in time and he hit my coat shoulder good job vi not dead yet we know you took it bitch where is it he kicked me in the stomach and i threw up the hold on my feet eased and i bucked and twisted away from rodneys oncoming boot he lost his footing slipped in my vomit fell hard head bouncing against the ice i rolled over to the l steps clutched the rail and tried to hoist myself upright the thugs grabbed me before i could get to my feet i dropped to the stairs and kicked out hard with my right leg smacking one in the midriff his motorcycle jacket took most of the impact but he couldnt punch without exposing his stomach to another kick his companion tried to circle around me from the other side but the stairwell kept him at bay i prayed for a train your kneecaps a cold voice spoke from behind my attackers my gun is trained on them get up come with me or forget about ever walking again it was the rumblyvoiced man whod been in command at club gouge last night i got up ludwig konstantin bring her to me the two grabbed me and shoved me toward the voice the gun barrel looked cold and gray under the thin light of the streetlamp the man holding it was tall with a fur hat adding another few inches when he smiled at me the streetlamp glinted on his gold teeth the roar of an oncoming train drowned whatever he started to say he gestured with his head and the men holding me shoved me forward into the backseat of the mercedes sedan they sat on either side of me pinning me to the seat while the commander got into the front next to the driver nobody paid any attention to rodney who was still lying on the sidewalk near the stairs tell me where you are hiding it the rumblers voice filled the car i shook my head its anton kystarnik isnt it if i knew what you were looking for it would be easier for me to tell you where it was dont play games with me warshawska i can make you talk the softness of his voice was more frightening than rodneys loud shouts im sure you can torture can make anyone talk it just cant make you tell the truth about stuff you never heard of maybe it can help you remember though i didnt say anything a thirddegree street fighter id been flattering myself the train pulled in and four people climbed down the l stairs i looked at them helplessly through the mercedes smoky windows they stepped around rodneyi suppose he looked like a drunk they couldnt bear to touch lying there in my vomit and all what were you doing at olympias club tonight anton asked looking for the body artist karen buckley you know her shes disappeared anton laughed an ugly sound dont worry yourself about little karen she knows how to look after herself first and last dont imagine her as the scared little girl she pretends to be yes i said i know you and she go way back back to when zina was still alive why did she change her name she was thinking she could hide from me but no one is that smart or that lucky when i want to find them they get found so you know where she is now i dont care where she is now what about her website you dont care about that anymore anton laughed again this time more loudly almost like an operatic stage laugh i fixed that problem now you are my new problem why are you caring about these people in the warmth of the car i was starting to feel the place in my abdomen where rodney had kicked me which people i tried to sound alert but i could tell that my voice was thick with fatigue i tried to imagine how anton would react if i simply fell asleep he wouldnt like it i decided these stupid mexican girls who get themselves killed in iraq in chicago konstantin and ludwig were watching anton and anton had his back to the street i didnt tell them someone hiding behind the l stairs was stretching an arm out to dig into rodneys pockets get themselves killed is that like getting yourself pregnant all alone with a turkey baster in the basement they stand in front of someone like you whos holding a gun and say shoot me anton thought that was funny these girls are behaving like that shoot me blow me up maybe they should all wear signs put that message on them now you will tell me where you are hiding the papers the figure had disappeared from the l stairs through the mercedes whisperproof windows i could just hear another train roaring in and then a loud report right below us a second shot sounded the driver floored the accelerator but halfway down the block the sedan spun to the right and slammed into an l girder an oncoming car honked furiously and swerved out of the way konstantin or maybe ludwig opened his door i put everything i had into my right shoulder shoved against him hard enough to knock him out of the car i rolled over on the seat and followed him three people were pounding toward us up the middle of lake street i got to my feet and swung my arms wildly behind me i could hear the front door of the mercedes open vic vic is that you my cousins voice highpitched terrified more welcome than an angel just then i shouted to her to get out of the road to get out of the way anton has a gun they all have guns get down i was ducking behind a parked car as i shouted a door opened in a building behind me a couple of men in waiters aprons came outside to smoke i yelled at my cousin that i was going into the building a moment later petra arrived with tim radke and another man one i didnt recognize all three were out of breath inside a jazz combo was playing an old coltrane piece or sawing at it in the dim reddish light of the room i saw that only half the tables were occupied and that no one was paying much attention to the music a young man came up to us and asked if we wanted a table theres a tendollar cover whether you sit down or not he said when we shook our heads i stuck a hand into my pocket fishing for my wallet my gun was there the thugs hadnt patted me down that was how ineffectual id looked to them i found the wallet and took out two twenties then cracked open the door the mercedes was listing toward its right side both tires completely flat as i watched antons driver flagged down a passing cab he held the door open for anton and climbed in next to him konstantin and ludwig started to get into the front seat but apparently kystarnik didnt want them alongthey shut the door and darted looks at the club wed entered uh you guys want to sit or what the manager asked us i flashed a smile or at least tried to were looking for club gouge we wanted to see this body artist everybody talks about oh they burned down last night but we have a good act coming on in half an hour a standup comic take a seat youll see his heart wasnt in the spiel i watched konstantin and ludwig kneel behind parked cars as i opened the door all the way konstantin ludwig were in here come on the acts going to start in half an hour when they didnt stand up i shouted come on guys no games tonightits too darned cold the two smokers outside the door looked from me to the two thugs the manager hovered nervously behind me if youre drunk maybe you should come back another night youre kind of making too much noise youre so right i said petra just hold the door here while tim and your friend and i go tell those two bozos to head for home if anything happens well dial the three of us ran across the street antons men got to their feet guns drawn but tim hurled himself at one mans knees knocking him into the path of an oncoming car the driver slammed on his brakes stopping inches from the thugs head i pressed my own gun against the base of the other mans skull drop your gun now the driver of the car had rolled down his window and was yelling at tim my thug thought about turning around to slug me but i had my left leg outside his and slammed him behind the ear with my left hand it wasnt hard enough to knock him out but it dazed him and he dropped his weapon my anonymous teammate scooped up the gun and put our guy in a choke hold i hurried to the car and bent down to talk to the driver im so sorry i said our friend is drunk we were trying to get him to come with us to the l and he tried to fight us off you okay no im not okay if id hit him it would have been your fault youre absolutely right well get him out of here right now the thug in the street was groaning but getting to his feet they attacked me he said blearily to the driver thats right ludwig we attacked you thats right thats what well tell your wife when we get you home upsydaisy now tim get him back on his feet and out of the street before someone really gets hurt petra hurried out to join us guys the manager hes like calling the cops what are we going to do im parked just over there on lake street our new helper said can we get these lowlifes that far marty well cover them tim said you go get your truck if thats okay with vic here doubletime marty sprinted down the street the manager and the waiters were crowding the sidewalk outside the club entrance tim had taken over the choke hold on martys thug the guy whod been knocked into the street was too dazed to fight but i kept my gun on him anyway petras teeth were chattering and she kept up a flow of nervous worried commentary where is he doesnt he know we have to get out of here what will we do if the cops get here first say your prayers sweetheart i finally said to her a battered pickup bounced to a stop next to us marty got down and helped tim and me shove our captives into the backseat tim and i joined them leaving the front seat to marty and petra i leaned back in my corner as marty pulled away from the club wed reached the intersection of racine before blue strobes swept up the street to the club a trip southalas not to sunshine now what petra said the backseat hadnt been designed for four none of us could maneuver well and i wasnt happy at the possibilities this gave the thugs when they regained their equilibrium i told marty to pull over and let me put petra into a taxi home if we had more violence tonight or the police caught up with us i didnt want her involved anyway we were just a few blocks from the heart of the restaurant scene where taxis were plentiful my abdomen was so sore that it was painful to climb down from the pickup and hard to walk but i made it to the curb flagged a cab got my cousin tucked away i gave her a twenty and told her to get home to bed to call me in the morning before she tried to go to the office i climbed into the front seat next to marty who are you by the way and how did you guys show up like that marty jepson tim said for him he was a marine staff sergeant in iraq hes one of the gang who chad and me met at the va i texted marty as soon as petra and me left you and he was at plotzkys so he hustled over to help out bless you staff sergeant was that you who shot out the mercedes tires yes maam tim here thought the guy who was passed out back there by the l might have a gun so i crawled over and found it and shot into the rimsfastest way to deflate tires what do you want me to do with these bastards pardon my french i dont know id like to drive them down to thirtyfifth and michigan give them to detective finchley see what he can pin on them they must have records for extortion or murder or something the men began spewing invectives curses in two languages if their english was any guide they didnt think much of me in ukrainian either on the other hand i said if we learned a couple of things from them like why they thought i had a piece of interesting property and why anton kystarnik is interested in whatever it is we might let them go off into the night we cant interrogate them here tim objected there are people all over the place besides the cops might find us where do you want to go maam jepson asked i thought of mexico citysunshine sleepbut i told him to head toward south chicago the povertystricken corner of the southeast side where i grew up we can talk on the way i turned painfully in the seat to look at the captives in the back which one of you is ludwig i asked bitch we dont tell you nothing want me to hit them tim asked they have a few punches coming judging from how they were roughing you up it doesnt really matter i said we know what they arecreeps who work for anton kystarnikand we know their names are ludwig and konstantin now which one of you is which they stared at me sullen silent okay i said just so we can call you something you by the window youre konstantin and your pal is ludwig we can find you easily enough if we need you again go on over to lake shore drive marty and head south a cell phone rang in ludwigs pocket and he reached for it tim knocked his hand away and we listened to the phone ringing konstantins phone started next a sound like a buzz saw what does anton think i have i asked over the ringing we tell you nothing you or your boy toys you driedup cougar a driedup cougar is that a step up from a bitch or a step down i wondered anyway so far you and your pal are oh for nothing so let me explain where were going we had reached lake shore drive and were heading south passing the enormous exhibition halls that made up mccormick place you know those highrise projects the citys been tearing down they were home to oldline gangs like the vice lords the citys relocated a lot of the residents to south chicago and the gangs who are coming in have unsettled all the power relationships on the southeast side its not a good place for strangers especially white strangers to wander around after dark all the time i was talking both their cell phones kept sounding i wondered if anton was trying to reach them trying to find out if theyd killed me when we get to ninetyfirst street i said take a right well drop these creeps off at houstonthats where i grew up ludwig and konstantin can see who will drive them north again maybe they can flash a bankroll and hire a ride but maybe that wouldnt be so smart because a bankroll we dont know that was ludwig rodney he calls us texts us tells us we are looking for you someone is tracking your gps in your phone they shut up konstantin cried i pulled my cell phone from my pocket and removed the battery wed reached the north end of hyde park the toney neighborhood around the university of chicago where barack obama has his home if someone was tracking my gps with any luck they wouldnt have a tail in place already tim i said just in case anton cares enough about these two to track them pull out their cell phones and remove the batteries i covered the pair with my gun while tim carefully stuck an arm across each man and found their phones we were riding close to the lake now close enough to see the desolate icecovered surface stretch to the horizon under the pale starlight you guys were at the nightclub last night i said what did anton kystarnik hear me say or where did he see me go that has him so interested in me we not knowing the talkative thug said we following orders only order followersthe lowest of the low i turned around to face front lets get this pond scum down to south chicago and go home ive had it i can pull over maam staff sergeant jepson said tim and me we can beat the truth out of them i thought of antons threat to me that he could torture me into talking you can beat them into saying something i said but who knows if it will be the truth lets just drop them in the middle of latin kings turf let them get home as best they can i switched on the radio and stumbled on nina simone covering strange fruit her voice pausing on the beat cracking brought a heartwrenching vividness to the lyrics outside the trucks dirty windows the lake had disappeared the expressway had ended we were on city streets we passed shabby houses and boardedover apartment buildings the ominous empty lots of a neighborhood that had gone past decay into ruin jepson hit a hidden pothole and we bounced so hard that i couldnt hold back a cry of pain as my abdomen shook in the backseat our duo conferred in ukrainian finally konstantin said his voice sullen we telling what we are knowing here is fruit for the crows to pluck nina simone was singing and what are you knowing i asked about the body artist or why anton doesnt care about her website anymore or about what he thinks i have anton he says you have special papers but we not knowing what they are we knowing only about body artist jepson kept driving following route as it twisted past the weedfilled land where us steel used to operate i turned off the radio so tell me about the body artist everyone is paying attention to anton the police the fbi everyone anton cant move we cant move without the police the fbi the secret service moving with us how did he manage it tonight i asked oh theres always a way with owen he pronounced it oven we switch carsback forth back forthuntil we know were clear but anton knows they are also watching computer email telephone so he talks to rodney and rodney paints antons words on the body artist and then all our friends overseas can read antons wishes it took konstantin a few minutes to explain the system and he wasnt clear on all the terminology he was one of antons pit bulls not part of the decisionmaking inner circle so he could only repeat what hed overheard when hed been bodyguarding anton and rodney basically it seemed that rodney had been using the body artist to signal antons offshore moneylaundering partners the letters rodney painted stood for countrieslichtenstein cayman sometimes belizewherever anton kept accounts he opened and closed them frequently trying to stay a few steps ahead of the secret service from what ludwig could recount it sounded as though one string of the numbers painted by rodney stood for banking sort codes the other string probably represented the password for a given account simple easy for anyone to pick up on the world wide web and hard to prove what it was or that anton was masterminding it so then that stupid bitch she is shutting her site and anton is crazy team members are calling from switzerland from the caymans from the middle east theyre saying the accounts are in a mess all because of her and you we saw you helping her leave the club if you saw that then you saw her knock me away and tear off into the night i have no idea where she is maybe konstantin said maybe not only suddenly tonight anton he calls us saying the website isnt important now only you and the papers you are stealing these we need to get back they had no more idea what papers anton was hunting than i did i asked them a dozen different ways but they were thugs not thinkers anton talked in front of them but not about what he was looking for if it was karen buckleys computer they wanted i wondered why they hadnt taken it last night when they attacked the club but of course the cops had arrived it hadnt been possible maybe anton had headed to the boardedup club tonight maybe they got there just as we were leaving and followed us but a computer wasnt paper and anton had very specifically been looking for papers i was too tired to think clearly i told marty to turn around drop the thugs near mccormick place and get the rest of us home for the night checkup by lotty ordered by contreras i slept around the clock that night waking up around eleven with my abdomen so sore that i cried out when i tried to get out of bed i gave up the effort and lay listening to the wind whip against the windows it didnt seem as though spring would ever come or that i would ever care enough about anythingclients baseball food sexto want to get up again i wondered what anton kystarnik had said when his team reported in miserable losers hed cried in ukrainian when they finally made their way back to his office i will whip you all and send you to bed without supper or would his response have been vengeful she has insulted me by embarrassing you bring me v i warshawskis head on a platter staff sergeant jepson had dropped the two thugs at thirtyfirst street a mile south of mccormick place if they couldnt find a cab it was only a mile or so to printers row the yuppie haven south of the loop konstantin protested when tim radke yanked them from the backseat but i told them i was doing them a favor youre getting soft because you only attack helpless targets if any muggers are foolish enough to be out on such a bitter night theyll help you polish your streetfighting skills when we were moving again i asked jepson to take me to my office so i could pick up my car in his polite marine voice he told me i was in no condition to drive tonight maam he and tim would take me home if i would give him the address after that i dozed my way up to racine and belmont when the vets woke me in front of my building tim said hed get some work done on the body artists website on his lunch break the next day you have the computer i was amazed that hed remembered it in the middle of our street fight i took it with me when petra and i jumped ship its under jepsons front seat he and the staff sergeant helped me up the walk to my building they made me feel old and frail supporting my arms i wasnt a driedup cougar i was just dried up while i found my keys and unlocked the outer door tim asked this business tonight anything to do with chad vishneski its got something to do with it i just dont know what i remembered the mitt and sand in the trunk of my car ive got to get that out tooive got to keep it safe if thats what rodney was looking for and he wakes up remembering that he didnt get it his master may think to look in my car well take care of it maam if you give us your car keys jepson said tell me what you want me to do with it drive it up to cheviot labs in northbrook take it to sanford rieff i want the mitt and the contents and chads duffel bag searched foranything that may be in it and i want a priority turnaround which means paying a fifty percent premium if you have time in the morning i would be grateful if you took care of it nothing but time maam jepson said im job hunting these days the dogs had been whining behind mr contrerass front door while we talked the old man opened the door and the dogs ran to me barking eager questions where had i been what had i been doing was i all right could they trust these strangers they seemed to ask it was only as i extricated myself and the vets from their onslaught that i saw petra had followed my neighbor into the hall shed needed petting pulling together and no one could do that better than her uncle sal when petra saw me she burst into tears ive been calling you and calling you she said when you didnt answer i thought you were dead told you she had a hundred and nine lives my neighbor said but he did come over to inspect me and my escort why do you need to keep sticking your neck out just so peewee and i can break our hearts i hugged him feeling his unshaven chin against my face im as burned out as last years firecrackers these are the heroes of the evening a couple of iraq vets tim radke marty jepson guys mr contreras fought at anzio gave him a taste for grappa which im sure hell be glad to share with you before i left him and the young people with the dogs and the grappa i asked petra about her pathfinder as far as she knew it was still in the middle of the street where id abandoned it tim marty can you pull it to the curb if its still there when you go back to get tims car well deal with towing and repairs when we have more time marty solemnly promised i could count on him maam with that comforting thought i staggered up the stairs to bed i undressed only because i know that if you sleep in a bra you wake up uncomfortable i didnt even take time to pull on a nightshirt before falling deep into sleep the next day when id finally forced myself out of bed i called terry finchley at the central district he wasnt available so i told the receptionist that my business concerned club gouge after a longish wait officer milkova came to the phone when she said that detective finchley had warned her i might call about the vishneskiguaman case i remembered her shed been one of the officers whod responded the night nadia guaman was killed do you have any new information on the murder maam i was starting to feel embalmed the way everyone under thirty was calling me maam a lowlife named rodney treffer passed out on lake street last night near the ashland l stop hes been beating up people around club gouge he and a team of creeps broke into the club two nights ago and attacked the owner last night he attacked me can you find out if hes in custody or in a hospital someplace i cant give you confidential information about any citizen whether theyre in our custody or not milkovas voice was severe maam i added what you forgot your punctuation mark i explained whether theyre in our custody or not maam so if my lawyer files an order of protection against treffer you cant tell us whether hes unconscious or anything she was new to finchleys team she didnt know how to respond off the top of her head you said he passed out then you said he attacked you how could he do both he did them in the reverse order first he attacked me then he passed out i want to know if hes in a hospital or the morgue or even police custody she thought this over i think i need to see you in person do you know where detective finchleys office is i know where it is but if you want to see me in person youll have to come to me rodney hurt me badly enough last night that im not hiking down to thirtyfifth and michigan in this weather ill tell detective finchley you called hell be ecstatic at the news tell him i cracked the code on what secrets kystarnik has been sending to his troops although maybe i should call the secret servicetheyre the ones whove been playing cat and mouse with kystarnik i think id better just ask detective finchley to call you milkova said when she hung up i made myself a large espresso and took it with me to drink while i soaked in a hot bath my abdomen was a mass of purpleblack jake thibaut was leaving for europe tomorrow night if the blood in my hand had turned him green what would the sight of my stomach do maybe if i wanted to preserve the relationship i should keep out of his way until he got home from his tour it was more important that i keep out of kystarniks way just because id managed to wriggle out of his jaws last night didnt mean i was home freeespecially once he found out that my pals and i had shanghaied his crew although maybe konstantin and ludwig wouldnt want anton to know that a driedup cougar had outwitted them but what papers did anton think i had and where had the body artist fled and why had she been so angry when i tried to help her get away from anton those seemed to be enough questions to keep a fit and lively detective busy for a year or two how could i handle them with just my cousins helpmy young inexperienced cousin whod been badly shaken by last nights assault when i was dry and warm i wrapped my torso in an ace bandage by pulling it tight across my abdomen i could move well enough to make my way downstairs to my neighbor his face lit up when he saw me i didnt want to come up he said in case you were asleep you looked like you was on your way to graceland last night doll by this my neighbor meant a nearby cemetery where chicagos most famous citizens are buried not elviss memphis home those were a couple of nice boys you brought around last night real thoughtful he added they drove peewee home and the one boy the marine came by a little bit ago he brought your car keys and a note from that lab you use mr contreras pawed through the newspapers on his coffee table and came up with an envelope that had the cheviot labs logotwo rams going headtoheadon the corner inside were my car keys and a receipt from sanford rieffs assistant listing the duffel bag the black armor mitt and the sand and summarizing the search id requested mr contreras insisted on cooking for me scrambled eggs bacon toast when he saw how painful it was for me to sit down he also insisted that i go see lotty well take a cab doll you cant take a chance if you got a perforated kidney or something you gotta get it looked at you know darned well how much i hate being in the medical maw i grumbled i can eat im not bleeding when i go to the bathroom even so even so im calling that service you used for the dogs when you was in italy last summer theyll walk them until youre fit again and im going upstairs to get your coat while you finish your eggs lotty was in her clinic today not at beth israel when mr contreras and i reached the storefront on damen avenue we found a roomful of the usual clientele streppy kids overweight adults with diabetes worried pregnant teens mrs coltrain lottys receptionist has handled all of her patients for fifteen years with the poise of solti conducting the cso when i told her what had happened she promised to fit me in as soon as she could while i waited i used the clinic landline to call my cousin konstantin and ludwig had told me last night that anton was tracking me through my cell phone so i just couldnt take a chance on using it petra was at her apartment tired nervous not sure she was ready for detective work marty jepson is here though she suddenly thought to say he came over to see how i was doing and were watching some of the body artists dvds together so far it looks like old stuff collages things that she photographed and uploaded later jewel kim the advanced practice nurse who ran the clinic while lotty was at the hospital interrupted me then and took me into one of the exam rooms we can send you for an mri if you want it vic and ill have lotty doublecheck you but i dont think you have any organ damage i know its miserable outside but you should put cold packs on your belly until the swelling goes down try arnica as well lotty came in a few minutes later victoria what on earthno never mind i dont have time what with all these people worried that their colds are swine flu and the ones with swine flu who waited too late to come in you werent reckless no one could ever say you were reckless simply you were minding your own business until someone kicked you thats good enough for me thank you lotty i knew you would understand i was bitter at her sarcasm in fact i was minding my own businessat least i was tending to my detective business i do not go out of my way to get hurt if a bully is running the street do you want me to stay inside with the door locked and hope he hurts someone else lotty had been probing my abdomen with quick skillful pressure pinpointing the sorest spots but she stopped fingers over my right ovary i dont suppose theres a middle ground perhaps with a bully there never is she finished her probing sodo as jewel suggests a cold compress arnica ill give you prescriptions for a good antiinflammatory and an antibiotic to be on the safe side in a day or two with your dna the worst will be past you wont run or let those dogs pull on you for a week the last sentence was a command not an observation and i took it meekly with me to the waiting room a pleasant chat with olympia mr contreras was torn between relief that nothing serious was amiss and disappointment that i couldnt be confined to quarters for a month or two while he looked after me he rode with me in the taxi down to my office so i could collect my car when i told him i wasnt going home he tried to argue with me at first then decided he should drive me im going to pay a surprise visit to olympia koilada i said you sure you want to come along i cant have you breaking her neck or anything just because you dont like the way she treated petra youre the one that likes to run around town getting beat up ill be there to protect whichever one of you needs it most i laughed clutching my abdomen and turned the keys over to him olympia lived in a loft building just northwest of the gold coast one of those conversions that followed the gutting of chicagos old industrial corridor according to my computer search shed paid almost a million dollars for half of the fourth floor the side that faced the chicago river i wondered what it would fetch if she had to liquidate in the middle of this slump when i rang olympias bell she squawked at me through the intercom its v i warshawski olympia go away she snapped i dont think so i think well have a lovely conversation about you anton and money laundering a couple of minutes passed where the wind made a good substitute for an ice pack on my sore belly and then a buzzer sounded unlocking the door when we got off the elevator at the fourth floor olympias door was cracked open she waited until we got close enough for her to identify us before she opened it all the way i had never seen her away from the club in blue jeans and a turtleneck without makeup she looked younger even a bit vulnerable although the large gun in her left hand kind of countered that image rodney kicked me so hard last night that im having trouble getting around today i said my neighbor salvatore contreras is helping me out mr contreras olympia koilada mr contreras stuck a hand out but olympia didnt move i lifted my sweater and peeled back the ace bandage to show her my bruises she blenched rodney did that yes indeed but it was all for the good because after he got knocked out i persuaded two of his cretinous team to confide antons code to me you knocked rodney out oh my god i didnt tell her the big role luck played in my salvation last night i wanted her to think that i was as powerfulmore powerful eventhan her tormentor besides in a way i had knocked him outhed slipped on my vomit after all weeks ago i told you to trust me i said if you had talked to me to begin with i wouldnt have these bruises today olympia moved away from the door the gun shaking in her left hand we followed her in shutting and bolting the door i took her gun and sat down on a white couch my boots were making dirty little puddles on the saltandpepper rug but olympia didnt seem to notice you know about antons code right you knew the feds were investigating kystarniks mob ties but you let him have the run of your club or at least let his chief enforcer have the run because hed bailed you out what other favors are you doing for him where is rodney now olympia didnt seem to have heard me did he follow you here i dont know and i dont care but you apparently do dont tell me youre sleeping with himthats so disgusting i cant bear to think about it if anton and rodney think im helping you she said i might as well jump off the roof right now and end everything the easy way her words were melodramatic but her tone was matteroffact hey thats no way to talk mr contreras reproved her if youve gotten yourself in trouble and youre too scared to talk to the cops talk to vic here shes helped people in worse trouble than you are in olympia flicked a contemptuous glance at him no one had ever been in worse trouble than she so i said rodney telegraphed bank codes to antons overseas pals via the body artists butt what else you slipped petra extra money to pretend she hadnt noticed him copping a feel dont tell me you let him sleep with your staff not everyone thinks her body is as sacred as you seem to olympia shrugged if the money was right its a bad economy i thought i might throw up again my neighbor as her meaning dawned on him started a furious protestdirected against mefor letting petra work in such an environment later i said to him rodney had the hots for petra so you kept her on but i was too close to her for his comfort he told you to give her the ax right she shook her head it wasnt like that what was it like then i didnt keep the contempt out of my voice she flinched but didnt speak lets see i continued you provided rodney with sex partners and set up antons message board that doesnt seem like enough to offset a million dollars of debt what else could it bemoney laundering anton paid off your debts right so that while you used to bleed money like scarlet your books are now white as wool and in return for whatever businesses hes involved in where he doesnt want the feds to see his cash flow he can funnel money through club gouge no wonder your business began to take off last fall when the body artist appeared on your stage you suddenly had money to burn at least it was antons money but you could advertise in the important places you could invest in that shiny set of plasma screens and that really cool sound system what was the artists role in all this did she sleep with rodney olympia made a sour face it was all i could do to get her to sit still when he was painting her that was antons idea when he first heard about her act he thought it would be a good way to keep the feds from tracking his offshore accounts now that youve ruined that i dont know what ill do say it more plaintively i suggested make me care karen buckley has disappeared by the way any thoughts on where shed go on who would take her in that stupid girl who drools on her i suppose olympia said rivka darling think harder dig deeper in your brain i dont care olympia shouted she was a royal pain to work with a fucking prima donna if anton hadnt told me told you what i said when she bit the statement off what her real name was i knew it couldnt be karen buckley what is it really how did you know she looked sulky but said youre not the only detective in chicago i saw anton had some kind of hold on karen so i hired brett taylor to run a background check he dug deep but he couldnt find word one about her and then he charged me a bundle brett taylor was another solo op in town our paths crossed occasionally what a happy little band you are at club gouge i said anton has you clamped in a vise you spy on your performers so that you can hold any secrets you uncover over their headswe wont use such an ugly word as blackmail whos anton working for now by the way a sly smile tilted the corners of her mouth i couldnt say although if i knew karen buckleys real name it might trigger a memory or two cant tell you that i got to my feet ill be talking to terry finchley the cop whos spearheading the guaman murder investigation ill be sure to let him know he should look at your books not the books the irs seesthe ones antons pet cpa owen widermayer keeps for you you wouldnt you cant go to the cops not when your own niece shes my cousin not my niece and if you try to smear her it wont be anton kystarnik who puts a bullet through you yeah itll be me mr contreras startled both of us hed been silent so long you letting a horror show like that rodney stick a hand on her and paying heryoure no better than a pimp yourself olympia looked from mr contreras to me if i tell you she said if i help you will you promise not to talk to this cop this finchley of course not im a licensed investigator i could lose my license if i covered up a crime especially one like laundering money for the mob i moved to the door ill call officer finchley myself she said boldly ill tell him i just found out that anton was using my club as a front and hell believe you because hes such a gullible guy especially if you wear that black thing that shows off your cleavage i suggested she held out her hands beseeching sister to sister you could help me she pleaded you could tell him you discovered the discrepancy when you were investigating this guaman murder and when you brought it to my attention your cooked books are connected to the guaman murder is that what chad and nadia were arguing about i stopped with my hand on the knob my jaw gaping in astonishment was that what had been in chads black mittsome microchip with olympias accounting data on it what do you mean my cooked books she protested belatedly as for chad and nadia they were just a couple of fuckedup people who came to the club and thats all youll get from me unless you back me up when you talk to your tame cop girlie magsand fortune as soon as we were in the elevator mr contreras tore into me why didnt you tell me that woman was letting some scumbag put his filthy hands on peewee why didnt she tell me herself she shoulda known id help her out if she got in a jam i put an arm around him darling the only reason we didnt tell you is because we love you what good would it do either of us if you were in prison for murder even if you killed a scumbag who wouldnt be missed he let himself be mollified at the suggestion that i thought he was tough enough to kill someone who bothered petra he drove me to the store helped me push my shopping cart didnt fight me over the bill even though hed put a few items of his own in the cart guess i can call that payment for chauffeuring you doll i needed to be in motion but i was so exhausted by the outing that i had to lie down when we got home i let mr contreras put my chicken in the oven to roast let him make me an ice pack to put on my sore stomach while he settled down in my living room with the dogs i tried to relax but i kept replaying my conversation with olympia she was afraid of anton but who wouldnt be she seemed especially afraid that he would know that id been to see her i felt a grudging sympathy when i met anton last night i hadnt been sure id be alive today in fact if tim and marty hadnt come along i might well not be the ice had melted through my ace bandage and my stomach was wet and cold a counterirritant to take my mind off the pain i rolled to a sitting position and unwrapped the bandage nadia had kept painting allies face surrounded by the same design that was on chads body armor if rodney and anton had been using the body artist as a message board maybe nadia had been doing the same thing she was writing about her sister that was definite but the rest of the message was obscure there was a connection to chads body armor but was it to the secret object he might have brought back with him from iraq or was it to chad himself or to his massacred squad i thought of the porn magazines id taken from under mona vishneskis bed the magazines chad had tucked away so mom wouldnt see them maybe allie had posed in one of them and chad was blackmailing the guaman family the magazines were at my office i got to my feet put on a dry shirt pulled on a sweater over ita big loose one that didnt require me to wriggle and struggleand went to the living room mr contreras was dozing on the couch i thought about slipping out without waking him on the theory that it was better to apologize than to explain but wed had too many skirmishes over the years about my secretive nature and i was too weak and sore to fight my friends along with my enemies when i woke my neighbor he didnt want to go back out in the cold and snow and who could blame him he argued that the magazines could wait until morning but when i said id call petra ask her to stop at the office and find what i needed he grumped to his feet you aint sticking peewees head in another tiger trap theres nothing dangerous about going to my office i objected trust me if you send little petra there to get a magazine for you chances are someones put a bomb in it so youd rather my head got blown off i was half teasing half hurt dont give me those puppydog eyes he growled all the years i been knowing you i been begging you to keep yourself safe and you aint paid one minute of heed to me im just asking you to take better care of the kid than you do of yourself look at youbruises on your hand your stomach would make your own mother faint youre right gabriella used to beg me the same as mr contreras when my cousin boomboom and i ran into danger cuore mio spare me more grief than my life has already held i bit my lip but i still wanted to look at those magazines the old man nodded grimly pleased that his words had hit home he started the slow process of pulling on his boots and his coat while i set the oven timer for the chicken we took the dogs for companythe walker wasnt coming for another couple of hours at my office tessa was working on some immense steel thing while i went into my files mr contreras pulled up a stool to watch her tessa doesnt usually tolerate an audience but mr contreras was a machinist in his working life and she respects his advice on tools chad had stuffed his girlie pix inside a copy of fortune and id left them bundled together when i put them into the file the issue dated to before the economys collapse there was an article on the high demand for luxury goods and the way you could make the middle class feel they were part of the hyperwealthy elite another teaser claimed that fortune had tested the iphone against all comers a third asked will a change of owner change achilles fortunes i had removed the girlie magazines and was thumbing through them looking for alexandra guamans face wondering if i would recognize it floating airbrushed above improbable breasts when i did a double take on the achilles headline i had read it online when i was looking up background on tintrey i went back to fortune to reread the story tintrey had acquired achilles the maker of body armor when it became obvious that the war in iraq was going to last for a long time achilles had been developing nanotechnology using particles id never heard of and wasnt sure i could pronounce inorganic fullerenelike nanostructures they apparently were galliumbased whatever that was and stronger than steel in a photograph of one of the particles blown up a few hundred times the stuff looked pretty much like the cement they were pouring into potholes on the kennedy expressway achilles had been losing money r d doesnt come cheap fortune had a lot to say about shortsighted corporate policy that let wall streets insatiable demand for currentquarter profits block longterm development strategies anyway the long and the short of it was tintrey bought achilles which was bleeding red ink too fast to fight off a hostile takeover bid jarvis macleans first order of business was a campaign to sell achilles shields to the department of defense some achilles staffers who spoke on condition of anonymity expressed concern that tintrey was marketing a product that wasnt ready for fullscale production yet the new owners had spent almost ten million dollars on building a pr campaign when youre making a new product why worry about graphic design why not put the money into hiring a good science team asked one former member of the r d staff indeed tintrey has been downsizing the r d division since acquiring achilles they have a great product in place we need to focus now on getting it into the hands of our troops not on endlessly refining it said gilbert scalia as head of tintreys enduring freedom division its scalias job to outfit the nine thousand tintrey employees in iraq and to provide matériel to the us armed forces deployed around the world a year after acquiring achilles tintrey has already changed the profit picture at the division maybe the new publicity did the trick the magazine showed some of the pr materials including the achilles logo a pinkandgray fleurdelis this was the design on the black mitt id found in chad vishneskis duffel and it was the design nadia guaman had been painting on the body artist i read the article through carefully twice curled up on the couch in my client corner with the dogs at my feet i learned a bit about the structure of fullerene nanoparticles at least i learned they were named for buckminster fuller but not much else the article had been important to chad vishneski important enough that he kept it alongside his girlie magazines and hed cut holes in one of the armor mitts but why hed done it would have to wait until he regained consciousnessor sanford rieff at cheviot labs found out a dramatic secret about the shield neither john vishneski nor tim radke had ever heard chad talk about the armor but chads squad had been killed around him that was when he lost the equilibrium that carried him through his first deployments maybe he blamed tintrey for the failure of their armor in protecting his men and was savaging their equipment as a way to vent his feelings of helplessness i called vishneski hed had to go to a jobsite a building far enough along that they were working on the interior but he said chads status continued to improve the docs are all pretty optimistic he hasnt been speaking anymore at least he hadnt before i left this morning but hes restless in a good way they say the police have been around some wanting to know if hes well enough to go back to prison but that dr herschel shes a pistol isnt she she told them where to get off i silently blew lotty a kiss no strangers have come around to try to see him not that i know of but ill talk to mona of course we dont know who his friends are so theyd all be strangers to us but like i said some of my buddies are hanging around theyll let me know if anyone comes calling that was one less worry at least for now when hed hung up i started looking for rodney treffer he wasnt in the morgue so i called around to the hospitals on the near north side i hadnt heard back from finchley or milkova and i wanted to find out how much time i had before rodney was fit enough to come after me i said i was sunny treffer searching for my brother he was supposed to meet me for breakfast this morning and never showed and given his history of psychosis i was worried whether hed had some breakdown and been brought in i was lucky with the third place i called the er charge nurse told me rodney had injured himself in a fall but didnt seem to be having a psychotic episode when he was with them theyd kept him overnight for observation and discharged him an hour ago hed had a concussion and some brain swelling but theyd done a second ct scan before they released him the swelling had gone down youre his sister make sure he rests for the next several days he shouldnt be out on this ice where he could slip and fall again ill do my best to keep him off the streets i promised did mr kystarnik pay his bill the charge nurse transferred me to the billing department where a service rep said someone had stopped by with rodney and paid cash all twentythree thousand dollars that were owed for his emergency care i gave an embarrassed titter i need to know who paid for my brother he well hes not good with bills and im kind of responsible the rep misunderstood me dont worry about that honey our cashier looked at the money it wasnt counterfeit but who paid for him i heard her clicking at her keyboard his friend said the receipt should be made out to your brother did he give his own address i asked on bobolink road in highland park she clicked her teeth no he said he was at north inscape drive in deerfield oh dear i said thats his exwifes address well it cant be helped thanks for looking after him he probably didnt tell the doctors about his risperidone either you should add that to his chart the helpful rep said shed pass a note on to the doctor whod treated my brother the address rodney had given on inscape drive belonged to anton kystarnik andor owen widermayer at rest ez as his worried sister i hoped rodney would stay there firmly put for a month but i was more afraid he might be looking for me and for karen buckleys computer karen revealed mr contreras and i were climbing into my mustang when a strange truck pulled into the parking lot i reached reflexively for my gun but petra bounded from the passenger seat as lively as a new puppy mitch broke from me to rush to her side while staff sergeant jepson climbed down from the drivers seat followed by tim radke whod been squeezed into the back afternoon maam sir jepson called to mr contreras and me you on your way out we spent the day on your gals computer and tim thinks hes got a lot of it sorted out i explained that i needed to get the dogs home for the dog walker but invited them to follow us north mr contreras enthusiastically seconded the motion mentioning my chicken big enough for five right doll when we make some fettuccine at home jepson helped me check around the building to make sure rodney or his minions werent lurking so vic tim totally hacked into this computer hes amazing you should hire him petra yelled as i made my painful way up the three flights of stairs it wasnt cheap tim warned me i had to download some pretty expensive software to come up with her passwordnone of chads dads ideas worked i told him to go for it petra sang out cheerily out of curiosity little chickadee how much is expensive uh thirtytwo hundred dollars tim mumbled thirtytwo hundred hmm soat fifteen dollars an hourwell rounding up to give you the benefit of the doubtthat would be two hundred free hours of work you can give me petra but vic her big eyes opening so wide her lashes brushed her brows i knew this was important and i didnt want to wake you up after you got injured no peetie that was thoughtful thats why im rounding your salary up as a thankyou you see youre working for me im paying the bills and i probably know a vendor who could get me a better deal on software than you can petra glowered at me youre not serious i cant afford then you need to learn to think twice or even three times before committing me to debt petra i looked at her seriously for a beat i will let you off the hook this time but if you do such a thing again i will hold you responsible for paying for it clear i told you i wasnt a robot clear oh all right she stomped back down the stairs tim radke whod been standing by uncomfortably while we argued said he thought he should pay for the software since he was the one who talked petra into buying it no were cool on this petra just needs help curbing her magnanimous impulses i headed on up the stairs and left radke to follow petra back to mr contrerass place jake thibaut was on his way out as i reached the third floor i hadnt seen him for a couple of days and he was surprised by my painful progress upward your hand bothering you for a bass player an injured hand was worrying enough to cause a limp not so much im just tired see you before you fly out not if it means looking at something gruesome stuck into your body to my surprise i found myself fighting back tears ill wrap myself in gauze head to foot so that only my eyes and mouth show hey hey just teasing vi just teasing he brushed my wet eyes with a callused fingertip im a bass player nothing grosses me out except blood cant explain that one we have one last rehearsal tonight and im just on my way to buy food for the group are you free tomorrow fourish theyre not picking me up until six he pulled me to him and kissed me and i tried to translate the pain in my abdomen into passion on my lips as he held me i heard the dog walker arrive the dogs yelps of pleasure and then my neighbor start up the stairs with tim staff sergeant jepson and petra jake murmured that hed leave me to cope with my circus on my own and went on his way inside my apartment tim opened up karens computer he showed me what happened when he logged on to her site we got the message that the site was down then he typed commands onto the screen itself lines of equations began to scroll downward heres the command to block content from the site he froze the screen and pointed to a line of text i could see the words respect for the and dead separated by strings of code now watch this he typed another set of commands green text scrolled down the screen once more he typed another command line and suddenly the body artists website was on the computer in front of us i forgot my sore belly howd you do that its a clone tim tried not to grin tried to be casualaramis ramírez quickly doffing his hat after backtoback homers that way whoever is blocking the original site doesnt know we can access it but who is blocking it he shrugged cant tell you that the server is in olathe kansas when i talked to one of their techies this afternoon the best he could tell me is that the commands werent coming from this machine theyre coming from baghdad but whether they start there or just are being bounced through there whoever is doing it is pretty sophisticated your old buddies jepson asked usacnoew radke grimaced they could but why would they i didnt see anything pertaining to military ops in here usacnoew i said sounds like a cat in pain tim laughed us army computer network operations and electronic warfare he translated you know the army its all alphabet soup of course theyre not the only big outfit in baghdad i said theres also tintrey them and a hundred other jackals marty jepson was suddenly angry im so sick of those damned contractors those private armies i lost two good buddies who had to go out shotgun to protect one of their farking ceos yeah man theyre total scum radke agreed but why would they care about this strippers website shes not a stripper petra started to protest then looked doubtful maybe i shouldnt be sticking up for her if she really is like a drug dealer or something i scrolled carefully through the images looking for nadias paintings we know what the codes that rodney was using mean but what was nadia trying to tell us about alexandra petra and the other two men crowded around my shoulders as tim enlarged various parts of nadias drawings the last one shed painted had shown her sister with flames sprouting out of her head she was killed by an ied i said i suppose the fire symbolizes that could well be maam jepson said his voice very dry where was this incident on the way to the baghdad airport her boss told me tim are there any other files in here that we can look at what are you looking for i dont know anything i flung my hands open in frustration where the artist might have gone to earth what she knew about olympia and rodneys business what she thought of alexandra guamanthe two had a brief affair the summer before alexandra deployed tim did some more keyboard work and brought up a list of all karens folders she had virtually no documents except drafts of scripts for the commentary she made during her shows and outlines for possible future shows any financial records or letters or even emails didnt reside on this machine we should all be so careful about our privacy i suppose but it felt eerily like walking through an empty houselike walking through karen buckleys or frannie pinderos empty apartment she might carry a vast burden of emotional baggage but physically she traveled light across the landscape her videos then i said whats in those folders that you didnt see on her dvds that folder bulged of course movies are very byte hungry and something only five minutes long might use a megabyte of memory tim got up so that i could sit at the controls at first he and the others watched as i browsed through karens junk footage early shots of herself painting her own body done with mirrors in what i assumed was the darkened front room petra and i had found yesterday afternoon after a bit though the two vets wandered off to join mr contreras and petra in my kitchen the dog walker rang my bell i sent petra downstairs with staff sergeant jepson as protection i kept watching videos as they came back up with the animals i saw footage of leander marvelle and kevin piuma dancing without their burkas they moved beautifullya marvel a feather theyd named themselves wellin a bare space that i guessed was the columbia college rehearsal room karen had taped herself with vesta they were in bed together vesta murmured something lowvoiced out of mike range and then sprang to her feet and ordered karen to leave take your camera with you karen and your clothes your toothbrushall those things i dont want you back here and karen hadnt argued she sat up in bed her face as impassive a mask as when it was covered with paint i saw her naked torso her hand stretched out she wasnt beseeching vesta but holding a small remote control and turning off the camera i looked for footage during the weeks nadia had been visiting club gouge i found a scene in rivkas bedroom with rivka demanding to know what nadia meant to karen a chance to explore the world of art shes a tormented soul little rivulet dont torment your own soul over her and certainly not over me i moved on to other files and came upon a crucifix with a dolls head black plastic hair tied around jesus hands that was the cross nadia had kept over her bed karen said youve never done this before have you her voice held cool amusement no tenderness wherever shed placed her camera it wasnt quite close enough for good focus i could tell nadia was naked but not what her face was registering her response to karen was so soft that the mike didnt pick it up why did you hustle me so hard after the show then karen said just out of curiosity a long tick of silence except for the rustling of the bedclothes and then nadia said you knew my sister alexandra i meet a lot of people nadia in michigan at a music festival maybe she told you to call her allie thats her pet name at home oh yes beautiful girl totally ashamed of herself are you the gobetween is she ready to come out or did she tell you to use me for your own sexual experiments if so try this it wasnt clear what karen did next but it hurt nadia gave a sharp yelp and sat up wrapping a sheet around her shoulders alexandra is dead she was killed in iraq do you want me to stand at attention and play the starspangled banner karens cool tone didnt change do you have any feelings at all for anyone besides yourself i figure chicks like you emoting all over the place have so many exhausting feelings that there isnt room for mine karen was being sarcastic but i thought there was an undercurrent in her toneanger bitterness if you had a sister like allie and she was murdered you might not be so cold karen sat up in bed so fast that the camera recorded only a blur i heard the slap hand on face fuck you bitch i had someone like allie who was murdered so stop bleating at me like a sentimental sheep i hit pause startled did she mean antons daughter zina was that a person karenfrannie had felt close to if that was the case then maybe zinas overdose had been someone elses deliberate work or maybe karenfrannie just thought an od was an act of murder impossible to know i clicked play and the recording began again nadia was apologizing but my sister was tormented she was hounded she wrote it in her journal all because someone where she worked in baghdad found out that she liked she preferredthat women that she was a dyke why cant you just say it dont use that word about allie who told them was it you because you were so angry with her for not returning your calls karen sat up and began pulling on clothessweater jeans boots nadia you want someone to be at fault because the sister you adored so much is dead but if she was a lesbian people in baghdad would have known believe me i did not say one word to one person about my week with her she was of no interest to me once she made it clear that i was of no interest to her for once karen spoke in a real voice someone who was feeling the words she was saying or at least someone who acted as though she felt them the clip ended there abruptly as had the segment with vesta there was no way of knowing whether nadia like vesta had realized karen frannie was recording her a clutch of apartment raiders plus dogs dinner was a success at least for my guests petra had recovered from last nights trauma aided by her military escort and they in turn seemed to be thawing in her ebullience my neighbor was beaming happily mr contreras wanted to see petra settle down with some nice boy and marty jepson and tim radke both fit the bill i sat at the end of the table smiling nodding wondering where alexandra guamans journal was i had played the video the body artist had recorded with nadia three times alexandra felt so hounded and tormented that she wrote about it in her journal nadia had said that which meant nadia had seen the journal which meant that whoever ransacked nadias apartment might have been looking for it julian urbanke i suddenly said out loud everyone at the table stared at me until petra said vic theres no one with a name like that in my family unless its someone on the warshawski side marty was asking who in my moms family had been in the service my aunts ancestors had mostly been in the confederate army i wondered how the veterans would react to that sorry i said i was trying to remember the name of the man who lived across the hall from nadia guaman her apartment was ripped apart the pictures even taken down from the walls a couple of days after she died someone took her computer and all her discs urbanke had a key to her apartment he seemed to have had a crush on nadiamaybe he helped himself to alexandras journal thinking it was nadias before the homewrecking crew arrived what would you like us to do maam jepson asked marty its so funny to hear you call vic maam petra laughed she may be older than us but shes not like a hundred just call her vic like everybody else does darling i love the staff sergeants impeccable manners i said who knows maybe some of them will rub off on you and me i looked at jepson who was staring straight ahead blushing id like to go over to urbankes place i continued see if he has the diary petras eyes sparkled all of us a midnight raid she stopped remembering last nights fight the muscles in her face tightened vic she said why dont you just call and ask him too easy to brush people off on the phone i said youre not going to beat him up are you she was pleating her napkin by now of course she aint mr contreras grumbled if she had any sense shed stay right here he turned to me if it wasnt for these boys here riding to your rescue last night youd be dead and in the morgue right now im going to bring peppy if urbanke tries to attack me hell trip over her and fall and then shell smooch him into confessing i stood too quickly for my abdomen and ended up clutching the edge of the table uh maam jepson said i mean vic id uh it would be a pleasure to visit this man urbanke with you well if he was going to put it like that implying that the marines had a sense of duty even if no one else understood it then mr contreras had to join in which meant tim radke and petra could hardly stay behind petra bent over mitch hands on his jowls you want to come too dont you mitch just in case after petra and tim finished the washing up we laced up our winter boots and zipped up our coats and went back into the night dogs and all i wondered if any other detective on the planet had ever traveled with this kind of entourage sam spade with dogs cousin old man and marineskind of like calling on a suspect with a circus parade in tow my fellow performers were full of enthusiasm jepson took me and the dogs in his truck tim radke followed in my car with petra and mr contreras the heater in jepsons pickup was as old as the shocks and my feet turned numb as we bounced over ruts i grabbed the edges of the seat trying to minimize the jolts to my sore muscles sorry about that maam vic i mean kind of like the roads in baghdad just without the gunfire and the ieds and so on although this part of town i guess we could get some gunfire he added as we moved into the grimmer gangridden streets west of western we got to nadias building ahead of the others while we waited we talked about ways and means i dont want all seven of us barging in on urbanke i said why dont we let mr contreras and petra wait in nadias apartment with the dogs while you and i talk to the guy it was hard to persuade mr contreras that this was a good ideahe hadnt come along just to sit on the sidelines and cheer for me thanks very much in the end tim offered to babysit petra and the dogs while my neighbor and the staff sergeant and i went into urbankes a bit of good luck he was home a bit of bad luck he remembered me and did not wish to see me youre not a cop he squawked over the intercom you cant make me talk to you right mr urbanke i bellowed at my end we dont need to talk we just want to ask you about alexandras journal another bit of good luck someone came out of the building just as i was debating whether to open the outer door on my own the man looked at us suspiciously and i grinned happily were the new tenants in e thanks the key they gave us for the outside door doesnt work no dogs allowed in this building he said theyre not moving in just helping my friends set up housekeeping well see you my parade swept past him and up the stairs to the third floor i opened the door to nadias place with my picklocks then knocked on urbankes petra stood in nadias doorway watching mitch and peppy were behind her trying to push between her legs when urbanke didnt answer his door jepson began kicking it and mitch started to bark in about thirty seconds wed drawn a crowd people from two of the other apartments on the floor and a woman bending over the railing on the fourth floor no dogs allowed in here who are they someone call the cops call the police and let them rob us in our beds call the building management the building management dont be insanethey still havent fixed my broken window because youre three months behind on mr urbanke has been really helpful in looking after my nieces home since nadia was murdered i cut into the flow he has a key to her apartment he took her cat but he also took some of her other thingsim sure for safekeeping security is terrible in this building and he didnt want anyone to steal her jewelry but i need to get it back to give to my sister nadias mother is so overcome with grief she cant come herself so she asked me to stop by and collect her jewelry thats a lie urbanke had opened his door just enough that we could see his nose and mouth shes no aunt she was going through nadias apartment herself pretending to be a detective i saw you go into the girls apartment the day after she died a woman on the upper landing said to urbanke fortunately not to me poor nadia you were always looking at her likelike this dog here looking at a bone she pointed at mitch who had pushed past my cousin and was nosing around the crack in urbankes door and then shes barely dead and you let yourself into her place how you even got a key to her door thats what i want to know she gave it to me he said mitch suddenly yelped a piercing shriek of pain a white ball of fur bolted between his legs crossed the hall and ran into nadias place the dogs nose was bleeding whatd you do to my dog mr contreras demanded as urbanke opened the door shouting ixcuina chain up that vicious dog or ill shoot him ixcuina ixcuina kitty kitty urbanke ran after the cat tripping over peppy who was standing in nadias doorway barking her head off petra was doubled over with laughter i grabbed her shoulders get those dogs under control now this is an investigation not comedy central i didnt wait for her response but took the opportunity to go into urbankes apartment jepson and radke followed me and mr contreras and two of the people from the building and mitch urbanke lived in three shabbily furnished rooms with a layout similar to nadias jepson and radke went through the rooms as if it were a terrorist hideout in iraq crouching peering around the corners after a moment jepson called to me from urbankes bedroom theyd found a shrine to nadia that he had created inside his closet photographs hed shot of her when she didnt know he was watching her a few pieces of her artwork that hed filched we didnt find her computer or any of her missing dvds but there was a redcovered notebook propped up inside an open papiermâché box with roses and candles around it the notebook was open i bent over to read it september leaving istanbul for baghdad its so hot that we all sit unmoving waiting for them to close the plane doors and turn on the airconditioning so we can breathe again is that what we were looking for maam jepson asked i nodded breathless and lifted the notebook carefully as if it might disintegrate with careless handling the interior of the box was decorated with paintings of alexandra guamanalexandra in a coffin arms crossed over her chest tears like chandelier drops falling from her eyes alexandra kneeling in front of the virgin who was placing a crown of roses on her head alexandra in heaven reaching her hands down to nadia clara and ernest clara should have this box i said to jepson shes the surviving sister he helped me place the journal back into its papiermâché container and said hed carry it for me before heading home i went looking for urbanke i found him in nadias kitchen trying to coax ixcuina the attack cat out from behind the refrigerator where shed taken refuge im taking the diary i told him it wasnt nadias by the way it was her older sisters he looked up at me i know i read it the sister was perverse but the diary mattered to miss nadia and i am protecting her memory or i was trying to protect her from people like you who want to drag her through the mud i could sue you for breaking into my home and for having a wild dog i smiled your neighbors are worrying now about whether their daughters are safe around you if i were you id lay low for a bit not bring any lawsuits where you might need a witness to describe what happened tonight their version and yours are likely to be a million or so miles apart an ugly expression crossed his face but before he could speak i added another thing i wouldnt mention alexandra guamans journal to anyone to a neighbor to your children even to your pastor we dont know what the people who trashed this apartment were looking for maybe it was nadias computer but maybe it was this diary if they learn that youve read it you will need the charmed nine lives of this cat here to escape he tried to stare me down but my words had taken the stuffing out of him he turned back to the cat looking a little pale it made me think hed already told someone about the journal the sister she was perverse he would have hissed to a coworker trying to make himself the center of attention i couldnt worry about his problems i just hoped he was embarrassed enough by his neighbors reaction to his actions that he wouldnt complain publicly about my taking the journal i left him to ixcuina and rejoined my circus in the hallway mr contreras had struck up an acquaintance with the woman from the floor above both of them clicking their teeth over the dangers of living in the city the dangers of apartment life where you couldnt know what kind of fiend might be renting right next door to you look after your beautiful granddaughter she told him nodding her head toward petra when she saw we were leaving which delighted mr contreras so much he repeated it several times on our way down the stairs a love storya horror story when we got home the two vets followed us inside staff sergeant jepson seemed to think i needed extra support on my way up the stairs i wondered if he saw me as elderly and frail or mature and exciting and then i remembered kystarniks thug calling me a driedup cougar the previous night and felt myself blushing jake and his friends were still rehearsing they were working on berios sequenze discordant not to everyones taste still i resented it when tim radke muttered sounds like that guy urbankes cat is dying in there and petra burst out laughing vic you totally rock how did you even know hed built a shrine to nadia my cousin demanded when we were inside my place i bent over the piano bench and slipped allies journal inside my score of don giovanni i didnt lucky guess even luckier was when the cat ran for cover the adrenaline wave id been riding began to recede leaving me so overcome with fatigue that i had to hold on to the piano for support i guess the answer to my question was elderly and frail that wasnt lucky mr contreras huffed i have half a mind to report him to animal control keeping a cat like that wild animal it attacked my dog just dont let them see the poor abused victim i said collapsing on the piano bench mitch grinned up at me red tongue lolling to show he knew he was a con artistand what was i going to do about it i looked at petra and the two vets thank you all for your help tonight but i need to get some rest hey no way my cousin said we didnt go through all that so you could go to bed were reading allies journal before we leave i pushed myself to my feet and propelled petra into the kitchen youre not a child and im not your nanny so dont start whining and cajoling looking at a piece of evidence in a murder investigation is not the same thing as begging for a new bike i told you when i agreed to work for you i wont be bullied petra scowled and i told you i was running a detective agency if you want to be part of it please respect the fact that we are working for people who often are in desperate need you had one assignment tonight to hold on to the dogs you blew that mitch roared around urbankes apartment and was a major nuisance until tim grabbed his leash and got him under control if mitch hadnt gotten away he wouldnt have freaked out urbankes cat and we wouldnt have gotten in to find that creepy shrine i did you a favor youll get your distinguished service medal first thing in the morning i said drily in the meantime if you want to keep working for me you cant be playing games and you cant ignore your assignments because theyre dull or because youre flirting with tim radke i dont believe you petra cried is this about you being jealous because im young and attractive i was so angry i jammed my hands into my pockets to keep from slapping her werent you the one who chewed me out yesterday for teasing you about your youthful attractiveness your looks are off limits but my age isnt she glared at me but asked am i fired not tonight but you are not captain of this expedition i went back to the living room wondering how long it would be before i ended up in the dwight womens prison for murdering petra jepson and radke got to their feet well take off now maam the staff sergeant said thank you for dinner thanks for coming along tonight i said i couldnt have done it without you jepson flushed a pleasure to help you maam vic what is this a recruiting commercial for the marines tim punched his friend in the ribs and added to petra who was trailing behind me were going to plotzkys to catch the last period of the hawks game want to come along my cousin smiled warmly at the two young men glowered at me to make sure i knew i was not forgiven and bounded out of the apartment with them it was harder to move mr contreras and the dogs but they finally left as well i moved slowly through my nighttime routine anton didnt care about the body artists website anymore or so he said he wanted papers he thought i had perhaps hed meant alexandras journal but if that was the case it meant hed somehow hooked up with tintrey because alexandras journal was of interest to them even if he was only looking for it as a potential way to blackmail jarvis maclean it still meant that somehow in the last two days hed learned about tintreys interest in the guaman family september leaving istanbul for baghdad even after i was lying exhausted in my bed the words kept running through my head i saw alexandra guaman her dark curls damp with sweat shed taken the overseas job because the money would help clara go to a good college at least thats what clara believed what else what had happened to her why with no experience as a convoy driver had she left the safety of the green zone to drive a truck to the baghdad airport around one in the morning i finally got out of bed and took the journal from between the pages of my don giovanni score i curled up in my big armchair with it and a glass of my dwindling supply of longrow september baghdad im half in iraq half in chicago everything is the same and everything is different when i go to work in the morning its almost like im at home on a hot august day except its already everywhere you go there are soldiers with weapons but inside the tintrey building its weirdly like being home same desks same airconditioning same systems people are friendly but cautious one of the older women in the office told us newbies never to leave the compound unless were with soldiers or armed tintrey personnel no woman is safe from them she says september everyone is nervous none of us has been close to war before in our training before we left we were told we are a team as a team we will win stress fatigue and terrorists cannot defeat a team when i read that to nadia she made a poster for me of the tintrey team mr scalia and mr maclean behind big shields made of dollar bills ernest and i laughed so hard we almost made ourselves sick ernest scanned it for me into the computer but if i look at it i must be careful everybody spies on everybody else its only because were bored or lonely or scared even in the tiny apartment i share buried deep inside the compound we hear the bombs at night in bed i try not to remember my week in michigan with karen sometimes i cant help iti go to her website although i get no real glimpse of her only the many masks she wears in public she is not worth my immortal souli must remember those words in times of temptation father vicente said when he urged me to take this job a chance to start over he said to leave your sinful tendencies in america and serve your country overseas i thought maybe hes right and anyway the money is so good clara is the smartest of the guaman sisters she deserves the chance to go to a good college and i thought maybe i can become a normal person if im far away although how could anyone become normal in this very unnormal place everybody drinks a great deal even i who used to have a glass of wine only on new years or my birthday find myself drinking almost every night after work september mama calls twice a week she is worried but we are really not in danger inside our great marble compound i didnt tell her that yesterday i took a walk outside the compound i went with amani who is one of our translators a very serious young woman who wears the typical black covering of an iraqi woman so you can only see part of her face she speaks perfect english and perfect french i trade her a few words in spanish for a few words of arabic mama would be frightened to think of me outside the green zone and why should i add to her fears and amani is so reliable she made sure i was covered head to toe in one of her abayas so that we would not be targets american and arab side by side september my roommates learned of my second trip into the city with amani and they screamed like tenyearolds oh allie how could you and you put on her abaya werent you afraid of germs germs i am afraid of bombs but not of a womans body i thank you jesus for sending me such silly girls to live with they will not rouse any tendencies in me father vicente reminded me of the priests and nuns who wrestle with celibacy every day sometimes every hour know you are not alone in your struggle and find yourself a nice boy you will meet plenty of young men in the middle of a war marry one of them make a family a family will cure you of your sinful desires i read on through the night more trips into baghdad with amani the two women went to art galleries or to outdoor markets but never to see amanis familyshe couldnt let the neighbors know she worked for americans or they might murder her little brothers for being related to a collaborator on thanksgiving during the boisterous celebrations inside the green zone alexandra got drunk and spent the night with someone named jerry one of the programmers in tintreys communications division november ive been sick all day throwing up gin and throwing up jerry i dont know which has made me sicker december have avoided jerry all week i think he told some of the other menthey look at me like a cat licking its lips over a wounded mouse i pray im not pregnant december thanks to the mother of god my period arrived today my coworkers are all treating me as if i were a leper i thought because of jerry but mr mossbach the head of my unit took me aside today people are talking about you you spend too much time with that arab gal and that means your teammates arent sure they can trust you to be on uncle sams side trust allie were a team so amanis neighbors may attack her family if they know she works with americans and my neighbors attack me because i drink coffee with amani she calls me alia an arabic name it means exalted or noble and amani means wishes or dreams so i call her desideria how can it be a sin to find more pleasure in her society than in that of silly girls or drunken boys of course i have no sinful thoughts for her only gratitude that i have found a friend in this strange country in january alexandra was transferred to another unit to achilles my pulse beat faster was this where her life intersected with chads i didnt see any mention of his name her family calls to her mother emails to nadia allies own private wrestling over her friendship with amani my desire is for my desideria she wrote more than once and then crossed out and recrossed out the sentence the men in tintreys operation outnumbered women by about ten to one so there was constant pressure on alexandra to date after her thanksgiving date with jerry she avoided or tried to avoid being alone with any of the men after work hours perhaps father vicente is right that all sex outside marriage is sinful and therefore without pleasure but my roommates both have male lovers and seem to have no unhappiness they tease me and call me the ice queen as long as i do my job well and give no cause for complaint at work surely all will be well february amani came to find me this afternoon she was waiting in the shadows of the building until she found me alone in the supply room alia how have i offended you she asked her beautiful dark eyes full of tears desideria mi corazón how could you ever offend me i said it is only because of my boss he ordered me to stay away from you then she asked what my words meant not boss my spanish my heart i said we call our sisters that its a pet name i was terrified she would think i was making an improper gesture to her my heart she smiled and told me the words in arabic and then somehow we were holding each other and my own heart felt at peace and then began their trysts the secret meetings in a bombedout flat near the artgallery district i took a picture through the broken window to send to nadia a date palm which somehow survived bombs and lack of water its crown is level with the roof of the building and in the summer amani tells me boys climb to the roof and jump to the tree to harvest what fruit the tree still produces i asked nadia to make a painting of it and when she did i was able to present it to my corazón allie wrote of the pleasure they had in each others bodies the delight in hiding from the bosses from the soldiers the drunkenness the violence of the war itself but she was always tormenting herself over her sin and wondering if she should confess it to the base priest but he is such a soldier such a military man how could he counsel me except with more military advice to find a soldier and have the children i want to share only with my hearts desire and then the inevitable happened someone started spying on them allie found a crude drawing on her desk heard snickers from her coworkers her roommates asked her to move out they didnt want to live with a traitor mr mossbach the boss told her no one trusted her because she wasnt a team player my work is always properly done perfectly done even now when someone on the team sabotages it i stay late and get it all together how can you make this accusation he laughed suggested they have a drink after work hed help make it all right for her a drink led to attempted sex she fought him off and then her life became hell indeed may the weather here is as hot and difficult as my own poor life i go when i can find a way to leave unwatched to the little room amani found for us but it has been many weeks now since i saw her may today i finally saw my desideria she also has had to stay awaytoo many people are watching her someone maybe even the americans warned her cousins that she is keeping undesirable company it is easy for her family to keep her almost as a prisoner after work hours she says she may have to quit her job that someone in our office has suggested to her cousins and her mother that she is secretly seeing an american only the poverty of her family their need for the money tintrey pays her lets her keep the job for now but my noble one my exalted alia we must be so careful no one must see us together in the office do you understand my joy with her is great and yet my sorrow is great too why is it wrong for us to meet because we are of different religions or because we are two women jesus if you are the god of love then why is my love to be punished with so much sorrow that was the last entry i flipped through the remaining pages which were blank and then i came upon a letter printed in black ink on a thin piece of onionskin the ink had bled through making it hard to read dear nadia i hope i may address you by your name without offense you are the beloved sister of my beloved friend now dead when i heard of her death i made my way to our room perhaps she told you of our room with the date tree outside the window that told us life was still possible someone had been in there not a drifting person rather someone who came with the evil intent my hands shook as i walked through the destruction of our small sanctuary our earthen pitcher broken our mirror shattered the linen cloth embroidered by my grandmother ripped in two they had poured blood on our bed much destruction have i seen in this war but this destruction was so personal against me personally and against your sister that i almost fainted from the hatred that had been in a room where only love existed before i knew my beloved alia wrote in this book and kept it in a secret place we made behind the bed too many eyes were spying on her in her living place and in her working place she could not leave her writings where unfriendly eyes would see them thanks be to god that the evil ones did not find our hiding place i wish i could keep my alias book but too many eyes look upon me also iraqi eyes american eyes mullah spies so i send this book of her writings to you keep them safe as a sacred memory of your sisters most noble and beautiful soul she adored you and little clara and worried constantly over your fates but god will keep you safe you are in the country of safety i enclose no address for no letter can come to me that will not be read by many eyes before mine ever see it amani known to your sister as desideria othello misfires id been so absorbed in alexandras journal that i hadnt noticed time passing it was almost three am when i finally finished reading what a sorrowful document at a time in life when alexandra should have been glorying in the chance to explore the world and her own place in it shed been pursued instead by demons the fierce teachings of her religion the taunting by her coworkers and bossperhaps all those things pushed her to a breaking point perhaps thats why she volunteered to drive a truck along the road that led to her death some of the writing showed glimpses of happiness especially the passages where she described her siblingsnadia painting a cartoon of tintrey for allie ernest laughing with her it was hard to think of them now nadia and allie both dead ernest so damaged he couldnt speak clearly about his sisters you live in the country of safety amani had written to nadia in the country of safety nadia had been murdered ernest severely injured but nothing showed a connection between chad vishneski and alexandra except for the fact that both had been in iraq alexandra had worked for tintreys achilles division chad had one of the achilles shields in his duffel bag tintrey had nine thousand employees in iraq and the us had over a hundred thousand troops there it wasnt beyond belief that chad and alexandra had met but she hadnt mentioned any chad in the journal if i went to iraq and somehow found amani and jerry the programmer and mr mossbach and persuaded them by unimagined means to tell me everything they knew about alexandras eight months in iraq and her last day on earth i still might not find out how she died if i was going to untangle the story i would have to do so from the evidence i could find here at home clara said her mother and nadia had fought over the insurance payments the guamans received after alexandras death the parents wanted to sue tintrey but the lawyer rainier cowles showed up and persuaded them to accept a settlement there was nothing strange about that or even unsavory but it so angered nadia that she walked out of her parents home and was still estranged from her mother when she died and clara believed no one was allowed to talk about alexandras death i wandered restlessly to the window carrying my glass the journal had absorbed me to the point where id forgotten to drink the whisky i parted the blinds half expecting to see a date tree but of course there was nothing but snow and ice and a few latenight cars bumping through the ruts rainier cowles had come to club gouge with the owner of tintrey and the head of the companys iraq division to watch the body artists homage to nadia the mens lockerroom jokes gave lie to any notion that they were there out of respect for the dead besides when i went up to the tintrey offices gilbert scalia knew exactly who alexandra guaman was and how she died maybe tintrey kept track of the guamans because they feared a wrongfuldeath suit i let the curtain fall tomorrowor rather later todayi would visit the guamans there had to be a way to get them to talk to me and then i would buy a very large crystal ball and divine where the body artist had gone to ground on that helpful thought i stumbled into bed this time i fell asleep in my dreams alexandra and amani were painting a picture of a date palm across my body in the background karen buckley her transparent eyes half shut was crying my sister died too it was a relief when the phone pulled me out of sleep a little before eleven even though the caller turned out to be john vishneski warshawski someone came after chad just like you thought they might my buddy cleon was here and a good thing too attacked right in the icu how did they get past the nurses dressed up like a nurse some blond gal looked like that actress in chicago cleon saidall brassy hair and whatnot but in a uniform cleon looked through the glass and saw her holding a towel over chads nose and you better believe that he busted in there fast enough to set a record but she skittered out the other end of the ward and disappeared what the hell is going on here what did chad get himself into i didnt try to answer that ill be over in half an hour i said i was thoroughly awake and thoroughly scared why were they going after chad now had they learned that i had the piece of body armor chad had ripped open and if so how while i made coffee i did some stretches gingerly favoring my abdomen the muscles were healing faster than id thought they would even though the color was still horrible i even managed a few jumping jacks i drank the coffee while i quickly showered whisked on powder and blusher put on a serviceable black pantsuit my right hand was still tender but i could squeeze it into a glove i could even squeeze a trigger with it everything was coming up roses before i left i locked alexandras journal in my closet safe behind my shoe tree mr contreras was continuing to deal with the dogs and our dog walker which took a load off my mind i clomped down the back stairs in my heavy boots and drove over to beth israel where i made my way through the maze of corridors to the intensive care unit the charge nurse visibly rattled demanded an id from me before shed even summon the vishneskis exhusband exwife emerged hand in hand whatever differences had driven them apart twenty years ago were beside the point with their sons life in danger i dont understand this vic john said who wants my boy dead how is he i asked has he shown any more signs of recovery hes opening his eyes more often mona said and seems alert for as much as two minutes at a time theyre saying thats a really hopeful sign he hasnt spoken again but dr eve is pretty optimistic that he will start speaking soon she says its just hard to tell with brain injuries but that the scans look hopeful only if he isnt going to be safe here i dont know she dabbed at her eyes and john patted her hand i didnt want to call the cops john added because they might say he was good enough to go back to that prison hospital and i wont let that happen but of course the hospital filed a police report and weve had someone here already this morning dr eve came down and told the detective chad was still in critical condition buti dont know its all a mess yes i said but im getting closer to some answers i just need one or two more breaks in the meantime one of chads buddies is a marine staff sergeantexmarine anyway hes out of work and i can pay him something to come up here and be chads bodyguard ill clear it with the hospitals executive director if sergeant jepson takes the owl shift maybe you can do the daytime the vishneskis took me in with them to look at chad hed been such a big angry man the times id seen him lying in a hospital bed his tattooed arms full of iv needles he seemed to have shrunk it was unsettling to see him like this but i knelt next to him and clasped one of his hands you dont know me chad but im a friend i said quietly im working with tim radke and marty jepson and were going to save you youre going to be okay so relax and rest and get better i couldnt tell if he was hearing me but i repeated the message several times when i got back to my feet the vishneskis said they didnt want to leave chad i went down alone to executive director max loewenthals office where i spoke with his administrative assistant cynthia she knew about the attack max had already been briefed by his security chief were moving chad to a private room she said and well have someone from security there twentyfourseven but the cost of an intensive care patient in a private roomchads veterans benefits wont cover it cynthia this is so wrecked if someone murders chad his parents will sue you for negligence and youll end up paying buckets in damagessurely its cheaper to suck up some of the cost of a private room dont lecture me on costs she broke in im on the page with you but i dont run this circus and neither does max were doing a lot for you here but the last i saw this wasnt the v i warshawski hospital for indigent veterans beth israel like most other illinois hospitals devoted less than one percent of its patient care to the indigent but i needed help not combat so i only said youre right cynthia youre right im sending a marine up to act as bodyguard thatll take care of some of the expense right if you dont have to use one of your own people i hesitated the man who stopped the intruder described her as looking like renée zellweger in chicago anton kystarnik has at least one woman on his hit team cynthia had never heard of kystarnik but when i explained who he was she said shed mention it to their security chief and to max if its any comfort this isnt going to go on much longer i said ive stirred the hornets nest theyre buzzing around like mad stinging wherever they see exposed flesh and thats going to lead me to the queen or king probably in this case thats no comfort at all cynthia cried we cant have our hospital turned into a war zone its bad enough all the gangbangers coming in here who have to have their weapons pried away from themsometimes even in the operating room i cant worry about somebody whos supposed to be in police custody to begin with i couldnt think of anything to say except maybe to beseech her not to tell lotty and that didnt seem like the act of an optimist instead i promised to wrap things up as quickly as possible if theres one more incident like this chad will have to be moved cynthia warned me and max will tell you the same with that stern valediction weighing me down i returned to my car i wanted to get in touch with my cousin to see if she had marty jepsons cell phone number but she wasnt answering the office line or her own cell urgent call asap i texted her before driving to thirtyfifth and michigan where i tried to see terry finchley liz milkova the officer id spoken to the day before came out to meet me i went through the motions wed met at club gouge wed spoken yesterday id worked with terry for years several things have happened i added including chad vishneski being attacked in the icu but in addition to that i can explain how anton kystarnik has been communicating with his subordinates so any eavesdropping devices cant tag him i can take a message and give it to detective finchley id like to give all the details to terry myself her eyes so dark a blue they were almost black darkened even more i may be a woman and a junior detective but i know how to take a statement i felt my eyes turn hot i am one of the oldfashioned feminists who helped open this door for you officer milkova so dont get on your high horse with me if you were eliot ness in the flesh i still would want to talk to terry unless its you and not he whos in charge of the guaman murder now someone behind me started to clap and i turned terry had come out into the lobby warshawski if i live to be a hundred ill never get more satisfaction than ive had just now having someone hand you your own shoulder chips on a plate i gave a twisted smile i live to serve others finch did you know someone dressed up like a nurse and went into the beth israel icu in the middle of the night she tried to smother chad vishneski with a towel a friend of john vishneskis was there and chased her out this was news to finchley and he sent milkova off to find out who in the police department had spoken to the icu staff he took me into a conference room where i gave him a detailed description of the way kystarnik and rodney treffer had used the body artist as a message board thats interesting warshawski but not real helpful since you say your stripper or artist or whatever has vanished and club gouge is closed for the time being thanks to kystarnik you say but the owner that olympia woman says otherwise he held up a hand as i started to protest im not saying shes right and youre wrong im just saying we dont have any basis to go collecting guysor galswho work for kystarnik and believe me id like to these eastern european thugs have added a whole new dimension to weapons and cruelty that our gangbangers never aspired to as for rodney treffer guy took a beating the other night and you called to report it is that right no i looked at him steadily guy had me cuffed and was kicking me in the stomachi lifted my sweater to show him my colorcoded abdomenwhen he slipped and hit his head on the ice a couple of iraqi vets came along and made sure rodneys pals didnt finish me off officer milkova had come back into the room she gasped at my bruises you file a formal complaint terry asked not yet i said but ill be happy to the vetsa marine sergeant and an army systems prohelped me persuade treffers subordinates to explain the code treffer was writing on the body artist its irrelevant now since the clubs been trashed but kystarnik may revive his code to use elsewhere ive written it all out for you when hed read it on my computer screen terry nodded and sent milkova for a data stick so he could make a copy of it you think this has something to do with the guaman womans murder he asked i dont know its all murky right now everything came together through the body artist but until she shows up i dont know how well connect those dots milkova reappeared with a data stick i copied the report then got to my feet the vishneski kid hes still out terry asked casually i didnt think he needed to know that chad had woken up long enough to ask for his vest the vishneskis say their neurosurgeon told your officer that hes still critical he hasnt regained consciousness as far as i know as soon as hes stable he goes back to county the fact that anton kystarnik used club gouge as a private mailbox has nothing to do with guamans murder vishneski is still in the frame as far as were concerned even though someone tried to smother him this morning i asked could be some completely different quarrel could be a friend of the dead woman looking for revenge you havent shown me another believable perp im working on it terry and im pretty darned close right now i got to my feet by the way someone using kystarniks address plunked down twentythree thousand in cash to cover rodneys hospital bill what does that tell you that treffer has richer friends than i do a molten house i went with officer milkova to file a formal complaint against rodney i didnt go into every detail of the evening especially not the part in antonsor owen widermayersmercedes but anton was crafty enough to file a complaint against me on rodneys behalf so i covered as much as i could without getting jepson in hot water on a weapons charge when we finished i tried my cousin again but still could reach only her voice mail a nagging fear that she might have been ambushed at my office made me take a detour there but my half of the warehouse was empty and showed no signs that anyone had broken in before taking off again i checked my messages rivka darling had called demanding a report on what i was doing to locate the body artist my most important client darraugh graham wanted to see me at my earliest convenience i called his assistant and said id be free the next afternoon everything else could wait i drove south to pilsen to the guaman home lights were on in the living room when i rang the bell clara opened the door the length of the chain when she saw me she gasped and turned pale what are you doing here she asked i need to talk to your parents its time we all came out from under the cloud of secrecy weve been under the past few weeks she put her hand to her mouth and looked over her shoulder i could hear the television and ernest laughing loudly at something he saw on it clara i found alexandras journal what other secrets are you sitting on allies journal butit was gone clara quién está her grandmother called someone for mom clara said so you went to nadias apartment after she died i said when before or after the place was trashed the grandmother appeared behind clara the two had a sharp exchange in spanish and then clara opened the door the grandmother looked at me puzzled as if trying to place me v i warshawski i said i think i saw you with your grandson at the rehab center a couple of weeks ago youre with the hospital she asked in english no i she was a friend of nadias clara interrupted quickly she wants to talk to mom about nadias apartment the grandmothers face clouded with sorrow are you wanting to take over the lease for nadia she asked i shook my head perhaps you dont know this but someone broke into the apartment they did a lot of damage but nadias artwork is still there im thinking you should go soon if you want to rescue her paintings broke in oh dios what next what next the grandmother wrung her hands but she tried to pull herself together asking if i wanted tea or perhaps a coke my daughterinlaw she will be home soon come in come in its too cold here by the door i followed her into the living room where ernest was watching the three stooges clapping his hands and recapitulating the action for his sister and grandmother between the television and his shouts it actually was easy to talk to clara privately nadia told you she had the journal i asked she showed it to me clara said a friend of allies sent it to nadia and she was so shocked she had to talk to someone she bit her lips i wish it had been someone else i wishi dont knowi wish i didnt know these secrets the friendthat was amani your sisters iraqi friend clara hesitated then nodded behind us the grandmother had dozed off in her chair even though ernest was yelling way to go curly way to go nadia didnt track down the body artist until this past thanksgiving i said but alexandra has been dead for nearly two years now when did she actually get the journal it came about six months after allie died clara said but itat first nadia said she didnt want to read it it was too hard what with allie dead and the fight with mom over the insurance so she made a little shrine for allie instead and locked the journal in a reliquary she made it especially so it would be the right size out of papiermâché painted with roses and other symbols of allies beauty i nodded relatives of holocaust victims sometimes lived for decades with precious diaries or recipe books from their dead unable to read them it wasnt so surprising that nadia had waited over a year so nadia finally read alexandras diary i said right before thanksgiving it was it was so shocking so hurtful that nadia felt she had to tell me she couldnt bear the knowledge all by herself thats what she said how could allie how could she betray us all and with a muslim i imagined amanis sistershow could youand with an american and a catholicbut i only said that muslim woman befriended your sister and kept her from feeling so lonely in a strange country you dont understand she protested allie told me she was going to iraq to make more money so i could go to a good college then it turned out it was an act of penance for herher week in michigan with that body painter nadia was a painter ernest announced catching part of our conversation before she went to heaven nothing is ever just one thing i suggested it was penance it was good money she believed in you the smartest of the guaman sisters she called you she did love you you know she did want a bright future for you clara played with the zipper on her sweater but some of the tension in her face eased and then you went to nadias apartment when i asked right after we left the cemetery everyone came back here for food and drinks and i just went out through the alley and caught the blue line up to nadias place everything was finei mean everything was awfulbut you said thered been a breakin and her apartment had been trashed well that hadnt happened when i was there everything was just like she left it except the little box was gone and so was the journal her amber eyes were clouded with fear the front doorbell rang after a glance at her grandmother who woke up with a start clara went to the door i peered around the corner it was cristina guaman waiting for someone to undo the chain so she could get in mother and daughter spoke and then cristina came into the living room eyes flashing chin thrust out you have no right to be here leave now the grandmother said something in spanish an apology to cristina for letting me in but her daughterinlaw ignored her you take advantage of my daughters trusting nature but i know your kind feasting on the bones of the dead leave now i got to my feet and picked up my coat when alexandra died i said you threatened tintrey with a wrongfuldeath suit didnt you ms guaman and then rainier cowles came along and offered you a settlement ernest needed extra care his bills were killing you you didnt have a choice you took the money whos been talking to you clara what have you told this this parasite please ms guaman its not a big secret why turn it into one what kind of threat did rainier cowles hold over you if it was to reveal alexandras private life to the world its not a world that cares very much about that kind of secret none of this is your business if you think you know something that we will pay you to learn think again were not buying anything you might be selling clara murmured a protest but it died in the face of her mothers molten glare even though the accusation was unjust it still embarrassed me and i buttoned my coat without saying anything else ernest looked from the television to me and suddenly made a connection of his own puppy he cried this lady has my puppy he ran from the room and came back with the picture from the pet store id handed him in the rehabilitation hospital it was grimy now from much caressing allie shes my allie big allie is a dove she flies with jesus little allie is my puppy he kissed the page then suddenly turned red and shouted at me where is she youre hiding little allie give me little allie he grabbed my briefcase and dumped the contents on the floor when he didnt see a puppy he sat on the floor and began to tear up one of my documents clara bent over and snatched it from him i gathered up my laptop my wallet and the rest of my possessions clara hunted under the couch for a lipstick that had rolled away by the time id put everything away ernest had forgotten his outburst and was watching the three stooges again i left without saying another word its dangerous to know vi i sat in my car for a time trying to remember why id thought it was a good idea to visit the guamans or why id thought i had a right to intrude on the elder ms guaman when she was at the hospital with ernest or even why i thought i should be a private eye at all instead of a street cleaner at least at the end of a days work a street cleaner left things better than she found them i finally turned on the engine and drove up to my office wondering what crises might await me there petra for instance had not been in touch i owed darraugh graham a report terry finchley still wanted to try chad vishneski for nadias murder i didnt know where rodney treffer was lurking karen buckleyfrannie pindero had vanished plenty for the dedicated pi to do without tormenting a braindamaged youth and his family over a nonexistent dog when i pulled into my parking lot i saw marty jepsons beatup truck i hurried into my office imagining disasters but petra was there with jepson shed dragooned him into helping her sort the mail vic she said what a day so much happened too much excitement even to contact me o texting queen i dropped my phone in the slush when marty and me were roping my car up to his truck she explained and that seemed to kill it and dont worry about martyabout paying him i meanbecause i know you didnt authorize me putting him to work ill split my check with him only i couldnt have managed the day without him staff sergeant i said if youve spent the day with petra you probably deserve some kind of battle pay he blushed and said uh maam uh vic it was a pleasure to help you out uh i wonder if you can call me marty im not really a marine anymore you know people get to be called by the highest rank they ever achieve i explained even if theyve retired like right now petra could be called pest by anyone whod like to know why she couldnt pick up a landline oh vic dont be such a crab cake your phone numbers theyre in my cellphone memory which is as dead as my poor old car you cannot believe how much theyre going to charge although of course i have insurance at least im on my moms policy she stopped sticking her lower lip out as she always did when she was thinking seriously maybe i shouldnt allow her to pay for it but gosh with all my bills and only this temp job for you i think your mother would be pleased to know you still rely on her i interrupted but im the one who wrecked your car so ill take care of the repairs that your insurance doesnt cover vic youre an angel im sorry i called you names last night she launched back into a highoctane account of her days adventures destroyed cell phone towed car spilled soup on new jacket although the stain on the cuff maybe was the pizza theyd had at plotzkys last nightwhat a cool bar the avalanche of information was making me reel i went to my back room where i keep a bottle of johnnie walker black for emergencies i dont approve of drinking on the job but responding to petra right after my painful meeting with the guamans felt like a medical emergency to me i offered the bottle to petra and marty but neither liked whisky its like drinking gasoline vic was the fetching way my cousin put it dont you have any beer the whisky washed through me and i felt warm for the first time since id left mexico city at new years i sat at my desk and smiled sweetly at petra youll have to buy your own beer you towed the pathfinder then what oh well she said then we came here to see if you like needed anything done and there was a message from cheviot labs mr rieff he called to say theyd found something really amazing when he ran his tests for you guess what they found the codes for the us nuclear arsenal i suggested oh vic nothing that amazing justthe stuff that was supposed to be in the body armorthe uh ceramic or whatever it issomeone took it out and replaced it with ordinary beach sand can you believe that i put my whisky down did he say could he prove that it was inside the shield to begin with i mean chad had poked a bunch of holes in the shield how do we know what was in it first petra hunched a shoulder i dont know uh maam uh vic we did get the report since we didnt know where you were or what you needed we drove up to northbrook and picked it up from mr rieff marty handed me a sealed envelope with the familiar crest of the cheviot rams in the corner i slit it open and scanned the pages which bristled with moieties van der waals forces carbon and other arcane phrases that i should have paid more attention to in professor turkevichs chemistry lectures when i was an undergraduate but it was too late to fret about that now i called up cheviot labs sandy rieff was working late that was one good thing this ratio you have in the report i asked seventyfive percent sand mixed with twentyfive percent fullerene how is that different from what it should be it should be a hundred percent gallium arsenide fullerenes said rieff and how sure are you that this diluted mix was in chads shield from the getgo my best materials engineer genny winne did the analysis winne says that shes prepared to testify on both those points and she doesnt say that unless she thinks her results are unimpeachable i thought back to the fortune article to tintreys rush to get their achilles body shield to market to take advantage of all those juicy iraqi war contracts so tintrey basically put out a shield that wouldnt stop a bullet i wonder if that was a temporary thing to grab market share or an ongoing policy can you order some achilles armor from several different production runs and get your ms winne to analyze the content will do rieff said what kind of priority priority service but not premium have you read the whole report rieff asked one of the oddities winne found was scorching around the holes in the mitt that fabric is too tough to cut without a special blade so he must have burned it to get into it thats the one thing a defense lawyer could jump on in claiming the contents had been tampered with he hung up but i held on to the receiver staring at the desktop if chad knew that his buddies had died because their armor didnt protect them no wonder hed freaked out when he saw nadia paint the achilles logo on the body artist hed accused nadia of spying on him he must have thought she worked for tintrey i looked up to see petra watching me anxiously vic she said is there some kind of problem not a problem i said slowly justi think i understand what happened but not how to prove it not who pulled the trigger on the gun that shot nadia guaman but why they did and why they framed chad marty how much did chad say about the body armor jepson frowned he never stopped talking about it maamvic we knew he was angry but he was always angry about the way him and his men had been treated generally but did he talk about the armor malfunctioning he said his men should be alive that their armor didnt protect them but maam no disrespect you get these ieds and nothing can protect you so he didnt say the shields were full of sand instead of the nanoparticles they were supposed to contain he shook his head trying to remember i know he said he was going to tell the whole world how his squad got butchered but you know that was just talk it was his way of letting off steam least thats how tim and me and the other guys took it i dont remember him ever saying he did like you did sent the armor to a lab to get it analyzed no i think he tested it by shooting at it that explained the burn marks around the holes in the mitt as well as the holes in monas bedroom wall that had bothered her so much chad had attached the shield to the wall and shot at it the bullet went through the armor and destroyed the drywall behind it that was his proof but how had the men at tintrey known what he was doing his blog i said the sections that got erased i bet those were where he described the mitt we need tim we need to see if he can resurrect chads blog i got up jakes leaving for europe this evening i want to see him before he takes off can you two track down tim and see if hell come up to my place when he gets off work in the meantime make two copies of this report will you send one to murray ryerson at the star the other goes to freeman carter id offered to drive jake to ohare but the packing of his basses for international travel was a painstaking if not heartstopping business with a hundred thousand dollars worth of instruments he bought tickets so that they could ride in the plane with him but they required extra scrutiny and careful repacking once hed been through security the manager of his chamber group was bringing a roadie just to oversee the luggage jake greeted me on the landing when he heard me on the stairs vic you made it i was afraid you were shooting somebody or being shot at he took me in his arms and danced me into his apartment where the living room was filled with the luggage including his two bassesthe modern one for the chamber group the period double bass for his earlymusic group in their fiberglass cases the instruments looked like stiff elderly people at a concert i bowed to them and sang a few bars from non mi dir bellidol mio my mothers signature aria jake took me into the bedroom where hed touchingly set up a little table with champagne and a vase of flowers three coach seats i cant afford to take my children firstclass so well drink my champagne now he slid my heavy winter layers over my head and unhooked my bra he winced a little when he saw the bruises on my stomach but he didnt back away from me as id feared by the time he had to get up to shower and dress for his flight some of my earlier anguish over my visit with the guamans had eased i lingered in bed until the bell rang when i pulled on my jeans and one of my sweaters while jake went out to greet his roadie i stood on the landing with my champagne as the two men carted out luggage and instruments it will be almost april when you come home ill miss you but ill follow your concerts online when theyre being broadcast i hope youll be olivecolored again by the time im home he said this green and purple doesnt look so good on you vi try to look after yourself okay a quick kiss and then he was gone i lingered on the landing but there wasnt time for me to feel sorry for myself about half an hour after jake left petra and marty jepson arrived with a couple of pizzas mr contreras and the dogs helped us eat while we waited for tim radke when tim showed up around nine he set straight to work but even though he managed to crack chads login and password he couldnt recreate the blog the entries had been deleted and that was that or he never wrote them tim said i cant tell its not like the artists website where we could see someone was issuing a command to shut down the site here theres just no trace that anything was ever there if we found his computer i asked he shook his head youd have to hack into the blog server to see what was deleted and even if i wanted to go to prison for chad which i dont im not good enough to do that kind of search the only thing we might find if we had his machine is if he sent an email or wrote a letter or something about the armor i had to be satisfied with that although it wasnt the news id hoped to receive the young people took off to go to a club they invited me to join them in a way that made me feel like an elderly aunt and like an elderly aunt i stayed home and went to bed oh those days of having so much energy that i could work all day and go dancing at night i wanted that time back it was after one when the doorbell woke me someone was leaning on the buzzer so hard theyd roused the dogs i could hear the barking as i made my way to the door on sleepthickened legs i pulled on my coat put my gun in the pocket and tried to run down the stairs so i could get to the door ahead of mr contreras petra i was betting petra had locked herself out of her apartment i rehearsed a stern speech on how she could check into a motel or sleep on the livingroom floor the ugly words died in my throat clara guaman stood outside her right eye swollen shut her nose bleeding when i pulled open the door she collapsed in my arms our lady protector of documents you will be well little one just uncomfortable for a few days with this packing in your nose now who did this did victoria involve you in some desperate scheme lotty i started to protest but the words died in my throat if i hadnt nosed my way into the guaman home tonights assault probably wouldnt have happened we were in lottys clinic on damen avenue along with mr contreras who had surged out of his apartment moments after claras arrival my god is it peewee he cried when he saw that the face of the young woman a stranger was covered in blood hed ordered me to bring her into his place we laid her on his couch and he made an ice pack for her face you stay with her doll make her lie still im getting dressed and then well get her to the doc clara was clutching her french textbook and she wouldnt relinquish it i wrapped her in a blanket and concentrated on cleaning the blood from her face while mr contreras changed out of his magentastriped pajamas i called lotty from the phone in his living room to ask if she could cut through the red tape at beth israels emergency room for us shed been sound asleep but years of practicing medicine made her alert at once she told me to bring clara to her clinic if nothing is broken well put her together there more comfortably and without worrying all those social workers and insurance companies about reports on injuries to a minor child as soon as mr contreras was dressed i ran upstairs for jeans a sweater and a spare coat for clara whod arrived wearing nothing over her jeans and st teresa sweatshirt i drove the two miles from our place to the clinic with a lottylike disregard for traffic laws once lotty assured herself that claras injuries were superficialno broken jaw no damaged eye socketsshe inserted codeinelaced swabs into claras nose and then packed it with what looked like a mile of gauze lotty applauded mr contreras for knowing to ice the swollen eye and broken nose then turned a stern gaze on me wanting to know what kind of scheme i was running that endangered children it wasnt vic clara said she was sitting in a big reclining chair in the examination room knees up head back another ice pack pressed to her face her voice was a little slurred from the drugs lotty had given her but she seemed anxious to tell us what had happened i guess they had someone watching our house vic she said like you know i told you how prince rainier thought we were talking to you i guess someone told him you still were i felt sick to my stomach as if rodney were standing over me kicking me again maybe i should find him and let him do it a few more times lotty was righti had been running a scheme that endangered children i couldnt wallow in guilt nowi needed to get clara to tell me how bad the damage was before lottys drugs put her to sleep i prodded her to continue they must have waited until papi got home from work he was on the threetoeleven shift today so it was almost midnight before he got back he was eating supper in the kitchen and they just battered down the back door and came in itthe noise the shouting these men all in blackit was so terrifying i dont even know how my abuelita didnt have a heart attack i was doing homework and i ran to the kitchen mamá and ernie and my grandma were all asleep but the noise woke them up the men they made us all come into the living room one of them had me he was holding me i tried kicking him and thats when he hit me the first time she was trembling at the memory but i spoke sharply forcing her to focus on details how many men four how were they dressed like ernest used to dress when he rode his motorcycle all black leather and studs that was almost the most awful part because ernie started shrieking were getting our bikes out were going for a ride so these men they yelled at him to shut up and when he wouldnt first one man punched him and when he still kept yelling this other man he hit me papi and mamá they stood there like frozen statues she let out a bark of laughter that turned into a sob lotty wrapped her in a blanket and forced some hot sweet tea into her after a few moments when she seemed calmer i asked why she had come to me vic shes had enough lottys voice was a whip she needs to sleep and in a safe place claras been playing with fire for too long i said if shes ready to tell me what she knows i need to hear it now before anyone else gets hurt or killed thats why i came to you vic clara said because they said if we didnt give them the report theyd burn the house down my stomach became a lump of ice what report the army sent it to my parents after alexandra died claras hands were shaking so badly that the tea slopped onto the blanket she was holding i took the cup from her and held it to her mouth i waited while she gulped the tea down before pushing her to tell me more about the report its what started all the trouble only i didnt know back then i was a kid still no one told me anything but its why nadia and my mom were fighting all the time my mom tonight first she told the gangbangers she didnt know what they were talking about only when they punched me again and my nose started to bleed she went to get it see shed hidden it inside the statue of the virgin of guadalupe over allies bed shei should have told her but i thoughti dont know what i thought i was just praying and praying that the gangbangers would leave when they couldnt find it they said we had twentyfour hours to give it to them or the house would be burned down or blown up i dont remember which they left out the front door i just grabbed my french book and went out the back door down the alley i ran all the way to ashland with papi chasing after me begging me to stop but i found a cab right away and came to vics place your french book mr contreras said why the heck would you even be thinking about your studies at a time like that and what about vic gave me a twenty for an emergency she opened the book to the back and showed us where shed glued a piece of notebook paper over the verb tables to make a kind of pocket yeah but that dont explain also i put this inside clara reached into the pocket and pulled out a set of folded papers which she handed to me when i opened them i found a letter with an autopsy report attached i began to readclassic pugilistic attitude absent lack of smoke stains around nostrils questions about cause of death led to decision to perform autopsy charring made it difficult to extract femoral blood sample anterior aspect of right wrist which survived fire intact shows a inch contusion i felt my blood congeal in my arms dynamite clara had been carrying dynamite to school with her every day as if it were her lunch did you read this i asked i tried to clara whispered i theyre about allie how she died i mean the report came from some doctor in iraq who saw her body after she died thats why nadia and my mother fought i think nadia knew what was in the letter butthe journal was sent to nadia as next of kin and the doctor wrote to your mother i asked cant you see the girl is worn out mr contreras interrupted she dont need you bullying her hes right you know lotty said im worn out too but we have to do this i pushed my fingers into my cheekbones as if to push back my own overwhelming fatigue if clara if her family are going to be safe i need to understand this tangled mess of documents who hid what why they hid them i think the muslim lady sent the journal to nadia because she was afraid if my mom knew about her and allie shed just burn everything at least nadia said that was the reason clara was still whispering as if it could keep the reality of her familys torment at bay does your mother know you have these i asked clara grimaced bunching up her cheeks maybe she guessed see allie nadia and me we all shared a bedroom after allie died mamá she created this whole shrine by allies bed in a way its freaky to sleep in there but its also comforting i feel like allie is there with me you know anyway after nadia got killed i came home one night and my mom was praying in there she ordered me out of the room and i thought it was well you know she wanted to be private while she prayed maybe she wanted to ask nadia to forgive her but later when i went to bed i saw the virgin wasnt sitting flat on the base so i went to put her back and mama had taken the bottom off and put these papers inside except a bit of the paper was sticking out so you put them in your french book why i asked she hunched a shoulder i dont know it was nadia was dead and mamá had fought with her over allie i cant explain it i thought maybe if i dont know if mamá had listened to her nadia would still be alive and i kept trying to decide if i should show the papers to you if they were the reason nadia was killed although everyone said that crazy soldier shot her victoria that really is enough lotty said i will call her mother so the poor woman isnt completely ravaged by grief and then lets get clara someplace safe to spend whats left of the night she can stay with me i said but only for tonight im too visible a target for the people who came after her family and her mitch could protect her mr contreras huffed he hates not being thought strong enough to protect a girl lotty gave him what max calls her princess of austria look do not argue with royalty back out of the room keep subversive thoughts to yourself mr contreras subsided into a grumble its all well and good to freeze our blood lotty i said but it doesnt solve the problem of where she can stay were all tired now lotty said lets get some sleep and pray that inspiration comes in our dreams come my surgery schedule starts in three hours i started to put the documents into a large envelope but stopped and frowned over them kystarnik or rainier cowles or someone at tintrey wanted these so badly theyd gone down to the guamans hunting for them i tried to imagine what i could do with them to keep them safe lotty called the guamans while i went to the clinics business office to make copies i could hear lottys voice sharp authoritativeim the doctor im doing whats best for your childwithout making out the words i put one copy into an envelope addressed to my lawyer which i stuck in the clinics outbound mail basket i mailed a second copy to myself the others i tucked into an envelope underneath my sweater i thought about sending a copy over to murray at the heraldstar but wasnt sure how much publicity i wanted for them right now everything settled i asked when i got back to lottys office lotty nodded i explained we were watching clara overnight but that youd be down with her in the morning to talk about how to look after her theyre not happy how could they be but they spoke to clara who made it clear that she wasnt coming home tonight but what are you going to do claras amber eyes were dark with drugs and fear they said they would blow up the house i shouldnt have run away i should have just given the papers to them oh why was i ever born why wasnt i the one to get killed instead of allie and nadia i took her in my arms you did the right thing baby i said if youd given them the autopsy report they knew you and your mom had read it its your ticket to safety giving me the report ill make sure they dont know where to look for it and ill keep you safe i promise how i didnt know but it was the least i could do after exposing the fragile remnants of the family to tonights assault you come on home with us mr contreras said gruffly vic and me well get you settled for the night and you listen to vic she knows what shes talking about a heroic admission i grinned at him and he turned red covering his discomfiture by taking clara from me and half carrying her out the clinic door as lotty locked up and we bundled into our cars i began to worry whether the thugs who had attacked the guamans might have tailed clara when she ran from home as we followed lotty onto irving park road i tried to look for anyone who might be trailing us i couldnt really tell in the dark which set of headlights looked familiar just to be on the safe side i trailed lotty the two miles to her highrise on lake shore drive we bumped over the ice and potholes without incident even when lotty ran the red light at ashland avenue lotty is a terrible driver the kind who insists that all her dings and near misses are due to the incompetence of every other car on the road back at our own place i circled the block looking for anyone who might be staking out the building all the cars on the street were quiet still i sent mr contreras in through the back with clara while i parked on a side street some distance away mr contreras and i decided to leave mitch downstairs to sound the alarm if anyone tried breaking in clara and i took peppy up to the third floor for comfort by now clara was more asleep than awake so i helped her undress pulled a big sweatshirt over her head and tucked her into my own bed peppy jumped up and curled into a ball at her side i remembered the grandmother saying clara was allergic but her fingers knotted themselves into peppys fur clinging to the dog shed been walking on a path strewn with broken glass and boulders a few sneezes were a small price to pay for the security of a warm puppy as i pulled the blanket up to her chin clara whispered im sorry i didnt tell you sooner its just until those men came tonight i thought maybe if i didnt say anything it would all turn out okay somehow her eyelids fluttered shut and in an instant she was asleep i doublechecked the doors and windows everything was bolted shut i made up the couch in the living room put my gun on the floor by my head and lay down with my copy of the document clara had handed me the captains conscience dear mrs guaman i have thought for a long time about whether to mail this letter it may cause you great pain and it may destroy my own career but after much agonizing i have decided it would be a breach of my oathas a doctor as a soldierto withhold this information from you it was my sad duty to examine the remains of your daughter alexandra whose body was found along the verge of the main supply route that connects the green zone to the baghdad airport medics from the th brigade combat team found her and brought her to our hospital inside the green zone hoping to make an identification forgive me for writing to you in a blunt fashion your daughter was found naked with burns across her face and torso as if she had received phosphorus burns from an ied however it troubled me that i did not see signs typically found in people who die as a result of burns nor would an ied have burned off her clothes while my staff submitted her fingerprints and dna for identification i began her autopsy the next day her identity was determined and we learned that she worked for the tintrey corporation a representative from the company came to collect her body to prepare it for return to her family i gave him a copy of my preliminary report at that time i was still waiting for results of various forensic tests including analysis of semen found in her vagina and for her blood work the following morning i had a call from colonel cleburne my own commanding officer ordering me to destroy my autopsy report no reason was given other than that tintrey was a civilian operation and that the army budget was stretched too thin to take on civilian autopsies the colonel informed me that he had also ordered the laboratory to end its tests on the various fluids we had sent over i deleted the report from my computer as commanded but i did not destroy my printed copies after long and anguished deliberation i have decided to send you my preliminary findings i regret being the transmitter of such difficult news but i believe no good is ever served by burying the truth sincerely edwards walker md captain us army attached to the letter was a photocopy of the report i skipped to the end to the summary which explained that alexandra was a healthy white female in her twenties with burn marks over percent of her body whose body had been found in the midst of metal fragments that might have been the remains of a bomb blast medics thought at first that she had been killed by a bomb but upon postmortem analysis we discovered she had been bound and strangled before death i flipped through the detailed medical examiners report diagnoses manual strangulation a petechial hemorrhages conjunctival surfaces of eyes b hyoid bone fracture postmortem full and partial thickness burns to percent of the total body surface area evidence of injury distal right portion of the hyoid bone palpably visibly fractured with prominent associated recent hemorrhage extending downward to the right thyroid cartilage clinicopathologic correlation the lack of thermal injury to the larynx and bronchi indicates that the victim was not breathing at the time of exposure to the fire given the damage to the hyoid bone and the petechiae found on the conjunctivas the evidence is consistent with death by strangulation with subsequent attempted disposal by burning on the posterior aspect of the right forearm is a linear inch contusion with a inch abrasion in its center wrists show evidence of binding ligature injuries the captain believed alexandra had been sexually assaulted he found semen in her vagina and pubic hairs of a different color than her own however as he had written at the end of his letter to the guamans the lab had been ordered to end all analyses of blood and other fluids as a result there was no toxicology report and no rape kit i lay back in the sofa bed staring at the ceiling there were spiderwebs in the corners and a trail of web hanging from the drapes cleanliness is next to impossible one of my college friends used to say and she was right i pictured cristina guaman and her husband reading captain walkers letter tintrey had sent alexandras body home to them telling them their daughter had died of burns from an ied burns so bad that they advised against viewing her body with the horror of that news still fresh in their minds they suddenly learned that alexandra had been raped murdered and then set on fire and left in a public place so that everyone would assume she had been the victim of an iraqi assault who had left her there who had violated her killed her tried to cover the murder up her boss mossbach the programmer jerry whoever it was tintrey knew they had put pressure on colonel cleburne to end the forensic investigation and destroy the report when cristina and lazar guaman got captain walkers letter they must have tried to find out why his report was so different from what tintrey had told them had they considered an exhumation so they could order their own autopsy by an impartial pathologist maybe cristina called tintreys office up in deerfield or maybe it had been ernest ernest the good and loving brother before his injuries took his mind from him i wondered again whether ernests accident had been arranged if hed been run down deliberately targeted as the one person who might really push for an investigation into his sisters death id never be able to prove it one way or the other but it might be important to find out the timing of the accidenthad he been injured before or after the guamans received walkers letter however it happened as cristina and lazar were agonizing over how to handle the pathologists report rainier cowles suddenly arrived waving a large check under their noses take this it will cover ernests medical care with enough left over to send clara to college as alexandra wished all you have to do in return is never discuss alexandras death with another living soul nadia had been furious blood money shed called it she and her mother fought so wildly over taking the money that nadia felt she had to move out clara hadnt been privy to the details either of captain walkers letter or rainier cowless offer she was told simply that she must never discuss alexandras death with anyone it had taken over a year for nadia to feel strong enough to read alexandras journal but when she did the description of her sisters unhappiness and alexandras ongoing torment over her sexuality drove nadia to desperate action she made a crucifix with a dolls head her sister superimposed on christs body she sought out the body artist who left her feeling even more helpless nadia wanted someone who could talk to her about her adored sister but the artist was like a black hole she drew emotions in but reflected nothing out nadias anger kept growing she started coming to the club and painting on the artist painting the fire that had burned her sister the fire that burned inside nadia herself as rage i could feel nadias helplessness and fury i could imagine why she did what she did but i couldnt imagine a way to prove it i went to my bedroom where clara was deeply asleep fingers still clutching peppys fur peppy softly thumped her tail but she seemed to realize she shouldnt leave the girl clara didnt stir as i tiptoed into my closet to put the autopsy report into the safe i went to the kitchen and surveyed the backyard returned to the front room and looked up and down the street no one seemed to be watching my building i climbed back into the sofa bed checked that my gun was easy to reach and switched off the lights i was so tired that the bones in my skull felt as though they were separating but i couldnt relax into sleep i was trying to tie together the many threads id been unknotting for the last month the threads became yarn behind my sandfilled eyelids olympia koilada was scarlet attached to the metallic pewter of anton kystarnik by her heavy debts so that rodney treffera nasty mustard colorhad free run of the club and the body artist everything came through the body artist she was a blank canvas where people imagined whatever they wanted usually an erotic fantasy but kystarnik used her as a message board nadia used her to display her grief chad vishneski had gone to see the artist for entertainment for erotic relief from his war traumas and then he saw the achilles logo and thought nadia and the artist were taunting him it was a typical reaction of someone in psychic distress everything in the world around you is about you i sat up chad and alexandra had never met it was the luck of the draw that chad came to club gouge the night nadia began her drawings i imagined a scenario when chad was in iraq he had seen the achilles logo every time he and his squad inserted the shields into their vests then he saw nadia painting the same logo at club gouge he freaked out got thrown out of the club came home furious with the world and furious with the shield maker and shot at the shield he wasnt testing it as id thought at first he was taking out his rage on it and then he saw that the bullets had gone right through the shield and he realized his buddies had died because their protection was a sack of sand so he blogged about it someone at tintrey monitoring references to the company in the blogosphere came on his postings and then gilbert scalia and jarvis maclean actually felt afraid alexandras murder had been a minor problem a lawsuit by the guamans might have made for unpleasant publicity but it wouldnt have threatened the future of the company theyd dispatched their outside counsel cowles to buy off the guamans and considered that problem solved indeed other private contractors had been able to avoid both civil and criminal damages from claims of rape from their employees which made tintreys payout to the guamans almost an act of benevolence but chads outbursts threatened tintreys very future they had grown to a multibilliondollar empire through their defense department contracts jarvis maclean and gilbert scalia could watch their stock fall through the floor if word spread that his company had sent our overstretched troops sandfilled body armor no more protection against a sniper than a wet sock at the beach even if tintrey had finally started delivering the fullerene nanoparticlefilled shields they advertised a persnickety member of congress might demand an inquiry might see that they lost dod support scalia and maclean summoned prince rainier to a council of war chad needs to be shut up for keeps no threats or blandishments such as they offered the guamans would work here with rainiers help they thought it through and came up with a brilliant plan dispose of two birds with one bullet shoot nadia frame chad for her death then make it look like he committed suicide by lacing his beer with roofies just another ptsd iraqi vet who took the violent way out the neighbor who thought there was too much of the myob said two men in overcoats came home with chad scalia and maclean maclean and prince rainier not kystarniks leatherclad thugs at any rate and then theyd rummaged through his things and found the achilles vest which they dumped in the garbage they just hadnt noticed the shotup shield in the bottom of the bag they left poor chad full of beer and roofies gave him six or seven hours to die and called the cops only chad had survived and john vishneski had hired me it was seven in the morning i could hear street noises as the neighborhood came to life jake would have landed in amsterdam by now i wished i was there in the world of music not here in the world of violence i turned off the phones and went to soak in the bath with a hot washcloth over my eyes i tried to imagine how i could get rainier cowles to tell all nothing came to me i could imagine getting him to meet with me i could imagine him ambushing and shooting me but i couldnt think up a wedge that would induce him to talk he was more likely to hire rodney to kill me chad and maybe even poor young clara the body artist had her own story her own loss her own cons and frauds she was the center of this particular web although i was pretty sure she was well not an innocent bystander but an unconnected bystander i wanted to talk to her as i lay in the tub i began to try out scenarios that would flush out the artist get her to appear for one last melodramatic performance as the water grew cold one idea occurred to me i didnt like it it made my flesh crawl even in my tub but it might work i dried off and climbed back into the sofa bed swaddled in a soft robe that had been jakes christmas present to me this time i fell instantly down a hole of dreamless sleep gimme shelter if so many lives werent at risk i might have slept the clock round but as soon as id slept enough to take the mindnumbing edge off my fatigue claras future chads safety my cousin petraall started tumbling through my dreams lives lost lives at stake pushed me awake i needed to be in motion it was noon when i woke i had a threethirty meeting with darraugh graham not missable not with my breadandbutter client so time to be up and doing with a heart for any fate i went to check on clara who was still asleep but poor peppy was pacing around restlessly desperate to get outside i opened the door in my nightshirt and bare feet to let her run down the stairs while the dog relieved herself i roused clara she woke in considerable bewilderment as well as a fair amount of pain lotty had left some prescriptionstrength ibuprofen for her but i didnt want to give it to her until shed eaten something i hurt too much to get up she moaned hard to believe i said but moving will make you feel better and we need to get you someplace safer than my apartment its going to be near the top of rainier cowless list of places to look if he finds out youre missing cant peppy look after me peppys a lover not a fighter and dont you have allergies i thought thats why your granny said ernest couldnt get a dog clara sat up im not really allergic at least not veryits just that my abuela doesnt want a dog she thinks shell be stuck looking after it claras skin was puffy and the broken nose was radiating bruises out under her eyes just as well lotty had taken care of her at the clinic clara would have been whisked off by child protective services faster than the speed of light if a hospital social worker had seen that face i dug out some clean jeans and a sweater that i thought would fit her you need to get dressed and get some food then well talk to your mom and your school and figure out how to navigate the next week or so until we get this nightmare all sorted out i cant go home mom is so furious with me and those people theyll be watching for me thats why you need to move because as soon as i have you squared away im going to call prince rainier to tell him i have the documents that will bring him hotfoot to my side where you definitely dont need to be but where can i go i have an idea on that but i need to see your mom first meanwhile times awasting we have three hours to accomplish our whole agenda you get dressed while i organize some food come on up and at em its not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog and all that good stuff between a laugh and a snarl clara finally hoisted herself out of bed and shuffled off to the bathroom i phoned down to mr contreras who was vociferous in relief at hearing from medidnt want to call up in case you was sleeping in but i been worrying about the kid she okay as id shamelessly assumed he was glad to provide breakfastfrench toast his specialtyand the kid wasnt one of those teens who starved herself was she whatever for healthy girls thinking they had to act like they lived in darfur give us half an hour clara was spending a teenage eternity in the bathroom i put on coffee and got dressed for my meeting with darraugh the current pride of my wardrobe was a burgundy carolina herrera pantsuit that id found in mexico city at christmas cut on the bias so that the wool jacket fell in a flattering line from the highstanding collar to the hips my gun made an unsightly bulge at the waist so i dug an ankle holster out of my closet i rapped on the bathroom door come on clara i need to get in there to put on makeup i cant come out i look like ive been attacked by gangbangers what will the kids say when they see me i already know what you look like so your face isnt going to shock me well figure out the rest after breakfast there was silence for a few more seconds on the other side of the door and then clara switched on my hair dryer i packed a suitcase with enough clothes for a few days away from home a box of shells and a spare clip for the smith wesson my laptop and my backup drive by the time id done all that turned down the heat and parked my mothers venetian glasses and my personal financial documents in jakes front room clara finally emerged shed used my foundation with a lavish hand covering the spidery network of broken blood vessels so thoroughly that her face looked startling like a kabuki mask well done i said briskly collecting what was left of my makeup and sticking it in my bag id finish my own face later before she could come up with any more delaying tactics i picked up her french book and ushered her down the stairs toward mr contreras my neighbor had breakfast laid out on his kitchen table it wasnt until we were facing each other across his wifes old checked red tablecloth that i remembered her name had also been clara this would add to his already strong interest in the youngest guaman sisters welfare and it would make it harder for him to let her go back into the world we are going to have a long day i told him were going to claras school to explain why shes tardy and see if its a secure enough campus then were going to see her mother and find a safe place for them to sleep mr contreras said there wasnt any place safer than his apartment and i had to go through a longer version of the litany id just covered with clara including the fact that i was going to announce myself as the tethered goat he didnt like any of it sending clara away letting her go to school or even me using myself as bait although that was at the bottom of his list of objections i finally suggested he accompany us to her school ill go get the car and meet you in the alley in twenty minutes clara can finish her breakfast and say goodbye to peppy i went out the back way and down the alley to the side street where id parked early this morning the car didnt blow up when i unlocked it or even when i turned over the engine good signs and even better mr contreras and clara arrived within a minute of my pulling up behind our building we had a quick run down ashland to st teresa of avila it was after onethirty now and i was starting to worry about the clock claras principal dr hausman turned out to be a sharp intelligent woman who quickly took in the details of what had happened hausman was cautious at first about talking to me which made mr contreras bristle as soon as i put her in touch with lotty though the principal became briskly professional we did call your mother when you didnt appear this morning hausman said to clara and she was quite upset but didnt give me any details i can see why now well give you a pass for today but im going to send you off to your counselor to work out how to make up your missing assignments for today ms warshawski and i will figure out the best way to keep you in school and keep you safe dr hausman had the happy notion of sending mr contreras with clara as soon as they had gone down the hall to the counselors office she said ive been here long enough that i knew both alexandra and nadia their deaths have been a heavy burden on clara and shes taken refuge in sarcasm and hostility but mercifully shes also taken refuge in her studies i dont want her class attendance to suffer yet i also dont want her in the kind of danger that cost her sisters their lives im going to try to persuade her mother to go to arcadia house i said its a shelter for domesticviolence victims and im on the board if i can line up someone to act as a bodyguard to and from the shelter to the school will clara be safe here during the day or should i try to have someone sit with her the principal thought it over how secure did you think we were when you got in just now it wasnt bad as far as it wentwe came in through the main door and we had to show some id i dont know what the rest of your campus is like how many open doors there are and i dont have time to look around this afternoon hausman nodded ill talk to my security staff and arrange for someone to be outside any classroom where clara is for the next week if it goes on longer than that then youll have to hire guards its not fair to the school as a whole to divert resources to one student we had an israeli diplomats child here for a semester and hed brought in his own guards the kids took it in stride once the initial excitement died down so i dont think theyll overreact to anyone you bring in for clara she walked with me down to the counselors office where we collected clara and mr contreras as we walked through the high limestone gates separating the school from the street i put my gun into my coat pocket and kept my hand on it but the only people on the street were waiting at the bus stop at the corner and none of them paid us any attention if our meeting at the school went more easily than id feared our conversation with claras mother was more difficult when we got to twentyfirst place it was clear that someone was watching the house and not making any secret of it a latemodel black lexus was parked in front engine running with either konstantin or ludwig at the wheel i didnt slow just went straight on to ashland where i parked near a busy coffee shop that car in front of the house clara said that was one of the men who hit me last night her eyes were big in her kabuki face yes i said i know who he is i need you to call your mother see if shes home or at work and get her to meet us here i put the battery in my cell phone and handed it to clara after a moments hesitation looking from me to mr contreras she typed in the number ma its me im fine just sore dr herschel she did a great job fixing my nose she says i shouldnt even need surgery no i cant come home no hes in front of the house waiting for me no ma if i come home hell kill me you want all your children gone im sorry im sorry please ma come to me im at julias café con leche on ashland no now please mamá the incipient hysteria in her voice was genuine and apparently got through to her mother clara handed me back the phone saying cristina was coming i removed the battery again and hustled our little group into julias to buy coffee and sandwiches i insisted that we eat in the car i didnt want a row of sitting ducklings inside the coffee shop if someone trailed claras mother here we had an agonizing half hour before cristina appeared as soon as clara saw her mother she jumped out of the car and ran to embrace her i hurried after anxious to get the guamans off the streets cristina guamans face was as gray and puffy as her daughters why are you torturing my family i surveyed the street behind her were you followed here i dont know i hope not i went out the back door and crossed the neighbors yard to come out on twentysecond street why are you putting clara in harms way why did you get my nadia killed mr contreras said she aint the person killing your children if youd been a better ma to your girls not blaming them for the lives they were leading your oldest kid wouldnt never have gone off to iraq in the first place how dare you cristina said to him she turned to me is this your husband the question embarrassed me almost as much as it did the old man but i didnt bother to answer we were starting to draw an audience people wanting to know who was attacking who hereand it was hard to tell from the way we were standing who was the assailant who the victim since i was a welldressed gringa in a poor area i didnt want to push my luck we need to get you and clara and the rest of your family to a safe house i said i want to take you to arcadia house its a womens shelter and they are expert at keeping their residents free from harm as long as we can think of a place for your husband to stay papi could sleep with his cousin rafi clara offered he does sometimes if the weather is too bad for him to make it home rafi lives in bensenville up by the airport we can look after clara cristina guaman said fiercely i will not have her stay with strangers especially strangers who will judge us i know the kind of shelter you mean where they look down their noses at us for being latinas i dont think the staff at arcadia house behaves that way i said but even if they do better to be in such an environment for a week than face those thugs in your house again tonight cristina guaman looked at the group on the sidewalk who continued to interject their own comments and queriessome of them knew her from the hardware storeand told them in spanish that she was all right just distracted with worry over ernests health and nadias death that marked the turning point in our confrontation although it took another minute of cajoling before she and clara got into the backseat of the mustang i drove to the house behind the guamans to the neighbor whose yard cristina had used when she left her own house she crossed their yard to her boardedover back door and returned in fairly short order with ernest her motherinlaw and a couple of suitcases i drove a circuitous route to arcadia houses shelter an anonymous building that lay just beyond the big medical complexes on the near west side it took some time to explain the guamans situation to the staff arcadia house was bursting at the seams and they werent happy about offering an adult male shelter but after a prolonged conversation with him and among themselves they finally agreed to let the four guamans stay for a few nights if its any longer than that vic the executive director said youre going to have to make other arrangements in this economy more and more families are breaking down into violence and were overcrowded as it is if i cant fix this situation within a week i said ill probably be dead anyway ill be in touch later today to tell you who will show up in the morning to escort clara to school darraugh gets things done i was running out of time to make my meeting with darraugh i told mr contreras id get out at darraughs building on wacker drive can you take the car home i asked ill be checking into a hotel tonight but ill get you word somehow about where i am and where to meet me theres a lot of work to do and not much time to do it in will you call petra too and tell her to lie low for now i dont want her running around town exposing herself to danger mr contreras was delighted to be part of the team when we reached the building on wacker where darraugh had his headquarters my neighbor gave me a rough hug and told me not to worry about petra hed take good care of her i jogged inside trying to comb my hair while i waited for the elevator as i got off on the seventythird floor i thought it was a pity arcadia house couldnt lease darraughs lobby it seemed to be bigger than the entire shelter on taylor street darraughs assistant ushered me into the conference room and sent a message to his office to let him know we were ready when he was darraugh ran through the meeting with his usual briskness i managed to be focused enough to cover my part of the agenda which seemed like a major achievement given my ragged condition while darraughs vice president for overseas operations wrapped upat such length that darraugh cut him short with a pithy remarki thought again about the buildings beautiful wellguarded space everyone got up to leave the chief of operations started a private conversation with darraugh but i interrupted asking if i could have five minutes alone darraughs brows went up but he took me into his own office and shut the door well im working on a case that is really scaring me and i have an extraordinary favor to ask i gave him a fast précis of how chad vishneski and nadia guaman had met and whyat least in my opinionshed been murdered and hed been framed tintrey has access to americas most sophisticated tracking systems and i need a secure place where i can meet with my team im hopingbegging you reallythat we could use one of your conference rooms my voice petered out under his cold blue stare he didnt speak right away looking me up and down as if assessing my competence you know why i work with you when i have companies like tintrey on retainer as well he finally said their sizei mean their global scope i dont do business with tintrey dont like jarvis maclean were on civic committees together he always manages to duck his pledges i assumed its because when you work with me the right hand knows what the right fingers are doing i said stiffly i knew i couldnt compete with the global monsters and that without darraugh i wouldnt be able to pay my bills very easily he produced his wintry smile right fingers right handyes i suppose thats part of it when i was a boy i found a stray dog on our land someone had dumped him there with a broken leg and i brought him inside mothers chauffeur showed me how to set the leg ive never known why mother and my grandmother let me keep him my grandmother despised sentimentality hated the whole idea of pets unsanitary she said but the truth was she hated the idea that any creature under her roof might show my mother or me affection some adult intervened he continued dont know who to this day i called the dog sergeant rock a comicbook hero when i was seven rock was small some kind of terrier mix but he took on anyone or any animal he thought was a threat to me growled whenever my grandmother came near me saved me once when i got cornered in the woods by some passing tramp who kicked me hard enough to break a rib died when i was fifteen broke my heart you remind me of rock scrappy sink your teeth into anyones calf if you see them kicking a kid i felt myself flush but didnt say anything when do you want your team here he asked tomorrow maybe around noon he nodded ill tell caroline to let you have a room shell clear it with security she can get your people up here without leaving a trail just give her a list of names phone numbers i started to thank him to offer him a month of free detecting but he shook his head and took me over to his assistant vics going to give you a list of names and phone numbers people were hosting tomorrow at noon a number of competitors are interested in the attendance list and the agenda so do your usual security magic for us right caroline griswold had been with darraugh for nearly a decade she spoke fluent french and serviceable chinese and often entertained darraughs overseas clients or competitors two secretaries worked for her but when darraugh needed to be confident that security arrangements had been properly made she handled all the clerical details of the assignment on her own while darraugh went into his boardroom for a video conference caroline took me into his inner office and shut the door i gave her a quick summary of the problems i was working on then turned on my cell phone long enough to look up the names and phone numbers of everyone i hoped to see tomorrow petra murray ryerson rivka and vesta the vishneskis mr contreras of course tim radke and marty jepson even sanford rieff up at cheviot labs i put sal barthele on the list but said i would speak to her privately ahead of the meeting finally i thought about the ultimatum the thugs had given the guamans produce the autopsy report by tonight or watch your house go up in smoke do you have a way to make a call to a lawyer here in the loop so that its impossible to tell what city it came from i asked carolines usual face is the smooth mask of the highstakes corporate poker player but after a moment she smiled mischievously tell me what you want to say and ill send an email to our agent in beirut hell be happy to place a call from his cell phone hes used to dodging bullets so he knows how to talk from an untraceable line that will be especially fitting this whole situation has its roots in our war in the middle east the lawyer is rainier cowles a partner at palmer and statten i want him to know that the guamans do not have the material his clients are looking for v i warshawski has taken the papers with her to a remote location and no one knows where that is any communication with ms warshawski should go through her own attorney freeman carter caroline wrote it up in an email to their beirut agent and had me read it before she sent it since i was already begging so many favors i asked to use her phone so i could try to organize the bodyguards i wanted for clara i started with the streeter brothers who i know are both skilled and reliable only tom was available and only afternoons but i turned down his offer to find someone else for backup i needed to know the guards i used i scowled in thought then remembered the body artists friend vesta she was a thirddegree black belt i reached her at a law firm where she was temping have you found karen she asked not yet but i have the youngest guaman daughter and im wondering if youd have the time or the inclination to do a little babysitting before she could protest i explained what had happened at the guaman house the previous night and how i wanted clara to be able to go to school while i tried to resolve the crisis in her familys life i have someone who can see her home from school i said but if you could get her there in the morning it would be a huge help i pay twentyfive an hour going rate for experienced guarding how much risk is there she asked really not glossing over it to get me to do what you want i dont know the people trying to get at clara work for the same outfit as rodney treffer hes the man who was always putting those crude numbers on karen if you are skillful at choosing your route you should be safe if they get a whiff of where shes staying it could be awful i dont owe the guamans or even karen buckley anything i know that and i know how to spar how to conduct myself under attack but im not trained as a bodyguard i understand but i also know what its like to be powerless when someones beating on you no girl should have to walk the streets in fear let me know where to pick her up and ill do my best i found id been holding my breath and let out an audible sigh before we hung up i told her about the meeting i wanted to hold in darraughs office the following afternoon and she promised to arrange her lunch break so she could attend i got up and thanked caroline for her help although thanks is a pretty feeble word for all youve done she smiled her brisk corporate smile all in a days work vic but if we need to reach you where will you be i shook my head i dont know yet ill try to get a room at the trefoil hotel using my mothers birth name gabriella sestieri but i cant afford more than a couple of nights there caroline thought for a moment ill check with darraugh but we keep an efficiency apartment in the hancock building for overseas staff who have to spend more than a few nights in chicago its free now i can book you in as ms sestieri i felt my eyes grow wide its extremely generous but caroline its not just beyond the call it could expose you to danger too she shook her head my sisters only son was killed in iraq blown up in fallujah he was a reservist and he had a new baby he never even saw i cant stand the thought that companies like tintrey have been making money on his body she looked at the console on darraughs desk saw that hed finished his video conference and took me into the boardroom so she could explain what she proposed darraugh grunted an agreement and caroline told me to stop back by in the morning to pick up a key and a photo id for gabriella sestieri darraugh escorted me to the elevator he believes in oldfashioned etiquette and decorum as i was getting into the car he let out an unexpected bark of laughter and brushed a finger across my cheek you are rock to the life i dont know why i never thought of that before phew around the sal corner i didnt feel very rocklike crossing the loop rainier cowles and kystarnik had me so spooked that i stopped in my bank to cash a large check i didnt want to take the chance that they might be able to track my credit card or atm transactions thats the trouble with the age of paranoiayou know people can trace you given the resources but you dont know if they are actually doing so not unless youre a whiz like nciss abby sciuto who can backtrace anyone whos looking at her records when i finally reached the glow it was half an hour after the closing bell and the traders were packed threedeep around sals famous mahogany bar sal saw me nodding as she directed traffic within two minutes a minion appeared with a glass of johnnie walker black i left the drink on the bar not wanting alcohol to take the edge off my awareness i also resisted the temptation to pull out my cell phone and reconnect to the world i was anxious about chad vishneskis safety as well as the guaman familys but i couldnt take any chances right now when the traders exhausted by a day from hell in the markets had finally drunk themselves into enough oblivion to manage a commute home sal came over to my perch at the end of the bar i hear olympias had to close the gouge she said bad fire in there i shrugged not that bad she needs to redo her stage and her electrics but the structures okay question is where shell find the money since shes already in way over her botoxed forehead to anton kystarnik sals lips rounded in a soundless whistle so the rumors were right this time i couldnt believe anyone would be such a complete idiot still as my mother says a fool and her wits are soon parted she paused measuring me youd probably better know theres another story running around the club scene some people say you started olympias fire people will say anything wont they especially olympia koilada i did threaten her with legal action if she kept slandering me but she probably knows i dont have the time or patience for a civil suit so how did the fire start actually i sort of did start it sal threw up her hands oh vic why im sure it wasnt the kind of pedestrian reason most of us would have she dissed your cousin she kicked your dog or in my case the last time i had a fire here some idiot had left her curling iron on a stack of towels in the womens toilet i didnt do it on purpose it was sort of collateral damage i described the night at the club gouge with kystarniks thugs beating up the body artist and olympia because they couldnt run their message board on the artists body so where is buckley doing her show now sal asked i shook my head she hightailed it no one knows where to find her but shes a woman with more than one identity i know two of them and wouldnt be surprised if she had a third to use as a bolthole in a situation like this sals shaved and painted brows lifted so high they looked like cathedral arches you looking for her whats kystarnik going to do if you find her that my dear friend is the question of the hour they have history anton and the artist the artist and zina antons only kid were so close they odd together zina kystarnik died but the artist pulled through and then disappeared where she spent the next thirteen years is a total mystery at least to me but kystarnik apparently knew at least he knew she was doing her act at olympias hes been using her i just learned but does he hate her or love her will he kill her or protect her im betting the first but hes a psychopath and they are like tornadoes you dont know where theyll go kind of like you warshawski sal said is anyone paying you to look for the chick not exactly someone is paying me to show that chad vishneski didnt kill nadia guaman kystarnik and the body artist dont connect the dots but they sure have enough dots on them to look like a measles epidemic kystarnik wouldnt have wanted a spotlight on club gouge and the artist so i dont think he was behind nadias murder im convinced the killer was hired by tintrey or maybe even rainier cowles himself i stopped to count on my fingers so many parties to this horror show besides cowles and his pals at tintrey there are four others nadia chad the body artist and kystarnik when a fifth party blocked embodiedartcom kystarnik was beside himself he roughed up the artist and slapped olympia around he wanted that communications network up and running i brooded over my drink im sure it was tintrey that blocked the site only now they seem to be happily doing business with kystarnik it was antons thugs who were parked outside the guaman house this afternoon but a week ago they didnt know each others names i dont know how it happened although im wondering if olympia brokered that marriage and how it happened isnt importantits what theyll do next that scares me you may make sense to yourself but its gibberish to me sal went over to talk to a couple of new arrivals whom she knew erica sals bartender came around with the black label bottle you okay vic you havent touched your drink one of those days erica just not in the mood id never be able to prove i was right not unless i found a way to make prince rainier speak i laughed to myself thinking of darraugh calling me after his mongrel terrier speak prince rainier or i will sink my teeth into your calf however it had come about kystarnik and tintrey had joined forces rainier cowles didnt want to beat up the guamans in person so he hired kystarniks muscle to force the family to turn over their copy of captain walkers autopsy report cowles or the tintrey executives thought this would end their problems apparently it never occurred to them that the guamans might have made other copies or maybe they thought beating up clara would persuade the bereft parents to keep tintreys dirty secrets to themselves or maybe they planned to kill all the guamans once they had the report when sal finally returned to my end of the bar i spoke without preamble have i ever put your life or your bar at risk nope and youre not about to start now warshawski i looked around the glow at the tiffany lamps on the tables and the racks of glassware hanging over the horseshoe bar erica was polishing the glasses methodically before putting them up in the manner of bartenders all over the world when business is slow each glass wiped obsessively until it reflects the light in the room youd want to put the lamps somewhere safe i said and maybe move those racks of glassware out of fighting range you could rearrange the tables create an open space for a performance and if you let me cover the windows with sheets theyd do nicely as projection screens v i warshawski i dont care if you are on a carry nation mission to torch the nightspots of chicago as long as you leave the glow off your list i tilted my glass watching the surface of the whisky retain its flat surface while changing shape gravity was amazing for one night sal one night only i need to resurrect the body artist rent the art institute they have better insurance than i do and a real stage whats your deadest night of the week sunday if i publicize this right with a cover charge of twenty bucks or even thirty you could make your weeks profit in two hours are you listening sal said the answer is no any profit would vanish in two minutes if kystarnik came in here in an ugly mood which what i know of the boy is the only mood hes got the question being is it mean ugly tonight or plain vanilla sal let me tell you the story of three sisters call them alexandra nadia and clara i told her the story as much as i knew starting with alexandras journal her journey to iraq the guamans chad the body artists disappearance ending with my own flight claras sixteen she got her nose broken last night and that was after burying her two sisters and watching her brother live in the nightmare of a badly damaged brain im not asking you to do this for me you know oh i know warshawski all i want is to run my bar in peace and maybe die in my bed not from a stray bullet but you always have some cause thats bigger than the rest of us my face turned hot but i tried to keep my temper under control that comes mighty strangely from you my sister being as youre the one who dragged me onto the arcadia house board sal chairs the board it was because im on the board and known to be sals friend that arcadia squeezed in ernest guaman along with his sister his mother and his grandmother yeah i chair the arcadia board and i give money to causes i care about but with you its always different its always some damned crusade or other its like you want the rest of us to think that next to you were a bunch of worthless slackers most of my work is for corporate clients who pay me with money they get from grinding the faces of the poor in the dirt does that make me acceptable as a human being that im just as much a part of the system as everyone else who comes into your bar sal drummed her long fingers on the bar still watching the room under her curling lashes something was in the balance here i wasnt sure whatmy sense of myself as a person my friendship with sal maybe if i survived kystarnik and rainier cowles maybe id find a place in the country where mr contreras and the dogs and i could live a simple life growing our own vegetables and offering shelter to runaway farm animals no more spikes in the hand or boots in the belly sal twisted on her stool to look at the fake gothic windows that fronted van buren street snow was starting to fall again creating a furry glow that almost blotted out the blackened fronts of the old buildings across the street its not such a great view is it she said the l tracks that otb shop over there and all the paper and chicken dinners and whatnot i guess im so used to it i never notice how tawdry it is maybe if i close the shutters for an evening itll cheer the place up better tell me what youre up to and why i felt sweat drip between my shoulder blades whatever dire outcome id been fearing it wasnt going to happen tonight even though sal raised a dozen objections about everything from not having a dressing room to where to set up the body artists webcams she was on board when i held my strategy meeting at darraughs the next day sal helped me push the project forward mad preparationsthen what looking back that meeting with sal in her bar seemed to be the only time i sat still for a week organizing the performance keeping clara and her family safe watching my own back trying to stay in touch with my regular clients while doing business on the fly at internet cafés i felt like a hamster on a jetpropelled treadmill for our initial meeting darraughs assistant caroline supplied us with food and drink and sat in for several long stretches to help move us along when we got bogged down darraugh himself wisely steered clear he was going out on a very long limb letting us use his corporate headquarters if his directors learned about it they might have a few words with him petra thought it was all a great game staying at tim radkes place made her feel safe and therefore cocky dont worry vic she assured me me and tim well take care of publicity well tweet and network and get this all over town i still have some media contacts left over from when i worked on the campaign last summer lets take this a step at a time i said we need to figure out who we want to reach out to we arent selling wheaties here hoping everyone in the world gets our message the glow holds a hundred thirtyseven tops sal added and i need serious crowdmanagement help if it gets up to that many tim radke assured me that his and martys friends would turn up in good numbers to make sure no one got too violent we dont want a freeforall i said with arrests and broken heads the whole purpose of getting the body artist back onstage is to stop the torment of the guaman and vishneski families how can you be sure shell come rivka said you havent been able to find her i dont think youve even been looking ive been searching like mad i assured rivka i even found her apartment rivkas face lit up what did she say shed fled before i got there but shell show up sunday night no artist wants to be plagiarized or have her work attributed to someone else i spoke with a confidence that i was far from feeling but the whole scheme wouldnt work without someone like rivka who was both talented enough and experienced enough to recreate the artists images most anxious was john vishneski who felt i was giving his son short shrift im the client here the one paying your bills and its my boy whos still on the critical list at the hospitalmy boy who someone tried to kill two days ago but this seems to be all about that gal who died in iraq i nodded sympathetically there are two halves to the story your son and nadia guaman i need the real killer to make a move in public and focusing on the guamans seems to me the best way to force the murderer out into the open but if you have a better plan please lets hear it now no mondaymorning quarterbacking too much is at stake mona patted her exhusbands arm john you know you dont mean to be selfish that poor family losing two daughters and who knows what will happen to the third girl the guamans situation had me badly worried the day of our first meeting in darraughs offices tom streeter had called to say that lazar guaman had come to st teresas and insisted that his daughter and wife return home i took a cab to the school and found lazar in the principals office with clara dr hausman seemed worried even frightened when she introduced us perhaps you mean well ms detectivei cant say lazar guaman said clara seems to think that you do we wont try to stop you but we do belong under our own roof why not let her be safe with your wife and mother i suggested for just a few days all this should end on sunday we are a broken family he said i know that my girls have been killed i could not protect clara when those men beat her up but i wont cower in my cousins home while shes in danger here in the city i tried to argue with him but his mind was made up he insisted that clara call the unlisted number at arcadia house so he could speak with his wife and the family returned home my one hope was that rainier cowles would leave the family alone now that he knew they didnt have alexandras autopsy report caroline told me at the meeting that darraughs agent in beirut had duly delivered the message still i had to take vesta off bodyguard duty it was just too much to ask of an amateur in case cowlesor even worse kystarnikwanted to attack the family i bought several disposable phones for my outgoing calls while my answering service was fielding all incoming ones as long as no one could find me they couldnt deliver threats turn over the report or we will hurt petraor claraor lottyor mr contrerasor the dogs i was a swiss cheese of vulnerability thankful that jake was on the other side of the world although i didnt hear from the body artist i knew word about the performance was getting out around town for one thing we had a lot of hits on our website for another i got a call from olympia actually i got many calls from her after her third and most emphatic message i called her back sitting in a window seat in darraughs hancock center apartment what are you doing she said advertising the body artists final chicago appearance olympia how are you how are repairs to club gouge coming along never mind the club what the hell is the meaning of this announcement i saw i dont know what you see or where you look i said so youd better give me a hint i thought i could hear her teeth grinding on the other side of the ether ive seen the advertisements that the body artist is going to be at sal bartheles joint on sunday what is the meaning of this gosh let me look at some tea leaves yep here it is it means that the body artist is going to be at the golden glow on sunday buckley is under contract with me she said and any bookings she makes talk to the artist or her agent dont talk to me if she has to wait for you to fix up club gouge before she can perform in public again it seems like a mighty poor contract but not my business its your business if you put sal barthele up to it ive been asking around and everybody who knows sal says you two are really tight still doesnt explain why you and i need to talk about it i said olympia was silent a field of graywhite clouds floated around darraughs sixtyseventhstory apartment so that the city with all its art and music and corruption and gang wars seemed as silent and distant as if it existed only in a childs popup book open the cover and the characters and their world spring to life shut it and you float off into your own private space when olympia still didnt say anything i added by the way i drove by the club last night and it didnt look to me as though anyone was doing any work did you know that or has kystarnik cut off all your cash until you jump through some big hoops for him where is karen buckley hiding vic dont you think shed be in touch if she wanted you to know olympia some swallows had ventured up as high as our windows looking for the insects sucked toward the building by the wind currents funny how much of nature there is to see even from a skyscraper i said what did anton offer you in exchange for getting her location from me to cancel all your debts to repair the club she hung up with a bang i laughed to myself but not for long i had too much work to do i had called trish walsh the raving renaissance raven to see if she would play music as a warmup for the show it was her performance back in november that had brought me to club gouge the first time and it seemed fitting somehow for her to open for the body artist on sunday i knew trish was flying over to london to join jakes earlymusic group but she wasnt leaving for almost a week trish readily agreed but i had to warn her that i didnt know what to expectthere might be a hundred people or five the crowd could turn violent but i hoped not vic youre making this sound like a buffy melodrama ill play for this eventi cant wait to tell the rest of the group that ive been close to bloodshedbut youll have to write in a guarantee for my instruments her lute and hurdygurdy were valued at twenty thousand for insurance purposes i gulped but told her to add the guarantee to the contract tim radke and sanford rieff from cheviot labs were creating highquality images for the slide show that the body artist had always run on big screens during her performances tim called in sick to his day job to help us out and he wasnt letting me pay him for his time he insisted he was doing it for chad that i shouldnt worry still i felt a bit guilty rivka was creating stencils for use in the show although it took vestas and my combined efforts to keep her working on something the artist had never authorized she wont be happy when she sees these rivka grumbled every time i asked her to prepare a new figure she was working in the basement of the golden glow where sal stored her overstock marty jepson and mr contreras had moved all the cases around to create room for rivka to spread out her materials theyd installed floodlights and a mirror so that the space could be used as a dressing room even with darraughs help providing me a place to stay the expenses were staggering and i knew i could pass very few of them on to the vishneskis they were uneasy enough with what i was doing without my suggesting they pay for messenger service between the gold coast and the northern suburbs rental of the glow insurance on the raving ravens hurdygurdy i entered the figures by hand on a spreadsheet and the totals made me feel faint every morning that i woke up without anyone on my team having been shot or stabbed i was relieved and every night when wed made it through yet another day intact i had a moment to relax however short before the next days maniacal routine began again chad vishneskis welfare was a big worry too john and mona vishneski decided to take him to johns apartment for the weekend chad was definitely on the mend he was alert for as long as fifteen minutes at a stretch now but he had no recollection of the night of the murder and there were big gaps in the rest of his memory too john and mona wanted to see the show and two of johns construction buddies agreed to stay with chad but it made me nervous to move a vulnerable man away from a doctor and closer to killers lotty wasnt happy either although she didnt want the burden of his protection falling on beth israel she also didnt want him far from medical help at such a fragile stage in his recovery when sunday afternoon finally arrived when the webcams and the security cameras were in place the microphones set up the screens for projecting the images hung over the shuttered windows i couldnt sit still rivka didnt help she kept saying i told you she wouldnt come i dont know why i believed you and did all this work when it was all just a big con job by eightthirty when the doors opened i felt as though every nerve in my body had pierced its sheath and was dancing naked on the surface of my skin tonight and tonight only at the golden glow the body artist in her final chicago appearance the raving renaissance raven at the body artist at doors open at pm cover the naked and the dead under the bright spotlights the thick foundation stripped the artists face of expression the cream paint covered her completely obliterating her race her age her hair was pulled back from her face lacquered heavily so that it stood straight up like a small shrub peering out from the middle of its leaves were a couple of barbie dolls their plastic high heels bit into the artists scalp the crowd on the other side of the lights whistled and catcalled the artist turned slowly she felt exposed powerless and it took all her concentration to hold herself upright to pretend that if she noticed the audience at all she disdained it behind her two giant television screens kept changing slides one zoomed in on a pinkandgray fleurdelis on her left breast another showed her shoulder with alexandra guamans face surrounded in flames as nadia had painted it off to one side the raving renaissance raven played her amplified hurdygurdy the words were so out of harmony with the purcellinspired melody that it took some time for the audience to realize what they were hearing little girl little girl whats your sister a toy played with by big boys until shes broken little boy little boy wheres your brother dead blown up by big boys into small pieces as the raven sang the images on the screen began to change from the pictures painted on the artists body to shots of soldiers bodies maimed and charred in a desert a woman clutching a torn dress around her bleeding body a group of men roaring with laughter toasting one another at a blacktie dinner text replaced the images will a change of owner change achilles fortunes someone in the audience yelled get to the show get to the show but at a table near the stage three men stopped drinking and began looking around the room as if checking for anyone who recognized them the artista giant doll really not a woman at allperched on a high stool in the middle of the jerryrigged stage and sucked in a breath the raven wound her hurdygurdy more slowly and after another few seconds fell silent the body artists program began its story hour boys and girls girls and boys and everyones stories come together through the body artist she is the blank canvas where your dreams come to life your dreams may be nightmares but youll realize them all in the artists body the screens began flashing images from embodiedartcom first the body artists original pieces of flesh the field of lilies growing from her vagina the tiger mask the winking eye they switched to the more disturbing images of the womanfaced deer being savaged by dogs the crucified woman with a spike through her vulva a horrified murmur ran through part of the crowd but others began yelling explicit sexual commands at me at my body for the body artists final chicago appearance im going to treat you to a fairy tale it begins as all good stories do once upon a time there was a chicago boy who loved to play football loved to fool around with his buddies loved beer but above all he loved his country so when his country invaded iraq he dropped football and a college scholarship and went off to war the screens showed pictures of chad as a small boy splashing in a wading pool then in his lane tech football uniform finally as a soldier heading for iraq he served cheerfully through his first two deployments but the third time he was sent his squad came under fire and every one of them died except for him theyd all worn body armor but the armor had failed them losing all his buddies at once that was hard our hero served yet a fourth deployment before he was finally released but he was never the same happygolucky guy hed been before he was angry odd things set him off one of the odd things that set him off was seeing someone paint the logo of the body armor that he and his squad had worn across the body artists back i got up and began slowly revolving as sanford rieff followed with a spotlight rivka had covered my body with the logo for tintreys achilles shield using a paint that showed up under an infrared light there was a ripple of amazement at the display while someone who had been to the shows where nadia did her paintings cried in surprise thats what that dead woman was painting over at the other club remember my soldier was so angry that he took out his old body armor and shot it and that was when he saw his armor could no more stop a bullet thanmy bare hand this so enraged him that he wrote about it in his blog man theres something i gotta get off my chest theres something i gotta get off your chests all you out there look at your armor if its got that funny logo that looks like an ear of corn sprouting get yourself new armor asap my whole squad was killed on the road to kufah because our armor wasnt worth shit and we all wore those corn shields theyre made by achilles so go get yourself ajax or any other brand and get rid of the sprouting corn the blog posting had taken a lot of work id written out what i wanted it to say and then john vishneski and marty jepson kept rewriting it until they thought it sounded the way chad would have written it i paused hoping for an outcry from rainier cowles or jarvis maclean but they were holding themselves still squinting through the spotlight i saw gilbert scalia half start to his feet but cowles pulled him back down i took a deep breath to steady myself off to one side i saw my cousins unmistakable spiked hair she was helping wait tables well boys and girls you can imagine how happyor notthe sproutingcorn company was to see this story going round the blogosphere the company was making out like bandits selling the army sandfilled armor instead of the real deal they began having corporate meetings the kind where they muttered can no one rid us of this meddlesome vet they didnt know what to do then fate intervened and played a rotten trick on the soldier you see once upon the same time that our soldier was serving his country there were three sisters who all shared a bedroom in a bungalow on chicagos south side unlike cinderella or other fairy tales about sisters these girls loved each another sure they argued as sisters do but each was more beautiful than the other and each worked hard to help the other two they had one brother who laughed with them and kidded them and made them feel special the way a good brother can the oldest sister was called alexandra the middle sister was named nadia and the baby well call her clara the bright one the guaman sisters faces were flashing on the giant tv screens the eldest sister led the way for the younger two going to a good prep school and off to college she took a job at the same company that made the achilles shield the world should have been golden to alexandra but she had a secret that weighed heavily on her and that was the secret of her sexuality her priest told her to go to iraq because her company had highpaying jobs in the war zone she could start a new life there a life untroubled by what her priest told her were her sinful desires alexandra obeyed him but for better or worse she made friends with an iraqi woman who found a small room with a date tree outside the window where they could leave the atmosphere of war and occupation behind and sometimes just rest and pretend they lived in peace but alexandras coworkers harassed her over her friendship with a local woman and her boss who tried to assault her was furious that she turned him down the day came when men in her office took alexandra away and raped her perhaps their assault got out of control or perhaps they thought they needed to silence her whatever the reason they strangled her they then set her on fire so they could pretend to her bereaved parents that she had been killed by an iraqi bomb the company sent her home and told her parents she was so badly damaged by fire that they should not look at their dead daughters body but a military pathologist had seen alexandra after her death and he could read the story of her murder by the marks on her body his conscience gave him no rest until he wrote her parents you can imagine their shock you can imagine the phone calls they made to the people for whom their daughter had worked and these people told the parents that they would pay them a lot of money if they never mentioned alexandras name again in public the screens were showing battle scenes and then a drawing rivka had made of alexandra and amani sitting under a date tree on the left screen captain walkers autopsy report was displayed slowly paragraph by paragraph no lazar guaman was on his feet you cannot speak like this about allie she was not that kind of girl she was a saint on this earth tim radke was at his side arguing with him but lazar was frantic they murdered heryes its true the tintrey people murdered herbut this woman this whore standing in front of you she is telling you liesall liesabout our blessed one a hubbub broke out in the audience people began repeating lazars words began realizing they were hearing a true story beth blacksin from global entertainment tried to get a mike in front of lazars face murray ryerson had spotted rainier cowles with the tintrey execs he leaned over them with his cell phone but what happened a woman cried from one of the side tables what happened to the soldier in the shadows the raving raven began playing he had it comin from chicago she sang at full volume until the uproar subsided to a buzz when i began speaking again she lowered her sound so that it became part of the background my naked body under a spotlight a perfect target nothing between my heart and a bullet but a layer of paint my palms turned wet and sweat began to seep down my neck from my lacquered scalp nadia the second sister and the angry soldier ended up at the same nightclub the nightclub where the body artist was performing poor things each thought the other was spying the sister thought the soldier was a spy from the company checking to see if shed violated their order not to talk about alexandra in public the soldier thought the sister was a spy for the armor maker checking to see what he was saying about their body armor ever since our soldier wrote in his blog about the defective body armor his outfit had been given the manufacturer had kept track of him because they had the highest level of clearance they had access to the defense departments most advanced technology it was a piece of cake for them to go into peoples computers and erase their websites or their blogs thats what they did to our soldier erased his blog the company heard how enraged our soldier became every time nadia painted their logo on the body artist so they worked out a sweet plan kill the sister frame the angry soldier give him roofies and make it look like he committed suicide out of remorse and where do you get roofies when you need them you go to your local drug dealer to the body artist the artist was working for a notorious mobster letting him use her body to send messages to his team of thugs shed made a name for herself years ago on the north shore as drug dealer to the rich and famous the rich and notorious when someone came to her asking for rohypnol the date rape drug she knew just where to send them no you ignorant bitch the shout came from the back of the room i never gave anyone drugs you know nothing about me if they wanted drugs they wouldnt come to me theyd go to the source theyd go to anton ask him ask him how he treated his own daughter the room was briefly silent and rivkas voice rose from somewhere near the bar karen karen its me rivka where are you oh dont go away the audience erupted into noise i shielded my eyes from the spotlight but could make out only shadows of people rising from their seats necks craning i saw murrays unmistakable bulk trying to carve a path through the crowd toward where karen had been standing i hoped one of the streeter brothers would make sure she stayed in the bar until i could talk to her above the roar i heard a louder roar the unmistakable sound of a gun and glass shattering a second shot and then screams in the small space the sounds echoed and bounced from the glassware hanging over the bar i couldnt tell where the shots had been fired but the screams had come from the back of the room where id heard karens voice rodney or anton they must have tried to kill her i forgot i was naked i ran into the crowd tried to muscle my way toward where karen frannie had been standing but my painted body was slippery and i couldnt make any headway another shot sounded so close to me i knew at once it had come from my left i whipped around and saw a cloud of smoke rising near where the group from tintrey had been sitting i managed to push through to their table rainier cowles was slumped in his chair blood pouring down his back his tablemates sat frozen their eyes on lazar guaman who was pointing a gun at jarvis maclean enough i shouted enough bloodshed put your gun down lazar they killed my girl lazar said to me his voice calm just explaining the situation they killed my princess i stepped behind him and chopped my hand down on his arm hitting the nerve hard enough that he dropped the gun one of you call i cried dont sit there like stuffed frogs i shoved the gun out of reach with my bare foot youre such war heroes when kids are dying far away do something now fold a napkin into a pad for the wound call an ambulance neither of the men seemed able to move they stared at me glassyeyed i put a finger to cowless neck he still had a faint pulse the bullet had gone through the side of his head and come out through his jaw i grabbed a couple of napkins from the table made pads and started pushing them against the two wounds it was a nightmare a repeat of the scene in the alley when nadia died i kept screaming for someone to call behind me i heard john vishneski come up to lazar man it isnt worth it vishneski said spending your life in prison for these scum you go back to your wife shes been through enough okay out of the corner of my eye i watched him ease lazar away from the table marty jepson materialized next to me vic what do you need call get a medical team here page dr herschel over the loudspeaker get me more linen jepson took out his cell phone he started to explain our emergency to a dispatcher then i heard the phone drop that man jepson said he was outside plotzkys that night chad left early and i saw that man come over and start talking to him i looked up which one i demanded jepson pointed at scalia and what the fuck are you doing with an iraq service medal vishneski stared from jepson to scalia it took him a moment to realize what jepson meant but he suddenly roared with anger and flung himself across the table glassware crashed and bourbon spilled across my bare thighs was that you vishneski grabbed scalias neck was that you who killed that gal and tried to kill my boy you chicken shit you fucking coward you send my boy and his friends to war without protection so you can make a few extra bucks and then you flaunt a medal i was struggling to my feet when a welcome voice bellowed through the room this is the police we have closed the doors return to your seats and one of you people behind the bar turn up the lights it was terry finchley standing under the spotlight on the stage with a bullhorn officer milkova was behind vishneski pulling his hands from scalias throat terry tossed the horn to the floor and came to our table an ambulance is on its way warshawski go put on some clothes and then youd better be prepared to tell me all about it after the brawl as the night wore on events began to blur ambulance crews came for cowles and for a woman whod been shot when one of antons thugs tried to kill the body artist someoneit might have been the renaissance ravenwrapped me in a big furry coat i never did learn who it belonged to terry finchley had set up operations at the end of the bar he demanded i give him the names of any key players besides the group at tintreys table but i had told him only about the body artist and antons creeps i was pretty sure id seen rodney in the crowd but hed managed to slide out ahead of the cops along with anton theyd left konstantin and ludwig to take any heat coming antons way jarvis maclean demanded that finchley arrest lazar guaman for shooting cowles when maclean turned to me insisting that i confirm that guaman had shot cowles i shook my head cant help you there mr maclean i said i had my back to your table when the gun went off i didnt see it damn it maclean said he was holding the gun you made him drop it still cant help you i said gilbert scalia might have shot cowles the way he shot nadia guaman he framed chad vishneski for nadias death and now he could be trying to frame nadias father for shooting rainier cowles that got terrys attention in a hurry he had been prepared to let maclean and scalia rush off to their waiting limo but he ordered me to repeat the accusation what are you basing that on vic terry asked your womans intuition or actual evidence i gave a tight smile marty jepson idd scalia as a man who accosted chad outside plotzkys bar the night nadia guaman was shot and one of mona vishneskis neighbors saw him and a second man escorting chad home about half an hour later the neighbor recognized scalias iraq service medal maybe he can pick scalia out of a lineup i have major responsibilities in a war that the us is waging against our most ferocious enemies scalia said i cant be bothered with this kind of crap terrys eyes narrowed murder is a kind of crap mr scalia the worst kind if youve shot someone in my city then youll have to take time away from your heavy duties to answer my questions terry told milkova to see that scalia and maclean were driven to his office at thirtyfifth and michigan let captain mallory know what were doing and of course let them call their lawyers i gather their chief counsel is over at northwestern getting his head sewn back together but they must have other lawyers at their disposal finchley told me i could sit down until he was ready for me and i retreated to the stool the renaissance raven had used after that i remembered things only episodically jepson and radke smuggling the raven out of the bar through the basement service door perhaps she was afraid a police inquiry might keep her from her european tour petra shrieked at the blood from my left foot pooling on the floor i hadnt noticed it until then vic youve been shot i pulled my foot up and looked at it under the spotlight a piece of glass was embedded in the ball i hadnt even felt it when i walked away from rainier cowles dont worry about that now what i need is for you to make sure the body artist hasnt left petra gulped vic you cant just sit there with glass in your foot then pull it out and go find the body artist petra disappeared into the crowd which was sounding like the herd in one of those old john wayne movies low mooing restless movement prelude to a stampede now that i knew about the glass in my foot i couldnt bring myself to get up to look for the artist i tried to scan the crowd to see if i could spot her but it was impossible with so many bodies crammed together i must have dropped off to sleep because the next thing i remember was lotty holding my foot while vesta pointed a flashlight at it yes it is just glass not a bullet and sal has a good firstaid kit this will hurt i dont have any topicals with mei dont go to nightclubs expecting to need them vesta a little lower and to the right the pain as she pulled the glass out shot through me like an electric current lottys expert fingers probed the area didnt find any more fragments she swabbed the wound with antiseptic which jolted me again and pieced the gaping pieces of flesh together with tape before wrapping the foot up thank you lotty i said weakly sorry the evenings entertainment took such a shocking turn why would i expect otherwise when youre in charge god forbid that the chicago symphony ever hires you to run a program for them the words were harsh but her tone was affectionate she squeezed my shoulder and ordered petra whod hovered whitefaced behind her to bring me a hot sweet drink no alcohol lotty waited until petra returned with some hot cider and stood over me while i drank it you have to stay lotty asked when id finished the cider im getting max to take me home you know men in uniform i think ive seen enough of them for the evening you have someone to see you home when they let you go plenty i got up to kiss her good night and ask her to take mr contreras with her he had been buzzing around the perimeter while i talked to terry and while lotty worked on me it wasnt just that i didnt have the energy to talk to him right now but i wanted to stay until i could see the body artist alone i didnt know if i could even keep her in the bar when the cops finished with her petra needs to go home i said to my neighbor when he started to reject lottys offer of a ride shes seen way too much violence tonight that suggestion brightened his face looking after petra was a pleasure as well as a duty as soon as he left with lotty and petra i turned to vesta if karen is still in the bar if the cops dont send her down to thirtyfifth and michigan will you hold on to her for me i want to talk to her alone and may never find her again if she gets away tonight vestas mouth twisted into a wry smile youre half dead where youre sitting you know but if itll cheer you up to talk to buckley or whatever her name is ill sit on her chest until youre done here when terry finally finished with mei saved the worst till last warshawskiand the last of the cops disappeared vesta stepped out of the shadows inside the mahogany horseshoe and brought the body artist over to me marty jepson and tim radke followed i wondered where rivka was but vesta told me shed made rivka leave an hour or so earlier while the cops were interviewing the artist well go down to the basement and talk while i clean up and change i said to the artist vesta can you escort her down and tim marty why dont you hang around up here if she decides to run up the stairs ive got this gimpy footi cant stop her i have nothing to say to you the body artist said so you might as well let me go now her chin was high defiant joan of arc confronting her burgundian jailers then you can sit in lofty silence while i clean up and dress and ill talk to you the body artists tale the concrete floor and walls were just about at the freezing mark i turned on a space heater full blast but i was still shivering i began rubbing cold cream on my legs vesta retreated into the back sitting on a crate of beer bottles she stayed so quiet during our conversation that after a few minutes both the artist and i forgot she was there lets see i started you were born francine pindero you and zina kystarnik sold drugs to the rich kids on the north shore until you and she overdosed she died but you survived i guess that proves how ignorant i am because i always thought dealers were too smart to use their own dope how did you know my name she demanded im a detective i detect things then how did you detect id given roofies to your tame soldier that was a guess i ran a facecloth under the tap in a sink that stood in one corner of the basement and soaped my breasts it felt wonderful like being newborn to see my own skin again you guessed wrong like you guessed wrong about anton and me her arms were folded across her chest her mouth a thin uncompromising line i dried off and pulled on a tshirt and a sweater my hair stiff with the hair spray rivka had used to hold the barbie dolls in place felt heavy and filthy but id wash it at home you let rodney treffer use your ass as a billboard for anton kystarnik wrong she said okay whats the right version why should i tell you one damned thing no reason i said my version is the one that will go out in the heraldstar and then it will be all over the blogosphere but if youre cool with that you cant be putting out lies about me she interrupted ill sue you and then youll have to tell the truth in court and everyone will know your real name so why not do it here and now she looked around the cold basement as if hunting for an escape route the service door to the stairs leading up to the street was behind me the stairs going up to the bar were behind her but she knew marty jepson and tim radke were waiting there let me tell you a version i suggested and you tell me where im wrong you recovered from your overdose all those years ago and knew anton was out for your blood because his kid had died so you took refuge in a second identity leaving your dad with a basement full of drugs wrong wrong wrong wrong the last wrong came out as a scream and her transparent eyes flooded with color as violent emotion swept through her my dadi would never have done that to him it was anton where do you think zina and i got the drugs anton thought it would be good fun for us to sell them to our friends and their parents why do you think we got away with it for two years because he was covering for us she began to pace the small basement frenzied a panther in a cage i got out of the hospital and cops were waiting to talk to me and dad he was shaking he looked like an old man i see him in my nightmares to this daynot just how afraid he was for me whether id ever recover but because he hadnt known what zina and i were doing he was so disappointed in me he had big hopes for me i was going to go to college i was going to be a painteri was going to be his special success in the world and then the cops got a tip probably from anton and suddenly this whole pharmacy appeared in our basement she gulped back hysterical laughter and then anton showed up he waited till dad had left for work then he beat me up and said i was lucky he didnt kill me he said it shouldve been me who died not zina and if i told anyone where we got the drugs hed see that my dad was arrested not him i didnt know what to do butmy mom was dead her namebefore she married she was karen buckley and my dad still had her old high school yearbook and her old high school id i took them and ran away and called myself karen buckley shed spent so many years with her story locked inside her that once she started talking she couldnt stop i sat quietly on the stool in front of the space heater i couldnt even tell my dad what id done because i was afraid hed try to go after anton and anton would have killed him like swatting a fly so i disappeared i bummed around the country just living on what i could live on i cleaned houses i did some carpentryi learned how working with my dad in the summersbut i couldnt get a regular job i couldnt do anything where they needed a social security number because then anton would know where to find me and i didnt want to ever see him or hear from him again i took some painting classes at local community colleges and worked on my art but nothing was right in my life then i came back to chicago and started this body art gig i thought i can be anonymous here behind all this paint so i started doing it in public how did anton find you i asked when she paused because my life is crap and nothing turns out right it was that idiot bitch olympia if id known shed borrowed money from him i never would have set foot in her goddamned bar but she always did these kind of edgy acts music and performance both and when i pitched my bodypainting idea she thought it would work because it was novel thats what you need in the club business something new all the time and it was starting to work except rodney came around by now he was antons enforcer but hed been strictly junior grade when i was in high school he recognized me from the sex parties sex parties oh you know anton liked zina and me to help entertain his friends his wife was usually pretty stoned by the time night rolled around and we thought at first it was fun we made so much money you cant imaginefor a teenager to have a thousand dollars in cashbut sex with those guysits why zina and me why we started using had to be high to get through the night anton he had pictures thats why i couldnt move without being afraid of him and blackmail she began chipping at her fingernails tearing off little pieces and throwing them to the floor so it must have been horrible when you saw rodney at club gouge i said she looked up ill tell you what was really horrible he knew me before i knew him on account of hed put on about a hundred pounds anton had been sending him to club gouge just to keep the heat on olympia about the money she owed but when he recognized me it all started again anton had this idea he thought it was so damned funny yes to use you as his message center i got that much and thats why you were so angry the night they came in and started beating on you i wanted to kill you she said if anton thought id ratted him out to a cop even a private one my life was worth less than the paint covering me so i ran home and grabbed my stuff and hid out but then i saw your ads on the net and i couldnt stay awayi needed to see what you were doing in my name i guess you were counting on that werent you she looked at me in surprise as if startled to think i could be that clever hoping for it i said not counting on it i didnt know what would happen tonight i wanted the cops to see an alternate version of the story of nadias murder i thought if you were here you could fill in some critical blanks the artist began fiddling with the paintbrushes id left out on the counter yes poor nadia i thought she was full of dramaselfdramaover her sister poor allie too is that really what happened to her raped and murdered in iraq its what really happened to her the wrong guy got shot tonight just my opinion but the corporate guys maclean and scalianothing will happen to them once the guamans threatened legal action over alexandras death they must have talked to her boss in iraq that guy mossbach scalia and maclean are the ones who got cowles to pay off the family in my book that makes them accessories to alexandras rape and murder well maybe finchley will get enough evidence to arrest scalia for nadias death but i dont see a murder charge sticking meanwhile scalia and maclean are responsible for hundreds of american dead because they substituted sand for gallium in their body armor the artist had limited interest in any life other than her own certainly not in tintrey or unknown soldiers overseas she flung the brushes down and walked over to the stairs leading up to the club not quite yet ms pindero i need to know how tintrey and anton came together tintrey was blocking your website im pretty sure of that and anton didnt know it the night he came to club gouge to try to force you to bring the site back online yet two days later anton was providing maclean backup at the guaman house anton will kill anyone for no reason she said or break their necks just for fun if hes in the mood her voice had gone flat again and all expression had left her face yes i said thats pretty much how i have him pegged too thats why i figured you needed an insurance policy after you ran away you were scared that was obvious from the way youd recklessly jumped through the back window of your apartment you found my home she came back into the main part of the room her face white how im ignorant about a lot of stuff ms pindero i said but ive been tracking missing people for a long time when i saw the frenzied way youd come and gone i thought you might call anton keep him happy by telling him that it was tintrey blocking the site she stood perfectly still not even seeming to breathe there was a piece i was missing a piece she didnt want me to figure out i tried to relax to let go of my anxious thinking to recall what had happened the different times id seen her perform in the club the night of the memorial for nadia guaman id seen vesta and rivka and the boys from tintrey had been there rainier cowles was in the club when you did your memorial i said slowly you denied knowing him id never seen or heard of him her eyes were wary no but vesta looked at him through the curtains and you asked her to point him out to you a day or two later you went to his office you didnt know if he could be useful to you or not but he was an important lawyer and he had a connection to the guaman sisters she sucked in a breath and i knew id made a lucky guess so what if i did she said is that a crime i dont know anymore whats a crime whats stupid or whats just plain wrong i said lazar guamanwas he stupid to say yes to tintreys money he had a braindamaged kid to support and no power to go up against them to fight over alexandras death was it criminal to shoot rainier cowles a jury may say so if the police make an arrest but im not so sure was it just plain wrong of you to go to rainier cowles i dont know you tell me the artist kneaded her fingers together it was wrong and stupid and criminal to sell drugs with zina i know that and i didnt go to prison but i might as well have the life ive been living the last thirteen years maybe youve been a prisoner of your fears but it still beats an orange jumpsuit and sexual assault by guards when theyre in the mood what did you tell cowles i said id call anton for him if he needed any extra muscle for anything okay are you happy now im ecstatic is there anything else ive been too ignorant to know before you take off she paused one foot on the stairs alexandra guaman was incredibly beautiful and very sweet even ifell for her the one week of her life that i spent with her she made me so angry not wanting to meet me in chicago i wanted to out her to her family but she didnt return my calls and then she disappeared she didnt disappear not the way you do how was i to know that it wasnt until nadia showed up that i learned what happened to alexandra when nadia introduced herself to me as allies sister i hopedi thought maybeshe would be the same they looked alike and nadia even seemed to want to go to bed with me then it turned out she was using me she didnt care about me at all she was using me just to get answers about her sister her colorless eyes turned dark again i smiled sourly only buckley or pinderoor whatever her name wasgot to use people nadia had broken the rules a modest revenge for a modest girl i didnt say any of thisi wouldnt get anything more out of the artist if she felt i was judging her so she made you really angry did you finger her for anton dont you understand anything anton is poison i try to stay out of his way justwhen i saw those two guys hanging around the alley after my show the night nadia was killed i thought oh let them jump her i didnt know they were going to kill her but once she was dead what was i supposed to do i couldnt go to the cops not with my past not with anton and the drugs and everything no one would come forward for me none of those north shore snots who used to come to antons pill parties theyd be glad to see me go to prison she had come back into the room her pale face flushed animated in a way id never seen before nothing like the need for selfexculpation to get your blood pressure up so those were antons men who killed nadia i couldnt believe it i couldnt believe id been so wrong about rainier cowles and scalia and the rest of the tintrey gang i dont know who they were she said i just could tell they were bad news the way they were lurking in the alley ski masks over their faces leaning against this old jaguar like they thought they were in a movie or something at first i thought they were after me i was really panicking but then i saw theyd spotted me they looked me over the way guys do and shook their heads that made me see they were after someone else so i went onto lake street and got in a cab for home i wanted to shake her or smack her something that would force some kind of empathy into her didnt she care that five seconds couldve saved nadias life all she needed to do was ask the valets to call the copsshe didnt even need to put herself on a tape i swallowed my bitter words nothing i said in this cold basement tonight would change karen buckley but an angry tirade would drive her away shed said something else that was more to the point the men were leaning against an old jaguar id seen an old jaguar a beautiful one id been coveting it where i squeezed my eyes shut trying to think back over the past month there had been one outside the tintrey offices the day i went up there and scalia threw me out id seen it in the executive parking area so you let chad vishneski take the fall i said it looks like after tonights charade the police may pressure the states attorney to drop charges against chad but if they dont im making sure that you my sister are in the hot seat as a witness not if you cant find me the artist smiled naughtily like a toddler in a game of i dare you ill find you i said drily ive done it once the second time wont be nearly as hard that car in the alley the jaguar do you know enough about cars to know the make could you see the color it was in an alley it was night i couldnt tell the color just in the street light i could see it said jaguar on the trunk and then a letter e and i thought oh gross another code just like what rodney was always painting on me and what does that have to do with anything anyway im leaving now so tell your goons not to try to stop me an etype jaguar the car of my dreams the car id seen at tintrey do you enjoy living on the run i asked wouldnt you like to get anton off your back take your art to a bigger stage if you think youre stronger than anton youre even dumber than i thought you were i laughed not possible but the feds are hot on his trail hes not long for this world if you know anything the least thing that could tip off the fbi tooh i dont knowhow he killed his wife or some other murder weve never heard of you wouldnt have to come forward you wouldnt have to talk about your dad and the drugs and all that ancient history just a tip that would send an investigator in the right direction once antons out of the picture the rest of his goons will melt like this snow is going to one of these days and id run interference id leak the tip and wouldnt reveal you as a source how do i know i can trust you she asked you dont you can only go with your gut and what youve seen of me that i took a beating from rodney and didnt stop my investigation that i did the best i could for clara guaman and chad vishneski you took a beating from rodney she was suspicious once again i showed off my discolored abdomen although ten days out the bruises had faded to a dull yellow didnt you wonder tonight how i knew about the messages they were sending through your body after rodney jumped me and tried to kick me into submission i managed to leave him unconscious on the street and then i persuaded two of his team to talk to me it sounded more impressive that way leaving out tim radkes and marty jepsons help and my pure dumb luck when rodney slipped on my vomit if you rat me out and anton gets wind of it ill send him after you she warned me im not afraid of the big bad wolf i lied any thoughts on how he might have offed his wife she held her breath shut her eyes ready to jump off the high dive acid its how he made a helicopter go down when i was in high school he put acid on wires running from the master switch to the solenoid and it ate through the insulation about twenty minutes after the chopper took off anton was laughing about it on the phone one night during one of his horrid parties zina and i were hiding behind the couch where his pals couldnt see us as soon as he left the room we ran like hell even zina didnt want anton to know shed heard something like that acid on the wire from the master switch to the solenoid howd you know what that was she shook her head i didnt i asked my dad i didnt tell him why i wanted to knowi let him think it was for a physics project at school even so he might have guessed he was a smart guy my dad but he died thinking i was selling drugs he loved you i ventured he certainly would have forgiven you i was so stupid she whispered so greedy i wanted the stuff that all those rich brats hadtheir horses their clothes and when i started hanging around with zina anton he saw my greed i made it so easy for him so goddamned fucking easy is not taking candy from baby he said is giving baby candy and giving you power i loved it ive always loved power it was only later when i was in too deep that i saw he had all the power the story was almost more than i could bear antons vileness using his own daughter and her friend as a private brothelscalia and maclean casually murdering nadia guaman to keep her sisters destruction a secreti didnt think i could continue living in a world with people like this in it and karen her adolescence shaped by anton no wonder she kept people at a distance my feelings must have shown in my face because she said dont go feeling sorry for me i hate that worse than anything tell your cop friend about the solenoid if anton really goes to prison then yes id like to come home be francine pindero again if you want to send me any news about it email steveskidyahoocom vesta emerged from her crate at the back of the cellar surprising both of uswed been so intent on our talk that wed forgotten her she put her arm around the body artist come on buckley she said or frannie maybe im a fool but im taking you home with me i turned off the space heater and followed the two of them up the stairs when i got to the top tim and marty were holding the artist i told them we were doneshe could vanish into whatever shadows she chose there is some justice in this world just not enough marty jepson and tim radke were heading to plotzkys to join their other friends for a drink or six and wanted me to join them chads off the hook tim radke said you were awesome vic wish youd been with our squad in iraq i told them that they were pretty awesome themselves but that id take a rain check for now drink one for me well catch up soon marty stayed a moment to apologize for losing his cool man i watched chad disintegrate into that kind of rage a hundred times and never thought it could happen to me but when i saw that guyand wearing the iraq medalif chads dad hadnt beat me to it it wouldve been me with my hands around his throat you saw someone getting away with framing one of your buddies for murder most people would have had a brainstorm under those circumstances i wouldnt worry that itll keep happening to you i his voice cracked and then he surprised us both by pulling me close and giving me a fulltreatment kiss you take care vic and if you ever need helpany help with anythingwell you know how to send for the marines right he turned and ran across the room after tim radke sal was waiting to close she and erica had swept up the debris but a decontamination team would have to come in before she could reopen the glow i took a stool next to her at the end of the bar you were right sal i should have rented a theater i somehow wasnt imagining that there would be people stupid enough to fire guns in a crowded room sal poured me a slug of one of those liquidgold single malts that i cant afford to get used to the damage wasnt as bad as it might have been a table some glassware and that light fixture near the exit which thank the goddess wasnt an original i guess that was when that guy was trying to shoot the body artist as long as rainier cowles and the woman who got shot instead of the artist dont sue we should be okay if your insurance doesnt cover the decon team ill take care of it and the chandelier and table i couldnt bear to think about my expenses on this venture ill make that my donation to truth justice and the warshawski way she said drily you pulled it off girl when you came out under the spotlights i was completely convinced you were the body artist yeah were just a bunch of interchangeable parts arent we under our clothes dont go down that road at least not tonight go back to your own crib get your life back in order get on a plane and surprise jake over there in amsterdam or wherever he is right now do something good for yourself you hear my smile felt lopsided but i squeezed her hand drank up went back to my own place for the first night in a week my neighbor had stayed up until he was sure i was home safely i hugged him but went on up the stairs to shampoo the heavy lacquer out of my hair when i got out of the shower mr contreras was in my dining room with the dogs and a plate of scrambled eggs mitch and peppy were ecstatic to see me again which brought as much comfort as the latenight supper and mr contrerass affection i knelt to fondle peppys ears if youd been in the golden glow tonight youd have known right away it was me not a body but me v i warshawski mr contreras had a thing or two to say about me being naked on the stage i told you two months ago women who sit around naked onstage get whats coming to them and how reassuring it is to hear that again although terry finchley seems to think that not knowing who was naked under all that paint is what unnerved anton anton thought i was the body artist and then when karen or frannieor whatever were going to call herhad her outburst at the back of the room anton was so surprised he lost his cool and sent rodney after her so i guess your stunt worked guess youre happy as all get out just do me a favor keep your clothes on in public in the future yes sir i said meekly oh you dont fool me none with that butterwouldntmelt attitude i know you i know you do what you damned well please no matter what i say he spoke roughly my wellbeing mattered greatly to him and he hated knowing he wasnt fit enough or fast enough anymore to keep up with me let alone look after me i listen to you i put my arms around him my mother would be glad to know i have you to counsel me he brightened thinking that i loved him well enough to compare him to my beloved mother he bustled about cleaning up the table it was twothirty time we was all in bed anyway doll so whats the point of fighting when its all water over the dam anyway mr contreras was right the stunt had worked at least up to a point the results however didnt leave me happy as all get out except for how they affected chad vishneski two days after my show at the golden glow john vishneski came into my office mona at his side the states attorney had decided to drop charges against chad we can get him into a proper rehab hospital mona said you worked a miracle for us ms warshawski i didnt know what to think when we got to that bar on sunday but you knew what you were doing vishneski grinned you ever want to take up that line of work more seriously let me know i can play the clarinet for you instead of that gal on those oldtime instruments you let me know what all your time and work came to well settle up i was working on the bill between my endless interviews with local state and federal cops grateful clients pay up but the longer you wait between results and invoice the more their gratitude fades the trouble with the vishneski bill was i had to sort out what belonged to the guaman inquirywhich no one was paying me forand also subtract items the vishneskis really couldnt be expected to cover like the extra security id brought into the golden glow sunday night or insurance for the raving ravens instruments i called terry finchley to thank him for getting the states attorney to drop charges against chad does this mean theyre going to charge scalia and maybe rainier cowles for killing nadia guaman the states attorney is an elected office finchley said at his most wooden the incumbent has received great support from the tintrey corporation as scalias mouthpiece reminds me every hour on the half hour the evidence isnt great marty jepson can id him talking to chad the night of the murder and maybe one of the tenants in mona vishneskis building can recognize him too the body artist saw an etype jag in the alley the night nadia was killed oddly enough gilbert scalia owns the same make and model marty jepson is a stressedout vet who saw someone through a bar window finchley said hes like a lot of our deserving vets pummeled by their time in the desert and prone to confusing reality and imagination and before you jump down my throat warshawski im just quoting the lawyer as for the jagwhos the states attorney going to listen to a stripper who used to work for kystarnik or the senior veep at a billiondollar company so its going to be left an open investigation i couldnt keep the bitterness out of my voice you came away better than you thought you would when you started out he said not such a bad deal even if it does grind my bones to see the tintrey boys skate but speaking of open investigations i need more from you about lazar guaman and the attack on rainier cowles you know as well as i do how a good defense attorney would shred me on the stand terry i heard a shot but i didnt see anyone fire it if lazar guaman was standing at cowless table so were a lot of other people i am not going to get up on the stand to perjure myself or to be made a fool ofeither way its bad for business rainier cowles wasnt going to die the bulletwhoever had fired ithad shattered his jaw and he would need extensive reconstructive surgery who knew thoughmaybe it would make him a more fluent litigator perhaps even an empathic one maybe the cubs would win the world series in my lifetime the gun used to shoot cowles had been one of the millions floating around the country without proper registration so it was impossible to trace it to lazar guaman but jarvis maclean had identified lazar as the shooter other people identified me and still others had chosen a twentysomething guy whod sat at the next table with a group of buddies so it was hard for the cops to make a castiron case it made me wild to think that the tintrey crew would get a free ride terrys implication that there was a quid pro quo between the open investigation into nadias death and the investigation into the shooting of cowles carried no weight with me at all guaman acted out of the personal pain of his daughters deaths scalia and maclean were trying to protect the value of their stock options not to say that tintreys ceo didnt have a few troubles murray ryerson and beth blacksin made sure that the story of sand in the achilles shields got wide circulation illinoiss congressional delegation began making noises about hearings that would look into tintreys billions of dollars worth of contracts with the defense department the stock price was already dropping there were some other bright spots of course there were chief among these was chad vishneskis vindication i also managed to get the body artists tip about acid in the solenoid wires up the chain i suggested it to murraywasnt there some story about anton and a chopper ten or fifteen years ago he brought it down by painting acid on the wires which ate through the insulation when the chopper was in the airand he was on that tidbit like a flea on mitch i had the satisfaction of reading that the faa and tsa were taking another look at antons wifes airplane a smaller spot but one that warmed me personally came from darraugh he hadnt been at the golden glow sunday night but caroline griswold his personal assistant had been there i hadnt noticed her in the densely packed room but after lazar shot cowles she had slipped out a side door before the cops shut off the exits caroline apparently had given darraugh a comprehensive report because on wednesday i got a giant basket of flowers with the note good girl rock in between talks with cops sending darraugh a handwritten note and cleaning up my apartment i answered emails and tried to pull together the threads of some of my other investigations clients were getting huffy they thought i was being a media hound and not tending to their needs olympia came to see me one day hoping i would let bygones be bygones the federal prosecutor for northern illinois was nosing around in her books and she was getting scared i told her i couldnt possibly help her but i didnt preach at hershed dug herself into such a deep hole she was lucky to be alive i hear you let buckley walk away into the night she said why wont you help me one of those things olympia i didnt say it was because francine pindero had taken refuge in her dead mothers name if id lost my mother at eight the age when frannie lost hers my dad working long hours couldnt have kept me out of trouble in the neighborhood i lived in we needed our mothers frannie and i id been the lucky one getting to live under gabriellas fierce protective wing until i was old enough to fly on my own a song across the ocean i drove down to pilsen the day after my show at the golden glow cristina in her own way had been tough and cold or at least bitter and hostile she didnt want to thank me for clearing up the search for nadias killer or even for focusing a public spotlight on tintrey for their treatment of alexandra instead cristina blamed me for her husbands behaviorthe police were circling around lazar guaman as a person of interest in rainier cowless shooting i suggested to her that the guamans hire a criminal defense lawyer to be on the safe side and she threw up her hands why not say he is guilty and run an ad in the paper having a lawyer makes him look like he has something to hide having a lawyer means he wont get tricked into saying something that can be used against him in a trial i know a firstclass criminal defense lawyer she just joined my own lawyers practice and ill be glad no more favors por favor havent you done enough harm to us already did you think we were a house full of puppets that you could just pull our strings and make us dance my two daughters lie dead and now what will become of us without the money we were getting from alexandras company ma clara was red with embarrassment how can you say that prince rainier killed nadia his bosses murdered allie we were likelike slaves bowing down to them were better off without their money nadia was rightit was blood money of course youd take this detectives side over your own mothers cristina said you ran off to her you left your own family to run off to this woman and now your papi could be in jail for murder what good have you done the two of you the world was a weight on her headi could understand that with the wrecked remains of her family around her but clara deserves all our best efforts to have the bright future alexandra wanted for her i said and it will be easier for her to go to school now that this heavy load of secrets has been taken from her shoulders shes right ma and when i finish college ill get a good job and look after you and ernie and even papi if they dont send him to prison and maybe they wont by the time everyone hears what prince rainier and his pals did to allie and nadia theyll give papi a medal youll see stop trying to make vic and me feel guilty for stepping forward i grinned at clara and hugged her but her mothers words haunted me as i tried to clean up the residue of the case i hung out some with sal and the two vets came around to check on me once or twice the three of us went to visit chad in the rehab hospital where hed been transferred it was a relief when he instantly recognized his friends id been afraid that hed be like ernie with lasting brain damage the three men greeted each other awkwardly its so much easier for women to hug and show emotion i hear you guys saved my ass chad said this lady here is the one you need to thank marty said after a few more awkward exchanges i left them to catch up and took a cab home i felt like an invalid myself these days like someone who needed a lot of tender care so i was treating myself to things like cab rides i cut back on my hours and lounged around with the dogs i missed jake and his music more than i had expected the dogs were physically taxing but emotionally rewarding what i needed these days i was a bit gimpy on my cut foot but as the days grew longer and the temperatures rose to the freezing level for the first time in five weeks my solace was in the parks along the lakefront the dogs and i went south to the wilderness preserve near the university of chicago where mitch chased a coyote for half a mile peppy followed as fast as she could while i limped along in her wake petra helped me get my correspondence back in order at the end of the week though she came to me very solemn and announced her resignation i dont want to leave you in the lurch or anything but vic i dont think im cut out for detective work people getting shot or cut to bits i hate it i was so scared last sunday and then i saw how tough and cool you were and dont take this the wrong way i dont want to be like you when im your age like living alone and being so hard that violence doesnt seem to bother you how could i possibly take that the wrong way i said in my hard fashion you going back to kansas city no the company where tim works theyre looking for a publicity person and it seems like a good job for me and well tim and me we really hit it off so thatll be fun i wrote out a check for the hours shed worked just dont blow hot and cold on me petra you came to me for help and i helped you now youre leaving me high and dry maybe you dont want to become tougher but you do need to become more thoughtful more responsible she nodded solemnly but didnt even bother to answer me i went home that night close to tears not because petra was quittingshe was too impulsive to be an asset to my businessbut i couldnt help feeling demoralized by her take on my personality when i reached my building i thought i really might break down clara guaman was sitting on the single front step with her brother ernie on this cold february night after hearing my cousins take on my character i didnt think i could cope with any more guaman crises but i held the lobby door open for clara and ernie and forced myself to smile how are things my voice must have been harsher than id intended because clara cast me a nervous glance this isnt a good time is it she said no no its fine im just tired your dad okay have they arrested him hes a wreck he wants to confess ma wants him to run awayto cuba even and everybodys fightingits like it was when nadia and ma were fighting all the time i thought it would all be better now but its not and tonight papi said if he had to hear ernies laugh one more time he wouldnt be responsible for what he did next i didnt know what else to do i couldnt take ernie to any of my girlfriends so i brought him here the dogs heard us and began barking and whining mr contreras opened his door and mitch and peppy bounced into the hallway peppy claras face lit up i hoped shed be here well clara look at you that black eye all gone youre pretty as a picture aint she mr contreras beamed at her and she blushed i worried what would happen when ernie encountered the dogsif he tried to hug or squeeze mitch it could end in disaster however the animals seemed to understand his disability while clara knelt and crooned over peppy mitch jumped paws on ernies shoulders and licked his face she likes me she likes me did you see clara she kissed me the allie dog kissed me ernies shrieks of delight echoed up and down the stairwell i didnt try to tell him that mitch was a male i took all five of them young people old man dogs upstairs with me while i changed from corporate to exercise clothes i showed ernie how to hold mitchs leash when we went back outside for a run he needed reminding at each intersection that we stopped at the dogs sat down and they waited for the command to heel before moving again but in the park i let ernie tear up and down the lake path until he and mitch were both exhausted clara played more quietly with peppy both guamans came back to the house happier than when wed left i had bought a salmon fillet to share with mr contreras for dinner we stretched it into a meal for four by adding pasta and a head of broccoli but ernie was too excited to eat much my allie dog my allie dog he kept crying jumping out of his chair to hug mitch ernie should get a dog clara said he hasnt been this together since before his motorcycle wreck i nodded i know someone who trains dogs for hospital visits well go see her on monday and get her help in finding the right dog and the right training for ernie im also going to give you deb steppes contact information shes a crackerjack defense lawyer well call her you and i i think if you can bring your father in to see her hell feel better and then things will calm down at home clara played with the feathers in peppys tail did my daddid he really shoot prince rainier sweetie i cant answer that i didnt see him fire the gun and if i say more than that you may be forced to repeat it under oath buthalf of me wishes he did to avenge allie and nadia half of me wishes he didnt because its terrifying to think my own father could shoot someone i took her hand what you and your family endured for the last three years no one should have to live through there are so many casualties of war and many are far from the battlefield if your father did shoot rainier cowles you should think of it as posttraumatic stress the same way poor chad vishneski suffered from it i dont think your dad will go around attacking other people once he talks to the lawyer things will settle in his mind about what the right course of action is for him and for what remains of his family we called deb steppe she listened to me and then spoke privately with clara the conversation seemed to help clara feel ready to go home again although she and ernie stayed until after eleven it was hard to dislodge ernie from mitchwithout mr contrerass help im not sure we could havebut the promise of more time with mitch and the promise of finding him his own true allie dog very soon finally got through to him and i was able to drive the two guamans home when i got back to my own place my melancholy mood settled on me again and i found myself writing a long email to jake he had finished his tour with the contemporary group playing berios sequenze in berlin and was heading to london with his earlymusic group high plainsong the raving raven had flown over on wednesday to join them with her historically correct unamplified period instruments id written jake once briefly to tell him the highlights of sundays show trying to make it humorous tonight i wrote more honestly or maybe with more selfpity hard to tell sometimes the fact that the guaman kids turned to me in a time of trouble should make me feel better but the truth is i dont know if i do more harm than good cristina guaman said i treated her family like a stage full of puppets and maybe ive done that again finding a lawyer for them promising to get ernie his own dog sometimes i think the fact that im so willing to act is a danger to the world around me like sals criticism a few weeks ago that i seem to put myself on a plane above everyone else its not that i dont i think im driven more by despair even than confidence especially the despair of seeing so much misery around me and then i leap into action and make it worse but at least ernie will get his dog surely that will be better but the law of unintended consequences thats what seems to bite me time and again i wish you were here or i was there i wish that my life had followed a calmer path i hoped to hear back from jake the next day although between the time difference and his work schedule i knew he might not even be looking at his mail i went to the gym and took part in a pickup basketball game i went to my office but decided i was sick of work i went to a spa in my neighborhood got a massage lounged in the pool when i got home i found a message on my machine from lotty max and i are coming over for breakfast tomorrow be up by a quarter of seven when i called her back she only laughed and told me to be up and have my computer turned on before i could beg or wheedle any other information out of her she hung up sunday morning i was so curious i got up early enough to run the dogs when we returned max was just pulling up across the street from my building he and lotty followed me up the stairs exchanging reminiscences about wartime concerts in london a night at wigmore hall when theyd held candles for their performing friends because the power had gone out while i made coffee lotty unpacked a hamper with fruit and rolls and max fiddled with the internet on my laptop a jangling prokofiev concerto was coming to an end and then an announcer stated the time just after one oclock and the station bbc radio he read the news and then said he was turning us over to the early music show the presenters rich contralto filled the kitchen today were delighted to have the american group high plainsong in the studio with us i felt myself grinning in surprise you knew how did you know jake called max when he knew they were going to do it and asked us to surprise you lotty smiled at me the presenter introduced the members of the group they discussed their instrumentsjake played a bass viol for high plainsongand the special repertoire theyd prepared for the trip trish walsh the renaissance raven sang and played an ancient lute one that didnt have a power cord stuck into it it was odd to hear her speaking in her highculture voice after listening to her heavy metal performance at the golden glow on sunday were going to start with works by some of the trobairitz the women troubadours of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries trish said there were several dozen of them but very little of their work survives and out of that whole group we have music for only one poem however weve taken some of the surviving poems and set them to the music of the period i chose the first song trish is going to sing jake said the words are by maria de ventadorn ive always loved the poem itselfa dialogue maria wrote with a poet named guy dussel she tells him that a lover should respond to a lady as toward a friend and she should honor him the way she would a friend but never as a lord i put together the music as a salute to a lady of my acquaintance like the trobairitz shes a woman of high courage she just saved a girl and rescued a soldier and did so with all her usual spirit and guile v i warshawski i hope youre listening sara paretsky
