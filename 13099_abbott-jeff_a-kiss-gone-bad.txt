a kiss gone bad jeff abbott when the blade as he secretly called himself felt blue he liked to relax behind the old splintery cabin where his three darlings were buried and feel the power of their vanished lives pulse through him it was quiet in the shade of the laurel oaks and on lonely evenings the blade pretended that his darlings lived with him with their cries and pleadings and wet fearful eyes his kingdom was small twenty feet by twenty feet and he ruled over only three subjects but he ruled over them completely life and body and soul today with his portable tape recorder playing a worn beach boys cassette and the clear harmony of god only knows drifting up into the oaks he sat down between two of the unmarked graves one of the mouthy carrottopped girl from louisiana who had fought so hard the other the young woman from brownsville who had cried the whole time and hardly deserved to be a darling at all he had selected a new darling a prime choice but fear made his spit taste like smoke because he had never wooed near port leo much less wooed anyone famous he had followed her for a daring ten minutes yesterday sweat tickling his ribs idling near her in the grocery store while she shopped with the bigshouldered boyfriend who had brought her to port leo the blade didnt like the boyfriend named pete not one bit although he liked to think about all the mischief that pete had been up to starring in those nasty movies the blade had eavesdropped in the grocery pretending to inspect the jug wines while the couple selected beer she fancied mexican beer one that folks drank with a lime slice crammed down the neck of the bottle and he wished he knew its taste but mama didnt let him drink the blade hoped they would talk about sex being their vocation but pete and his darling talked about grilling shrimp the rainy autumn how irritating his godzillabitch exwife was his darlings voice sounded edgy and impatient im tired of us sneaking around this town and you pissing off these dumbasses lets go to houston to write your movie im in big favor of plan b the hint that his darling was making a movie here in port leo tightened his throat with desire the boyfriend muttered no then shed said jesus let this crap with your brother go the sweet agony of being close to her flamed into fear hed grabbed a gallon of cheap cabernet in terror and bolted for the checkout lines crowded with new winter texans hed fled to the cereal aisle and shoved the jug behind the cheerios and waited until his darling and her boyfriend left the store before venturing out they hadnt seen him known him pete was writing a movie he didnt think that the films those two did involved screenwriting didnt they just point the camera clamber on the bed and do their artful moaning and thrusting with all the sincerity of professional wrestlers last week he had driven into corpus christi when he learned that his soontobe darling did movies of an extremely dubious sort he frequented adult bookstores driving the two hours to san antonio or the thirtyodd miles to corpus christi avoiding the few establishments that were too close to port leo along the ribbon of highway never going to any single store too often paying with bills worn thin from lying under mamas mattress he never asked the clerks for recommendations he didnt want to be remembered and tried to fit in with the faceless men who wandered the toobrightly lit aisles of the porn stores he was unremarkable just another lonely guy with eyes only for the bosomy models on the video covers his research uncovered that she had acted in only a few movies she had directed far more he almost felt proud of her on his last jaunt off the sale table he bought a video she had headlined five years ago her last acting job she went by the name velvet mojo an appellation the blade found tasteless the tape was called going postal he suspected the post office would receive a satirical treatment perhaps even a deliciously violent treatment but the movie disappointed no violence and while his darling was versed in erotic tricks involving stamps that made his tongue go dry her friend pete performed with her which seemed wrong the blade watched them couple again and again until the worlds edges grew soft and his mind napped he heard mama cursing when he awoke he felt bleary and offended she deserved rest with the pleasure of his company he could save her from this sordidness he would that little shady spot under the old bent oaks it would be perfect for her but winning her would be tricky wooing other darlings and avoiding suspicion had been easy louisiana and brownsville and laredo were far away she was within a mile or so and he would have to wait he could not truly enjoy her now but he could in a few days his hunger sharpened and he imagined her lips speckled with her own blood tasted of copper and strawberries the blade stood with resolve he would make her his but first he would have to make sure that no one cared if she was gone the phone jarred the honorable whit mosley awake at tenthirty at night out of a dream that melded campaign signs incomprehensible legal mumbo jumbo and his stepmother in a sheer nightgown he cussed quietly and grabbed the receiver this is judge mosley whit croaked this is patrolman bill fox judge sorry to wake you yhonor but we got a dead body we need

exwife he picked the phone back up started dialing faith hubbles number and stopped no point in freaking her out until he was sure it was pete please god dont let faith have had anything to do with this whit pulled on the wrinkled khaki shorts a clean tshirt and the parrotcovered beach shirt hed worn earlier in the day he locked up the guest house behind him hurried barefoot across the cement decking around the pool and by the back door to the main house found a worn pair of topsiders in a pile of pool accessories through the windows whit saw his father assembling a sandwich in the kitchen no doubt needing nourishment for another bout of nuptial bliss his father noticed him rooting for the shoes and opened the back door who called babe mosley asked he wore a silk robe hefner would have approved of dead body daddy whit answered ah babe said watching whit youre not wearing that are you why whit stuck his feet into the old boat shoes a hole at the front of one showed a sliver of his toenail well son god almighty there might be some voters there a crowd you ought to look more judicial maybe a suit daddy i dont have time to change whit kept his voice in check thirtytwo and still his father lectured him the corpse sure isnt gonna care what im wearing he pushed past his father and pulled a beaten navy baseball cap that commemorated a port leo fishing tournament pray for marlins off a hat tree on the kitchen wall see this hats all civic im set whit said whit irina called to him from his fathers bedroom he crossed the kitchen and glanced down the hall she stood in the doorway god help him sporting a flouncy little peignoir that a hearty sneeze would send drifting living at home was a bad idea and as soon as the election was over he was so out of here who rang whit voice like warm caramel drizzled on skin i got to go certify a dead body he answered not looking at her tell him to put on a suit babe hollered from the kitchen a dead person who is it eet she said her russian accent grew more feathery in sleepwear for gods sakes she came from a cold climate didnt she believe in flannel i dont know he whitelied if the son of the most powerful woman in the texas senate lay dead on a boat whit wasnt going to breathe one word before any official announcement his stepmother twentyfive gave him a smile that nipped the edges of his heart shall i make you some coffee to take with you a sandwich yeah if he was going to work a corpse with a bullet blasting open its head he wanted a snack but he smiled grateful for the kindness no thanks be back in a bit whit jingled his keys in his pocket be careful irina called as he stepped out onto the grand front porch good advice the previous three nights hed dreamed of irina in the most unmotherly ways be careful right he might mumble irina in his sleep and faith hubble would justifiably castrate him with her bare nails the night sky glowed with faroff lightning a freshly brewed storm hovered over the western gulf of mexico scudding dark clouds over port leo the october air blew heavy with the promise of rain whit eased his ford explorer down the crushedoystershell driveway he sped down evangeline street past the old victorian homes till he reached main street then headed north threading through downtown toward the marina the port leo storefronts catering to the winter texans and tourists stood dark he sped past port leo park and its attendant curves of grass and beach past the dour guanogrimed statue of st leo the great the towns namesake because of his reputed ability to calm storms past a line of trendy galleries selling the wares of the towns many artists the large shrimpers fleet docked at the downtown marina bobbed at rest a couple of nightclubs with cheesy names like pirates cove and fresh chances for what whit wondered to catch syphilis remained open strobe lights flashing against the windows but few cars were parked in the lot a red porsche blaring kc and the sunshine bands boogie man bulleted past him in his rearview mirror whit saw the wink of the roadsters solitary taillight as it braked to swerve onto a side street see you in traffic court soon and i may double your fine for your music whit thought main street merged into old bay road which snaked alongside st leo bay a modest strip of grayish white beach the color of dirty sugar lay along the bays rim then there was the road and then a line of rental cottages and retiree homes across the expanse of st leo bay the jeweled lights of several pleasure boats cruised past whit lowered his window and breathed in the coastal perfume of dead fish weathered wooden docks and salt wind caught in high grass a clump of signs along the road read elect buddy beere justice of the peace campaigning sucked whit hated it election day loomed just over two weeks away and buddy his esteemed opponent had littered port leo with enough flyers and signs to endanger a forest whit had slapped several magnetic signs on his explorer whit rechristened his car the vote mobile and erected twenty small post signs at major intersections around the county he had not made time to phone knock on doors and shake hands for votes hating the idea of begging strangers to put him in a job if buddy beere who whit considered to have an iq lower than a swarm of gnats even a big swarm defeated him whits local career options included scooping ice cream working a fishing boat or frothing lattes at irinas he drove past a huge sign asking him to reflect lucinda hubble texas senate the pictured lucinda waved with her trademark big red hair and her bright blue eyeglasses simultaneously evoking a kindly aunt and a confident leader if this dead guy was pete hubble mess wouldnt begin to describe it whit wheeled into the crushedoystershell parking lot of golden gulf marina the main building was a faded seagreen with white trim now ablaze in the spinning redandblues of the police cars this death had drawn an array of authorities port leo police encina county sheriffs deputies texas department of parks and wildlife cruisers and the highway patrol it looked like a lawandorder convention the hubble name mustve gotten mentioned over the police bands and all came running for a quick peek whit cursed under his breath a small crowd of marina residents had been ousted from their boats and milled in the lot dressed in robes and shorts watching the proceedings in the glow of the mercury lights whit parked and grabbed a notebook full of jp forms a pair of latex gloves and a flashlight from the deathscene kit he kept in his car fox the patrolman who had summoned him stood watch by a swath of yellow police tape and nodded hey there judge mosley fox blinked at the tropical shirt and disheveled shorts come from a party no whit grimaced down there at the farthest tip of the docks an officer climbed off a hefty cruiser yes sir damn nice boat whit ducked under the yellow police tape maybe i should have worn the suit whit had served as justice of the peace for only six months since the previous justice died in a car crash after several years in office hed accepted the appointment from the county commissioners all cronies of his fathers because he needed direction over the past five years since hed shuffled back to port leo his jobs shared only their brevity photographing sports parttime for the paper managing a defunct fiftiesthemed ice cream parlor with the illadvised name of shimmy shimmy shakes and running a messenger service that never delivered profits his father measured success by oil leases acreage investment income and wifely pulchritude and believed in direction especially for english majors who had cost him fifty thousand dollars to educate at tulane babe cajoled his buddies into appointing whit to the remainder of the dead jps term whit decided to give it a shot judge would make the most respectable addition to his crazyquilt resume whit pored over justice court law but felt awkward and stupid every time he had to consult a book during a hearing impatient litigants tapping their feet he bought some dimestore eyeglasses to smarten his appearance and cut his blondish hair short but wore his beachbum clothes polos shorts and sandals beneath the black sobriety of the robe to whits surprise he liked the work he adjudicated small claims and traffic court which could be dishwater dull or raucously entertaining depending on the cases but he also issued arrest and search warrants magistrated the arrested into jail signed commitment orders for the insane ordered autopsies and conducted death and fire inquests with encina county too small for a medical examiner of its own whit served as the first line of forensic defense so far in his six months this unpleasant duty had reared itself four times once with a car crash at the edge of the county twice with drownings on st leo bay and once for an elderly suicide who his insides gnawed with pancreatic cancer washed several fistfuls of valium down with a fifth of vodka while listening to hank williams cds another death and the whole county would be watching all the attention could make or break his anemic campaign great your lovers exhusband is dead and you get to rule on cause of death congratulations whit headed past the long line of docked boats on the thead most shrouded in bright blue coverings weekend boaters from corpus christi or houston owned these craft a few folks lived on their boats fulltime retirees or trustfund babies whit ducked under another banner of crimescene tape taped right at the boats stern hello honorable claudia salazar a port leo police detective stood on the deck of real shame watching him scale the ladder a gust whipped her dark hair around her face and she yanked it back over her ears she looked decidedly more official than he did in her black slacks white blouse and a plpd windbreaker hey whit said i heard this may be politically testy no press yet we have a short grace period before they swarm once it gets out that senator hubbles son is dead claudia said get your quotes ready has anyone called the senator delford is she answered delford spires was the longtime police chief in port leo he had a full ruddy face and a natty mustache that made him look like a chunky catfish he followed claudia across a pristine deck down to a living area and galley filled with clutter a thick paperback propped open with a carton of marlboros and an empty wineglass on the floor a pizza box lay open with torn cheese and pepperoni glued inside two empty bottles of cheap cabernet stood on the coffee table each label had been peeled away from the bottles little curls of paper dotted the floor on one side of the den a series of windows faced the gunmetal waters of the bay on each end small stairs led to sleeping cabins claudia went to the aft stairs heres where he was found she stepped aside so whit could enter the tiny stateroom the dead man lay naked on the bed lying on his back arms and legs spread the sourness of deathreleased waste scenting the close air i havent seen him in fifteen years whit said but thats pete hubble he did not add that pete hubble had skinnydipped with whits older brothers and once you saw pete naked you were unlikely to confuse him with someone else it might be best to get a formal id from family or friends eddie gardner another police department investigator stood in the corner of the bedroom snapping photos an evidencecollection kit lay open at his feet you were supposed to wait for judge mosley to get here claudia said sorry gardner shrugged just taking some photos i didnt disturb anything for the judge gardner made judge sound like dog turd he wore his thinning hair pulled in a short ponytail aiming for and missing the surfer dude look he was a recent hire from houston and had tried too hard to go coastal with the flowered shirts and baggy shorts why dont you get started on searching and cataloging the rest of the boat claudia suggested in a patient tone gardner went up the stairs with his smirk houston knowitall claudia muttered eddies got to stop those public displays of affection for me whit said he pulled on latex gloves and switched on an overhead light a bit of bedsheet was wrapped awkwardly around petes upper torso a gun loosely gripped in his right hand his mouth a gaping hole his eyelids stood at halfmast rimmed with blood this just sucks whit said did you know him well claudia asked he was friends with a couple of my older brothers i knew his brother corey better than him claudia cocked her head corey he went missing didnt he yeah about fifteen years ago a hoarse voice called down to claudia ill be back in a minute she said whit probed gingerly pete hubbles throat for a pulse nothing obviously he poked the paling skin cool but not cold and rigor mortis had not yet begun the windows were shut in the cabin but the boats at golden gulf were docked in neat succession surely someone would have heard the fatal shot he raised the blinds on the windows the two berths next to real shame were empty on the other side was the open bay and the long pall of night whit opened his notebook to a blank sceneofdeath form he heard more officers boarding the boat into the galley and living area claudia greeting them dividing responsibilities whit wrote oct pm peter james hubble male age brown hair brown eyes sixsix around pounds nude except for gold chain with lions head on it around neck redandgreen dragon tattoo on right forearm lying face up on bed sheet wrapped partially around chest mm glock in right hand bullet wound in mouth blood spray on face whit peered inside petes broken mouth bringing his flashlight to bear on the damage the tongue the back teeth the palate the uvula the smooth pink walls looked exploded the back of the mouth was a gruesome tunnel boring to the brain pete had his lips wrapped neatly around the barrel when the gun went off ate the gun didnt he eddie gardner asked conversationally he had returned with his camera apparently sheriffs deputies are helping claudia so you and i can get the body done he spooled film into the camera still smirking love the shirt parrots are you whit ignored the jab leaning close to the gun odd the safety is on i pulled the gun out of his mouth so i could click on the safety standard procedure gardner explained this in a tone usually reserved for addressing toddlers wouldnt expect you to know great a buddy beere supporter did you take a picture first with the gun in his mouth no forgot just trying to secure the scene judge whit wrote in his notebook gardner didnt take requisite pictures mention that in the inquest report so you knew this guy gardner asked ages ago theres a whole bunch of adult movie videos in a cabinet by the television and this guys picture is on some of the covers whit stared at him please be kidding gardner grinned not kidding at all you could hold a blue film festival with all the porn up there he pointed at the dead mans prodigious organ jesus a horse would be jealous makes sense he might make some money off of that the son of a prominent state senator starring in porn films the imagined headlines took a greasy turn in whits mind he wondered if faith knew he watched eddie gardner snap photos of seemingly every square inch of the bed excepting the square inches that had landed pete in movies eddie whit said please photograph the gun im going to need those for the inquest gardner took several shots of the pistol from different angles neither man spoke for a minute until gardner finished the roll you thinking suicide judge looks that way to me why whit asked bigbuilt guy no signs of struggle its hard to stick a gun in the mouth of a guy this big at one corner of the bed stood a sleek video camera mounted on a tripod aimed at the bed gardner watched whit examine the camera shit maybe he was shooting a home movie with that little gal out there and things got rough gardner said little gal girl that found him looks like shes spent her last dime and got no place to go dirty strung out gardner laughed she might have screamed bloody murder if she saw that dick coming at her maybe whit said gardner had all the appeal of head lice but he had a point whit remembered a tidbit hed read in a forensics book about bodily fluid residue he carefully inspected the dead mans genitals with his latexed fingers the massive penis appeared dry there hadnt been immediate predeath sex he bet but them medical examiner in corpus christi could properly make that determination gardner watched him probe the organ if it gets hard yell dont worry i will whit felt uneasy embarrassment again no doubt gardner would gossip back in the police station jesus mosley felt up the dead guys dick can you believe it whit noticed a frame turned down on the bedside dresser and he righted it it was a photo of a young boy on the verge of the teenage years with a scattering of freckles and mischievous brown eyes hints of pete hubble lay in his face the square jaw the crinkled smile the brown hair signs of faith hubble were the small ears the slink of the raised eyebrow it was an old photo of sam hubble pete and faiths son sam was now fifteen a bright kid whit had always liked he wondered how on earth the boy would take this news the only suicide ive worked whit said the fellow turned every family picture to the wall before taking the big gulp another vote for suicide gardner loaded another roll of film more flashes filled the room still wearing his gloves whit flipped open the video cameras housing no tape inside was there a videotape in here claudia took he asked dont believe so did you take it gardner frowned nope whit shut the case discarded clothing lay piled in the corner of the room still wearing the gloves whit picked through the mound in the pile were faded mens jeans a cowboy belt still threaded through the loops a white tshirt and mens black briefs that must have clinched the family jewels in a vise grip nestled with the shirt were a pair of cotton womens panties decorated with little intertwining violets whit hooked the panties with one gloved finger and raised them toward gardner looky looky there mustve been nookie gardner glanced behind him to make sure claudia salazar hadnt returned to the room ought to check to see if the girls got her delicates ill volunteer a hero in her darkest hour whit said what has the witness told you her names heather farrell got that scaredgoat look of a runaway were running a check on her to see if shes got a record she said she met hubble on the beach over the course of the last week and he asked her to come over tonight whit studied pete hubbles face little of the boy he had known remained in the dead mans looks a memory bubbled up whit barely twelve hanging at the edges of one of whits brothers birthday parties full of raucous teenagers and pete sneaking whit youngest of the six mosley boys slugs of prime bourbon hed thrown up at the partys end on the shoes of his oldest brothers date and gotten the last whipping hed ever received from his father pete mr fun at least before his brother vanished i wonder how many fuck films he made gardner said dont go broadcasting details of that career around town just yet not a chance in hell thats gonna be kept quiet gardner said i guess all the pussy in the world cant make a boy happy think of all the women he mustve had doing the movies think of all the venereal disease gardner pondered this might suck the wind out of your sails whit opened the small closet that faced the bed a small collection of mens clothes hung loosely on hangers pants sweatshirts a stacked collection of baseball caps captioned with adult entertainment awards and hot and bothered productions and oddly ucla film school on the opposite side of the closet blouses womens tshirts sweatshirts and jeans were neatly folded across hangers below was a box of loosely stuffed papers on the floor a leather bustier designed to rein in a majesticsize bosom and a collection of hotpink thong underwear lay in an untidy heap a womans been staying here eddie gardner shrugged imagine a guy who fucks for a living keeps a lady handy whit returned to the combined galleysitting area he heard claudia and another officer detailing and bagging the evidence out on the deck which was most in danger of being affected by the threatening weather opposite the couch was a brandnew television and videotapes were wedged into an open cabinet whit pulled up a tape from one stack cleopatras love slaves featured an elfinfaced platinum blonde in a golden vaguely egyptian costume she was about to lick a rubber asp caught in her cleavage behind her loomed an oiled chesty fellow in a toga with a lusty stare pete a list of performers covered the left side of the tape cover dixxie st cupps and rachel pleasure and love ramsey after several female names were listed big pete majors and another man the casting wasnt split evenly by gender but then men generally werent the main attractions velvet mojo was credited as the producer and director whit pawed through the rest of the cassettes mixin vixens more lovin spoonfuls oral arguments xi big pete majors was listed as a performer on every tape velvet mojo was listed on all of them as producer and director all under the hot and bothered label whit counted twelve tapes and noticed they were all done in the past year pete and his harem believed in hard work whit sat in shock he wondered if petes mother the senator knew of her sons career or faith who never mentioned her ex two extraordinarily bright accomplished women the shame would burn them both like acid personally politically he noticed books piled on the sofa there were several books on screenwriting basics dialogue technique porn didnt require much in the way of story structure whit thought but the books looked well worn the other collection of tapes twice the size of the porn collection was a world away from the adult tapes and whit recognized some titles only because hed taken film appreciation years ago at tulane for an easy a city lights one of charlie chaplins masterpieces the battleship potemkin a longago classic of russian cinema abel gances napoleon d w griffiths birth of a nation gone with the wind films by alfred hitchcock by john ford by stanley kubrick and a bevy of obscure foreign cinema films from australia and sweden and italy that whit had never heard of combine the two stacks and you would have the worlds most bizarre film festival whit peeked into the vcr and found a tape already in the drive still wearing his gloves whit powered up the television and the vcr the tape snapped into sudden focus pete hubble walked along a curve of rural road sauntering backward talking into the handheld camera with the earnest patter of a tour guide the time stamp in the corner of the screen indicated the footage had been shot ten days ago heres where my brothers car was discovered pete said in his rumbling baritone the camera panned over a clutch of small white frame houses with a private ratchety pier jutting into the water before this was just beach and field and kids parked here im sure you never did a womans smoky voice commented offcamera she apparently was operating the camcorder pete smiled i was too shy you triumphed over your phobia a pause were the keys in his car no never found any sign of foul play no mom made corey work for the car i couldnt believe hed just abandon it they find anything in it a gas receipt from port lavaca was under the seat so we know he or someone had been driving the car and had been up the coast pete shaded his eyes against the sun no prints in the car that werent coreys everyone thought at first that somebody kidnapped corey but never a note never a call so start theorizing then well go slam some coffee corey dumped his own car because it would have been traced too easily and he wanted to disappear pete said why to make my mother suffer pete shrugged into the camera lens i dont know how to make that part work in the screenplay without corey looking like a bastard dont make him a saint if he wasnt one pete the woman said pete shook his head and the tape fuzzed to blue then resumed with pete standing in front of a sign jabez jones ministries visual notebook part two still scouting locations for the shoot pete pointed up at the sign heres where musclebound morons come to wrestle with their sins i remind you the womans voice said my daddy was a preacher be nice jabez declined to be interviewed for my movie it makes you wonder pete said i have a feeling hes just waiting to see the movie and sue bigtime let him sue your ass the woman counseled free publicity pete grinned like im gonna have to worry about publicity im gonna be front page on every paper in the country yeah right whatever the woman said annoyance dripped from her words as though there was a secret she wasnt privy to and wanted to be the tape jumped again pete stood on a stretch of jumbled heavy granite blocks a fishing jetty near port leo park the surf surged in and the waves slammed hard against the pink and gray stones spraying droplets into the air wind whipped petes hair the time stamp said this was filmed a week ago hand me the flowers pete ordered from out of the frame came a womans hand covered with jangling bracelets offering a large bouquet of daisies and carnations the kind found in the grocery checkout lines wrapped in green paper pete tossed the bouquet into the waves the flowers churned in the tide bounced vanished churned again the camera panned up to petes face theres no grave for my brother but we used to fish off this jetty its the best i can do he began to cry softly a few moments of silence i think im gonna bring sam here pete said and the woman said oh jesus you got to listen to reason and the film went black he looked over his shoulder ejected the tape and stuck in one of the adult offerings johnny ampleseed the new tape had only been rewound midway it took less than twenty seconds watching pete and two bleached blondes kneeling in an orchard to confirm pete hubble was indeed a celluloid sleaze his timeless lines consisted of oh yeah do it baby and now its your turn whit felt sick for faith for lucinda for sam another part of him wondered so what was living that life like whit put the first tape back in the machine and powered off the television pete had been making a film project about his brothers disappearance going legit with a film career after working in porn unless he had decided to inject adult themes into his familys tragedy whit thought probably not whit went up to the deck he spotted claudia salazar talking to a sheriffs deputy along the gangplank another deputy carefully packed a few bagged and tagged items into a large cardboard box the ambulance had departed replaced by a mortuary service hearse ready to transport the body when whit gave the goahead whit waited for claudia to head back to the boat im pronouncing him dead as of pm he said im authorizing the autopsy and ordering an inquest its all right to transport the body now he scribbled details on an authorization of autopsy form signed it then claudia witnessed his signature is it you or prince charming thats in charge of the investigation delfords given me the case you thinking suicide before we get to that question hes a porn star claudia blinked her face paling in the marina lights your shirts funny but youre not he explained what hed found both the adult and legit tapes claudia rubbed her face holy holy god she mumbled back to your question whit said suicides certainly suggested theres no sign of a note but he turned down a picture of his son i saw the same in a suicide down in darius a few weeks back but considering this guys livelihood im wondering why that camera with no tape is pointed at the bed and theres a pair of womens panties mixed in with his own clothes is our young witness missing any underwear oddly enough i havent checked theres womens clothing in the closet including some stuff you aint gonna see the junior league sporting during the buccaneer ball if this girl isnt staying with him it belongs to someone else you think he was filming a movie and got snuffed whit shrugged i really dont know this is turning nastier by the second where is your witness down at the station gardner and the deputies can finish the scene work im going to question her and get a statement she jabbed a finger at him not a word whit not a word to anyone he jabbed a finger back at her but smiled gardner says this girl is a runaway if youre not going to detain her i dont want her taking off before the inquest claudia nodded ill make sure she sticks close i wonder if the person taping pete talking about his brother was our runaway lets talk to her claudia said well compare her voice to the tape they walked back to real shame claudia quickly inspected the tape collection and retrieved petes homemade tape and they went back on the dock toward the marina office an angry voice boomed along the docks and they saw a woman arguing with patrolman fox at the police tape boundary lady says she lives on the boat fox called to claudia her names velvet velvet mojo whit whispered is the director of petes movies velvet mojo sounds like a real bad wine claudia said its okay she called back to fox the woman was in her late twenties with streaky blond hair combed back to her shoulders she wore a dark longsleeve tshirt that read mean people suck and baggy bluejean shorts with scuffed sneakers velvet claudia asked as they came to the tape the woman stared and whit saw fear in her eyes fueled by the police the crowd the hearse whats going on here is pete in trouble the woman asked whit immediately recognized the womans voice from the videotape smoky hinting of hazy bars and purred invitations maybe we could go inside and talk claudia nodded toward the marina office velvet shook her head i want to know whats happened right freaking now and i want to tell you but inside claudia said jesus velvet said but she allowed herself to be led to the marina office the wind gusted against them once smelling of rain inside the office claudia gently steered velvet to a couch and sat down with her velvet pardon but is that your real name yeah its what i go by but mojos made up velvet said as if that could be a revelation so whats your real name velvet lynn hollister her gaze darted back and forth between whit and claudia im claudia salazar with the port leo police department and this is judge whit mosley hes our justice of the peace is pete in trouble did he she stopped pete has died claudia said he was found shot to death this evening im terribly sorry velvet accepted this news without screams or tears her throat worked in the dim light of the office for a few moments dead on the boat she held herself very still hands fixed in her lap eyes dry yes whit said he had been shot in the mouth the gun was in his hand they let velvet digest that bit of news for a moment she didnt move did he own a gun claudia asked no he hated guns didnt want them around claudia glanced at whit would one of his family perhaps have lent him a gun i avoided his family velvet said i wasnt up to their tightassed snuff his mothers an a i bitch and his exwifes her understudy they didnt want us around so faith knew pete was in town why didnt she tell me whit touched velvets shoulder she didnt flinch away where would pete have gotten the gun from the boat belongs to a friend of petes he might have gotten the gun from him i dont know velvet began to shiver whos this friend claudia asked a guy named deloache junior deloache he lives in houston but hes got a weekend condo here velvet grabbed whits arm did a doctor look at pete are you sure hes dead im quite sure im sorry did you see any sign of depression in mr hubble claudia asked you think he killed himself velvet sounded incredulous no way no way no way no way she stood pacing away from the couch shaking her head claudia stood i know this is hard you never knew him miss thing and youre gonna pretend to know him better than me he didnt kill himself whit asked the obvious question how can you be so sure her glare would have savaged a tank because he liked himself way too much he wasnt depressed if hes dead someone killed him fine claudia said who would want him dead velvets tongue dabbed her lips well first of all not me i know how cops work and i didnt have any reason to want pete dead whats your relationship with him whit asked weve been friends for a long time weve worked together on a bunch of art films dozens of them so was he your boyfriend claudia asked boyfriend how milkandcookies no velvet frowned look go talk to jabez jones he used to be a famous wrestler now hes a jesus jumper on cable tv you know him we know him whit said velvet nodded petes working on a new film project and he wanted some cooperation from jabez but jabez told us to fuck off but yesterday i came home from the grocery and jabez is here and he and pete are talking on the boat and i can tell petes upset his face was lipstickred like his head was about to burst jabez was smirking like hed just popped a good money shot her choice of metaphors whit decided was clearly influenced by her career well talk to jabez claudia said anyone else velvet pinched her lip between finger and thumb his exwife faith hubble theyd been bickering over pete getting to see his son faith didnt want pete to have anything to do with sam pete wanted joint custody which i knew he wouldnt get but he and faith argued about sam a lot great great great whit cleared his throat where were you tonight velvet claudia asked screw you velvet said theres no way youre gonna suspect a senators flunky or a minister right so start barking up my ass im just asking where you were tonight when you last saw him what you last spoke about claudia said easily no ones barking up your ass so just calm down and help us velvet shivered again and sat back on the couch pete had work to do on his screenplay about his brother whit asked yeah velvet said slowly how did you know i saw the tape he had in the machine scouting out locations talking about his brothers car pete wanted to be alone he writes better but didnt want to write down at the beach which is where he usually goes said maybe i could go entertain myself so i went and did some shopping ate a burger down at a cafe by port leo beach and went to see a movie she stared at claudia i got my ticket stub and the geek behind the snack counter flirted with me alibi enough for you id like to get a statement from you down at the station claudia said evenly oh shit am i gonna need a lawyer velvet grabbed whits arm youre a judge right do i need a lawyer youre not under arrest maam claudia said if you want a lawyer you can get one we just want to get a statement from you do you have someplace you can stay velvet whit asked yalls boat is a crime scene and you cant stay there at least for now velvets shoulders sagged the enormity of the situation settling upon her you mean like friends no i dont have any friends here i dont fit in with all you decent folk whit said ill be sure you have a place to stay claudia gave him a raised eyebrow that seemed to say arent you the little white knight thanks but i dont need your help velvet stood can i see pete maybe i should be the one to tell his mother the police chief will do that claudia said hes known petes mother for a long time lets get you down to the station get your statement and then we can go from there okay velvet crossed her arms take all the statements you need tell me how i can help because there is no freaking way that pete killed himself none her mouth hardened and if you people dont find who killed him ill make more trouble than you can imagine i assume you both can spell lawsuit the small crowd of marina dwellers was a mix of boat bums gulf wanderers and snowbirds they had little in common except a desire for quiet and the sundriven crinkle around the flesh of their eyes theyd been hurried off their boats and they stood clustered in the parking lot bathed by the glow of the police lights one could hear mutterings about life being too short and the wrong class of people booking at the golden gulf an overeager officer fox had used the word suicide in an illadvised sentence and the rumor rippled through the small crowd the blade listened to the murmured gossip his heart jolted like hed dosed himself with a tickly bit of electroshock no one paid him much heed only a couple of the boat bums saying hello he kept his hands tucked inside his light windbreaker he watched a police officer forage in the trunk of a patrol car the blade wondered how the officer would react if he leaned close and whispered i have a passion id like to share with you come see my graves but he wouldnt the city would decorate the officer the news pretties would hail the cop as hero while labeling the blade as crazy the boat snobs right here would jockey for camera position and gasp oh yes were terribly shocked he seemed like the nicest man and he probably wouldnt even get to tell his side of the story on tv life was blatantly unfair unless you were willing to take it by the balls and squeeze hard he watched as one older lady stopped and chatted with the whistling officer he spoke and she hurried back to the crowd where she whispered eagerly he stood and waited the elderly lady panted with excitement ferrying the sad news to each knot of people its the man who lived on real shame thats dead she said to the blade and two other men they think he mightve shot himself isnt that terrible shot himself shot himself what wonderful delicious morsels of words if they were candy he would have eaten them and then licked his fingers he wanted to see his new darling to touch her to feel the heavy weight of her hair lick her skin and exult in the warmth of her breath against his neck she would need comfort poor baby i bet you that trashy girlfriend of his cheated on him and he killed himself the old woman lowered her voice wearing those thong swimsuits a piece of trash like pete hubble hadnt been a piece of trash too thought the blade he wondered what interesting pops and creaks the old womans jaw would make if he broke it she probably wont stay in town the blade heard himself say in his thin wispy voice he so loathed not from here is she stupid dummy he berated himself shut up shut up the old woman nodded at him she had wrapped her fluffy hairdo in a protective cocoon of toilet paper and the blade thought she looked ridiculous youre so right ought to go back to whatever cesspool shes from he nodded politely yes if everyone thought velvet had left town then wouldnt it all be easier for him perfect three people emerged from the marina office lovely one was his darling why she wore grief well as cute as could be in her jean shorts pretty is as pretty does mama used to say his mouth went dry with want the three walked back to petes boat went aboard and came out perhaps two minutes later velvet was sobbing he could see her bent shoulders in the dim light of the marina a man walked with her steering her toward the police cars panic flamed in him oh no they were arresting her that would not do at all not at all but they and now he could see in the dim light the other was a tall man not a cop went past the parked police cars past the quiet ambulance and he could hear his darling sob and oh this would not do the man put his hand on her arm tenderly the blades heart boiled the man opened the door of a ford explorer and she got in the man helping her like they were on a date the man turned toward the crowd the blade seeing his face grimaced heat tickled the backs of his hands the explorer pulled out into the street and the small crowd of onlookers parted to make way for it one of those magnetic signs was affixed to the door white letters bold against a stylized redandblue background keep whit mosley justice of the peace the explorer passed within three feet of the blade and he saw his darlings face leaning against the passenger window she had her fists pressed to her eyes he heard the storm of her voice over the cars motor as it shot past the blade hurried away if they were arresting her a cop would have taken her away not a judge and she hadnt had a bag she wasnt leaving town that thought steadied him as he jumped into his beatup volkswagen he didnt like her running around with that judge when she belonged to him that judge that judge had seen her upset and wanted to help her wanted to take her to his house and undress her and no no he knew he was letting his imagination run wild and imagination was his enemy until his darling was safely in his arms judge mosley was part of lawandorder after all so he must be taking her to give a police statement or to fill out forms yeah you know what all those mosley boys are like you know the blade revved his engine and headed toward town he wanted her with him screw waiting maybe he could catch them before they got into port leos downtown on the dark bay highway flash his headlights pull them over onto the shoulder or a dark parking lot get mosley out of the car gut him with one swift move then cut his throat he wondered if a judges blood would reek of musty courtrooms and old thick books then he could whisk his darling to his cabin and make her his comfort her take her away from the worlds sadness he floored the accelerator do you think he suffered velvet mopped her eyes it was probably over in an instant whit believed in mercy and it was the likely truth she rolled down the window a couple of inches and the cool of the wind slammed into her face that little cop salazar she any good she has an excellent reputation here in mayberrybythefuckingbay how many murders do you have here a year one none last year i think one the year before that velvet wadded up her tissue oh great so she lives and breathes homicide i feel so much better now she stared at him so exactly what role do you play in this aside from chauffeur when theres a suspicious death i examine the scene meet with the people who knew the deceased talk with the investigators decide to order an autopsy or not conduct the inquest work with the me in nueces county if needed rule on cause of death velvets eyes widened so never mind the cop all you gotta do is rule its murder and she has to investigate i have to make decisions based on the evidence i got to be judicial he said she regarded his tropical shirt and ratty shorts yeah when i picture judicial im seeing you what are you twelve he didnt know what to say to her his inexperience gnawed at him he cleared his throat i promise you ill be fair and ill listen to what you have to say about petes state of mind when will the autopsy be done in the next couple of days ill get a verbal report from the me first but we wont have a complete report for a few weeks and before you keep casting aspersions against me and claudia you ought to know that i grew up with pete i knew him and his brother and i sleep with his exwife so clearly im an interested party pete never mentioned you he was more friends with my older brothers but if someone killed pete were not gonna let him or her get away with it i suppose it wouldnt be politically sound to let a hubble be murdered and let the killer slip free she said bitterly no i guess you have to investigate to the balls when its a state senators son i know youre upset whit said and im real sorry for your loss but is there some reason youre cranking on me i thought judges were all supposed to be big poker players you dont got a poker face i can tell by the way you look at me you think pete and i are trash i dont have a negative opinion of you he paused i want to help you she unfolded and refolded her tissue who found the body a young woman we think shes a runaway although shes apparently a few days past eighteen so i guess you turn into a vagrant then um i saw a video camera set up in the bedroom she could draw her own conclusions whit supposed thats not how you make a movie she snapped you got at least two cameras not just one you got better lights than youd have on that boat you got a makeup girl no way was pete making a movie with that littleass camera he was professional but moving on to a new career porn had worn him out its hard work you know he wanted to come home to research and write this script and he wanted me to direct it once it was done so he gave you a chance to make a real movie her stare was acidic excuse me have you seen my movies they are real movies butthead im the spielberg of porn i have plots and characterization and depth and everything whit suspected it was the everything part that raked in the profits but this film about his brother had no adultmovie elements he said right of course not i wanted to try a different kind of project you know thats allowed if youre creative shakespeare wrote comedies and tragedies its only small minds that jam you into one freaking hole forever she turned back to the window so where are you dumping me after i give this statement i suppose petes mother isnt an option whit ventured shed cut my throat in my sleep and bathe in the blood youre sure you dont have any friends in town whit asked i dont want any friends here thank you kindly then i guess well get you to a motel you got several choices the excellent which isnt the port leo inn the gulf breeze a bunch of b and bs theres also a best western and a marriott suites too i cant believe pete is dead and i have to stay at a best western she managed a sniffle and a slight smile friendlier than just a moment ago any room at your inn im awful quiet and i dont take up much space you dont want to stay with me im a dork who lives with his dad he said but at the best western ill be alone i dont do alone real well i need a plan b im sorry you got a phone in here yeah a cell phone here whit dug among the tapes and cds in the storage unit between the seats and handed her the phone he clicked on the interior light so she could see to dial another bit of brightness caught his eye he glanced in the rearview mirror and saw a pair of headlights jouncing rapidly gaining on them velvet dialed and waited anson oh good youre in town huh oh okay this is velvet let me talk to junior a pause junior listen i got real bad news petes dead a longer pause im not kidding he was shot im okay im holding up i cried for a bit and now i am getting ready to cry some more then im gonna kick me some police ass if they keep saying he killed himself whit ran through his mental rolodex of port leo trying to place an anson or a junior velvet had mentioned a junior deloache as the boats owner im not leaving town till we know what happened judge mosley says theres gonna be an inquest what i gotta go to the police station pete was on your boat and its a crime scene and im booted so i need a place to crash can i stay at your condo she listened and hung her head slightly no i dont know when you get your stupid boat back yeah yeah okay sure i understand sure ill just grab me a hotel room yeah thanks for the generosity she clicked off the phone those bags whit glanced in the rearview mirror the headlights behind grew larger no luck he asked i hate that greasy little junior deloache hes this piggyeyed stain thinks hes a stud yeah with a dick stretcher and a case of viagra maybe she shrugged i cant get into their condo theyre in houston but are coming down tomorrow so i guess ill hotel it i thought you called a local number its callforwarding she blinked at the bright headlights that dazzled behind them the lights began to flash from dim to bright and dim again somebodys in a tearass hurry whit glanced back in the mirror he can go around me if he wants the car stayed uncomfortably close then the lights flashed dim bright dim he wants you to pull over velvet handed whit the phone in the headlights glare no thanks whit floored the accelerator he pulled away from the car and the pursuer dropped back dramatically to a more reasonable speed asshole velvet commented whit checked the rearview mirror several seconds later and found the car was nearly gone my office is right across from the police station whit said i can give you a ride to the hotel after you give your statement velvet misunderstood his charity look i dont do thankyou fucks just because someone shows common human decency i can promise you i wasnt asking for one why you think i stink do you know how many guys have hit on me since i got here probably lots whit said velvet hunkered down in her seat lots is half right she finally pronounced tons is closer whit turned onto main street and pulled up in front of the encina county courthouse it was a sprawling grand oddity shaped by the moorish architecture popular on the coast a century ago three stories of heavy texas granite designed to survive storm surge and hurricane the port leo police department stood across the street a crackerbox of boring plain brick they crossed the empty street together the wind rustled in the drooping palms and the clouds had dipped low pregnant with rain they arent going to arrest me are they velvet asked suddenly stopping halfway across the street did you kill him whit asked no god no then dont worry tell them what they need to know these are good people theyre not going to hang you out to dry i promise you that she crossed her arms bowed her head and the tears came in shudders and she bleated pete hubbles name whit didnt dwell on niceties or politics he took her into his arms and let her cry against his shoulder like old friends consoling each other in the terrible reality of sudden grief he couldnt stand there like a wooden post while a woman sobbed she got his tropicalprint shoulder wet and snotty and when the shaking stopped whit steered her into the brightly lit doorway of the police station the blade watched his darling and that goddamned goodfornothing lecher of a judge embracing in the street he tried to slow his breathing he had drawn close to whit mosleys explorer and retreated when his headlights and the explorers interior lights showed velvet holding a cell phone that wouldnt do to have them announce they were being chased or to have a stranger on a cellular connection overhear the blade doing his best work he followed them into port leos town square and slowly parked a block away in front of the black glass of the gulfstream bookstore his headlights cut watching them touch watching whit mosley touch a woman that belonged to him sickened the blade he cupped the knife against the round fleshiness of his palm feeling the bite of its edge he took calming breaths and tried not to cry in frustration patience was beyond a virtue it was the most basic rule of survival and to bend patience meant mistakes mistakes were not affordable he had read in the literature of his own kind of the most abominable errors john wayne gacy inviting the police keeping him under surveillance to join him for breakfast right when the odd smell floated from the crawlway dennis nilsen showing the first policeman who knocked on his door the grisly plastic bags in his london closet the blade decided long ago that he would not lie down and die so he fell back and he watched and he turned on the tape player and the reedy beach boys tape that had been the players sole occupant for the last three years sputtered into life and the boys volume turned low demanded he be true to his school he prayed that his darling would be true to him singing along under his breath taking the harmony line mosley and velvet went into the police station and the blade waited a few minutes later mosley sauntered across the street to the courthouse you dirty little freak youre nothing not worthy to touch her know her tears im not the nothing youre the nothing mosley fiddled with the courthouse door and ducked inside the darkened building a light flickered on a few minutes later in a firstfloor office behind lowered blinds perhaps judge mosley didnt lock up after himself he ran to the courthouse steps and tried the door locked damn but no he told himself not now he shivered one death by violence in port leo tonight was remarkable another the same night would bring the police out in droves he walked away from the courthouse let whit mosley continue to breathe for now and let him rule that pete hubble died a suicide he congratulated himself on his selfrestraint the momentary pride evaporated when he saw the flyer hanging in the bookstore window only the dim shimmer from the streetlight illuminated the girls face printed on light blue paper taped to the inside of the window the blade blinked his guts coiling like a frightened snake the eyes of his last darling watched him from the flyer she was smiling broadly he had not seen her smile from the time he had abducted her from a faraway parking lot to when hed laid her in the shallow dirt behind his house have you seen her the flyer asked with marcy ann ballew written below the question it gave the young womans statistics of age description height and weight and when she was last seen leaving work at the memorial oaks nursing home in deshay louisiana september her car had been recovered from a nearby walmart he read on his throat feeling coated with sand her wallet had been found two miles outside port leo along fm road a week ago anyone with information as to her whereabouts was requested to call the encina county sheriffs department or the port leo police a reward was mentioned the blade mentally replayed his time with his most troublesome darling when could her wallet have gotten out on the road he wondered and with a sick wrench he remembered as he approached his enclave hidden away from the eyes of other men she roused from the stupor hed forced on her with the valiums and she kicked open a window hed veered off the road whirled to grab her and belted her hard four times in the face breaking her cheekbone and nose and knocking her unconscious he was furious having to hurt her before his fun and the broken bones meant hed never gotten to see her smile he traced her smile on the paper with his finger lovely he missed her she must have thrown her wallet out the window before he punched her trying to leave some clue of her passage now the police in louisiana and here must know that she had come through offthepath port leo texas he swallowed the swell of panic the police would no doubt be questioning everyone who lived along fm between here to the county line how hard would they look and how hard would they look at him capture always lingered in the back of his mind an unwelcome companion but one as steady as his shadow now it loomed as a distinct possibility and he had not claimed his most precious darling yet he could not take her now the police would be watching her but in a few days especially if pete was judged a suicide then she would be ripe a plum oozing with juice to be plucked from the tree tonight was monday he could take her he believed by the end of the week friday or saturday they could have a deliciously lost weekend together movies if she were good dinner death then back to work on monday the blade began the somewhat arduous process of hatching a plan what had he overheard velvet call such contingencies in the grocery store he remembered and smiled plan b the interview room at the port leo police department resembled a supply closet more than an interrogation facility in one corner tottered a stack of old computer monitors the department had upgraded their sevenyearold systems recently and no one wanted the old standbys a box of shredded documents ready to be recycled was shoved against the wall two plastic containers of office supplies filled another corner an old wooden table occupied the center of the room marred with circles from water cups and soda cans heather farrell the young woman whod found petes body watched claudia salazar with mulish eyes police chief delford spires sat next to heather quiet letting claudia take the lead in getting the statement claudia noticed with affection that there was a crumb of cake caught in his mustache but she didnt want to point that out with the tape rolling he had just returned from telling the senator her son was dead she turned to the witness okay heather this wont take long claudia said for the record do you have some identification heather farrell dug in her dirty jeans and produced a tattered drivers license one that had expired the birth date indicated that she was two weeks past eighteen the address on the card indicated she was from lubbock in west texas far more than spitting distance from port leo claudia read the information off the drivers license into the tape then handed the laminated card back to heather who proceeded to tidy her nails with the edge of the plastic your family still in lubbock heather claudia asked yeah why did you leave lubbock dirt sucks heather said thats a good reason claudia said pleasantly any others im an artist lots of artists here heather shrugged i thought for sure those galleries would want to give me a bigass fancy show strange it hasnt happened yet you havent updated your drivers license spires said dont drive much these days heather gave delford a caustic look gunks in your mustache mister delford groomed out the offending morsel thank you heather where are you living now heather claudia asked the girl shrugged with a lazy roll of shoulders a willfulness either born of stupidity or of hard use tugged her face into a constant wary frown here and there i camp out at the park down by little mischief beach sometimes do you have a permit to camp claudia already suspected the answer heather shifted in her seat darn i lost it yesterday i havent found a friendly ranger to give me a new one claudia nodded toward the backpack in the corner those pretty much all your belongings yep travel light i dont believe in uhauls so you brought everything you had in the world along with you to meet this guy on the boat i guess heather said with no energy in her voice you moving in with him no i just dont like leaving my stuff lying around did he tell you his name yeah pete majors heather took a swig of the tepid cocoa officer fox had fetched for her he said he was from los angeles majors not hubble big pete majors was his nom de cinema gleaned from the videotapes on the boat claudia saw a thin sheen of sweat on delfords brow despite the cool of the room did mr majors tell you why he was in port leo claudia asked he was writing a movie about his brothers death but he was awful depressed about it i think thats why he killed himself where did you meet mr majors claudia asked at little mischief beach heather answered claudia jotted a note on the pad in front of her little mischief was an aptly named scrabbly beach north of port leo a few miles from the golden gulf marina known as a kids hangout with a small park attached dense with live oaks and red bays a good necking spot but there were better around the county heather brushed fingers through her hair the lights good at little mischief i like to sketch the birds the waves the old folks walking on the shore dopers love little mischief delford interjected am i gonna find some weed in your knapsack young lady no she said rolling her eyes i dont do drugs claudia steered them back on track what was pete doing down at little mischief hed come down there with a notebook computer to write or just chill out and throw pebbles in the surf she wiped a hand across her lips quiet but nice he gave me money for food claudia made a note this money he gave you any strings attached a flash of resentment crossed heathers face of course not what do you take me for more to the point was what pete hubble had taken heather for claudia remained silent for a full thirty seconds and heather began to fidget im not a whore okay he was just being nice she paused maybe he didnt need the money since he was gonna kill himself so he gave you a loan what happened next between you claudia asked heather farrell finished her cocoa and began to tear the rim of the foam cup into strips specks of wet powdery chocolate smeared onto her fingertips but she didnt notice nothing happened he seemed real sad lonely like hed gotten bad news when did he invite you to his boat claudia asked he said he wanted to talk heather said he wasnt sure why he would go on living he barely knew you and yet he suggested to you he was suicidal claudia said sometimes its easier to talk with a stranger than a friend i suppose what was this crushing sadness pete said his brother was the source of all the sadness in his life i gathered his brother died young and he made mention of some preacher that had screwed his brother over somebody jones she glanced at delford he made it sound like maybe this preacher was responsible for his brothers death delford cut in pete tell you what proof he had no but pete bitched that he couldnt make a case stick she looked up from her lap her eyes wide like a child watching a parent for approval youve got to be more specific claudia said what exactly did he say about this preacher and his brother heather scrunched her face christ i didnt take a goddamned transcript and he didnt make a ton of sense ive told you what i know claudia let silence fill the room and began to tap her pen against the notepad he ever suggest you come to his boat and take off your clothes for a movie heather gave a sharp bark of laughter no im not some street whore i havent had any problems with the police since i got here a month ago howd you get over to the marina i hitched a ride into town from little mischief i got to the marina a little after ten she tore a long strip of styrofoam away from her cup and shredded it into confetti so i go to his boat hed told me its the big one at the very end of the dock and i went aboard i called for him but there was no answer the door was open i went downstairs her throat worked and there was no one in the kitchen and the living room so i knocked on the bedroom door it was closed claudia asked yeah heather dabbed at her lips with her tongue i yelled out for pete and pushed hard on the door i saw him on the bed right away and the blood spotting his face she was quiet for a moment a youngster staring at implacable death and realizing she would someday feel its grasp i think i screamed i think i would i got off that boat like it was on fire i screamed running down the docks and people came see anyone suspicious around the boat or around the marina this from delford no heather tented her cocoadaubed hands claudia yanked a tissue from a box and offered it to heather the girl wiped her hands carefully and repeatedly i was so worried about pete how depressed he was i wouldnt have noticed anyone delford nodded solemnly claudia thought you just dont strike me as the girl scout type sweetie do you have your panties on she asked heather heathers mouth twitched excuse me id like to know if you have on a pair of panties why just answer me please yeah i got on panties you think im running around without underwear on show me please i need you to lower your pants enough where i can see youve got a pair on chief would you step outside for a moment delford blinked at this turn of questioning he can stay i dont care heather stood and yanked down on her beltless jeans with a gentle tug claudia could see a slice of panties below the girls waist plain white grimy thank you claudia said heather rearranged her jeans and sat let me guess you found panties on the boat and wanted to be sure they werent mine she was smarter than she acted those panties probably belonged to his lady friend you knew he had a girlfriend delford asked he mentioned a lady that lived with him on the boat once but i got the impression hed had his fill of her he said shed made a lot of money off of him and he was tired of her well need you to stay in town heather until our investigation is done her eyes widened what under house arrest no but dont leave town heather leaned back in her chair i think my statement is done and i want one of them pro bono lawyers like on tv if youre going to ask me any more questions two more simple questions claudia said woman camping a lot you carry a gun heather picked at the table with a dirty fingernail no i have some pepper spray and i know how to kick a guys balls all the way up to his throat you ever see this young woman around maybe down at little mischief claudia pulled a flyer from her notebook and pushed it toward heather delford watched without expression marcy ann ballew heather read she scrutinized the photo as if looking for some vestige of herself in the printed face sorry dont know her where you staying tonight delford asked heather looked discomfited back at the park i guess if youre still shook up spending the night alone out in the darks no fun claudia softened her tone you can crash here oh great a jail cell heather said thanks but no wed leave the door open youre not locked up its clean and warm claudia ventured a grin real cute guy working the night shift the face of marcy ann ballew smiled up at both of them heather shook her head i am not staying in any jail cell then let me call social services theyll find a place for you you just want to keep a tab on me a tab to be sure youre okay claudia said i dont need a tab heather stood we done i got to go as if she had errands to run close to midnight claudia clicked off the tape ill get this typed up and you can sign it can i come back tomorrow and sign im beat sure claudia said thanks for answering our questions delford stood and like detective salazar said dont leave town miss there may be a death inquest and you may have to give testimony ill stick like glue later she gathered up her knapsack and left without a backward glance delford spires shut the door and they say charm school dont make a difference no more she seems awfully sure on the basis of little detail and thin acquaintance with the man that he committed suicide would a man really kill himself over something that happened to his brother long ago i worked the corey hubble case delford sat back down a heartbreaker here one day gone the next and never a sign of him again i wonder what this connection is to a preacher corey sure wasnt religious he was a little hellraiser claudia told him about petes tape and the mention of jabez jones delford clicked his tongue jabez jones was just a kid then too and sure to god was never a suspect shit there was never a sign of foul play in that case period corey just ran off and landed himself into real hot water and never resurfaced pete clearly thought otherwise claudia said i think ill talk to jabez jones she watched delford slump in his seat she was fond of him like one might be of an oldfashioned uncle how are the hubbles she asked devastated i think they felt theyd just gotten pete back in their lives hes stayed his distance lucindas a real strong woman but this might undo her they gave me preliminary statements a twinge of irritation nipped at her hed assigned her the case yet taken statements from the immediate family perhaps it had been best she reasoned giving him the benefit of a doubt but she decided to explode the land mine so do they know pete was a porn star she explained the tapes holy hell no at least she didnt mention it to me why does a son hurt a mother so maybe she hurt him parents can be rotten delford snorted lucinda gave pete the world it aint her fault he didnt want it he sighed a long arduous wheeze and stood he regarded her with critical affection you up for this big a case of course she labeled the tape of heathers statement and dropped it in an accordion folder you okay about david she closed the folder im fine delford really i noticed today that you werent wearing your ring no more claudias thumb rubbed along the bare ring finger a band where the skin shielded by metal that supposedly meant forever stayed pale yeah well the divorce was final yesterday i sent david back the ring i know its a tough time claud and maybe i ought to let gardner handle this one theres no need claudia said really delford i appreciate the concern but im fine and work is heaven for me right now he coughed i can smell the advice baking she said id treat this like a suicide i dont think whit and the me have talked cause of death yet delford ran a finger along a curve of his mustache whit mosley couldnt find his ass in the dark with three flashlights after the election hell probably be running a snowcone stand no hell be a housepainter claudia said you aint one bit funny delford shot back it was a port leo legend fifteen years ago whit and his five brothers had in four masterful hours when delford was away at a football game painted delfords house pink violent electric peptobismol pink delford unwilling to be the butt of a joke had viewed the mosley boys like crazed terrorists even after they repainted his house back to its original white the rest of the town hid its laughter behind their hands and shook their heads in mock scorn at those wild mosleys youre still not over that prank claudia said thats why you dont like any mosley she herself liked whit mosley fine hed palled around with her brother jimmy as kids fishing gigging for frogs swimming in the bay and whit never made her the tagalong tomboy feel unwelcome he had kind eyes gray as the bay when the clouds hung low and he was easy to work with the last jp god rest her soul puked at every single death scene and guilted claudia into taking macrame and quilting classes with her whit kept his lunch and hobbies to himself i dont like mosley period hes running the bench like a beach attraction delford fretted im just saying pete smells like suicide to me are you jumping or driving to that conclusion when i told lucinda that pete was dead she asked straightaway if hed killed himself she told me in detail about the mental problems hes been suffering from over the past several years its in her statement she knew he was nuts but didnt know he was doing porn claudia asked delford frowned well maybe she did know but i wouldnt blame her for not mentioning it his friend velvet insists he would never commit suicide lets talk about petes friends this boat he was staying on real shame its registered in houston its owned by a fellow named tommy deloache in houston hes known as tommy the roach suspected drug ties suspected money launderer and pete hanging with criminals bolsters your suicide theory how from what houston pd says if the deloaches wanted pete dead hed be in the gulf sixty feet down wired to blocks they tidy up after themselves they dont leave bodies around to be autopsied she stood ill keep you apprised of what i find claud dont get bent im just asking you to be sensitive to a mothers grief remember lucindas got an election in less than a month and this could derail it the senator wouldnt get more sympathy votes if he was murdered as opposed to suicide claudia asked bluntly suicide sounds like maybe she was a bad mother damn it claudia youve never handled a death this highprofile and my gut which is both bigger and older than yours tells me pete killed himself if you chase the wrong path and embarrass yourself not to mention senator hubble with all this unrelated garbage about porn and corey hubble and what not thats going to be remembered he shoved his chair hard against the table well hell delford if you dont have confidence in me dont give me the case im just trying to help you the case is yours just mind how you run it she nodded and he turned and left claudia stared at the door he slammed behind him why didnt you tell me pete was back in town whit asked he heard the sharp rasp of faith hubbles breath oh whit god babe i didnt think it mattered he said he wasnt going to stay long a couple of weeks no more if i had an exwife wouldnt you have wanted to know if she showed up in port leo he asked were not dating whit were just i mean oh god i cant have this conversation now sams out of his mind with grief and lucindas a zombie whit hated having to press but he did pete was writing a screenplay faith i dont think he was just waltzing in and out of port leo on a quick jaunt oh god she couldnt hide the shock in her voice movie did you know he was in the movie business faith i cant discuss this right now sams real upset he needs me fine but i need to talk to you all tomorrow i want that i want to see you fine ill call you tomorrow please give my sympathies to the senator and sam i will and thank you in advance whit for your help we appreciate it they said their goodbyes and hung up whit wondered exactly what kind of help he was supposed to provide unasked whit transferred his field notes to an inquest report and assigned the death a case number he had called the mes office in corpus christi as soon as he got into his office to report petes death and the bodys expected arrival at their facility the oncall me had phoned back and whit gave her a brief summation of the case he asked her to be sure and check the corpse for any signs of foul play although from the bodys condition suicide was indicated he hung up and watched the clouds begin to pour a thin steady rain on the sleeping town he gathered up a notebook from the jp training center that offered details on conducting a formal death inquest locked up his office and headed down the darkened hallways of the courthouse grief in whatever variety reminded whit of his mother when he was two she had packed up and walked away from her husband and six sons and vanished into the great blue of the world and in odd moments he ached for her touch as he might ache for a missing limb for the first time in weeks he wondered where his mother was if she were dead or alive he imagined her buried under an assumed name or her unmourned bones bleached by the sun a victim of terrible evil but not always he also imagined her munching a peanut butter sandwich licking stray dabs of plum jelly from her fingers watching the tonight show curled on a bed with green sheets green had been her favorite color she often wore a thin green ribbon in her blond hair at least in pictures he could not remember if he ever played with the ribbon he wondered if she ever thought of him perhaps five sons had seemed manageable and six was just one son too many his mother corey hubble both gone into the maw of the world the difference between whit and pete whit mused was that pete acted or at least attempted to peel back the layers of years toward truth and document what had happened to corey whit admired his guts so what had pete found the police stations night dispatcher a shegrizzly named nelda buzzed him into the building whit freeloaded a cup of highvoltage roadtar coffee from her and collapsed on a rough old bench velvet was giving a statement to claudia salazar he was told and nelda peered at him strangely when he said hed wait being a shoulder for velvet was fine a morons level of political astuteness demanded that he do nothing more but he knew she was alone and he knew the shock of sudden paralyzing loss no harm in being friendly bitter pills were harder to swallow alone delford spires ambled toward him while he sipped his coffee hello partner delford said youre not usually such a dedicated public servant just waiting for claudia to finish up with velvet claud can give the lady a ride to her hotel maybe you and i can chat for a second whit followed delford to the stations back entrance where the smokers were exiled under a metal canopy the rain fell steadily and lightning webbed the sky over the gulf delford dug in his pocket for a pack of marlboros and waited until he had one lit and two puffs down before he spoke so you were gonna wait on velvet i told her id give her a ride and talk to her about pete a ride ill bet delford blew out a calculated plume of smoke edging whits face im just being a nice guy you know what nice gets you with a loose woman delford rubbed the smooth dome of his balding head a burning need for penicillin whit waited for the next nugget of wisdom to fall from delfords lips delford exhaled another stream of smoke this is a hell of a mess whit hell of a mess yes i feel bad for lucinda hubble whit tossed out a verbal card to see if delford would trump delford did oh lord yes i hated to be the bearer of bad news but she had to know suicide is so goddamned selfish and this so close to the election whit sipped his coffee letting delford believe silence signaled agreement then said we dont know that its suicide delford to their right a bluelight bug zapper sounded a long fuzzy trill as it dispatched some flying insect to creeper heaven of course not but i been in law enforcement thirty years partner and youre wet behind both ears and balls pete hubble clearly looks like a suicide to me no sign of struggle big old boy like him he put that gun in his own mouth whit shrugged i think ill wait for the autopsy to make a ruling but i sure dont see why hed come home after all these years just to kill himself especially after he was starting a new film project i get it youre just interested in the media circus get your name in the paper for the voters to see i think you owe some common sense and courtesy to lucinda hubble that this be handled quickly and quietly since dear abbys not available whit said how does ramming a ruling through quickly get classified as common sense and courtesy delford stubbed out his smoke its called decency try to add it to your vocabulary partner lucindas done more for this county than most people have and shes suffered a lot of tragedy in her life so show her some compassion the woman has lost her son i dont plan on being anything but compassionate especially if it turns out her sons been murdered and you wouldnt change your mind because shes a democrat and youre a republican whit had had to make a party affiliation to get the appointment from the republicancontrolled county commissioners but he felt lukewarm about allegiance to any political party party lines bore me delford i imagine the only party line youre interested in is the one leading to the keg whit patted his pockets i like that one i better write it down and note the time and date you actually attempted a joke listen whit delford lowered his voice but kept his amiable smile firmly fixed we all know youre sort of learning as you go but you sure dont want the voters to realize that youre shall we say still climbing the learning curve for all your preaching about compassion whit said i havent heard you show one bit of sympathy for pete hubble lucinda doesnt deserve for that goodfornothing son of hers to muddy her name from the grave youre gonna be out there alone whit looking like a fool when the police and the family who know the truth all say its suicide and youre chasing shadows what is this a goodoldboy plea to stay in step whit said delford shook his head you mustve sniffed some of that pink paint son im not pressuring you to do diddly my judgment is based on years of police experience this is your first big death case whit you screw it up and its real public and its right before the election he laughed and crushed his cigarette under his boot heel and just a tip voters dont vote for candidates who consort with porno queens delford went back into the police station whit watched the rain and finished his coffee when he went back inside nelda told him claudia and velvet had left not three minutes before he drove home devoured a ham sandwich and a bag of corn chips while watching a monty python rerun on cable and went to bed with his jp training materials he read every detail on death inquest procedures he wondered how the voters would react if he and his brothers painted delfords house again reading the procedures written in laws natively ornate style made him drowse his thoughts drifted to the last time he had been with faith making hurried love in a laurel point motel last week she had seemed distracted going through the motions of lovemaking without her usual ardor kissing him as though she were tasting a sour peach he had wondered if she was growing tired of him or preoccupied with lucindas reelection campaign now he wondered if it was because pete had reentered her life he doused the lights when he fell asleep he dreamed not of faith or irina or velvet but of his mother calling his name like a siren from the surfchurned rocks that judge velvet said to claudia as they pulled into the port leo best westerns halffull parking lot tell me about him what exactly do you want to know he said there might be an inquest he gonna be fair extremely fair claudia said he looks like a beach bum not tidied up all the way velvet said i directed a movie called here comes the judge i know bad title but schlocks part of the game i worried that flip wilsons estate would sue did great on video i had a guy who wore nothing under his judges robes in one scene and he did the court reporter and half the jury wow you really are a film visionary claudia said not wanting to hear a synopsis of adult movies a real scorsese arent you the meow kitty i guess i shock you velvet said youre trying too hard to shock me and why would i do that if you dont think what you do is wrong and you beat people over the head with it theyll probably keep their opinions to themselves and what do you know about my profession you know most of the people in the adult film business are married they work it just like a ninetofiver then go home to their families im sure there are hired killers who have white picket fences it doesnt make it respectable claudia turned to her i dont believe in exploiting people you ever use an informant in your line of work ms highandmighty maybe someone whos fallen on hard times gotten himself in a little lick of trouble and wants to stay out of jail and they can if they give you names and numbers and know whos fencing what or where the marijuanas stashed claudia stopped the car in front of the lobby doors rain slid down the windshield blurring the world thats different im enforcing the law youre taking advantage of their weakness to get what you want dont lecture me about using people baby i launch careers i let lonely guys have some fun in the privacy of their own home i show shy ladies how to make a man their love slave forever its a public service if that resonates with you i have less than zero interest in debating you velvet but i dont know of many women who could do what you do and not feel degraded tart it up however you like velvet regarded her with interest i bet whit wouldnt wear anything under his robe if i asked him christ lady your old ones barely cold yet david wasnt even dead only her spankingnew ex but she couldnt imagine touching another man right now ask him and see what happens well hello raw nerve velvet said didnt mean to trespass im not in the market and im especially not in the market for whit mosley im just being a realist i know whit youre not his type and youre involved in a case hes adjudicating men are the simplest maps honey and no one can unfold one better than me i just go for the thing pointing true north and i learn all i need to know whits no different she paused he up for reelection like lucinda yes im sure the hubbles will be riding your ass like the pony express to run the investigation the way they want they dont have any influence over me claudia said velvet watched the rain splatter against the windshield whit defended you to me said you were a good investigator i just hope hes right im sure in a little town sucking up to the right people makes all the difference in promotions youve suffered a really nasty shock tonight and im real sorry about your friend so im just going to ignore what you just said because you dont know jackshit about me youre the one who got out the label maker sweetie velvet opened the car door and ran through the rain claudia peeved followed her they went inside the motel lobby and got velvet checked in claudia asked youre gonna be okay here alone id be better if there was a wet bar ill settle for a shower and a bed thanks for the ride well talk tomorrow claudia said ill have a patrol officer bring you by some clothes and toiletries let her see actual respectable smalltown nice maybe she would unleash a squad of church ladies on velvet no one could be nicer than church ladies on a mission thank you now go work hard and get the fucker who did this velvet said she turned off and went down the hall toward her room claudia drove back to golden gulf marina the crowd had returned to their boats although several craft showed lamps glimmers from behind the curtains people still awake shocked at deaths close amble watching television or drinking decaf to lull themselves to sleep in the gentle downpour she walked to real shame watching the yellow crime scene ribbons flap in the breeze she boarded and heard a low voice talking inside the cabin yeah its all taken care of not a problem she opened the door and eddie gardner smiled clicking off his cell phone whats going on she asked not much just finishing up he gestured to a stack of bagged items and rolls of film neatly tagged how did the statements go you squeeze a confession hardly the girlfriend is sure he didnt off himself and the young woman who found the body is sure he did id like to send both to credible witness school claudia thumbed through the stack of bagged items bedding individual items of clothing including the pair of womens panties velvet had said forcefully that she owned no pair with violets on them wineglass wine bottles the videotape that whit had found find anything interesting she asked not counting the dirty movies no no contraband she smiled gardner could be a toad but he wasnt a bad guy just overimpressed with himself both the other single women at the police station pined to date him although the attraction eluded claudia she ought to shove velvet toward gardner and away from a decent guy like whit shed make gardners day delford with all the tact of a fart in church told me to treat this like a suicide gardner stopped piling the evidence into a case it looks like one i know but considering who this guy is to automatically assume well delfords a man of strong opinions but hes solved practically every major case hes ever had he knows police work hes old friends with lucinda hubble she wont want her sons movie career brought to light and i frankly dont blame her gardner shrugged again look claudia delford clearly has confidence in you if he didnt trust you you wouldnt be here a sudden pang of embarrassment at having shown her doubt hit her gardner bent back to his work not looking at her i know thanks can i give you a hand with the evidence case naw i got it he hoisted a box to his shoulder you coming in a minute i want another look around gardner headed out the door grunting as he carried the box theyve got fox sitting out on the dock all night to watch the boat make sure no one comes aboard great thanks eddie she said in petes bedroom claudia carefully flicked on a light using the edge of her hand black fingerprint dust marked the most obvious spots the light switch the door handle the metal nightstand table where gardner and the deputies helping out from the sheriffs office had dusted and lifted prints thank god david wasnt on duty she didnt want to see him up close and personal quite yet and it would be impossible to avoid with her in the police department and him in the sheriffs office the body and the bedding were gone she opened the closet door she pulled some of the files out of the box the minutiae of everyday life phone bills store receipts credit card slips bank records all haphazardly clumped together pete wasnt rich but he wasnt destitute he had a balance slightly over ten thousand dollars in his van nuys california account according to his most recent statement and hed opened a new account last week at the texas coastal bank port leo branch with an opening balance of four thousand she jotted down the van nuys address she wanted to check with the police there about both pete and velvet it bothered her that he was staying on a boat with ties to a criminal family such affiliations did not appear overnight with a snap of the fingers she was searching the main cabin when gardner came back aboard hey eddie did you see a laptop computer she asked gardner inspected a handwritten inventory pulled from his pocket there was a small portable printer in the other room but i didnt see a computer help me look nothing turned up except some dust bunnies beneath a couch and a box of shotgun ammunition hidden in a back drawer two people have told us pete had a laptop and now he doesnt claudia said they searched again behind furniture in closets in cabinets for another half hour i dont think its here claudia claudia crossed her arms so where the hell is it early tuesday morning whit awoke to his father prodding at him with a thick finger get up little bit babe mosley rumbled and whit was lost in a childhood moment his father between wives whit being ordered to rise before dawn and fix daddy a coffee with bourbon breakfast at the mosleys had never been like in the cereal commercials whit blinked at his fathers frown shit did my alarm not go off hopefully he was still dreaming if he was going to suffer being referred to as little bit why didnt you tell us last night babe demanded despite his childish nickname he was a big barrel of a man close to sixfive and two hundred fifty pounds he boasted a full head of grayish blond hair and clear blue eyes but the cherubic face had softened like a souring cheese moldered more by the dozenplus years hed spent drunk the vodka aged him more than the weight of raising six boys and marrying four wives years of sobriety combined with an addiction to various fitness programs had restored his vitality but no medicine had erased the drunkards veins my sons the goddamned judge a job i got you thank you kindly and i have to hear that pete hubble is dead on the radio whit stumbled to the commode and luxuriated with a heavenly pee babe followed him to the doorway daddy i cant talk about cases whit flushed the toilet and started the shower this is your golden opportunity whitman whit doffed his boxers and stepped into the hot spray say what lucinda hubble rules this county like queen bee victoria this storys gonna be huge its your chance to show the voters what you can do boy i thought thats what i was doing for the past six months whit squirted shampoo into his hand and soaped his hair yes but this gets your name in the papers front page you got to milk this son when you gonna do the inquest youll want to do a formal one not just issue a cause of death make sure the corpus papers there get your photo taken a bunch maybe at the crime scene in your robe and wear proper shoes for once issue press releases all that babe rubbed his hands together that asswipe buddy beere must be shitting bricks with all this terrific publicity youre gonna get you get this mornings merit badge for good taste whit said a man is dead you know im sorry for pete and the hubbles you know that what the hell was pete doing back anyway wheres he been working for the cia whit answered above the roar of the shower to give babe a meaty morsel something about nuclear release codes in ukraine perhaps we shouldnt tell irina youre not amusing to your daddy oddly enough making you laugh about a death case wasnt on my todo list today i got breakfast at the shell inn with patsy and tim babe frowned you tell georgie to quit slinging mud all over town about poor helpless irina news flash you not only remarry again but you fund a competing cafe of course shes pissed at you whit rinsed shampoo from his head and soap from his body babe handed him a towel georgiell forgive me she always does women are far better at forgiving than men could ever be babe said whit thought of faith hubble and wondered if that was really true the shell inn was an establishment one might generously term a halfbreed the front of the restaurant offered serviceable meals catering to the fishing crowd and the retirees who refused to slap down more than five bucks for a meatandtwovegetable plate the back contained a funky dark bar that boasted its own atmosphere breezes of bourbon mists of beer warm fronts of tobacco smoke for the old guard of port leo the shell inn which had been in continuous business since except the five times it was nearly destroyed by hurricanes was a basic requirement of life in town up there with a newspaper and water service georgie oconnor mosley perched by the cash register sipping milky coffee and contemplating the corpus christi callertimes financial section she had been whits first stepmother his mothers oldest and dearest friend georgie and babe had married more out of friendship and a mutual hope to provide six devastated boys a mother but those reasons shriveled under the neversetting sun of reality georgie relentlessly practical and blunt and babe a roaring drunk still in love with an absent first wife only lasted three stormy legendary years the six mosley boys all loved georgie without reserve they knew the bullet she had taken for them babe had bought the shell inn for her the christmas after their divorce a parting gift and georgie kept the mosley name to irritate him tell your daddy he shouldve listened to me about those overseas stock funds georgie said as whit entered im making a killing i could buy and sell babes ass hes more conservative with his money whit said i would think anyone who imports firm young former communist flesh into his bed would be receptive to new ideas georgie kissed his cheek she smelled of lip balm and oranges and steered him to his corner table where patsy duchamp and tim oleary sat no coffee for whit georgie until he gives me a quote patsy duchamp said as whit sat down patsy was the editor of the port leo mariner a biweekly paper and like whit she had trudged home carting an english degree from a prestigious college patsys hair was as dark as a crows feathers she had sharp penetrating eyes and she rationed her smiles no comment patsy whit said as georgie sloshed steaming coffee into whits cup quote please patsys breakfast had already arrived and she stirred a pat of butter into her grits it looks like he died of a gunshot wound but im not saying anything official until we get an autopsy report from corpus i heard it looked selfinflicted patsy said i for sure have no comment now then youll call me the moment you know what the me says anyway or you better patsy said pretty please when did you take a pollyanna pill pete hubbles death might be the biggest story of the year of the past five years especially if it was murder and patsy lived for news to cover beyond city council and navigation district meetings fishing tournaments and high school football you talk to the senator yet asked tim oleary the county attorney tim looked worn this morning no late night whit asked yeah too much merlot or too much graham greene last night whit asked tim only had two vices it was an australian cabernet and too much greene is impossible tim said you two arent gonna start talking literature and ignore all this juicy news patsy said so lets talk pete hubble actually lets not whit said lets talk about corey hubble patsy lowered her eggy fork oh i smell me an ongoing series of stories patsy if i farted would it be off the record whit asked patsy looked stung fine were miles off the record whit glanced around no one was seated close to their table an orchestration of georgies tell me what you remember about corey hubble annoying tim said a rotten little punk patsy said never got over his daddys death tim agreed mad at the world patsy added pissed at his own shadow tim said a pothead patsy said he hung around with dopers you know i always thought he was gay he hated sports tim might relish his thick tolstoys and fullbodied syrahs but he also worshiped football and fishing preferences ironcast in most male coastal bend genes not gay patsy said corey dated my cousin marian in a way that should have gotten them on jerry springer they beat each other up a couple of times if memory serves marian told me corey would diddle her for exactly one minute with a look of incredible gratitude on his face and then slap her around she lowered her voice and i heard once he used to torture cats and lucinda sent him to a therapist in corpus but that might have been political mudslinging cats are big with the retiree vote do you remember anything about when corey vanished whit asked his regular order of scrambled eggs garlic cheese grits bacon and biscuits arrived and patsy and tim waited until the waitress had refilled their coffee cups and retreated people said hed run away to embarrass his mother tim gave a hangover frown to whits food when he never came back then i think everyone imagined hed been murdered while hitchhiking or some other unpleasant end patsy nodded it was common knowledge corey resented lucindas career in politics hed already lost a father and now here was his mother throwing herself into the most timeconsuming career possible probably he got involved with the wrong people somewhere south padre or galveston or mexico and ended up dead whit made a leap of faith that patsy would stick to her word about being off the record do you remember corey and jabez jones being particular friends tim faked puking it annoys me no end that what port leo is going to be known for on television is an exwrestler who performs ab crunches while quoting scripture you know if my memorys not fading with age jabez was the last person to talk to corey patsy said i covered it in the high school paper could you do me a huge favor and dig up the clippings from when corey vanished whit asked nothing more you can say patsy asked no can i still have the clippings this is why god made little retired ladies bored enough to do schlepp work at the mariner sure but what will you do for me patsy asked ill call you as soon as i have prelim autopsy results whit promised patsy smiled like the aztec goddesses blood placated her claudia had just finished showering after four hours of fidgety sleep when the knock came at her door she pulled on her robe wrapped her heavy black hair in a towel and peered through the doors security hole david she had not seen him since he walked alongside her down the county courthouse hallway saying quietly listen im sorry you did this claud you know i still love you her attorney had tucked a hand on her elbow and steered her away past the flyers and the benches and the secretary puzzling over a soda choice at the coke machine and out to the bright fall light the morning haze burning to wisps over the bay she had walked in married and walked out free and clear she had gotten in her car suddenly flustered and near weeping and driven halfway across port leo toward the home they shared before she remembered she didnt live there anymore but she did still live in port leo and both she and david were peace officers why not grab the inevitable by the throat and give it a good shake she opened the door morning david power said hed gotten his auburn hair cropped shorter than usual he wore his encina county deputys uniform and she noticed the creases were flattened she had tended his uniform for him since hed burn his hand if he got within ten feet of an iron dark circles daubed the fleshiness beneath his eyes and hed missed a patch of reddish bristle on his jaw during his shave good morning whats up keep it brief keep it polite just wanted to see if you were okay i heard about the hubble case short on sleep but fine david shifted his beige stetson from one hand to the other you know if yall need help the sheriffs department were glad to assist thanks its under control she didnt say anything further and he massaged the brim of his hat drumming his fingertips against the band everything okay in your new place he asked yeah sure she knew he wanted to be invited in but she didnt want him in the little space she had staked out for her own she drew the robe a little tighter around her front in atypical modesty his voice lowered jesus claud ive seen your skin before remember padre they had honeymooned on south padre the mightiest and most beautiful of the long chain of texas barrier islands and unfortunately it had been the best time in the marriage a week away from both their cloying families a week away from car wrecks and burglaries and speeding tickets david loved to invoke padre as if teethchilling margaritas orangebright sunsets and spinerattling sex could serve as the basis for the rest of their lives david his blue eyes narrowed and his fleshy mouth thinned youre alone right i told you theres no one right i never hit you took wonderful care of you never cheated on you you just dont love me anymore same old same old are you coming to check up on me spy on me or belittle me she kept her voice neutral david powers jaw worked check on you sorry i crossed a line it still hurts its gonna hurt for an indeterminate period of time i dont want to hurt you back claudia im sorry for your hurt i am but weve had this discussion a hundred times before and theres no point in rehashing her phone rang and she said look ive got to get going and he said i need to ask you about something else so she shrugged and said wait a sec and hurried to the telephone hello claudia salazar a throaty womans voice but brisk as a marine yes whos callling hold please ordered captain brisk instead of muzak there was a recorded sleek baritone with soft strains of america the beautiful playing in the background the voice intoned proven leadership for the texas coastal bend senator lucinda hubble democrat moderate protecting our children protecting our elderly protecting our precious coastal ecology and protecting our health care while protecting our economy lots of protection claudia wondered if the faithful automatically wore condoms during rallies a former nurse senator hubble especially understands the needs and concerns of our retiree population vote november seventh to reelect senator lucinda hub the verbal pabulum broke off ms salazar not miss brisk but instead a confident bright voice yes this is detective salazar claudia had a sudden feeling she was going to need the title she turned and saw david had stepped inside the apartment shutting the door behind him and he blanched as she used her maiden name she had been claudia power for the twentytwo months of the marriage but no more and david in particular seemed to take her revived surname as a hard slap the voice on the phone honeyed slightly detective good morning this is faith hubble im senator hubbles chief of staff im sorry about your exhusband ms hubble thank you its a terrible tragedy my motherinlaw and my son are having a difficult time with petes death and youre not claudia wondered thats understandable id like to meet with you and find out where we are in the investigation we claudia noticed as though faith hubble were busily lifting prints and completing paperwork into the wee hours weve collected a certain amount of evidence but we dont as yet have autopsy results i would like to talk with you and your family as soon as possible talking with lucinda is that absolutely necessary shes absolutely griefstricken and we already gave our statements to delford spires yes maam and im sure this is a difficult time for you all but yes i do need to speak with her as will judge mosley perhaps you and i could meet first to discuss how to deal with the media claudia watched david inspecting her bare apartment his face emotionless we already have policies in place maam yes im sure you do but this is far more highprofile than a drunken tourist drowning and theres already been serious news leaks faith said lets meet in an hour shall we at your office fine let them meet to discuss the press but claudia would seize the opportunity for a frank discussion with the dead mans former wife see you in an hour faith hubble hung up claudia clicked off the phone david stood at the apartments large window looking at the parking lot you should have gotten a bay view claudia ive seen the bay every day of my life she said she didnt want to mention she couldnt afford a bay view on her singlewoman salary thanks for stopping by but duty calls speaking of duty poppys birthday is this coming weekend and i was hoping you could go to his party with me poppy was davids grandfather patrick power closing in on ninety now relegated to the care of a port leo nursing home but still the patriarch of the oldcoast irish clan if youre not there poppy will wonder why oh david thats not a good idea um well he gave her a halfapologetic smile poppy doesnt know about the divorce claud he doesnt believe in divorce and we havent wanted to upset him his hearts weak you know claudia believed poppys heart could serve as a rich source of granite tell him david im not going to play along in a charade thanks a bunch claudia jesus one favor you know how poppy loves you yes hes never missed a chance to pat my fanny you want to hurt me fine whatever just dont hurt my family i dont want to hurt anybody i just want to have my own life now she was yelling doing exactly what she had promised herself not to do this life is what you want david gestured at the drab apartment she had hardly unpacked any belongings in the month she had been here a few salazar family pictures stood on a dusty coffee table dishes stacked in the sink a futon unfolded in the den and sloppy with sheets shed let david keep most of the furniture just to spare herself the whining you dont seem to be relishing your singleness im busy with work she said arent you anything to change the topic yeah im working this missingperson case girl from louisiana they think ended up here marcy ballew you got that one yeah i briefly met the girls mother when she stopped by the station claudia said terrible not knowing what happened david that master of the wounded glance and gesture took full advantage yeah not knowing what went wrong i know exactly how the lady feels six berths down from real shame where pete hubble breathed his last was a fiftythreefoot workhorse hatteras sports fishing boat christened dont ask this was a craft used to take serious fishermen out into the deeper bowl of the gulf where the marlin and shark hopefully provided thrills at an exorbitant hourly rate dont ask belonged to an oddball friend of whits a man known to most people simply as gooch gooch did not socialize overmuch he was unfailingly polite and ethical in his dealings with other guides the marina and his clients and admired for making small loans to guides who frequently needed a cash boost at the end of the month most of port leo was happy to give him his privacy because gooch was ugly and big and had a hard notolerance light in his glare that explained his boats name whit had only found him to be generous loyal and slightly east of sane for twenty minutes whit had been mired in quicksand conversation with the marina manager who could tell him nothing new about pete and velvet the manager who smelled slightly of soured baby formula and had an unnoticed glob of infant burp on his shoulder explained that real shame had begun docking at golden gulf only five weeks ago and its bills were paid by check mailed from a company in houston tdd holdings the arrangement had been handled by an elderly man in a wheelchair who apparently worked for tdd name of anson todd and the manager had not seen mr todd again since the shame docked as for pete and velvet they had not mingled much with the other marina residents nor had they caused any trouble whit left the office spotted gooch on his boat and headed down the thead an honest man would be at work by now whit said as he came aboard i chose to use this day for reflection and selfimprovement gooch grinned showing slightly uneven teeth i gave myself the day off i figured youd be back down here soon enough you still holding the cops dicks for them so they can pee straight kindness demanded one say gooch was simply not handsome his face was too gaunt for his body and married a tooprominent bumpy nose with small muddy brown eyes he kept his sunstreaked hair cut short in a military burr but he was powerfully built stonecarved arms and legs the kind of physique that encouraged burly bar patrons to keep observations about goochs unfortunate face private coffee yhonor gooch asked please with milk and sugar gooch pointed toward the galley youre the embodiment of the service economy gooch whit fixed his own cup and went back up to the deck where gooch gobbled his way through a leviathan bowl of capn crunch you want some he asked through a milkdripping mouth no thanks screw your stepmom yet my father and irina are very happy thanks for asking and youre very miserable gooch said youve got to make some more room on this wall for your diplomacy awards whit said i didnt see you docked here last night when duty called i spent the evening over in port aransas playing poker i didnt sail home until this morning were the gossips awake no hen yard could compare to marina liveaboards for rapidfire rumormongering all ive heard is that the guy on real shame shot himself in the mouth now itd be a real shame indeed if that hot little number living with him on the boat really did it and got herself sent to girly prison where she could never experience the joys of gooch youve met velvet her name is velvet velvet mojo stripper or actress an adultfilm director gooch set down his cereal bowl no we havent met cute but rough like a mare thats been rode hard and put up wet like my dad used to say who would know about them here gooch shrugged they kept to themselves not much for fishing and not much for boating i saw them docking once they needed about five people to help them dock properly he considered probably they talked with ernesto gooch went to his radio and spoke briefly he left the radio on to hear the chatter of the working fishermen and guides across st leo bay and beyond whit could hear three or four male voices joking chattering one complaining about a dearth of redfish someone asking that a poker game be rescheduled for tomorrow someone else hailing captain bill ernestos the marina handyman he sees the cops coming he hides so i bet no authority figure has taken a statement hell be down in a second so spill details whit told gooch who he would trust with the launch keys for americas nuclear arsenal what he knew thus far about pete hubble gooch laughed lucinda hubble walks around town like shes got a coal lump up her ass and none of us are good enough to sniff the diamond her boys off making fuck films i love it youve got to quit being overly sympathetic to people gooch i wonder if this velvet was planning to ply her trade here please dont tell me you want to audition gooch tapped his unshaven chin its an interesting moral dilemma most men pretend to have fantasies straight out of a porn movie but how many would actually walk the walk and show their worth in front of rolling cameras not me im too shy gooch watched ernesto gomez hurry down the thead i on the other hand have a decided lack of inhibitions i would be a natural strutting among the starlets but i wouldnt do a porn film either why not anytime you see a blue movie remember this those women were once somebodys baby girls do you think a single one of them thought in kindergarten gosh when i grow up please god please let me be smart and talented enough to be a porn star no way theyre barbie dolls who got bent along the way whit sipped his coffee pete hubble was a kid once too so he had some deepseated shortcoming and he was proving he was a socalled real man or maybe he wanted to piss off mommy or maybe he wanted to just lose himself and forget some nasty shit this concludes our psych lecture gooch shrugged i feel as sorry for him as i do for the women even though he got to sleep with more women than you or i ever will combined so he screwed hundreds of women you think he got to sleep with them no whit no real kissing holding enjoying each woman for her unique sparkle in her eyes the taste of her skin the shape of her lips when you bring her pleasure no it was assemblyline sex no thanks gooch stood and invited ernesto gomez in rapidfire spanish to come aboard ernesto was in his fifties with a moonwide face centered by a nervous smile his left eye wandered slightly and he kept that side of his face turned a bare angle away in spanish gooch offered him coffee and asked if they could converse in english as whits spanish was execrable ernesto nodded and kept his tight grin locked in place judge mosley grew up with the man who died gooch added ernesto frowned in sympathy very sad yes did you notice many visitors to his boat whit asked ernesto glanced at gooch who murmured in spanish and nodded reassuringly pete had a few visits a richlooking lady a teenage boy the dirtbag the richlooking lady was probably either lucinda or faith the boy was no doubt petes son sam the dirtbag whit asked ernestos face wrinkled in distaste si bossy no respect young too good for everyone else has porsche but keep it dirty dont take care of it you know this guys name gooch asked ernesto shook his head sorry gooch he come here once twice a week over the past month or so take the boat out for all the day come back at night fishing i suppose one time they argue im fixing rot two boats down i hear them laughing yelling much drinking what did they argue about ernesto murmured to gooch in a low torrent of spanish gooch patted him on the knee ernesto glanced back at whit money the old man said money to be paid to pete this man owed pete money ernesto considered and scratched his lip i think that how it was yet you said they were partying together not yesterday not after arguing can you tell me what they said whit asked ernesto grimaced they talk too fast for my english but dirtbag all red in the face i hear them yelling i come over to the boat want to be sure all is okay i see through the windows dirtbag took swing at pete but pete he strong and big dirtbag just heavy has hands of man who never works pete pushed him down dirtbag left very angry ernesto pressed gave a more detailed description of dirtbag heavyset around fiveten blondish late twenties or early thirties thinning hair bright clothing always loud the teenage boy you saw do you know a young man named sam hubble no i saw the boy once yesterday at lunch i guess skipping school any others you can remember yeah short guy last week handed me a piece of paper on his way to petes boat blue and red and white talked plenty smelled like mints too much mints you know that sounds like your esteemed opponent buddy beere gooch said isnt he an unrepentant altoid sucker this paper what did it say whit asked ernesto waved hands wanting folks to vote you see all those signs around now campaign flyers from buddy gooch said that savvy bastard courting the illegal immigrant vote did you hear anything last night whit asked no nothing until the cops came i was asleep you ever see any young women coming around to his boat whit asked ernesto nodded yeah i forgot with that preacher the one on tv with the big muscles he brought lady with him but she big and scary big muscles like a man with titties ernesto glanced back toward the marina office mike be mad i not working dont worry about mike whit said have the police talked to you about this ernesto appeared stricken no please mister no policia i dont know nothing about nothing its okay dont worry whit soothed one other question the woman named velvet you see her around much ernesto smiled velvet yes she bakes good chocolate cookies every few days give some to me velvet baking cookies whit tried to summon the image and pictured a hausfrau in a leather apron and stiletto heels you ever see her bake an eclair gooch asked with a leer ernesto looked confused so whit asked did she and pete get along okay sure yeah she mess around with any of the guys around the marina gooch asked no she nice ernesto put the bright smile back on end of commentary gracias i appreciate it ernesto whit shook his hand ernesto hurried back toward the marina office im guessing the rich lady was lucinda gooch said unless theres a bored matron around here in need of sexual servicing your stepmother for instance funny with a hint of vicious you could outdo pete hubble on the annoyingyourrelatives scale if you do your oedipus impersonation whitman jesus gooch youre a crank im finding a place to live right after the campaign ah yes the campaign waging a fierce one arent you i particularly enjoyed your interview on face the nation are you done whit please campaign today the thought of buddy beere at the bench makes me want to move to a judicially sound country like cuba whits cell phone buzzed hello whit its faith she sounded crisper this morning less frayed with shock how are you were holding up lucinda finally slept last night sam slept with me to just get his dad back and then its a hard thing for a kid i need to talk to yall for the inquest would this afternoon work for you yeah how about four fine her voice lowered i wish i could see you just us i could use a hug or something stronger he didnt flirt back watching a gull alight on the bow of real shame hows sam handling this my son is a tightly controlled mass of nerves hes upset but he doesnt want to show that he is his father did matter to him even a lousy sob like pete her tone turned bitter a father always would what can i do to help he meant to help sam but faith took the inches and made them miles please just hurry us through all this legal rigmarole dont drag it out with a public inquest hearing help me protect lucinda and sam from what is sure to be unpleasantness whit youll do that for me wont you her tone usually cool even in wriggles of heat took on a slightly cajoling tone ill do what i can the quiet stretched but she finally said i appreciate it ill see you at the house later whit clicked off his phone gooch studied a tidal chart and yawned i must have a gift certificate for unwanted advice do this do that rule its suicide dont hold a formal inquest gooch raised a crooked brown eyebrow rule how you please judge and screw em if they cant take a joke velvet came awake suddenly in the bright haze from the motel windows she rubbed her eyes and thought so now starts the rest of your life babe what are you going to do sleep remained impossible after that prissassed cop dropped her off at the motel she lay awake listening to the hum of the air conditioner as it chilled the room and the gentle bump of her heart as she hugged a goosefeather pillow close to her body pete dead and only yesterday hed said to her im not gonna do another flick with you until all this with my brother is settled understand you can help me or you can fly your ass back to california but im not leaving now shed pouted furious well if you loved me you would hed set his lips tight and turned away from her i guess i dont love you then velvet and now even though she was sure pete hadnt meant it the words could not be undone loved away erased made into meaningless wisps velvet thought about lucinda hubble and faith hubble and a hot cinder formed in her heart hatred was too polite a word for what she felt she thought of young sam hubble and her throat tightened for sam and pete and what could never be if god were merciful pete strutted in heaven now and her own mother might be meeting him at the pearly gates smiling at him with all the love shed once lavished on velvet taking him by the hand introducing him to the other souls flitting from cloud to cloud that image made her cry like you believe in that shit anymore girl pete was probably frying in hell and scooting over in the bubbling oil to make room for her the cry did her good velvet dried her tears on the pillowcase enough weepiness it was time for action she needed a plan b the hubbles clearly wielded influence here the local powersthatbe she suspected would treat her as petes embarrassing girlfriend if it was suicide and a possible suspect if it was murder and she had zero intention of sitting like a lump and letting her ass be moved around the political chessboard she decided claudia salazar would be useless but whit mosley wouldnt she reviewed the mental picture shed formed of him nicely tall trim full blondish hair tan but not from idling on a beach face a little too boyish for his years kindness in the smile smart but not snotty a beach bum grown up perhaps only recently average teeth firm legs and butt terrific hands the checklist of how she typically evaluated the rookie male talent for her movies on initial meeting before the pants dropped she liked a man with strong hands the hands were seen more in the movies than you would think cupping breasts running fingers through hair holding faces for a kiss and whit might be putty to a woman with her talent and charms and persuasive skills at nine in the morning she called her production companys lawyers in van nuys and a few friends ignoring the time difference between the texas coast and california breaking the sad news about pete she left a voice mail for the lawyers to find her some legal representation in corpus christi a bigcity attorney hardened enough to deal with pissingmad senators and provincial police then she took a bath relaxing herself in the soapy hot water and only when a stray thought crossed her mind did she sit upright in a panic what if whoever killed pete thought she knew what pete knew she didnt hed kept his research about corey tight to his chest just telling her all was going well he had discussed none of the screenplay with her the killer might not believe that she dried off combed her hair and sat naked as she leafed through the coastal bend yellow pages researching pawnshops and gun dealers the images played across the television the screen the only light in the cabin and the blade sat and watched as big pete majors took velvet mojo from behind both of them grunting like animals she tilting her head to keep her wraparound sunglasses on during the pounding encounter they moaned so much it sounded like they had intestinal disorders pete did not offer a range of theatrical nuance he just knelt behind her ramming with his hips while velvet pleaded with him to go stronger and faster more like a testy coach than a lover petes face was as blank as the boys the blade remembered from the mental home he watched the tape twice before he finally fell asleep in his recliner he awoke in a sour mood because he had dreamed not of velvet but of whit mosley laughing at him you shes gonna pick you over me what reality does that happen in fat ass the blade had watched whit in public and women smiled at him whereas women suddenly recalled other appointments and hurried on their way when the blade tried long conversations hating whit was easy the blade imagined whit dead hollowed out and himself stepping into whits skin pulling the pallid skulllness face over his own like a mask fitting his fingers into whits fingers like gory gloves why not kill mosley as well as take velvet he considered dismemberment held a certain appeal as did evisceration although they certainly cut short the fun he considered decapitation overrated heads seemed mocking without bodies attached the blade had learned that truth the hard way hed never wanted to kill a man particularly before but it promised an interesting difference like fries after a solid week of potato chips he daydreamed about whit dying from a slow careful series of cuts and a slow whisper filtered into his ears he stared at the ceiling and its whirring fan the fan spinning resembled a dark eye mamas eyes he stared barely breathing only hearing mamas voice telling him what he must do he awoke and knew he had slipped to that inky world that mama had shaped she used to say with her sure smile right before she warmed the wrench on the stove or clicked the clothespin shut on his little flick of a penis were together forever honeybunch and dont you ever forget it thank god he would think that he had managed to become the hero of his own story mama had not won he had he would still his phone rang he picked up and chatted through morning niceties then listened this young woman who found petes body the familiar voice murmured into his ear do me a favor give her some money get her out of town sure said the blade i can do that for you santa fe is lovely this time of year and i bet theres a nice affordable youth hostel or perhaps florida if shes still set on a beach he listened to detailed instructions and hung up the phone his thumb began to itch for the keen sharpness of his knife if heather farrell needed to leave town well many were the avenues a hefty bribe paled compared to other options hed gotten away with this every time well except that one time so very long ago why not again he was already in the mood he considered how best to approach the problem and how to avoid any messy ramifications a lure simple would do nothing could interfere after all with his plan for velvet he ducked under the sagging bed he slept on and reached for his bowie knife it was lovely stout and sharp enough to cut hopes and dreams he rummaged in a box with mamas stuff written on the side in thick magic marker and found a worn sharpening stone the blade dragged the knife back and forth across the stone a rhythmic caress that whispered heather heather heather the blade flicked on his stereo the beach boys sang in perfect harmony about their and the knife moved to the beat claudia wrote a terse report on the investigations status and left it on delfords empty desk she grabbed a cup of thin coffee from the kitchen when she got back to her desk the dispatcher was buzzing her she had a visitor in the lobby faith hubble i get the feeling the dispatcher whispered she dont like waiting the lobby was barely ten feet by ten feet cramped with a chair a side table of old magazines and a rack of flyers on safety and community policing the woman sat in the chair pulling a loose string from the tattered upholstery and snapping it with her fingernail mrs hubble im claudia salazar faith stood and offered a hand they shook hands quickly and faith followed claudia back to her office from their phone conversation claudia had pictured a different woman shed imagined one of those nononsense austin politicos healthclub firm and sororitygirl petite blondhelmet hair with a crisp suit and jumpwhenisay demeanor faith hubble was a bigboned woman approaching six feet tall generously chested and thighed with a creamy complexion and thick brown hair arranged in a hurried french braid pretty but loosely put together her italian suit was tailored black with a white silk blouse but the jacket was already rumpled and a smear of jam soiled the cuff claudia imagined faith more at home on a honkytonk bar stool than a campaign trail have a seat mrs hubble thanks for seeing me on such short notice hon i assume were both pressed for time so i wont dillydally with you whats the status of the investigation faith kept her eyes bright hazel beauties firmly fixed on claudias face like a drill sergeant surveying a sweating recruit mostly were waiting for lab reports claudia was uneasy with the idea of snapping to and giving this woman a complete rundown but she suspected delford would provide the hubbles all the information there was little point in being evasive and when will the lab geeks deliver tomorrow or the next day any way to rush them faith asked obviously the family wants to know what happened as soon as possible her voice was low and throaty as though corroded by cigarettes or whiskey science cant be rushed certain tests take a certain amount of time claudia paused im sure you and the senator wouldnt want the tests to be inaccurate honey im dealing with a devastated mother and a heartbroken son they need some sort of closure no grief of your own claudia thought faith hubble carried herself more like a woman inconvenienced than bereaved how would you feel now if david died though a sense of loss would be inescapable david had not been a bad husband just not the right one for her their life had not been all misery she hoped her heart would be big enough to mourn his passing faith straightened her sleeve noticed the jam and muttered in anger her fingernails were painted cranberry red and she clicked them together impatiently im also dealing with a press corps with a decided lack of scandal or news in this campaign and theyre gonna be on petes death like dogs on ribs they got deadlines and imaginations hon and theyre gonna write id like to be sure your department doesnt feed them newsy tidbits that are inappropriate weve told the press nothing but the bare essentials that a man was found dead on a boat at the marina and were investigating petes death was all over the radio this morning detective they knew his name that he was lucindas son im sure the press spoke to people at the marina people could see which boat we swarmed over i guess they knew his name im afraid we cant stifle the public or petes friend velvet faith rubbed her forehead do you know what its like to have your life be tabloid fodder its like showering in a glass bathroom she shook her head i know that yall know what pete did for a living delford told us and i cant let aaron crawford use this to defeat lucinda he could use petes suicide as an unfair disparagement on lucindas abilities as a mother he was your husband father of your child do you even care one bit about him claudia wondered such a tactic might backfire voters might see it as a rotten attempt to gain from mrs hubbles personal loss never overestimate the voters faith said no confidential information will leak from this department ill be sure all press inquiries are routed to me or delford im thinking of my son not the political damage to lucinda faith said sam doesnt know you understand sure and i would like to review any announcements that your department makes on the investigation claudia stiffened thats not going to be possible faith set her chin in her palm and kept her tone relaxed let me clarify hon i said review not approve or edit or block if youre going to release damaging information about pete id like the opportunity to prepare a statement on the senators behalf surely thats reasonable claudia suddenly felt dumb in the face of this womans impenetrable confidence well try not to blindside you thank you detective i sure do appreciate it faith stood to go i need you to answer a few questions first claudia said pleasantly delford took our statements surely youve taken the time to review them its best if i can hear it from you please claudia gestured at the chair faith sat folding her small italian purse in her lap it too was black all the trappings of widowhood without the teary inconvenience of grief were you in regular contact with him claudia asked not until he returned to port leo before that perhaps a couple of times a year sams birthday if he remembered and at christmas i imagine christmas is his slow season with so little contact you cant make a reasonable judgment as to whether he was suicidal i suppose claudia ventured faith had already mentioned suicide twice as though it were a given faith frowned i think someone in porn has serious selfesteem issues dont you perhaps he didnt send you child support nails clicked why is that relevant pray tell im trying to determine if his son was part of the reason to come home making me and his mama squirm was the reason we occupied seats of honor on his shit list detective when pete announced his intention to leave me and our infant son and go to california for this folly of being in movies i knew hed fail he had lofty goals but no real talent and the selfdiscipline of a drug addict when i found out hed ended up doing adult films i wanted to be sure he could never hurt sam or lucinda she rubbed her tired eyes ill give him a smidge of credit that he did send support for sam every now and then but he sent it to his mother she would then turn the money over to me i in turn would donate it to charity starving children in ethiopia monsoon relief in bangladesh always a good cause far removed from us why give away the money if it was intended for your son that money was earned on petes back or other body parts she said dismissively i didnt want petes smut translating into food in my sons stomach when was the last time you spoke to pete faith shifted in her seat yesterday morning he phoned the house wanting to talk to sam how did he seem depressed unhappy if you had ended up like him utterly failed utterly cheapened wouldnt you be depressed hed seen the lives that sam and i have built sam and i have a good life i think pete regretted the choices hed made if our lives are the candy store he definitely had his face pressed against the glass do you know if hed sought professional help pete on a shrinks couch never he thought couches were good for one thing and one thing only you didnt like the way he made his money or lived his life but you didnt object to him seeing your son faith tented her fingers beneath her chin her hands were like ivory no i didnt like it but sams like the rest of the hubbles he has a mind of his own he wanted to see his father when his father came back so i permitted limited visits better that than sam sneaking around to see pete how would you characterize their relationship relationship my ass real anger tinged her voice sam spent most of his childhood wondering what was so wrong with him that his father shunned him as though the child were the damaged goods not the man but when he got to know his father sam finally realized pete counts as little more than a sperm donor you mentioned pete was depressed when he called you can you be more specific faith fingered a wrinkle in her tailored slacks he asked if he could speak to sam i told him sam had already left for school he begged me to let sam know hed called and i agreed we said goodbye and hung up that was the last time i spoke to him do you know if sam returned his fathers call i gave him the message but sam didnt seem particularly interested in phoning his father back let me get this straight maam he didnt mention to you after yall found out pete was dead whether or not hed talked to his father that day faith shifted in her seat again sam probably talked to him yes i dont remember it was a very long upsetting evening how badly will it hurt his mothers campaign if voters learn pete was a porn star claudia asked her throat worked i have no idea surely when he showed up you had to calculate what the possible damage might be lucinda has been an outstanding senator for the past sixteen years shes easily won reelection and her approval ratings are high theres no reason to think she wouldnt have the voters support you sound like a press release given breath claudia said and faith stiffened no one in her office was eager to advertise about pete were you i have no intention of being harangued by you claudia suspected the damage from faith and lucindas viewpoint would be considered catastrophic nuclear careerending do you know if he kept a gun claudia asked i have no idea do you know if he was having financial problems of any sort no do you know if he was involved with drugs anything illicit faiths mouth tightened as though a stench had drifted into the cramped room if id suspected for a moment he was a drug user i wouldnt let sam within a mile of him do you know if he was still involved in porn he told me he wanted to leave that business faith rubbed her lip perhaps it was more politic claudia considered for faith to paint pete as on the road to reforming a bad guy whod come home to senator mommy and seen the error of his ways before his unfortunate demise if there is anything suspicious about petes death if its not suicide then i suggest you take a long hard look at that velvet woman shes entirely unstable how so how mentally stable could she be sleeping with hundreds of men it would warp a soul warp a heart do you know shes done that i thought she directed not acted as if that matters faith dismissed the difference with a flutter of fingers youre a woman who works in a maledominated profession right detective yes so do i and a woman like velvet is a traitor to all women we fight and bust our butts to be considered equals and she traps women as carnal playthings madeup dolls that exist only to pleasure men faith leaned closer she was obsessed with pete she didnt want him to come back to texas but she followed him pete might have been making the best effort to shed that world and here she is blocking his every move she leaned back i think pete probably killed himself but if your tests argue otherwise i think she killed him funny she says the same thing about you at least thats what she told judge mosley faiths smile tensed then relaxed thanks for letting me know detective ill sue the bitch for slander claudia had waited to see if faith would broach the subject of custody speaking of legal proceedings i understand pete was considering fighting for custody of sam faith blinked then laughed surely you jest he wouldnt have a prayer in family court he never mentioned a desire for custody of sam no never not once who says so velvet consider the rather polluted source claudia shifted focus do you know anyone named deloache no did pete ever talk about his brother corey to you a surprised blink corey god no hes a forbidden subject with pete or with the senator with pete it was too painful for him they were real close he didnt tell you he was making a film about corey no he didnt but judge mosley told me last night pete never mentioned a movie to any of us you can imagine how awful it would be for the senator ripping open terrible old wounds she raised her palms up in mock surrender another perfect example of how unthinking pete could be pete had a laptop computer thats missing do you know where this laptop or a copy of his notes or script might be good god no faith said claudia saw the faintest tremble of the womans bottom lip i assume on the boat did you ever visit him on the boat yes once when i went there with sam i wanted to be sure pete was creating a suitable environment for visits that whore velvet wasnt around that helped if you were on the boat then ill need to get your prints claudia said sweetly we want to identify everyone whos been aboard and see if there are prints not accounted for you must be joking im not its painless claudia took faiths prints herself there in her office quickly and efficiently faith spoke not a word during the procedure and wiped her hands clean with a cloth claudia handed her senator hubble and i will cooperate in every way faith said i just hope youll cooperate as well and remember that the senators done a great deal for this region she dropped the cloth back on claudias desk your familys been in port leo for many years havent they her voice asking was shiny as a knife yeah your dads a shrimper asking when it sounded like she already knew yeah thats a very honorable profession she gave claudia a half smile shaped like the cruel crescent claudia remembered from high school the popular girl grinning closing in for the kill on some mouse of a geek he ever have trouble holding on to his shrimping license no never not a bit of trouble thats good you know licenses are much harder to come by these days the senators trying to make sure we get the right balance between preventing overharvesting of the bays and protecting our economic interests faith wadded up the inksmeared cloth i suppose some shrimpers will lose their livelihoods because their licenses will get bought out by the state or wont be available at all claudia said nothing i certainly appreciate the information you gave me faiths smile was as warm as summer honey may i call you claudia from now on claudia nodded faith hubble shook hands and lumbered to her feet tucking her toolittle purse under her arm claudia walked her to the front door faith saying hello to every person they passed and then headed back to her office alone her stomach twisting she went to the quiet of the ladies room and washed her face in icy water she stared at her dripping face in the mirror jesus christ claudia that mouthy bitch just threatened your father didnt she maybe the woman was just making conversation or not maybe faith hubble was rattled after having to give her prints feeling a little cornered she thought of her father cipriano waving at her as his little shrimp boat chugged into st leo bay for a days work empty nets hanging behind him like ancient tattered flags rope and nylon to cull a precarious living him telling her to be a good girl one simple step would set her course aright take delfords blunt but good advice and treat hubble as a suicide pete hubble was a moody loser outcast from a respected family hed earned a debased living and it wouldnt surprise her in the least if the toxicology tests revealed drugs in his system he probably had killed himself and spared both his family and velvet the shock of finding him by inviting heather farrell to the boat youre some cop quiver like a little kid and let those two tell you how to do your job she fumed she should have confronted faith hubble right then and there she called whit mosley at the courthouse hey honorable its claudia whats the matter you sound deflated no just tired suddenly she didnt feel like embarrassing herself with private revelations to whit i wanted to update you on where we are she told him about her questioning of velvet the missing laptop and her discussion with faith sticking to the facts what do you think of suicide as an explanation your boss came down hard on me last night to push for suicide whit said i didnt appreciate it he claudia stopped herself delford spires had been her ardent supporter her mentor on the force i know hes never been your favorite but he is a smart man im sure he meant well whit updated her about his discussion with ernesto gomez and the information he had gleaned id like to know who this dirtbag is that pete argued with on the boat we should ask velvet im going to have a background check made on pete hubble see if he has a record in california im going to check velvet too claudia said id like to visit jabez jones his name keeps cropping up take me with you but im booked up until this evening with the joys of court whit said claudia said ill call and see when we can meet with him fine ill call you as soon as i know details that are forensic and meaningful he said fine bye she said still feeling peevish she had a lot of phone calls to make computer searches to do she picked up the sheaf of pink messages left for her by the dispatcher two from patsy duchamp at the port leo mariner no doubt looking for a quote one from her mother no doubt to berate her for divorcing deputy wonderful and one surprisingly from the reverend jabez jones she reached for her phone heather farrell spent a damp night in a grove of bent live oaks near little mischief beach surrounded by bluestems that stood tall and thin and kept her hidden lying on her back the limbs of the oaks were fingers of a gnarled claw pointing away from the bay shaped by the ceaseless wind at night the trees looked frightening transplanted from the forest where hansel and gretel roamed when she awoke she peeled a scrawny orange and ate watching the few pleasure boats plying the waters on a brisk autumn morning she got out her notebook and began to sketch the boats the prows cutting the water the foaming curl of wake left in their path the hard angles of stern and bow and flying bridge she hummed as she drew she hoped sam would come his father was dead and heather knew propriety demanded sam be at home he was no doubt upset but she hoped he might prefer the solace of the beach rather than his frostbitten mother and egocentric grandmother he might prefer her heather wished for a shower she had settled for a quick sponge bath at the police station she rubbed toothpaste on her teeth and gums with her finger and rinsed and spat with a gulp of water from her oversize water bottle she kept in her knapsack she emerged from the oak motte and headed down to the shores of little mischief beach and found sam there watching the waves inch against the sand heather came up behind him wanting to touch the cool skin at the nape of his neck and feel his hair the same color as his fathers instead she gently touched his back sam hubble turned the wind had reddened his smooth cheeks red lines webbed his eyes a dribble of snot clung to one nostril hi you he said hi yourself she kissed him shyly on the cheek she dug a tissue from her jeans pocket and dabbed his nose its okay its all okay we shouldnt be seen together he said softly and one of my grandmothers jerks will probably be out looking for me im supposed to be at home inconsolable with grief heather loved that sam used big words like inconsolable he sounded so smart smart guys were sexier to her but she didnt know many shed get him a little tattoo maybe of heather in bloom when they got to new orleans and then hed just be to die for so we sit tight she asked sam shrugged and sniffed probably for the next week or so and then we can go we can get out of here yeah he said but youll be a runaway no way is your grandmother going to let you go i got that covered there wont be a stink she and mom wont come looking for me thats a guarantee they can tell people ive gone off to boarding school in houston he wiped his nose with the back of his hand if they dont let us go then i start talking heather heard the resolve in his voice but it didnt ease the churn in her guts she leaned away from him and with her fingernail drew a heart in the soft sand their plan seemed utterly impossible but she wanted in her heart to believe it would work that they could be together free of pete and lucinda and faith me the smileygirl optimist theres a switch i want to believe this will work that well be safe from them heather said he didnt respond staring out at the bulletgray bay are you okay she asked sam shrugged he was a twoweek dad whats that two weeks out of my whole life heather shit i dont even want to figure out the percentage ive been to summer camps that lasted longer he fell silent heather ached to take his hand but instead she kept her palm pressed against the damp cool of the sand he cried heavy big tears for his father and she hugged him close he surrendered to hard racking sobs and heather thought he couldnt cry like this in front of his mother or grandmother not allowed im sorry he gasped he was fifteen three years younger than her and their being together was utterly insane but the world was insane so why couldnt they succeed he leaned toward her as she wiped his cheek clean of tears and he kissed her hard and they leaned back in the sand smearing the heart she had drawn whits day typified the joys of the justice court he first magistrated into the county jail a sobbing carpenter from darius a small fishing community on encina countys northern tip who had blackened his wifes eye and broken her nose during a morning argument over burnt toast dont put me in jail please the man pleaded he was not much older than whit but he mewled and cried like an ashamed child his wifes blood still splattered his tshirt im claustrophobic ill go apeshit judge please please listen mr reynolds whit wished he could refer to him in open court as you sniveling little dick i dont want to hear one bit of whining complaining or bitching from you are you listening to me sir big sniffle from the oversized baby yes judge sure am whit informed the accused of the charges against him his right to retain counsel his right to remain silent his right to request appointment of counsel if indigent all the miranda warnings the man had heard when he was arrested by the encina sheriffs deputies big baby blinked a lot as though his brain were clogged so whit carefully and calmly walked him again in plainest english possible through his rights it was his first arrest for family violence assault whit set bond at ten thousand dollars the maximum thats more money than mommas got big baby wailed forgetting momma would have to pony up a percentage not the whole amount such concern for a lady whit said is very touching but wrong lady he stared at big baby im also serving you with an emergency protective order mr reynolds at your wifes application that means after you make bail you cant go near her for sixty days but i love her big baby sniffed then you got sixty days to let your heart grow fonder you go near her youre gonna be right back in front of me and i will get medieval on your ass mr reynolds big baby was led out of the courtroom bawling afresh saying he sure hadnt meant to hurt his sweetie pie whit silently wished castration were back in judicial fashion but he put his smile on and turned to the next case that morning pete hubble tucked in the back of his mind whit signed arrest warrants for four hotcheck writers two of whom were sisters who had apparently gone on their overdrawn jaunt together which made him a little sad set a fortythousanddollar bond for a chronic burglar who had been captured driving away from his justburgled exgirlfriends house with cash electronic equipment and all his sugars lingerie and heard guilty pleas from and sentenced six mintybreathed minors in possession of tobacco to twelve hours of community service each and a tobacco awareness class whit thought the class sounded worse than the public service which usually consisted of tidying the beaches the puffers parents grimaced at him as though he were sentencing their little darlings to rock splitting and he thought theres a dozen votes lost he saw buddy beere his opponent sitting in the back row of the courtroom watching him with all the warmth of a spider approaching the squirming fly grabbing a quick lunch at his desk he ignored three phone messages from his father he returned four phone messages from the newspapers in corpus christi and houston telling them that pete hubble had apparently died from a gunshot to the head and he was awaiting autopsy results before releasing cause of death hed never rated a phone call from the houston paper before and the rising prominence of the case made him nervous after lunch whit interviewed from the bench a port leo woman who had told her sisters and neighbors over the past week that president kennedy was living in their attic hiding from the cuban missiles and dallying with an aged marilyn monroe the assassination in dallas and suicide in hollywood never happened and kennedy now with a shaved head and a beard had been fishing along the bays of the texas coast ever since with his blond companion the woman claimed she employed them as a gardener and maid on occasion for their protection and hers she had taken to carting around a loaded pistol that was a family heirloom whit nodded solemnly through her recitation of her reality shed shaved her eyebrows and she often ran a finger along the hairless ghostly arches as though twisting the reels that played for her minds eye the woman said mr president adores the water but he just couldnt show his face on the east coast again and the rest of the gulf coast is closer to cuba she lowered her voice west coast too many cameras and they shot bobby there thats why jack stayed here and thats why i keep the gun handy protection thats considerate of you whit said her two sisters stood to one side crying quietly the woman smiled serenely as whit signed the warrant to detain and transport her to a medical facility for a psychiatric review whit as gentle as a summer breeze explained to the woman that she would go to see some doctors at port leo memorial she smiled determined to indulge him in this silliness the constable led the woman and her sisters away traffic court didnt seem so bad then court concluded he walked down the private hall back to his small office shrugged out of his robe wearing a polo shirt jeans and birkenstock sandals underneath and hung it carefully on its hanger hed made three phone calls to the nueces county medical examiner this afternoon quick breaks between cases and they hadnt cut into pete yet to make matters worse a downtown drug deal had soured last night in corpus christi and three twentyyearolds had shotgunned each other into oblivion a woman had been found strangled over in ingleside and apparently pete hubble senators son warranted no special rank to break ahead in the line of corpses the deputy medical examiner liz contreras promised she would call him as soon as she had some details a musical doubleknuckled knock rapped at his door hey there whit buddy beere stuck his head in with miles of smiles for his esteemed opponent hello buddy how can i help you you could vacate this office for me in a couple of weeks was the answer whit imagined flitting across buddys mind but instead buddy offered whit a friendly hand i wanted to invite you to a debate between you and me whit shook the proffered hand and buddy sat down uninvited he reminded whit of a teddy bear gone to seed he was more stocky than pudgy in his early forties with brown hair straggling across his head in campaigning he smiled a lot as though grinning were as expected as breathing crowing an illdefined platform he termed real judicial fairness as though whit managed the justice court with all the probity of a salem witch trial what exactly would we debate buddy whit asked would you sign arrest warrants differently than me probably would with a little happy face drawn next to his signature buddy shook his head no i mean on the critical issues facing voters no offense whit but your daddy bless him sort of waltzed you onto the bench and the voters dont know much about you as if that was buddys responsibility to fix and as soon as he did whits unrobed ass would hit pavement other than your fondness for toocasual apparel dont know me ive lived here most of my life and my familys been here since texas was part of mexico whats to know well i was sitting in the back of the courtroom earlier observing you sentenced those teenage smokers to community service you could have given them a twohundreddollar fine those kids are all from families living out at port leo country club and community service will make a bigger impression than scribbling a check they ought to get their hands slapped and a little dirty well we could debate the rightness of that real easy buddy said with satisfaction whit watched buddy eyeing the black robe hanging in the corner buddy dont you already have a good job down at the nursing home sure do buddy was an administrator at port leos one nursing home down in a crook of st leo bay well then why do you want my job it cant possibly pay you as well as the nursing home does buddys florid mouth worked i want to make a difference in peoples lives buddy i frankly dont know what we would debate about i sentence to community service youd do a fine big effing deal buddys smile tightened at the brush with profanity how about debating moral fiber moral fiber im opposed to it unless it fights colon cancer ive heard youve been keeping company with a woman of lessthansterling repute are we talking about pete hubbles friend god not faith he thought yes well i heard whit said that you were keeping company with pete and his friend velvet as well a junior high refrain i heard she heard you said they said buddys smile died a natural death you better not be spying on me is it true why not just have me testify at the inquest buddy asked and whit smelled a stinky political ploy buddy im not subpoenaing you when were running against each other buddy tugged at his lower lip like a reluctant tattletale well i was out campaigning and pete stopped me he wanted to know how he could get close to his family again he had been a disappointment to them and he wanted to make amends and what did you tell him to leave town no one wanted him here at all state senator lucinda hubble kept a collection of heads on the top shelf in her study johnson nixon carter reagan bush and clinton represented the presidents for the governors of texas she had george w bush ann richards mark white bill clements and dolph briscoe all grinned like decapitated clowns rubbery skin sagging without bones their falselipped mouths gaped caught between mirthful smile and slackened grimace lucinda also had one of herself complete with trademark puffy red hair and big azureframed eyeglasses whit had arrived ten minutes ago a little past four the housekeeper a dour vietnamese sparrow of a woman told him faith was out lucinda was on the phone and would he mind waiting in the senators study anything to eat or drink she offered the kitchen and dining room tables creaked under the weight of the collected casseroles and salads and pies brought by neighbors and churchwomen and by the democratic power elite but only a few mourners stood gathered nodding with awkward sympathy he wondered if the truth about pete was leaking like a slow hiss from a balloon faith had stood him up perhaps off conducting damage control what would people say to lucinda sorry your sons dead or sorry he turned out so badly the democrats in the living room looked fretful he followed the housekeeper and sat studying the study underneath the political gallery of plastic masks stood an old pinball machine themed big spender with a fat cat tossing bills to an admiring crowd of s zoot suiters and flappers prominently behind her desk were her framed nursing certificates yellowing with age on the wall hung an array of photos lucinda hubble with president bush with president clinton with willie nelson and ann richards with a steady parade of texas celebrities in each picture lucinda gave a thumbsup as though marking another successful conquest lucindas office was almost too relaxed for a politician warm friendly where the senator could meet with the common folk show she was just a good old gal there were no pictures of her sons a couple of faith and sam both formal portraits the kind given as christmas gifts in gold frames faith smiled but only like shed just passed a cpa exam sam looked like hed wandered out of a national honor society meeting serious and bespectacled and boring the perfect political grandson certainly the two sons had been failures in that regard a small stereo sat in the corner playing soft solo piano music whit wandered over to the stereo picked up the cds jewel box bachs goldberg variations played by glenn gould i find bach a great comfort lucinda hubble said from the doorway she looked sunken and diminished she wore a faded olivegreen cardigan and a pair of old khakis as though she might be loafing in a library or tending winter pansies in her flowerbeds hello senator whit said im so very sorry about pete thank you honey she cleared her throat and dabbed her eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief these wells have just about run dry im sorry to keep you waiting but that was the governor and his wife on the phone she said this with only the slightest hint of superiority she came and stood by whit her fingers playing air piano do you hear gould he hums and breathes along as he plays all that careful structure gould builds note by note each one a key brick in a musical house each note each rest played to his own exactitude but still he cant contain the passion he feels for the music she switched the music off its beautiful whit said pete hated classical music she said he hated anything touched by beauty lucinda hubble gestured at the chair on the other side of the desk and he sat she eased herself down into a heavy leather armchair your daddys already called and he and irina have brought us a lovely casserole its something russian and quite unpronounceable but im sure its delicious so thoughtful you thank them again for me honey yes maam i will and i wont keep you long now i just need to ask you some questions so i can make a determination on cause of death of course she placed her hands palm down on the expansive smooth teak of the desk he wondered if she knew about him and faith she had given no sign no sly smile no slight frown of disapproval he led with a suggestion for suicide how would you describe petes state of mind in the past few weeks depressed lucinda said he felt he had wasted his life because of the particular career he had chosen you knew about the porn lucinda flinched at the word but nodded i found out a couple of years ago i called pete at his home he was apparently in the middle of shooting a film she crumpled the handkerchief i could hear the women in the background laughing at me hollering about which one would get to appear in a scene with my son first she touched at her blue eyeglasses not what a mother ever wants to hear i hung up i told faith she already knew shed been shielding my sodelicate feelings i was devastated of course i didnt speak to him again until he came back to town i think the press will find out whit said quietly not from me they wont and if they find out from you or from detective salazar or any member of either of your offices i will hath more fury than hell lucinda flared i cant have sam knowing about this i just cant not to mention the voters do you think velvet is going to stay quiet i cant control her did pete say why he was coming home whit asked he said he no longer wished to pursue his acting career whit believed the words adult films or dirty movies or skin flicks were never going to pass her lips how did he plan on supporting himself he didnt say i assumed he had savings or could find legitimate work he does know knew film production perhaps at a television studio in corpus christi or with jabez joness outfit how much contact did you have with pete after he returned to port leo an hour here and there lucinda said the chill had gone deep for years she sank slightly into the bulk of the cardigan and selfishly i did not want to be disappointed by him again pete thrives on disappointing others i was happy to see him but i wanted him to rehaul his life i wasnt willing to get too close until i thought he was sincere lucinda perceived the reaction in whits face perhaps i sound harsh but mothers are mortal too no i know it must have been tough for you he told you nothing of this corey film he planned i didnt know one word until faith told me this morning but i doubt pete would have completed any real film bless his heart he didnt have the talent the drive im wondering why pete chose corey as a subject after all these years penance i suppose he blamed himself for what happened to corey why arent you the youngest of a whole passel of boys didnt your brothers take care of you she offered a wan smile yeah when they werent bossing me around or beating me up her smile faded corey disappeared on a weekend when i was out of town on business he vanished while he was on petes watch so to speak pete never forgave himself she shrugged i think hes been killing himself slowly for a long time when certain people do wrong they turn away from the world isolate themselves slip on the hair shirt and selfdestruct its why he went into porn and i think it eroded every bit of selfrespect he had she looked at whit hard ive always believed you have to put your troubles behind you and soldier on maybe he came across new information about coreys disappearance like that corey was still alive it was a balloon to float the silence hung for nearly ten seconds i am certain corey is dead why whit asked because corey would have contacted us if he was alive he wouldnt have let me suffer for all these years why did corey run away from home dont resurrect the other worst day of my life for the first time she showed raw emotion anger flaring her nostrils her cheeks reddening whit waited lucinda dragged her fingernails through her mop of red hair and gave a pained sigh i will never be able to author a book on good mothering judge taxpayers are easier to corral than willful children corey got involved with drinkers dopeheads all to punish me for the time i was spending in austin and the higher standards of behavior i expected from my boys after their daddy died i let them run wild do what they wanted but once i was elected they had to toe the line it was not too much to ask of them pete tried at least but corey slipped the leash like a wild dog i know i remember him you know yes he would have been about your age now wouldnt he she pondered whits face wistfully you dont think hes living happily on a commune in montana or a farm in virginia does that really happen with most missing teenagers judge lucinda asked with a touch of frost id be overwhelmed to know corey was in some idyllic retreat let me assure you the uncertainty of not knowing what happened to corey is an ongoing thorn in my heart when was the last time you spoke to pete senator whit asked a couple of days ago i wanted him to come to dinner alone but he wouldnt come without velvet he declined the invitation told me hed talk to me soon im curious how had you and faith explained petes absence to sam lucinda smiled thinly we told him pete worked in industrial films you know training tapes corporate tapes for business conventions sam accepted it pete never told him any different it was part of the agreement for him to see sam did pete ever talk about a change in the custodial arrangement whit watched lucindas face turn pale i dont understand pete was contemplating suing for custody of sam the silence filled the study until lucinda leaned forward and her chair squeaked judge have you lost your mind be realistic how on earth would pete stand a chance in a custody hearing i dont know whit said you tell me he couldnt have been serious no family court would give sam to pete did he ever ask about joint custody now that he was back that would be an issue between him and faith she said sternly and whit thought yeah right like you wouldnt be all in the middle of that last point whit said the boat pete was staying on its owned by a family suspected of being involved in a drug ring yall know anything about them he could almost hear a political future boiling away in the room most certainly not lucinda managed to say petes friends were his friends and his associates have nothing to do with us i would expect you would not leak that news to the press as well a vein throbbed in the hollow of her throat so you didnt try to find out who was giving him room and board when he came back i dont like what youre implying judge for the first time he saw anger storm in her eyes her jaw set her mouth narrow sorry but i find it hard to believe you just let him waltz back in the middle of an election and didnt research his friends his benefactors his purpose in being here i cant control what you believe but i would be very careful as to what you imply to the world he saw her scrutinize him with new eyes he was not being he supposed the easygoing whit mosley who liked to wander the beach and never put two shakes into a job id like to speak to sam her shoulders stiffened of course assuming that his mother or i am present he is a minor after all of course thank you youve been very helpful but she raised a finger i ask that you not discuss this custody idiocy with sam i cant promise that im sorry i need to talk to him about any subject relevant to his fathers death i wont have you subjecting him to velvets foolish notions im assuming shes the one claiming pete wanted custody yes a pathetic attempt to hurt us and i wont permit it whit kept his voice mild out of respect for her loss this is how it works i interview him and you or faith can be there and if theres nothing he can add fine or i can call him as a witness at the inquest put him on the stand her fingertips worked along her palms awkwardly kneading the flesh why dont you let me discuss it with his mother that would be fine whit stood and offered his hand she shook it but the cozy neighborliness had evaporated he saw himself to the door but before he left the bach cd suddenly roared in the study the icy cleanness of the notes as loud as hammers in the late afternoon the teenagers aimless tans not faded from summer gold were out in meager force two girls sat crosslegged on an arc of crushed shells at one end of the beach a boy waded in the gentle surf black jeans neatly rolled up past thick calves dragging a bamboo stick in the water watching it cut a wake through the waves claudia parked in the small sandsmeared asphalt lot that fed off the old bay highway from the lot she could see the whole nearly straight line of the beach that terminated on the south with several acres of windbent oaks and the private fishing pier on the north for port leos nursing home the pier she remembered didnt get much use but two healthylooking old ladies their faces shadowed by big neoncolored sun hats one magenta one turquoise stood on the pier trolling simple rigs with slack lines the elderly women reminded her of david begging her to attend his poppys party david was looping a hook back into her flesh securing it into her jaw making sure she could not dash from whatever shadow he might cast across the water of her life she saw heather farrell easing herself down the mangy slope of grass to the flat of the hardpacked beach a notebook under her arm a sandwich in her hand the girl chewing and tossing a scrap of crust to a hovering gull other gulls swooped near pleading with cries waiting for the generosity to be extended heather popped another two morsels upwards and then ran leaving the gulls to sort out the buffet she sat kicked off her shoes and ate keeping her feet just beyond the encroaching tide claudia sat down next to her you wolfed that down claudia said you hungry ill buy you dinner heather dusted the crumbs from her fingers with a quick slap she tucked a fleck of mayonnaise from the corner of her mouth onto her thumb then wiped her thumb on her jeans do you always criticize other peoples table manners were not at a table slap me you really are a detective heather watched the gulf inch toward her feet then retreat she kept the notebook close to her on the other side from claudia brought this for you to sign claudia produced a statement read it first and make sure its correct heather scanned the document and signed her name at the bottom there perfect satisfied you sleep okay last night sure amazingly unrattled by finding a dead body heather dragged a hand through her hair what am i gonna do run home to lubbock i can help you find a real place to stay arent you out of your jurisdiction officer heather asked no insolence laced her voice little mischiefs not in port leo proper the sheriffs department might consider you a vagrant heather camping out here she could call david ask him to check on this beach later this evening heather shrugged i moved where to a friends house she wiggled toes at the froth of the surf as it kissed her heels since youre gonna ask me for all the details her names judy cameron she lives on the west side of port leo im crashing there so you dont need to follow me around im perfectly safe judy have a phone number she didnt pay the bill and got disconnected but her address is still in the phone book paris street beige brick house with a motorcycle out front why dont i give you a ride back there now why dont you quit hassling me heather asked look im all warm and gooey inside from your concern but im fine im a grown woman if theres anything you havent told us about petes death youre going to be hipdeep in trouble i wont be able to protect you then shouldnt you have another cop here to play bad if youre good heather laughed you ought to watch more tv and get your shtick down whyd you buy greyhound tickets this week two of them claudia asked heather turned her gaze back out across the bay to the hump of santa margarita island youre a busy bee it was easy to check judy and i thought wed go to see friends in houston that okay with the local nazi regime i dont want you leaving town before this inquest you cant expect me to wait around forever claudia fished a card out of her pocket in case judy kicks you out she jotted numbers on the card and handed it to heather thats got my home and my office number and my exhusbands number hes a deputy with the sheriffs department he cute heather asked very claudia said call im around twentyfour seven ill program you on my speed dial thanks claudia dusted the sand from her rump and walked away when she reached her car she watched heather sitting notebook open sketching with a pencil the sunset painting the low clouds orange and purple the light beginning to fade two pelicans glided across st leo bay with graceful swoops the tips of their wings barely brushing the water claudia watched them fly and then she drove back to town the two old women lumbered inside the nursing home their cackles of laughter drifting down the beach to heather a caspian tern squeaking its nasally call dove down into the darkening water its bill bloodred but not from prey the tern shot back into the sky wet dinnerless heather watched it you dont always get what you want babycakes the tern tried again farther out into the bay heather watched the surfwalking boy and the two chatting girls leave the beach when she looked back out the tern was gone shame she opened to a blank page and began to sketch out the muscled wings the probing beak the eggshaped head she stopped as the sun set behind her she wished sam were here to drink red wine cuddle up close to her run his tongue along the backside of her ear but he wasnt coming no escape from the hubble guardians no escape at all a hand grabbed her shoulder whit mosley and faith hubble had first made love an altogether too kind term considering the bourbon and muscle cramps involved in july they met at a winddown party after three days of shellfest port leos annual salute to all things crustacean and culinary over ten thousand fairgoers both locals and tourists jammed the st leo bay area to guzzle beer buy crafts stomp to forgettable jazz and blues and countrywestern acts and to deplete the shrimp and oyster populations through structured gluttony lucinda judged a shrimp recipe cookoff gladhanded voters and raced back to her austin condo with sam in tow to hear a classical piano concert at ut faith didnt she lingered in town hanging out at the shell inn drinking bourbon in a back booth with a clutch of old high school girlfriends the womens group slowly merged with two more groups which is what happens in a small bar where nearly everyone knows everyone else and has been drinking for three days tables were pushed together drinks ordered again and faith sat next to judge whit mosley she vaguely remembered his brothers from her school days knew he was the youngest of the wild and handsome pack of mosley boys even though now a judge he dressed like a townie bum without two dimes in his frayed sunfaded orange polo shirt and weathered khaki shorts and birkenstock sandals but the legs leading to the sandals were nicely formed and she liked his odd gray eyes and the direct and knowing way he smiled not at all put off by her height or weight she grinned at the quiet way he indulged the drunken boasts of his friends when the topic turned to fishing not joining in but not deflating his buddies hackneyed tales and although his polo shirt was old and the neon orange a color out of style the chest and arms beneath the fabric were tanned and firm he didnt look like any judge she ever knew she had been lonely for a long time plowing all her time into lucindas career and no one had given her jokes a sincere laugh in a long while he offered her a ride home she was drunk she asked him to come inside and have a cup of coffee and a couple of aspirin to help sober themselves up although she had watched him nurse a single corona for two hours and knew the only drunk one was herself and while they stood chatting in the kitchen and the coffee brewed she surprised herself by reaching out for him and saying is that a gavel or you just happy to see me her jokes got worse with more bourbon it wasnt a gavel and he amply liked her too they spent the next several hours in bed half of the time sleeping the other half making strenuous love she was left gasping but energized freeing some longburied shadow of herself to face the world she watched whit nap and traced his lips with a fingernail while he softly snored since pete had left her the few men shed allowed intimacy with her tended to be older and snagged in the intricate web of state politics they talked of little else here was a man lying beside her who was younger with a flat stomach and long legs and probably not overly bright but he knew how to make her feel mygod shivery good she brushed his light fuzz of whiskers grown in the course of the day wondering how quickly he would bolt in the morning he didnt he made love to her again and she almost wept with pleasure and an odd relief she didnt want a romance but she did want him warm and kissing her throat and giving his halfway smile as he filled her they began to see each other discreetly she didnt want sam or lucinda to know he was the only private part of her life and whit didnt argue they saw each other perhaps twice a month faith and whit learned about the constellation of small motels along the coastal bend little way stations in rockport and aransas pass and laurel point and copano they would meet share a bottle of shiner bock while kissing and slowly unburdening each other of their clothes soap their skin in the shower make love on the bed and then talk about her work about his struggle to learn enough law to be an effective jp about books theyd both read he was smarter than she thought a love of reading was other than sex the only thing they had in common all perfectly friendly but now he had failed her and the memory of the taste of his skin soured in her mouth faith backed her bmw out of the hubble driveway and gunned the engine toward whits house faith rocketed over to the mosleys ready to carve whits guts into ribbons of flesh but instead the storm turned to shower she cried as soon as she saw him babe and irina were dining with friends in rockport and would not be back for quite a while faith and whit sat in the cramped living room in the guest house the corpus christi news turned on but muted petes death as the son of a prominent state senator not as a porn star which had not yet been mentioned by any news source had been the second story after the gunshot war that had slowed down the nueces county coroners office faiths hard heavy weeping slowly eased whit handed her a wad of tissues to replace the ones shed rendered sopping and he poured them each a hefty glass of an inexpensive merlot she gulped down a third of the glass in a long swallow you dont think you can cry for someone you ceased to love a long while back faith sniffed tamped her nostrils with the tissues i keep thinking of the boy i knew and married not the sleaze he turned out to be but he came home and all i saw was the sleaze nothing more she drank again this is good whit thanks you know how he proposed to me on port leo beach at midnight the beach was closed but we snuck in and sat on the sand and counted stars he told me i had missed one and then he dangled this beautiful diamond on a string before my eyes she studied the red depths of the wineglass i loved him then sure i did but he married me only because his mother wanted it i found out later shed bought the ring for him and told him just how to propose she knew what would light my fire she set the wineglass down folded her fingers together in her lap whit youve got to believe me we didnt have anything to do with petes death nothing and lucinda she shouldnt have come across so hardassed with you why didnt you tell me pete was back in town whit kept his voice gentle quiet and unaccusing because god we didnt want anyone to know he even existed anymore but he cooperated with us he kept a very low profile i mean i guess a couple of people commented to me he was back but no production was made of it her mouth twisted did you want to waste away our motel time chatting about my ex you didnt want people or me to know he was back because he had starred in blue movies yes she took another bolstering slug of wine and shuddered not because he could derail lucindas campaign and your career not because he was going to sue you for custody of sam look as far as im concerned whit this custody crap is a complete fiction velvet dreamed up in her screwedstupid little mind you asked me to help yall get through this to not make a big production of the inquest but im not doing you any such favors until i know whats going on here i clearly dont mean diddly squat to you do i this has nothing to do with us faith but i dont believe a man who wants to get his child back just kills himself i dont suppose its occurred to you the source of his depression was he knew hed never ever get sam yes it occurred to me it also occurred to me to wonder exactly why hed even think he had a chance in court did he have something on you faith theres nothing that could trump porn she barked at him for gods sakes there are worse crimes than dirty movies not to a family court she stood i came over here to talk not to be grilled by you you came over to presume on our relationship whit said youre asking me to not make a public spectacle of the inquest for sams sake but im asking you for an explanation of what was going on with pete this cuts both ways sweetie i told you what i know she sat again perhaps i should excuse myself from the case no dont panic flashed in her eyes you do that youll have to explain why and i dont want sam to know about us dont lock sam in a glass bubble forever look it hasnt been easy for him no father his grandmother and i so busy and now with pete dead i cant rub salt in his wounds please whit not now she covered her face with her hands the boat pete was staying on its owned by a family suspected of heavy drug activity up the coast lucinda mentioned that she leaned back against the thick pillows of the couch and dropped her hands good god he chose well didnt he one little explosive charge after another to sink his mothers ship hes the one whos dead not lucinda he sat next to her where were you last night am i not supposed to be insulted at the question thats up to you faith i was at home last night with sam i havent spent enough time with him lately we had dinner watched tv went to sleep early its all in my bland little police statement okay he said thanks she took his hand ive been nothing but honest with you im sure he killed himself okay all these other diversions this corey movie this custody idea him staying on a drug hounds boat im begging whit keep it all out of the inquest cant you it has no place if you dont youre letting a nobody like pete win over me over us i cant promise that faith i cant she rose her face contorting as though slapped the problem with you whit is that everyone has low expectations of you and you never fucking disappoint a rap sounded at the door faith fell silent whit stood wondering if she might go hide in the bathroom or closet but she stayed put and he went to his door it was claudia hi she said and she glanced past his shoulder to see faith hubble standing by the couch the empty wineglass on the coffee table the half full one next to it im sorry she said i didnt realize you had company come in whit said mrs hubble and i were just discussing her exhusband you want something to drink id love a coke claudia sat down while whit busied himself dumping ice cubes in a glass and cracking open a liter bottle of cola he brought claudia her soda the silence between the two women hung thick as fog on a cool winter morning claudia broke the quiet im glad youre here mrs hubble i just confirmed with anders sorenson that he was hired to represent pete in suing for custody of your son i thought you might be able to help us understand why as i was just telling the judge faith said slowly petes legal concerns were his own matter hed ignored sam for most of fifteen years and he was no parent he had zero grounds for a serious bid for custody so why hire sorenson whit asked anders sorenson was from an old port leo family one of the bestregarded attorneys in the area almost seventy a scrappy dapper little man feared in the courtroom because sorensons a bigmoney republican whod love to see lucinda lose faith flared shit i dont know what pete was doing i cant repeat that too many more times without thinking the two of you are braindamaged neither whit nor claudia spoke i have to go unless you have further questions faith said sam is expecting me for dinner i would like to speak with sam whit said briefly call me tomorrow and well set up a time she picked up her purse and didnt give claudia another glance as she walked out the door whit followed her out of the guest house past the pool she didnt break stride and she didnt look back and he didnt call out to her he went back to the guest house claudia stared at him i heard her yelling at you before i knocked on the door ive known her for a while shes upset and her kids the most important thing in the world to her whit said but shes right pete wouldnt have a prayer in family court unless shes done something far worse than adult films claudia said whit sipped his wine i thought you and i could talk to jabez jones together tomorrow morning she said your clerk said itd work with your schedule thats fine he said she touched his arm anything else you want to tell me honorable no he said nothing else at all velvet eased the magazine out of her sig sauer mm automatic pistol she tucked the sig far down into her purse then she yanked it out of concealment past tissues and car keys and compact four seconds too long but stacking the gun atop her billfold and cosmetics made her nervous she had no concealed weapons permit she supposed she could always just fire through the thin leather of the purse finding the gun had been easier than she imagined shed hired a cab to take her to corpus christi rented a chevy caprice at the airport and driven to a ragtag collection of pawnshops she found that cash and a quick but ardent display of her professional skills spoke volumes to one particular dealer shed never seen a registration form shed picked up a small tape recorder as well the kind used by reporters voiceactivated in case someone said something interesting she wanted to keep this she stuck down in the depths of her purse velvet practiced pulling the automatic from her purse for ten more minutes until the motion felt fluid and natural and the gun didnt feel so alien in her grip if junior deloache became a problem she thought shed have to fire without flinching she imagined shooting him in the stomach clearly the biggest target on him and tried not to think about how much blood might explode from his guts him or you just think of it as him or you if it comes to that junior was she thought most likely full of bluff and he might even be useful to her her fantasies shifted from gunning down a hotbreathed junior deloache to placing the cool barrel of the sig against faith hubbles head and forcing that snide bitch to sing the truth yes i killed him i killed him please dont hurt me a gentle knock rapped on the door she went and peered through the peephole faith hubble stared back at her through the security hole arms crossed frowning like she wanted to bite the world in half velvet you there faith called she knocked again velvet hurried back to her purse she clicked on the recorder and found the ammunition in the bottom of the bag youre stupider than i thought gooch said whit nursed his beer he and gooch sat in a deserted corner at georgies bar at the shell inn being a tuesday night the bar was mostly empty only a few figures quaffing down liquid forgetfulness in the shallow light the tarpons on the wall mounted over draped netting caught the glow of the television along their preserved curves georgie sat at the bar smoking a cigarette and working the new york times crossword puzzle with a bloodred pen he had just confessed to gooch about his affair with faith and was now receiving a quota of due lashings what do you think buddy beere might make of this whitman gooch rattled the ice in his nearempty glass of bourbon hell fry you into political hash buddy doesnt have to know and petes her longtime ex i dont think theres a professional conflict in me handling the case buddy will and no secret in this county gets kept forever gooch said theres too many big mouths and prying eyes and booze he finished his drink with a toss and signaled to the vapid barkeep for a refill she didnt see him giggling with eddie gardner at the bar whit watched gardner who had pointedly ignored him if claudia was slaving over the hubble case tonight gardner wasnt ive discovered the silver lining you blow the election you can work for me gooch mused im thinking of buying a much bigger boat you know a serious party barge if i do it you can wriggle out from under babes wing and grab a real life yeah scrubbing decks gutting fish keeping drunks from going overboard and best of all taking orders from you my lifes dream you aint got room for snooty gooch finally got the bartenders attention when she turned from laughing at a joke of gardners she nodded and brought gooch his drink whit watched the young woman hurry back to gardner intent on not leaving him shifted in neutral too long why do cute girls like a greaseball like gardner whit wondered gooch shrugged you ask this while diddling faith hubble whit considered shes fun and willing is that all you require no what else breathing gooch put a hand over his heart in mock horror god help us youre not in love with her are you of course not whit said so shes just someone you sleep with shes whit stopped lover implied more emotional depth than either he or faith had yet brought to the bed onenight stand was logistically incorrect sexual release carried all the warmth of freezer burn he just liked her he still liked her were in a shadowy area his map of faiths heart consisted of the roughest sketch he knew sam was her north star her everything with perhaps lucinda and her political career a near second but when they were together from the first time she had shown an openness toward him that he suspected few others saw he didnt believe her capable of sticking a gun in a mans mouth and pulling the trigger he was pretty sure fairly sure he finished his beer crap not sure at all even though hed tasted her skin felt the broad warmth of her back pressed up against his chest explored the shape of her mouth smelled chamomile in her hair knew which ribs produced ticklish laughter he didnt know the shape and size of her heart and claudia shed greeted faith with all the friendliness of a mongoose eyeing a swaying cobra claudia sure hadnt believed it was a simple interview miss bythebook would blow a mighty shrill whistle on him in two seconds flat if she smelled a conflict of interest and he couldnt blame her just then whit noticed a chunky blond man lumber up from a darkened corner of the bar wearing a gaudyawful tropical shirt and head out the door he bumped into an older man entering the bar and said watch it old fart the old man already drunk ignored him whit said come on to gooch tossed dollars on the bar to settle the tab and followed as they went out the man clambered into a red porsche grit and birdguano splatters dusted the car the porsche jerked out of its slot and revved onto main street whit ran to his explorer gooch following explaining soon gooch said heavy blond loud he looks like the dirtbag ernesto described and hes driving a messy porsche just like ernesto said whit tailed the filthy porsche down main street past the shopping district where seasonally challenged store owners had already hung christmas decorations and dangled sprays of light in the palm and red bay trees on his left was the bay with rental condo developments lining the shore most had been built in the s during a lastgasp oil boom and retained the unfortunate granolaesque architecture of the time boxy with diagonally layered strips of wood for siding and balconies ringed with thick oak beams they drove past the port leo city limits for a half mile and the porsche wheeled into a condo resort called sea haven its name was written in cursive rope for that authentic nautical air missing windows and sawhorses suggested renovations were under way the porsche parked next to a flooring companys van and the driver unfolded himself from the car big with terminally moussed hair and pimpbright clothes a crimson tropical shirt adorned with purple parrots bright yellow golfing pants snowwhite hightop sneakers he straightened his britches with a decisive yank as he ambled toward the building whit drove past uturned and circled back the man still stood in the yard talking to an elderly man in a motorized wheelchair stop and talk to them or go on gooch asked carpe diem and all that crap whit said lets stop the old man watched them park and raised a hand to silence the young man whit was suddenly conscious of the keep judge mosley megasize magnetic sign on the side of his explorer he and gooch walked toward them the steely scowl on the old mans face deepened hello whit said im whit mosley and im the justice of the peace here in encina county i see the old man nodded toward the garishly patriotic votemobile bright under the streetlights im anson todd whit recognized the name from the marina manager todd was the man whod made the docking arrangements for real shame this is leonard guchinski whit said charmed gooch said whit kept his eyes on the hefty guy i understand youre acquainted with pete hubble why do you ask or care the younger man challenged junior the older man said with a bored note of caution ah young mr deloache ill take that as a yes im conducting the inquest into petes death and id like to talk to you about him we have nothing to say junior said in a petulant voice nothing come in for a minute the old man invited as though hed not heard juniors pronouncement his voice scratchy reminded whit of a dusty worn record junior do me a favor were out of cereal and im not facing the morning without my raisin bran run down to the store he pivoted the wheelchair sharply and zoomed for the condos lobby anson we got cereal junior called to the old mans back not the kind i like anson said not giving junior another glance go junior abandoned stood slackjawed and then loped to his porsche and roared off whit and gooch followed anson into the condos lobby wood shavings tattered wallpaper and a halfdismantled reception desk cluttered with a forest of empty soda cans decorated the halfdone vestibule a couple of construction workers begrimed with sawdust but getting excellent overtime inspected unfurled blueprints with lukewarm interest late night to be working construction gooch said late night to be bothering people anson said they followed anson into a cramped rackety elevator anson punched eight the top button so you own this building whit asked no anson declined further explanation anson todd looked to be edging seventy he wore a black turtleneck gray sweatpants covering withered legs and wirerimmed glasses over catgreen eyes an ugly welted scar scored his temple and his overlong gray hair was combed over to hide the mark let me guess you work for mr deloache senior whit said the elevator stopped and whit held the door for anson to wheel himself out anson motored out of the elevator into a garishly appointed suite it looked to whit like an animal lovers apartment from hell zebra prints on the wall a leopard sofa a tiger skin on the floor the monotony of hides was broken by the neonkissed furniture that had likely been purchased at the house of lime a thicknecked youth glanced up from the television his overinflated physique made him look like he had been gulping steroids with his mothers milk hey the young man greeted anson a wary glance going to gooch and whit go watch tv in the master bedroom anson ordered come if i call you sure the monosyllabic hulk agreed he lurched up from the couch and stomped into another room slamming the door behind him anson todd said i love chaperoning the mentally deficient have a seat judge mr guchinski he gestured toward an expansive leather sofa the color of a frozen margarita instead whit wandered to the wall of windows that showed a panoramic view of st leo bay and the gulf to the north the huge piers jutting out into the bay dazzled with light and house lights along santa margarita island glittered like a broken bracelet of diamonds i see why you stay here instead of aboard real shame whit said actually the shames not wheelchairfriendly i stay off except for an infrequent fishing trip coffee beer gooch leaned against the window thick arms linked behind his back whit eased onto the plush leather couch no thank you whit said we wont take up much of your time you wont need much judge we dont know a thing about petes death yes mr deloache senior owns real shame and has for five years but pete was an acquaintance of juniors mr deloache never met him the gun that was found in mr hubbles hand wasnt registered if there was an unregistered gun aboard then mr hubble or his lady friend brought it not ours she denies that anson smiled once shes over her grief maybe her memory improves whit wondered if memory enhancements came in the form of fists or threats ive spoken with witnesses who say junior visited pete pretty regularly at the marina argued with him about money behaved badly yesterday define badly tried to rough up pete junior hes a teddy bear he couldnt bruise fruit look from where i sit you got hearsay you got anyone whos positively idd junior as being there dont whit said his father owns the boat okay yeah but you got anyone who will id junior as being the argumentative type youre looking for yes really cause junior wasnt here yesterday neither was i we been in houston the past few days we just drove in this morning got a whole bunch of people who will confirm that why are yall down here because someone died on your property juniors in charge of getting this resort project completed for his dad you could call him a project manager you should he loves it whit raised an eyebrow let me guess junior manages the project and you manage junior anson grinned his teeth were yellowed from cigarette smoke how well did you know pete whit asked i met him just once let me tell you judge i find porn boring i find porn stars even more boring especially when theyre male pete had all the brains of dandruff what about this money pete and junior supposedly bickered over anson cleared his throat his voice took on a soft volume that had no softness in the tone look judge i agreed to tell you what we know not undergo interrogation we knew the guy we didnt have anything to do with his death and mr deloache is gonna want his boat back pronto mr deloache is going to have to wait for the investigation to be over whit answered pleasantly mr deloache both the senior and the junior need to answer questions let me ask you one how many times was pete shot once where the head anson crinkled his nose gee once in the head can i have suicide for four hundred dollars alex or maybe it was an execution whit said gangland style gangland christ i havent heard that term since cable showed the james cagney movie marathon anson leaned back in his chair look judge you want to explore slander keep talking we got a whole flock of lawyers up in houston that wouldnt consider your ass a light hors doeuvre yes but my ass is planted up on the court bench and from that vantage point i can call you and junior as witnesses at the inquest mr deloache too ive told you we know nothing and i got nothing to give you judge except the pleasure of my company and a good cup of coffee he smiled i bet you know the good fishing spots in st leo bay we ought to get our lines tight some time whit imagined more of ansons boating expeditions involved concrete mixes and pleas for mercy rather than suntan lotion and cheap bait thanks for your time ill see you in court he headed for the elevator gooch silently following and pressed the button the fishing bonhomie vanished its not a good idea to waste mr deloaches time its not a good idea to waste mine either whit said the doors slid open and whit and gooch stepped on the elevator anson todd stared at them until the doors slid shut youre such a bad ass gooch said i released a vast flood of urine into my pants out of sheer terror you do smell funny whit said watch me ill subpoena both of them so fast their beady little eyesll pop the elevator doors slid open with a creaky fanfare junior deloache stood there with a box of raisin bran crushed under his arm and a sixpack of beer he looked like a delivery boy gone to seed but a cold light of calculation touched his eyes hi junior whit said could we talk for a second just outside junior shook his head i gotta make sure anson gets his mr plumbr cereal id like to see what all youre doing with sea haven i only have a couple of questions for you junior shrugged and whit and gooch followed him through the dismantled lobby to a large patio aglow with fuzzy security lights bare of furniture with an emptied cracked pool a decaying cabanacumbar with a graying palmthatched roof stood nearby lopsided with neglect welcome to groovin central junior said once we get it cleaned up and lure all the young chickies here gooch said oh yes i just see chickies flocking here by the dozens you gonna have the money to finish whit asked junior gave him a scornful sideways glance why wouldnt i didnt you owe pete hubble serious money most certainly did not people at the marina heard the two of you bickering about money saw you shoving him around on your boat junior frowned but whit saw he had to think about it first your sources are faulty man i didnt owe him money gooch asked so what did pete owe you and you would be who junior asked you the bailiff for the judge or something gooch is just a friend along for the ride whit wished gooch would shut up there was no owing of any sort man theres a real difference between friends goofing around and arguing i just got a big voice when did you last see pete whit asked a few days ago last week he and i took the boat out do you want to talk about whatever this money issue was at an inquest hearing because ill call you to testify if i think its relevant or if youre not cooperating im sure the police would be interested not testifying whit suspected might be a family virtue long drummed into junior probably since he broke the legs of his first gi joe in the nursery i had no reason to want pete dead see pete promised me i could be in a movie the one he was making about his brother tragedy is not my style a you know different kind of movie junior swiveled his hips with a notsosubtle grind i see pete was going to let you be in a groovin movie whit said in an understanding tone yeah youre on board now fucking a anson and your dad mustve loved that idea the smile faded i got the impression whatever anson said you did whit gently poked the box of raisin bran yeah well thats me being nice to an old fart ansons oldern hell he already got one wheel in the grave so with pete gone i guess your movie career is on hold unless you can convince velvet to cast you in her next opus he grinned thats no problem why is that junior set the cereal and beer down gently stood and rubbed his palms against each other warming his fists for use you know youre grilling me like chicken dude and i dont got to give you the time of day oh yes please lets get physical gooch interrupted i havent had a workout today and you got punching bag written all over your gut junior started a retort then seemed to reconsider as he noted the size of goochs biceps i sure as hell aint gonna answer any more questions fine ill see you in my courtroom whit had found his weapon ansons and juniors loathing of court and wasnt about to surrender it a cold rage lit juniors eyes my daddys attorneys will eat you alive whats with these attorneys and the food metaphors eat us alive and grilling you like chicken and consider whit an appetizer no wonder youre chunky gooch said gooch dont whit said he shrugged at junior so start working your cell phone and get all of your daddys attorneys down here the bill the lawyers charge to your dad for all that travel time should be substantial junior considered this calling his father to gather a bevy of lawyers in port leo and suddenly cooperated look judge you want to chase down the right fox you need to look at the xbitch who petes ex he called her the xbitch you know like the xfiles freaking alien weirdo she was about to drive him crazy how so man how didnt faith over at his boat all the time trying to sweeten him up i caught pete and faith once i swear inches from fucking velvet wouldve had a coronary velvet says pete was just a friend yeah right theyre just friends after hes had his dick inside her a couple of hundred times you know women dont think that way not even porn stars junior laughed relaxing now that the topic was back on treasured ground but the xbitch hell i think she kinda had a split personality going as far as pete was concerned she wanted him but she wanted him gone she works for that old shit of a mother of his and you know they were soiling their panties when he moved back jesus he told me his mother offered him money to go away he didnt want to do it and im all like dude are you nuts take the money ditch port lame here and go back to la where life is real junior shook his head shit he shouldve taken that money he really shouldve anson wheeled into view in the open doorway junior he bawled get in here junior picked up his groceries i had every reason to want pete alive and his family sure as hell didnt later he turned and went back to anson walking past him without a word whit followed him back through the lobby anson wasnt in a mood to parry further good night judge he said with solemnity and motored himself back into the elevator after junior whit and gooch walked out of the lobby junior hardly appeared credible on paper but his words gave whit pause if velvet was right and pete was going to sue for custody had faith tried to disarm him with sex and if lucinda had truly offered her son cash to fade away what had she done when he refused it suggested they knew damn well pete might be suing for custody and had more than a prayer of winning but junior would be hard to present as a credible witness i must get the name of the reform school he attended gooch said i want to sponsor a scholarship whit walked past juniors porsche and noticed the rear left corner looked like it had suffered a minor accident the left taillight was smashed whit remembered the oneeyed porsche hed passed last night heading away from the marina trash disco blaring into the night hours before anson claimed theyd arrived in port leo the blade was tired midnight had come to port leo his favorite time and he stood beneath a canopy of live oaks and listened to the wind the wind that had caressed in its time every inch of the world every woman whisper through the oak limbs it was a good day he supposed he knew where velvet was a toy just waiting to be opened his plan for heather farrell had been put in motion he could sleep and dream up a store of delights that in the days ahead he could make real not every man he knew was so blessed and rich he went into the garage to prepare his boat for its chores mom faith hubble was jolted out of sleep she had been dreaming dreaming that port leo was gone left far behind her on a boat arrowing deep into the bowl of the gulf and pete stood to one side of her whit on the other as the spray from the prow cooled her face against a blistering sun the two of them seized her shoulders upended her over the railing and she plummeted toward a canyon of water falling for miles she had glanced up and pete and whit were gone lucinda and sam standing in their places watching her die she pulled her head from the pillow sweat touched her shoulders her back between her legs mom sam said again purpling shadows marred the skin under his eyes he looked as though he hadnt slept in a week you okay she smiled she certainly was yes honey im fine she patted his hand its all gonna be okay i promise you that velvet munched on a cold poptart and counted the money again the bills new and stiff and feeling like revenge under her fingernails she made the edges of the bills flush with a smack against the bedside table as down payments went it wasnt half bad and since her production company wasnt being at all helpful on the legal front sorry velvet dont know a lawyer in texas and we just cant get involved the bastards the money was more necessary than ever money from faith to stab faith eventually she liked the idea she finished her poptart then studied the pastrys box to see if the phrase was trademarked not a bad name for a movie poptarts could play up pop music could play up oversweet breakfast treats damn trademarked oh well she folded the money twenty thousand into the bottom of her suitcase hiding it inside a light windbreaker she showered considering her next move shooting faith would have been a bad idea and she doubted that she could have pulled the trigger but she had loaded the gun and stuck it in the bottom of her purse as faith knocked on the door just in case just in case the crazy bitch tried to kill her but faith had not had murder on her mind listen velvet you know and i know that pete killed himself you saying anything else is just a ploy for publicity you mean a ploy for justice no publicity i did a little checking sweetie pete tried to kill himself four years ago swallowing pills i got the hospital records from van nuys im giving them to the police and to whit mosley it doesnt mean anything you know what else i found out sweetie your last five movies have bombed you tried to get all artsy instead of just delivering the smut and no one cares what youre doing now youre broke velvet get the hell out of here and faith instead of getting mad gave her that superior little smirk so mature dont you know i can help you get you back on your feet so you can the smirk again get back off them right away and you and i can both be happy velvet rinsed her hair clean of lather turned off the shower reached for a towel she felt better than she had yesterday when the knots and rocks in her gut shifted with every breath she stepped out of the shower wondering if pete was looking down or up at her and whether he hated her now dont hate me pete i promise you im not done with them yet and faith hubbles going to fry fry fry she would have to launder the money the hubbles would be steering toward her polish it with a veneer of respectability before she called the papers in dallas and houston and austin it shouldnt she figured take very long she got dressed and checked the gun again at the bottom of her purse it fit in perfectly next to the handheld tape recorder faiths voice on that tape cajoling begging offering bribes for silence over petes still secret career was better than any bullet a bullet meant only a moments suffering suffering she thought of sam faiths pleas that he be protected from all the pain about petes career and she remembered sam and pete sitting on the prow of real shame pete drinking a bottled beer sam sipping a coke awkwardly talking settling finally on a discussion of baseball pete liked the padres sam the rangers and she shamelessly eavesdropped hearing them warm to each other talking about trades and homers and a mutual loathing of the yankees sam had finally laughed at one point warm tears had welled in her eyes and she thought who the hell are you june cleaver maybe she should say nothing forever let sam think his father just made industrial films pete wouldnt want sam to be ashamed to bear the brunt of his sins or she could take the money throw it at sam say heres what your mama wanted to pay me for silence hon know who youre living with she dug the creased business card out of her purse smoothed it out then dialed whits number at ten after nine wednesday morning claudia drove past an elaborately painted sign that read jabez jones ministries above the logo was a gold cross etched over a pair of gargantuan biceps did you know that jesus did not work out on a regular basis whit slurped a cup of hot coffee hed snagged at irinas cafe judas was flabby too claudia said the road leading to the compound was surrounded by a dense growth of bent oaks and lined by hardy palm trees they drove past another sign that read salvation ahead feel the burn burn so what happens if you go to hell dont you still feel the burn claudia asked she didnt feel the burn but she felt the tension in the car she and whit hadnt talked since shed seen faith at whits place whit had seemed tired when she picked him up at the courthouse he updated her about his talk with junior deloache and anson todd another angle for her to present to delford although she fretted her boss would welcome news of petes friendship with hoods no more than theories of murder do you think hes this corny on purpose absolutely its sort of like asking if pro wrestlers consider themselves athletes whit said do you remember jabez jones from school vaguely geeky glasses the kind of preachers kid you felt bad for because you just knew he never got to have one lick of fun claudia said i remember seeing him wrestling on tv joltin jabez jones i nearly didnt recognize him especially in gold tights god knows my father considers pro wrestling a religion god doesnt have much to do with his appeal whit said hes just like those tv specials on pets that attack or cops greatest chases or us all watching a president get caught with his pants down everything is entertainment now hes just making local evangelism another genre they turned into an asphalt parking lot jabezs compound was the original odd folly of a fort worth oil baron who had built a television studio outside port leo part of an illconceived plan for a fishing network the few shows he produced bombed and the compound stayed shuttered for a few years until jabez jones defected from the pro wrestling ring to start his church and show holy crosstraining it had found a shaky home on stations serving rural markets with lowpowered religious programming the squat cabins were painted a glossy white a game of womens volleyball played in modest shorts and tshirts adorned with gold crosses was under way in a sand pit a couple of men stood by watching attempting unsuccessfully to look pious while ogling the bouncing breasts hes hugh hefner with a bible whit said whit and claudia were barely out of the car when the welcoming committee arrived she was six feet tall well muscled and wore her platinumblond hair closely cropped she wore a tight white tshirt with a gold cross emblazoned on the chest and cargo pants bulky enough to conceal an armory whit remembered what ernesto had told him about one of petes visitors like a man with titties it was a crude unkind but effective description hi im judge whit mosley and this is detective claudia salazar from the port leo police we have an appointment with jabez whit said regarding he wanted to share some information with us regarding a case claudia said follow me but if hes not done with his taping youll just have to wait claudia and whit followed the amazon along a crushedoystershell path that led down from the main complex toward a finger of the bay im sorry i didnt catch your name whit said mary magdalene whit shot claudia a look if mary magdalene was this tough whit thought god only knew how butch esther and ruth were eve could probably kick major ass too this is an impressive setup claudia gave whit a frown that said dont you dare laugh mary magdalene nodded oh yes the lord has smiled on jabez hes smiling on that volleyball court whit said jabez says exercise is a way of paying homage to what the lord has created in making man and woman building muscles is worship she flexed her own thickened arms ive always believed our bodies are temples whit offered mary magdalene gave him a quick scrutiny then apparently dismissed his temple as one devoted to a lesser god the volleyball bounced into the grass near them one of the comely disciples chased it she scooped the ball up and whit thought do i know her but the young woman turned and sashayed back to the game jabez doesnt have much trouble getting a date does he whit observed in what he considered to be a completely friendly tone claudia withered him with a glare jabez doesnt date mary magdalene spat out the last word he doesnt care a whit for the temptations of this physical world her voice hardened the temptations of the flesh are the seed of all evil whit surveyed the immaculately kept buildings the sandrumped girls playing volleyball the new cadillac parked right by the administration building door with jabez on the plate hes a real francis of assisi whit said to claudia his voice lowered sissy mary magdalene had misheard no sassy whit answered he sasses that old devil dont he mary magdalene raised one platinum eyebrow jabez could kick the devils ass and dont you forget it whit and claudia reflected on this platitude in silence claudia pinched whit on the meaty part of his arm to ensure he wouldnt comment mary magdalene escorted them to a small stretch of beach full of cameras portable sound booms and spandexclad missionaries sparkling white sand cleanerlooking than the grayish beige grit on most texas beaches had been spread over the native soil whit and claudia stood back to watch the spectacle jabez jones well over six feet tall two hundred thirty pounds of muscle with less body fat than a moth lay on his side scissoring his treetrunk legs into the air counting off reps while providing a little insight into the book of luke behind him two women one svelte one heavy for the dieting viewers to bond with and a less beefy man mirrored his exercises all beaming like angels now hold the lift until the scripture is done jabez boomed i tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite there amen bless us all did you feel the holy spirit invigorating your limbs i know i did im just coursing with the holy spirit right now you keep doing those leg lifts and the devil himself wont be able to catch you now lets start our cooldown and our scripture for that is one of the more relaxing psalms a personal favorite of mine number sixtyone whit resisted the urge to lead a cheer cooldown completed jabez jumped to his feet did a hand clap reminded viewers about his i number and web site to place requests with jabezs prayer workout chain or to order his fitnesstheology tapes remember your donations make all the difference in fighting flab and sin praise god call now god who in whits mind represented the infinite beauty of the universe as a weightloss shuckster finally a nasalvoiced director called thats a wrap beautiful jabez jabez gave a weary sigh and wiped the sand off his oiled legs the crew began their cleanup im curious mary magdalene whit said where does all the money come from to pay for this wonderful spread jabezs wrestling career mustve been lucrative in that worldly goods way the lord provides mary magdalene intoned the lord must provide on a real regular basis whit said claudia shot him a look quit antagonizing this woman whit moved to the left a couple of feet to avoid another pinch jabez jones trotted over smiling hello detective salazar judge mosley bless you hello reverend claudia nodded we had an appointment of course thank you for escorting them here mary we can talk here along the beach its quiet and peaceful he gestured with his oaktree arm down a stretch of beach away from the camera crew jabez mary magdalene clearly didnt want to leave his presence i can stay go its fine jabez said if youll excuse me mary magdalene said i have the lords work to do she uttered this with a mysterious air as though this activity involved navy seals russian microfilm and jimmy hoffa they followed jabez the morning had turned shiny the sky cloudless a wheel of gulls cawed above their heads swerved as one and dived for food in the lapping surf shriveled husks of two dead portuguese manofwar jellyfish lay on the sand mary magdalene seems real sweet whit said shes very devoted i rescued mary magdalene from the streets of houston she was homeless hopeless strung out on dope not strong i made her strong jabez said you and jesus whit said absolutely jabez agreed as though he and the lord made an awesome tag team so whit youre a jp now how very rewarding for you i like it whit said i surely hope youre reelected jabez said i mean running that restaurant and that delivery service just didnt seem to be your calling the comment was topped with such a dollop of theocratic sugar that it might not be an insult jabez smiled in the light of his expensive muscles and his expensive compound and his expensive television crew gosh jabez thanks and i pray on a nearconstant basis that you get picked up by a tv station that actually serves a metropolitan area jabezs smile never dimmed but one of the balloonshaped muscles in his arm tensed the preacher turned to claudia i called because i thought i might be able to help you with your inquiries we understand youd been to see pete recently yes i offered him spiritual counsel he and i have known each other for a long time he was going through some difficult times he paused and dropped his little bomb he wanted custody of his son that we knew whit said jabez crossed his bulky arms small gold crosses were tattooed on his knuckles oh well perhaps im not being helpful the hubbles were of course opposed to him filing trying to settle with him i guess you knew that as well whit and claudia exchanged a quick glance the hubbles had consistently claimed no knowledge of pete wanting custody if jabez was being truthful then they were lying what did he have on them that would have made them even negotiate with him you only go outofcourt if youre not sure you can win and faith and lucinda should have been as sure as saints whit said what leverage did pete have jabez shook his head dont know your honor pete kept that private but there was a flicker of an amused smile behind his solemnity and whit wondered i understand you and he fought argued whit said ah velvet yes she misunderstood pete wanted me to be a character witness for him i was willing because i do think everyone can change and pete seemed sincere in wanting to improve his lot but i told him he would need to accept god in his life and he got mad at me then there were no other arguments so did pete discuss any other aspects of his life with you claudia asked a pained look crossed jabezs gladiatorhandsome face when i was in wrestling well some of my colleagues were attracted to women of dubious morality some of them worked in adult films and i heard through them about pete i actually saw him at a dinner party a few years ago hosted by a wrestling promoter he looked terrible he asked me not to tell anyone back here about his career ive kept my word gossip is the devils venom poured in an ear so do you suspect the hubbles so much for the evils of gossip whit thought we have no suspects at the moment were not even sure its a homicide claudia said judge mosley will be conducting the inquest in the next couple of days would suicide surprise you whit asked i dont quite understand why he would come home and work on getting close to his son then kill himself whit changed topics did he mention that he was working on a film jabezs mouth gave a cautious twitch i prayed he would not resume his career no a documentary about his brother corey he says on a tape we found that you refused to cooperate with him the mouth twitched again and a muscle flexed under the crossladen tshirt thats not so i just couldnt be of much help to him he had called me when he came back to town thats how we got to talking he did ask me to tell him about the day corey vanished and you said what claudia asked jabez paled under the storebought tan well i was one of the last to see corey before he was reported missing pete asked me to restate what i remembered im afraid i wasnt much help to him he stared out at the flat plane of the bay stretching away like green glass you and corey strike me as unlikely friends whit said jabez shrugged i wanted to help corey he was in trouble at school at home and sinking further i thought i could help him reshape his life so he was like a project whit said you could get your samaritan merit badge by turning him around thats a crude way to put it but yes if i didnt think god could turn around lives i would never bother with a ministry and corey was willing to be preached at you have an admirable ability for oversimplification whit jabez said it must serve you well in traffic court no he wasnt willing to be preached at but he was willing to have a friend he could talk to who didnt smoke dope who didnt want to drag him down i was a refuge you were a goodygoody he was a punk im frankly surprised corey hubble would give you the time of day whit said you just never know about people do you jabez said so what happened the day corey vanished claudia interrupted corey had planned to spend the night with me we were going to watch movies at my house id gotten a tape of godspell thought he might like the music and itd give me a way to witness to him he called and canceled at the last minute saying he was sick i never heard from or saw him again did pete share any theories about corey with you claudia asked any information he had found about his brother jabez jones considered for a moment and the pause reminded whit of a talented preacher waiting for the congregation to lean forward eager for the next word it makes no sense to me pete mentioned a possibility that corey was still alive and in some kind of trouble you know that motto what would jesus do i look at jabez and wonder what would jesus think claudia said hes lying whit said prove it oh christ proof my gut tells me hes a publicity hound if he can link himself to a highprofile death he will listen honorable you cant prove hes lying any more than you could prove faith hubble has lied or anyone else she added quickly you think faiths lying faith hubble is running scared dont pull a punch here she threatened my family whit very subtly she implied my father might lose his shrimping license you must have misunderstood you dont misunderstand a threat to your fathers livelihood i felt like belting her in the face claudia turned onto highway that threaded back to port leo i sensed a weird vibe between you and faith hubble last night no ive just known her for a long while shes worried about her kid dont let your friendship warp your judgment im going to get tired very quickly of you and delford telling me how to do my job dont get all huffy whit was silent for a moment so say what you think claudia you have a political future at stake whit i know you want to win the election even if you act like campaigning is pimping and i dont relish examining bodies with that greasewad buddy beere so all im saying is you show the hubbles a hint of favoritism youre gonna get cooked i dont believe for one second they can contain velvet from leaking news of petes career the news is going to hit big and you better handle the inquest with every i dotted and t crossed as opposed to gunning for them like you whit said dryly they passed the welcome to port leo sweet spot of the gulf sign surrounded by smaller signs from city churches the chamber of commerce the kiwanis and rotary club as long as they dont gun for me she guns for me my family i dont tolerate that i still think youre mistaken about faith whit said im not getting into a fight with you honorable claudia turned into the town square parking in front of the police station but why did heather farrell say pete blamed jabez for coreys death jabez sure isnt going to tell us how would heather even know about a connection between jabez and pete maybe shes got a different connection to jabez other than pete claudia shrugged ill track ms farrell down and ask her whit turned to her lets say jabez is telling the truth pete thought corey was alive so wheres corey been all these years claudias office was cramped delford sat in the creaky wooden chair next to her desk eyes bleary red even his waxperked mustache drooped its tapered corners sagging whit slumped in the chair at eddie gardners desk his feet propped on a stack of papers whit watched as delford and claudia brainstormed the most obvious answer is usually the right one delford said suicide claudia shook her head pete lived on a boat owned by established criminals he wanted his wifes kid he could derail his mothers political campaign he was digging into a brothers disappearance that could have been murder and made accusations against a wannabe television star are you and i looking at the same picture yeah well you can look at inkblots and come up with different interpretations claud delford said he was a pervert and he didnt have squat of a future weve had more than one person say and folks that knew him better than you and i that he was depressed and maybe suicidal your stubbornness claudia groaned is about to make me suicidal he tried to kill himself a few years ago faith hubble got the police report from van nuys he downed a bunch of pills and vodka delford clicked his tongue id have thought claud you would have unearthed that little nugget a slow creep of color bloomed along claudias cheeks id like to see that report if you dont mind suicide once doesnt mean suicide again whit said delford growled low in his throat no lets never grab hold of the obvious shall we claudia turned referee let me tell you what else ive found before you two start debating petes been arrested twice out in california once for public intox once for disturbing the peace and public nudity apparently while filming one of his little epics in the great outdoors he didnt serve time both were over five years ago she flipped a page velvet has no record she told me in her statement that pete rented that laptop on a monthly basis from baywater computers i called the store owner and pete hadnt returned the system we still havent located it im going to get a diver down into the marina to look for it maybe it went overboard delford said nothing phone records ive got fox checking out mostly calls back to california although he has several calls to missatuck texas over the past week up in deep east texas know it never heard of it delford said so lets say its murder just to indulge you claudia who do you like faith hubble claudia said instantly right a respected leader and mother delford said same for you whit whit felt like he was walking on quicksand in leaded boots i dont know certainly pete was a threat to the campaign and pete was serious about fighting for custody although no one believes he had a prayer given what we know claudia interrupted but it works if faiths closet was dirtier than his delford snorted thats hard to imagine junior deloache or someone working for him would be my guess whit said if you have a crime look for criminals youre deep delford said since you think i ignore the obvious dont ignore the deloaches whit said carefully ive got to go court and duty call he left delford waited until whit shut the door sloppy work claudia not learning about that suicide attempt doesnt make us look good his voice usually a cajoling drawl rang hard and steely im sorry ill call the van nuys police right now and confirm see that you do delford said i got a meeting with the mayor let me know what you find out and dont screw up again claud he slammed the door behind him who the hell are you turning into delford she wondered she reached for the phone and asked nelda to get her the van nuys california police department at lunchtime whit grabbed a booth in the back of cafe caspian surveying the small crowd in his new stepmothers restaurant babe had cautioned irina that the coastal bend population included many military retirees who might blanch at patronizing a russian cafe whit privately thought most of the retired military males would rush in wellorganized step to slurp irinas coffee once they spotted her in her black miniskirt and white tshirt cafe caspian was perhaps a quarter full mostly retirees with a smattering of realtors secretaries and artists gossiping over russian specialties like piroshki meatfilled dumplings golubtsi cabbage rolls borscht topped with sour cream honey breads and blinis whit wished he had invested in sour cream futures before irina opened the cafe he would have made a killing she also served more mainstream foods such as thick ham sandwiches fish shrimp and oysters fresh from the bay and what she called bitokes a la russe hamburgers dolled up with sour cream of course onion and nutmeg these had been an unexpected hit tributes to both irinas motherland and her adopted land decorated the walls a beautiful color photograph of the statue of liberty a portrait of peter the great reproductions of elegant faberg e eggs and peasant russian dolls lined a shelf on another was a framed collection of miniature american and texan flags in the window hung several keep whit mosley justice of the peace signs irina the sovietborn fiend for democracy irina slid into the seat across from him holding a steaming cup of tea and pushing her chestnutbrown hair back over her ears her face was elfin he had always pictured russian women as either kerchiefheaded grannies sunandnutrientstarved model waifs or steroidgulping swimmers but irina looked fresh and healthy not tall but not frail eyes of watery blue and a generous mouth go campaign today she took her stepmother role seriously buddy beere has a van covered with campaign signs patrolling main street he offered to debate me of course you accepted no im too busy doing the actual job but i need two favors tell me i need to borrow your computer sure you need the computer now she asked id prefer to use it after hours if you dont mind no problem why does a russian accent nail you right in the crotch perhaps he had fixated on natasha on the old bullwinkle cartoons in a freaky erotic manner she jangled a set of keys from her pocket pried a silver key off the ring and slid it across the table extra key lock up when youre done second favor is i want you to befriend someone but you cannot gossip about it who her name is velvet that sounds like a horses name shes not shes a friend of the man who died shes a little unconventional but she could use a friendly face shes meeting me here for lunch ill introduce you you always find the strays that need help yes dont tell dad hell just say that im not being focused on the campaign irina made a dismissive noise forget him you know i think i am the only one who knows the real you sometimes isnt that silly she leaned over and gave him an irreproachable peck on the cheek you are a thoughtful boy whit a boy and he was older than she velvet stepped inside the cafe whit waved her over introduced irina to her youre judge mosleys stepmother velvet dressed modestly in touristtrap bermuda shorts and a pale yellow tshirt shook hands and sat not taking her eyes off irina maybe i should go recruit in russia i do training films corporate stuff irina smiled politely and excused herself she returned with tall glasses of iced tea took their order for salads and bitokes and scurried to the kitchen so now youre making training films whit said i cut a little deal with faith hubble mouth zippered shut for now for sams sake pete wouldnt have wanted him hurt by well by the truth so you and faith are bosom buddies i loathe that bitch with all my heart but sams a good kid i dont want him hurt but i dont want them to just sweep pete under a rug either so how are you doing she shrugged im cried out when do you have autopsy results probably today at the latest tomorrow he stirred his tea pete tried to kill himself once before you neglected to mention that to us oh that he took the wrong pills a dozen of them he took the pills because i didnt cast him in a quickie movie i was making we had a fight the week before and i was fed up with him pete could be a prima donna so he downed some tranqs and called me on his cell phone to drive him to the hospital i didnt believe him and by the time i got to his place he was tanked out otherwise i wouldnt have bothered with the hospital i just would have made him puke ive jammed fingers down throats before a lot of suicide among your coworkers isnt there velvet shrugged shrinks kill themselves more than any other group so dont be thinking my colleagues are all mental cases were not no like me youre all welladjusted models of society he meant it lightly as a joke on them both but hed punched a wellpummeled bruise yeah just like the welladjusted models of society that buy all our movies their salads arrived blanketed with bluecheese dressing velvet waited until the server left before speaking you probably dont know the names ive been called by your welladjusted types when ive bothered to go on radio shows or done web interviews whore slut they cease to mean much after a while she offered a smile i prefer to think of myself as a pleasure engineer he laughed because he could tell she needed him to at least this way i get to choose what im called whit whores a term coined by men to trample any woman with sexual vitality velvet licked the blue cheese from her fork with a slow baroque flourish of her tongue whit waited for the chain reaction of heart attacks to decimate the retired men in the restaurant but no one keeled over that makes you uncomfortable velvet said youre all squirmy boy now i am not what a squirmy man needs is a kiss gone bad velvet said a what in regular movies ninety percent of the time you get the kiss and thats it maybe they wriggle real fakey in bed but its antiseptic sexuality in adult movies you get the kiss and two seconds later the cast is getting way down and dirty i just call it a kiss gone bad but its really good you know youre my ideal audience single a little bored too respectable to ever solicit a prostitute but probably in need of sweet relief im not bored whit said he felt color creeping up past his collar have you ever seen one of my movies whit no have you ever seen any porn movie be honest yes he admitted when one of my brothers got married we had a bachelor party with an xrated tape rolling on the vcr if you watched it and it made your godfearing little soldier stand at attention honey you cant look down your nose at me im giving you and every other man what greases your wheels she lowered her voice even further i bet my tapes are under more beds and hidden away in more closets here in your sweet little gomerville than you would ever imagine what do you want me to say velvet good for you i just dont want you to act like what i do is so terribly wrong im not filled with angst over what i do all this angst pete supposedly felt about his brothers disappearance is that really why he ended up in porn he did it because its fun she said in a flat voice fork poised above the messy salad fun and thats why you did the movies too she began to eat her salad not answering him shoveling drenched chunks of lettuce in her mouth staring at her plate drop the armchair psychology its just that you seem too smart for this she glanced at him quickly oh and so the blue movies are full of morons huh judgie boy ive worked with computer programmers accountants lawyers people who want to make one flick just for laughs use a hornycorny name get in get out you think theyre better than me cause they do driveby porn no whit said but i want to know why you and pete did these movies why want me to make you a star she asked im quite sure id be a disappointment on film you got a good jawline thats important the camera likes you better so why i just would like to know theres no soap opera answer my folks didnt beat me my dad didnt abuse me none of that tabloid talkshow shit she set her fork down im the worstcase scenario of a preachers kid my dad was a methodist minister in omaha i wouldnt mind going back there one day live life a little slower your mom died when i was four lupus im sorry i dont remember much about her except she made the best lemon pie you ever ate id sit on the kitchen floor while she baked waiting to lick the spoon and she liked gardenias the house always smelled of them before she died she leaned back against the booths seat my dad married his church secretary just to give me a mama she was a mean old cow whod gone to the hitler secretarial school and when i turned sixteen dad was dying of cancer he told me theyd slept together exactly one time that was it she cut him off right after because she had all the sensuality of a stale raisin thats whats wrong with this world theres not nearly enough love or happiness or orgasms about your mom my mother took off when i was two never saw her again whit said and my dad was a drunk until i was seventeen geez you shouldve ended up on the other side of the camera with me velvet said since nothing is our own fault and everything is the fault of our familys right wrong i dont blame my mom or my dad for any of my choices whit i wanted to make a lot of money i wanted to make movies and i liked the sex whit pictured a little girl sitting in a kitchen smelling of lemon peel and gardenias the soft camouflage for a sickbed i wanted to go to film school be the female coppola but that costs money whit and i wasnt filling the bank waiting tables or mopping up spilled beer or tutoring kids in algebra i met a guy he said i could make a lot of fast cash use a fake name no one would ever know she paused so i stayed in it we build these little worlds for ourselves and then we never get to move out meaning no one was gonna hire you for legit film work once you went down porn street the judges robe does a nice job of covering your vicious streak its vicious of me to point out the obvious she said nothing what you gonna do after pete is buried whit asked softly go back to california find the next guy who can supersize his boner when theres a camera three inches away and a crew of five standing around picking their noses dont he said dont do that she smiled but not the kind of smile that said arent you sweet gee willikers whit you gonna sweep me off my feet and save me from myself i just think you could not do these movies anymore why are you a judge she asked suddenly you dont fit the type at all too freespirited to be comfortable judging other people my dad got me the job he said and she laughed but youre sticking with it right you want to be elected youre like a smalltown gerald ford wanting everyone to vote for you and really give you the job you got handed why i never wanted to be a politician i hate that part of the job but i think truth matters even the little truths of smallclaims and traffic court and death inquests yes bull she said you like the power whit i can see it in your eyes that quick flash of yes im the judge dont mess with me i like the power too when some lonely horny guy slides one of my tapes into his machine i have power over his pleasure i can make him tingle all over or i can make him as limp as string never had much power as a kid i bet she smiled a cat warming up for a good purr littlest of six boys you probably didnt get to pick when you took a pee im not inclined to surrender my power any more than you are whit their bitokes arrived and irina plopped in the booth chatting up velvet asking her if shed walked through the shopping district and seen the arts center and the maritime museum velvet steeped in sudden courtesy spoke with complete assurance and sounded like an aspirant to the junior league irina left them patting velvet on the hand telling her how nice it was to meet her velvet toyed with the prescriptionpadsize dessert menu clamped above the salt and pepper what if you decide suicide and more evidence comes later that says not suicide i can reopen the case conduct a new inquest but considering pete tried to kill himself before if the autopsy remotely suggests suicide i knew youd cop out youre not going to risk your own political neck to help me give me something then do you know anything he knew that could have gotten him killed anything specific she shook her head you dont think thats keeping me up at night that maybe whoever shot him thinks i know what pete knew i dont i dont and he saw fear a naked cancer in her eyes it had been a bad afternoon for claudia she got confirmation that pete hubble had once attempted albeit clumsily suicide she hated that faith hubble was right about anything there was a judy cameron in the port leo phone book at the paris street address mentioned by heather ms cameron was a math teacher at port leo high school but she had never heard of heather farrell and had no transients lounging at her house so claudia gobbled a messy lunch of barbecue shrimp and coleslaw downtown then headed for little mischief beach no heather farrell the two scruffy girls on the beach shed seen yesterday claimed not to know heather or to have seen her shed then stopped by the hubbles an exercise in futility lucinda faith and sam all stuck by their statements lucinda gave yes and no answers faith hubble was polite but clearly irked at going through her statement again claudia remained friendly crisp and polite with them but feeling out of sorts and frustrated you dont like faith hubble fine look at every suspect dont be blindsided she told herself so she tromped back to the station to engage in a deloache hunt she spoke with the houston and galveston police departments and did simple queries against a statewide criminal database thomas deloache sr age fifty had a quilted history twice dragged before a grand jury but never indicted he had started most likely as an enforcer for the montoya crime ring and took over when montoya and his son both died ignobly crushed by a beerladen semitrailer on the houston stretch of i thomas deloache sr kept a low profile but he was suspected of handling about five percent of the drugs funneled through the houstongalveston area five percent was worth millions the successive generation of deloaches offered mixed hope for a criminal dynasty two sons tommy jr and joe joe was the bright one attended a catholic prep school in miami went to college at texas but didnt finish opting to enter the family business early galveston police suspected him in two murders but the lack of bodies and evidence stymied investigations junior marched to a different perhaps palsied drummer he had been arrested a few times on very minor charges never anything worth more than a slap on the wrist one hot check swimming in very public mecom fountain in houston when drunk attending an illegal dogfight in galveston barely finished high school never attempted college she went to go find her boss to her surprise delford seemed more willing to listen to the potentials of a junior deloache being involved in petes death why would junior deloache be in port leo he asked one of his dads legit business concerns is a couple of small motels in galveston theyre clean as a whistle which is driving the galveston cops nuts papa might be turning over that side of the business to junior its less risky he and his associate a guy named anson todd both told judge mosley they were renovating the old sea haven and judge mosley thinks theyve lied about their whereabouts the night pete died i bet the deloaches launder dirty money through the socalled legit businesses like these condos delford tapped his finger against his lip do they know how the deloaches run in the houston drugs probably different channels some from other parts of texas some up from mexico some in from the gulf so whys he here there wouldnt be near the market in port leo for drugs unless shrimpers and retirees suddenly go cokehappy delford said but weve got navigable bays quiet beaches only a few hours from the south side of houston closer to padre and all those tourists and a lot fewer officers delford frowned so juniors here to smuggle drugs junior may be exiled where he can do the least amount of damage the houston detectives told me hes famous for being an overgrown brat even if pete turns out to be a suicide we need to know about these people sit down for a minute she sat smelling a lecture in the air delford flattened his palms on the table claudia i have faith in you but one area where you could stand definite improvement is in dealing with people pardon why are you grilling the hubbles on their statements i didnt grill anybody i hadnt even talked to them before today i just wanted to review their statements with them see if there was anything else they wanted to add there wasnt i wont have the senator and her family treated like criminals i did no such thing he rubbed his stubbyfingered hand across his eyes he looked ten years older she realized than he had last week thered been a bad cancer scare with him last year and a sudden tremble of worry took her he was not a young man anymore are you okay she asked fine just tired he leaned back in his chair and a new hardness tensed his jaw im pulling you off as the lead investigator in the case her face felt frozen why because one thing were going to be in this department is professional and you havent been how dont get mad stay calm she thought a finger of sweat trickled down her back you clearly dont like faith hubble and its coloring your view of this case and given all the likely publicity its best gardner takes the lead you can still work on the case just under his direction i already sent him to corpus this afternoon for the autopsy claudia heard her voice go ragged this is unwarranted delford youve never treated me this way before defensive dont suit you ive made my decision she sat stunned delfords phone buzzed he scooped up the receiver and listened yeah oh yeah i forgot ill send up claudia he hung up and gestured toward the blue flyer on his wall of marcy kay ballew that missing girls mother from louisianas here can you talk to her that was the sheriffs case davids case to be exact technically yes but shes been wanting to know what were doing in the city to help delford shrugged maybe thisd be good for you to focus on now ill talk with her anything was preferable to sitting through an undeserved rebuke not quite by the way delford said your ex is with her david sat ramrod straight his deputys stetson resting on his knee his stare drifted to claudia as mrs ballew talked claudia forced herself to concentrate on the womans words marcy is a really good girl the rose tattoo that was simple foolishness id already started saving for when she wanted to remove it she is really quite sweet mrs ballew perched at her chairs edge im sure she is claudia said and it would be easy for me to say i have no intention of being a pest but i have every intention of being a pest youre certainly not a pest and i want to assure you were doing everything we can to search for your daughter here in the county david nodded at claudia detective salazar and i are used to working together and im sure we can find your daughter gosh you hardly ever spoke so gently to me claudia opened her copy of the ballew file that david had brought the same picture from the flyers was on top a photo probably taken at a chain department store based on the cheesy fake background of an autumnkissed farm and barn marcy had reddish hair cropped short slightly crooked teeth thin lips skin supple as a peach no leads from the flyers yet right claudia asked david he nodded and foisted his extrasympathetic gaze toward her mrs ballew swallowed she was a spare floridcheeked woman with a red frizz of hair and toolong nails painted a bright lavender she wore khakis and a denim blouse dressed for a day shopping at an outlet mall instead of beating the pavement for her missing child well everyone back in deshay said that marcy ran off you know but i didnt believe it yeah she had once before but that was after a huge fight and she told me she was running off and i dared her to and she went to new orleans for two nights and then ran out of money and came home crying for her mama mrs ballew blinked worn out by her monologue marcy dont have a boyfriend right now so i dont think she took off with a boy and no one in your family your circle of friends knew port leo david asked he kept glancing at claudia and she thought dont use this womans grief just to get within two feet of me no none claudia wondered if the ballew girl had traipsed to the coastal bend for an unannounced vacation lost her wallet maybe turned to hitchhiking or hooked up with some of the partyminded sail bums that trolled from galveston to south padre island she hoped that was the answer will they drag the bay again probably not maam david said unless we have new reason to will they search again until theres more evidence to point she actually stopped in the county probably not claudia said mrs ballew sagged and youre absolutely sure that your daughter knew no one in port leo claudia asked she hung out with boys sometimes at the bars and sometimes they werent from deshay she never mentioned port leo to me claudia debated no clues no witnesses no reason for the girl to be here but she couldnt just turn this woman away tell me about marcy mrs ballew pointed toward the file but you have the information i know but it would be more helpful coming from you you live in deshay how long have you been there three years we used to live in shreveport but in deshay i got a job working for a cousin of mine at his shrimp restaurant and hes promised to make me a full partner in a couple of years shrimping was big along the louisiana coast and it was a lifeblood in port leo was that coincidence but shed consulted a map deshay was a fair ways north of the louisiana coastline and huddled up close to the texas border did marcy work as little as possible mrs ballew said as if by rote and she burst into tears long heaving sobs that carried the force of long suppression claudia hurried around her desk and squatted next to mrs ballew put an arm around her and placed a tissue in the womans hands david fiddled with the brim of his stetson paling under his freckles sorry mrs ballew gasped as her crying subsided im sorry im sorry youre doing great claudia assured her i always said she didnt work hard enough jesus and now im so afraid shes dead and i make fun of her for being lazy but that was the thorn between us you know not a joke but the one thing i got mad at her for the not working hard enough mrs ballew exhaled a long whooosh and wiped her face and nose tell me about her job claudia pulled her chair close to mrs ballews she worked as a nursing home aide in deshay shed change the patients beds mop up the floor spoon lunch into their mouths it was either that or road crew for the parish out in the heat and wet but she liked the clients especially the old ladies shed tell me when a new widower arrived and all those old women would just start aprissing mrs ballew mopped at her eyes marcy said she could make their last days happy if she snuck viagra into the food whats the name of the nursing home memorial oaks claudia wondered why it wasnt a crime to use the term memorial in a facility designed to house the stillliving tell me about the day she went missing september thirtieth she worked her regular shift from noon to ten at night usually she came right home showered to get the lysol smell out of her hair got ready if she was going barhopping she didnt come home the staff at memorial oaks were the last to see her yeah her supervisor said she left about ten after ten she stayed to help with a patient whod puked all over himself as mrs ballews lip trembled she wondered the inevitable if marcy had been her usual lazy self and not stayed that extra ten minutes would she have escaped the boogeyman and none of her things were missing no all her stuff was at home her car was found about ten miles away at a shopping center parking lot but she hated that center she never went there so i dont know why she would go that night bad with a capital b the girl was in claudias opinion an abductee and probably dead but how and why would her id surface in port leo hundreds of miles away david cleared his throat importantly but said nothing claudia glanced at the file the wallet when found on the road outside port leo had had a credit card and thirtythree dollars in cash in it the most likely scenario was that the ballew girl had been killed close to deshay although the louisiana police had not turned up a trace of her assuming she was dead someone either the killer or an associate had come to port leo where they chose to throw marcy ballews wallet still containing cash onto the road we traced the movements of the registered sex offenders in encina county seeing if any of them had gone to louisiana recently if any had a connection to deshay so far nothing david said the words sex offender made mrs ballew go white deshay is a long way for someone to go to commit a crime against a stranger claudia said there must be some other connection i cant think of one mrs ballew said mournfully so for the next forty minutes claudia worked through marcys life old boyfriends old high school friends former coworkers any hobbies or interests david hardly asked a question mrs ballew enumerated her daughters interests she did like watching cable tv the movies and she liked wrestling on tv a lot and figure skating what with the fancy costumes wrestling she ever watch joltin jabez jones claudia asked mrs ballew brightened oh yeah the guy who became the preacher sure she watched his show she was a big fan of his the honorable whit mosley curbed the impulse to put the smallclaims hearings on a kitchen timer watching the augustine brothers bicker was like rewinding a moment from his own rowdy familys past where the six brothers routinely waged war over who scarfed down the nacho chips and who erased the super bowl tape and who spread lard across a brothers bedsheets the division between the augustines who seemed to be sharing iq points was a homemade barbecue grill each side had laid out the facts of their case in a style that would have won them admirers on the tabloid talkshow circuit let me get this straight whit said tony you built the grill using your own labor correct damn straight sir tony augustine nodded he was a year older than whit and had been a minor bully in junior high and now realized he might pay for past transgressions sweat of my own brow judge but you used cliffs materials correct thats right your honor said cliff augustine he had never pushed anyone out of the lunch line and suspected he had the moral high ground i spent all the money on the materials the bricks the racks the wiring all of it and tony because there would be no grill without your high level of craftsmanship the sarcasm was not lost on judge mosleys clerk the constable the augustines or the few spectators waiting to argue their own cases you now want it back well yeah tony gulped i mean we were gonna share it but now our wives aint getting along its a real sweet grill makes the best ribs youve ever put in your mouth a hint of bribery honeyed tonys voice whit believed a plate of the heavenly meats might anonymously arrive at his doorstep if all went tonys way its ridiculous that two grown brothers cant resolve this whit said youre wasting this courts time boys so call me solomon im ordering that the grill be divided equally right down the middle you get the right half cliff and you get the left half tony thatll destroy it tony exploded are you nuts cliff demanded watch it constable lloyd brundrett who served as bailiff in whits court rumbled sorry your honor cliff said in sudden meekness im sorry im very sorry or option b is you two resolve this peaceably right now whit said neither augustine spoke fine thats my judgment the sheriffs deputies will execute this order at their earliest wait cliff yelled please please judge wait all right tony built it he can have the grill i dont want to see it ruined tony pumped his fist in the air in a redneck jig whit rapped the gavel and pointed it at tony stop that celebrating right this minute the hand dropped the hips ceased their victory sway tony if your brother is letting you have the grill i strongly suggest you work out a plan to reimburse him for the cost of his materials over time and either with cash or barter maybe you could feed him and his family some of that barbecue you bragged about you need to be a good brother understood tony finally nodded surprised and still pleased fine case dismissed his clerk handed him the file for the next case neighbors bickering over ownership of a lawn mower in the next hour he adjudicated four more cases patsy duchamp slipped in and sat in the back row of the courtroom when he completed the last case and the courtroom emptied patsy approached the bench and slid him a folder the news clippings on corey hubble you wanted whit she said thanks the margaritas are on me sure could use a good quote for the hubble story im sorry patsy not yet i should hear from the mes office real soon he tucked the file under his arm and promised to call her as soon as there was news whit ducked down the hall into his office relieved to have the days docket done five cases in justice court resolved in barely an hour the voters could not say justice wasnt damned swift in encina county maybe he ought to make that a mainstay of his campaign whit opened his office door and found sam hubble sitting in front of his desk head bowed hands in lap the boy stood slowly hi judge mosley you got a minute sure sam how are you holding up im kind of freaked about my dad thats understandable whits tongue felt thick and oily he sat behind his desk smoothing the black robe trying not to let the thought ive been screwing your mother play across his face i know this is a tough time for your whole family wow what next can i pull out from the bag of cliched platitudes i wanted to talk to you about my father stuff i couldnt say with gram and mom around if you want we can call them after ive said what i got to say his tone was resolute he looked like pete broadshouldered tall lanky with a shock of brown hair hed inherited faiths eyes hazel and direct and a thin slice of a mouth that reminded whit of lucinda then lets talk im sorry for what i did sam said and whits stomach dropped my dad killed himself i know because i found the body first not that girl thin light slanted through the halfshut blinds and in the bars of shadow sam reminded whit not of the other hubbles but of lost corey hunched beaten down i didnt want anyone to know sam said but i cant do this to gram let her think maybe dad was murdered he swallowed i went back to the boat monday night to see my father did he know you were coming no i just wanted to talk with him it felt weird sometimes knowing he had been gone most of my life and yet he was now just a few miles away did you get along with him sam shrugged he wasnt as bad as i thought he would be but he abandoned mom and me i wasnt ever going to forgive him yeah i could get along with him okay but forgive never i think he knew that sam pulled a folded paper from his pocket and laid it on whits desk i went to go see him about eightthirty the boat was dead quiet so i went aboard and i found him the boys voice quavered i freaked i tried to wake him but he was clearly dead his skin it was still warm he wiped at his mouth with the back of his hand i like froze i didnt know what to do then i saw the note it was on the nightstand table so you werent at home with your mom like you said in your statement no i snuck out theres a trellis by my window its a quiet climb mom didnt know i was gone im sorry i lied on the statement i didnt know what to do sams voice broke because of what my father wrote whit took a tissue from a box and carefully unfolded the note it was written in typeface from a computer printer i came home thinking i could fix what was broke in me and i cant mama im sorry for the pain ive caused you and what i did to corey i killed him i didnt mean to but i did we argued over his drug use all those years ago and i hit him and he fell and hit his neck funny against the stair banister he was dead in less than a minute and i panicked before you came back to town i took his body out past santa margarita island and weighed it down good and dumped it i didnt know what else to do i have tried to deaden the pain of this for years with all the wrong things in life and i just cant go on this way is better sam and faith please forgive me i love you both velvet i dont have the words be good mama good luck in the election and

with you at all you are aces and i love you i am so so sorry and please forgive me pete whit set the letter down on his desk a tremble of nausea touched his stomach youre going to have to give the police a revised statement sam i know but i came to you first my mom said you decided whether or not it was suicide will you go with me to talk to the police sure but id like to know why you kept the note why you didnt say anything right away there was a marina full of people there you could have told i know i just i didnt want everyone to know hed done what he said to his brother i didnt i was worried about grams election what this would mean my grandmother shes gonna kill me for this not helping out right away telling a lie what happened after you found the whit nearly said body and managed to edit midstream after you found the note i stayed with him for a few minutes sam lowered his eyes i know it sounds weird but i didnt want him to be alone it seemed wrong to leave him i thought of calling the police but i thought maybe what with grams election coming up maybe i shouldnt be in the news so i just left left the boat and left the marina he wiped his dripping nose pretty shitty huh am i in big trouble lets call the police and call your mother whit picked up the phone and dialed the station claudia wasnt in but he was transferred to delford delford blew out a long sigh now here i was telling yall it was suicide and jesus if you and claudia bickered with me the whole way sam is here but his mother needs to be present if hes going to give a statement of course ill give lucinda and faith a call right now thanks well walk across the street in a minute whit said and hung up im sorry sam said whit placed the suicide note into a manila folder outside the sky was a sweet blue smear and the gulf wind whipped whits robe around his legs sam shaded his eyes against the unclouded sky two questions occurred to whit did you notice whether your dads laptop was on the boat sam shook his head i didnt notice a computer around and did your father ever discuss a new film project with you sam shook his head he didnt talk about his work to me did you know he made movies for drivers ed yeah whit said i knew they crossed the street and went inside to the police station quite the development whit said after sam had gotten settled in the chiefs office the hubble women had not yet arrived but were on their way over he and delford had retired to the kitchen delford filled a coffee cup with a shaking hand god relief ill sleep better tonight whit folded his arms youll have that note tested for petes fingerprints right showboating is over whit its typed not handwritten and his computer is still missing am i supposed to believe he typed a suicide note then tossed his laptop into the marina delford started to argue then shrugged damn youre difficult fine ill tell gardner why not claudia the case is gardners now delford said through tight lips not that theres much of a case now partner delford was right whit left he didnt want to see faith right now he walked to his car shrugging out of his robe he tossed it in the backseat and drove a half block to the ice cream store he once managed he was halfway through a chocolatealmond double scoop when his pager beeped the nueces county medical examiners office calling this doesnt have to be awkward david said he smoothed his damp hair with the flat of his palm claudias fingers tapped against the computer keyboard of course not but it is she finished her report and saved copies to the hard drive and a diskette i dont want to make you uncomfortable he said she popped the diskette from the computer youre not so whats bothering you he palmed his hair again when you get mad you dont vent you keep it all locked inside but i know youre steamed hes not your husband anymore and you dont have to skirt an issue to keep the peace i felt like you were using that interview with that poor woman as a reason to see me he laughed well dont we think well of ourselves am i wrong i didnt steer her to you she wanted to talk with plpd and delford said you but im not sorry to see you david arent you hurt doesnt it bother you i didnt want to be married to you anymore did you want to hurt me of course not his mouth thinned sure yeah it hurts bad i miss you awful fierce when i get home and its just me and the tv but like you said were still gonna run into each other the casual sweetness of his tone prickled her skin well i think its just best we dont overdo our time together the point of a divorce was to be apart was it all bad did you just hate me or what he blinked i would really like to know i want to fix whatevers wrong with me she touched the back of his hand oh david no it wasnt all bad and no i dont hate you she said i feel like we got married because everyone said we were such a cute couple its not enough i know some womans going to scoop you right up because youre a great guy and ill still be a moping loner but i wasnt right for you he carefully put his hat back on his head she saw wetness glimmer in his eyes he had never cried in front of her and he said okay thanks i really did just want to know david bumped into a smiling eddie gardner as he left the two men exchanged friendly hellos and eddie dumped a photocopied piece of paper on claudias desk suicide note with prints from hubble and his son he said and it clears up the corey hubble case too claudia read my god are they going to look for coreys body eddie shrugged the hubbles asked we not release the note to the press i suppose the coast guard or maybe the parks department will look for remains but thats gonna be a waste of time mosleys inquest is gonna be just a formality now he smiled and sat man i love clearing cases congratulations claudia turned back to her paperwork on two burglaries she had cleared on friday wishing she could slap the smirk off his gaunt tendollartan face an hour later eddie left for drinks at the shell inn with most of the day shift he invited her to go but she declined with a polite smile hey no hard feelings right of course not she said he grinned slapped an astros cap on his head and sauntered out whistling cheeseburger in paradise she waited until he was gone for ten minutes and headed down the hall the old files of the port leo police department moldered in a locked back office it was quiet now at six pm none of the other detectives were here most of the clerks had headed out and the patrol shift was out cruising port leo unlocking the inkblack storeroom she pulled on a chain to click on a naked lightbulb the room smelled of old paper damp brick and oddly garlic she went to a wall of cabinets the files were organized by year and then in turn by case number only a few major cases had not been cleared she wondered what murderers still walked free with the warm sun of port leo aglow on their faces full of easy confidence that they would never pay claudia pulled corey hubbles file it was thinner than she expected the disappearance of a state senators son surely would mean a thick bulging file this file was starved for data she scribbled her name in the signout book along with the file number and returned to her office an old file was simply a snapshot of a tragedy no papers in here could capture the boy that corey hubble had been what was his favorite tv show did he like chicken or beef wedged in his enchiladas which local jetty did he think had the best fishing all these fading papers represented was bureaucratic eulogy delford spires had been the detective on the case one of his last before being promoted to police chief she noted the year of coreys disappearance and did some quick math delford had been with the port leo police for fifteen years at that point she began to read senator hubble had reported corey missing on july she had gone to a democratic womens group meeting in houston leaving sixteenyearold corey and twentyoneyearold pete at home pete and faith were recently married faith finishing college at texas a ampm in college station a few hours distant faith had not been home that weekend she had been at summer school completing her degree someone had typed out a rough chronology based on delfords interviews thursday july lucinda had left for houston the boys spent time at their jobs pete working for a video store corey for a florist as a delivery boy friday july corey planned to spend the night at a friends house the friend being jabez jones the son of the minister at the gods coast evangelical church pete claimed that he had last seen his brother on friday shortly after lunch corey acted upset but would not discuss what the problem was claudia looked through the papers for petes statement and found the corroborating quote corey came back from being at his job and he was furious pissed upset i asked what about and he wouldnt tell me but he said that he was going to go fix what was wrong i asked him what he meant and he just said hed teach her no hint that pete might have beaten his brother to death at that point the chronology went on pete worked that afternoon at the video store then went out for hamburgers and barhopping with three male friends he got home shortly after midnight corey was not there having planned an overnight stay with jabez jones the next morning pete worked all saturday at the video store starting at nine and he did not get home until after five that afternoon his brother was not at home but pete did not consider that unusual his brother was often out pete fixed himself dinner and his mother arrived home unexpectedly a day early from her conference she wanted to know where corey was and when pete didnt know she started calling friends they were unable to find him she then reported him missing to the police at nine oclock that night claudia dug down for a statement from jabez jones it was there but added nothing to what delford had already noted corey had called and canceled the sleepover and then apparently vanished the rest of the reports and interviews painted an increasingly grim picture school counselors called corey manipulative unstable and attributed his behavior to his fathers painful cancer death five years earlier the boy seemed to have few friends willing to talk to the police one of coreys teachers described him as talented but erratic and mentioned he had gotten into trouble twice for fighting in school the teacher said that corey has a somewhat twisted view of the world being in place to primarily serve his needs his dad died so the world owes him clearly this idea is not sustainable with change in life being inevitable corey will face some real challenges i worry that he has a not welldeveloped regard for the rights of others to have lives separate from his another note in delfords scribble some rumors that he is sexually active but only when he can be rough with the girl cannot yet get anyone to confirm this he might have left if he roughed up some girl but have not been able to find anyone who would admit to sleeping with him pete said corey dated marian duchamp will check whit had mentioned that patsy duchamp claimed her cousin had slept with corey and gotten slapped around for the trouble thered also been the rumor of animal torture whit had mentioned to her but she found no notes regarding that subject corey hubble stood out in her own mind as a kid who lounged in the smoking area at the high school always slightly apart not quite fitting in with the roughnecks not hanging in with the populars where she remembered pete dwelling in splendor not clustering with the geeks for collective security she remembered he had blue eyes wide sadlooking several pictures of corey hubble lay stashed in the file a school photo where he glared dourly at the camera and several family photos in them lucinda and pete always smiled corey always frowned there was only one picture of him smiling sitting with his wasting father in a lawn chair touching his fathers pasty arm mr hubble smiled with the thin certainty of the dying she paged through the rest of the file an immediate search of the county turned up nothing except the boys car parked in a grove of windswept oaks not far from big cat beach found the day after he was reported missing a detailed report on the car and its condition indicated no sign of foul play an interview with one of coreys friends indicated the vintage mustang was coreys pride and joy he couldnt imagine that corey would leave it behind if he was cutting out from town st leo bay aransas bay copano bay and st charles bay were searched for his body nothing the investigation widened to san patricio and matagorda counties to corpus christi to south padre island to houston to austin all places a runaway teen might find attractive nothing the task force disbanded five months after corey hubble vanished although the file stayed open and assigned to one detective delford spires periodic updates followed a possible sighting in houston one from dallas one from san antonio nothing resulted in a real lead he was banished to the limbo of milkcarton photos pictured on direct mail pieces as a public service nothing there was little indication in the notes that the fbi or texas rangers had proffered much help although with lucinda being a state senator one would think every agency in the state would be hunting corey hubble apparently not or they had no more success than delford not a single thing to suggest that pete hubble had done away with his brother in the heat of an argument no physical evidence in the house no physical evidence in the hubbles small fishing skiff nothing she stuffed the file in her heavy purse and headed out the door on the way she talked to nelda the dispatcher and main guardian of the files being a baptist nelda hadnt gone to happy hour with the others do you remember any citizens phoning or asking for information about this case recently the corey hubble file nelda nodded yeah a guy stopped by big guy late thirties tall kind of muscled up some i remember he wore a lionshead chain around his neck not so classylooking i told him to talk to delford claudia thanked her so pete hubble murderer of his own brother wanted to see the file on corey why would he need it if he already knew the truth dont ever send me a famous body again dr liz contreras deputy medical examiner for nueces county had a voice that reminded whit of crumpled foil raspy bright a little grating you finally get some pressure to hurry pete hubble along i got a call from the governors office some aide to an aide with a degree in snotitude i explained to said flunky i dont have powers over time and space to hurry up blood tests then let me be the first to thank you for your quick work dont thank me too quick you need to chew out your evidence people ive already had a chat with your delightful mr gardner she cleared her throat hubbles hands werent properly bagged the gsr readings are not going to be particularly accurate whit had counted on the gunshot residue tests to help him determine if pete had been holding the gun when it fired a high level of residue implied suicide how was the bagging screwed up the bag on the victims right hand wasnt fastened properly and the bag itself has defects holes as if torn by rough handling now that said i found gunshot residue on the right hand but the amount could have come from hubble pulling the trigger and then the residue getting worn off with crappy bagging or because someone stuck the gun in hubbles mouth and hubbles hand went to the gun or was by his mouth or jaw its not definitive that he pulled the trigger or that he didnt crap if liz said outright suicide his ruling became simple so what can you tell me time of death was between seven and nine oclock hed eaten shortly before he died most of a pepperoniandmushroom pizza a number of tostada chips and several glasses of red wine death was instantaneous bullet entry wound through the mouth the angle is consistent with a gun placed in a mouth with little or no struggle so he wasnt lurching or fighting when the gun fired that could indicate selfinflicted she made a humming sound and he pictured her scanning her report the bullet didnt exit the skull ive retrieved it and sent it to the crime lab here dried blood around the mouth specks of blood on face and hands the specks on his face are blowback blood and tissue bursting forward from the bullets pressure moving through the head she paused what well this amount of blowback we ought to have seen it on hubbles right hand as well theres very little there would the bad bagging of the hands account for that maybe but i would still expect to see as much blowback on his trigger hand as on his face the amount of blowback on the gun itself is consistent with what i would expect with a selfinflicted shot hubbles prints are readable on the gun according to the lab they said there were a couple of partials but not readable enough for an id he thought of eddie gardner easing the gun out of petes mouth and thumbing the safety could that have happened if an officer handled the gun improperly whit asked possibly did he have sex before he died whit asked no we did find a pair of panties by the bed mixed in with his clothes then have gardner check those panties for seminal traces or pubics we will comb the deceased down for hairs and fibers not his contreras said whats your considered opinion as to homicide versus suicide a lot of folks are watching me on this one liz contrerass voice softened that he is lying in the bed with this bullet angle is a big suicide supporter theres just no sign of struggle the lack of blowback and gunpowder residue could be attributed to the poor handling but i cant say with certainty if theres much reason to believe he was depressed or suicidal youll probably be safe in ruling for suicide she paused hed had a lot to drink too his blood alcohol count was point two thats a lot of hooch might supercharge any depression toxicology on narcotics will take a while longer ive sent fingernail scrapings hairs from up and down and the bullet to the crime lab along with hand swabs they can do a double check on my work there thats about it she paused if your inquest is showing he was suicidal youre probably safe in ruling that way whit thank you liz if i decide to do a formal inquest youll come testify sure liz said especially if youll treat me to one of those russian hamburgers at your stepmoms place he chatted with her for a minute more hearing all about her young daughters dominance of the pee wee soccer leagues in corpus christi then clicked off he called delford left a message asking him to call and then nearly dialed patsy duchamp at the mariner to give a statement but he felt tired and oddly disappointed there was no case here to be solved really after all and patsy didnt have a paper hitting the streets again until saturday he could talk to her in the morning he went home ate a quiet dinner with babe and irina and was getting into his car to go to irinas cafe to borrow her computer when velvet pulled up he stood in the yard and waited for her to get out of the car you got a minute for me she asked yeah i have some news for you whit said we have a suicide note he explained to her sams revised account she leaned against her car no way whit i sure dont believe he killed himself and i sure dont believe he killed his own brother the note said coreys death was an accident i still dont believe it she stalked around the yard in a circle burning nervous energy i dont believe it why why not because he was a genuinely sweet guy he was i can look at him the same way i look at you and know you couldnt kill someone we never ever know people exactly the way they are velvet shook her head i want to see this note the police and the hubbles havent released it to the press yet he watched her fidget i dont think i can get you a copy im sorry velvet his damned family theyll say pete was a murderer and a suicide i mean why not kick him when hes dead she crossed her arms dont you have autopsy results yet anything to contradict that stupid note he wasnt about to disclose liz contrerass findings not yet nothing yet he paused tell me about junior deloache she crossed her arms junior whats to tell i understand he wants to be in movies to his surprise she laughed honey i couldnt sell tickets to junior the biscuit shall we say lacks yeast he says pete promised him only if junior bought his way in you mean an actor pays you not exactly ive known investors whove wanted to come watch the shoots or take some photos of their own or screw a starlet if she didnt mind but never while the camera was rolling whit studied her pimping for investors what does that have to do with love and happiness and all that stuff you whacked me with at lunch pray tell doesnt that make you just a glorified madam life is a tough business and youre running right back into the sleaze what am i supposed to do whit put down roots here in pleasantville why not make this film about corey that you and pete planned she stared without pete i dont think so plus the purse is empty he hadnt gotten the financing any excuse will do right as long as you can make more porno crap this crap is what i do and i tend to be quite good at it she stepped closer to him would you like to experience how good we could do a tape together never release it in the us distribute it in asia only no one here would ever know he didnt say anything for ten seconds and she laughed no smart answer whit under all that assurance youre such a whitebread boy if i took you on youd be toast and if i took you on maybe i could help you get out of the pit youre in deep in your heart you know porns wrong you know i can tell you do i dont im not one bit debased im superior to any man who pays money for my tapes and the last thing i need or want is a white knight to bring me a new set of morals mine are just fine she said i dont tell you what you do is wrong let me guess why youre still living at home at your advanced age your stepmothers charms no whit youre a sweet man but you look at me like a street whore maybe your church could sponsor i like my life as it is i like you period and i dont want to see you ruin your life its mine to ruin as you put it if i rule for suicide what are you gonna do he asked i dont know does that note mention his career not directly if it wasnt for sam id blast lucinda hubble with petes career in every paper i could why do you hate her so because whit she hated her own kids pete told me once his mother treated him and corey like stagehands in her great play of life faith should have been lucindas kid she seems to relish the role of little miss macbeth if lucinda wont stand by pete when hes dead i ought to hit her exactly where it hurts with the voters vendettas dont get you far they get you far enough she got in her car whit stood in the yard in the twilight and watched her go excitable thing isnt she a voice called to him coming across the yard whit turned and saw buddy beere dressed in a suit the color of a stale brownie and thickknotted polyester tie clutching a sheaf of campaign flyers hi whit said hi whit hope you dont mind me canvassing your neighborhood just out meeting the voters well i suppose if you havent grown up and known most of the voters all your life you need to campaign he felt extraordinarily peevish and the sight of buddy in his lumpy suit and sweaty brow and dorks tie only irritated him buddy didnt rise to the bait if it makes you feel better two houses on the street already said they were voting for you considering there were at least fifteen houses whit saw the jab thanks that was pete hubbles girlfriend right buddy asked you still chasing her part of the inquest is gathering information on the deceased to do that you have to talk to the bereaved youll have to learn that if you win suddenly he was tired of arguing and jousting with this little man so determined to take his job away good night buddy buddy rolled his remaining flyers into a cylinder whit one question did you have to buy your robe or did the county buy it for you i just want to be sure i get the right size claudia called whit on his cell phone before she collapsed in bed giving him an update on what shed found in the corey hubble case file he told her about the autopsy results and the bad bagging youll really have to discuss this with delford she said out of my hands now im sorry whit said delfords being unfair well let gardner handle it she said apparently the lesson learned here is that the hubbles warrant special treatment she paused gardner did do the tests on the note there were two sets of prints petes and sams i guess that settles that whit said driving to the cafe caspian whit watched gleaming lights dot the harbor fishing boats pleasure boats the restaurants by the piers that jutted into the bay his cell phone buzzed as he pulled up in front of the darkened cafe i understand you are sams confessor faith sounded hoarse and worn he says you were very good to him thank you whit less frosty than when shed stormed from the guest house youre welcome how are yall doing sam is still upset and of course lucinda is having to deal with petes confession you talk to me like youre talking to the press do i i guess so ive got spin doctors from austin coming out of my ass forgive me sam is devastated lucinda is in shock if pete had just told her then what happened with corey my god how their lives would have been different the suffering we would have been spared needless so needless she paused im sorry ive been so testy frankly i could use about seven hours in bed with you faith do you believe the note a silence of course i do i feel horrible for pete now imagining what he must have gone through why he decided to steep himself in what passed for pleasure why he couldnt tell me her voice broke for a moment and then she laughed one of those soft laughs not funny made at the sadness of the world i always considered him a failure as a husband i must have been an equal failure as a wife after corey vanished did pete seem different troubled he could hear lucindas voice in the background apparently talking on another line soft and mournful pete was never the same but all i can worry about is sam okay im sorry faith condolences never counted for much with him they always seemed designed to coddle the giver in the face of mortality but he tried im so sorry at least its over thank you whit bye he unlocked the cafe doors and headed back to irinas office an untidy whirl of papers covered her desk a calendar from the local branch of the texas coastal bank was pinned to one wall framed on her desk was a selection of photos of family in faraway russia a dour mother a sunny brother who needed orthodontic work and wore his hair in an unstylish chop irina rarely spoke of them as though they were from a chapter of life best forgotten he powered up her imac accessed the internet and found himself on the yahoo web portal he began with a search for big pete majors the film name pete hubble had used for his career a number of web sites popped into view along with brief descriptions most of the sites appeared to be online businesses selling pornographic videos the site with the highest relevance in the search proclaimed itself as the big pete majors site for the truly devoted fan whit clicked on it the site belonged to a truly devoted male fan of petes it offered reviews of petes cornucopia of movies a message board where petes fans could post deep thoughts and a gallery of downloadable pictures of pete both by himself and in action with his costars no banner proclaimed on the sites front page that pete was gone the copy below the big pete majors unofficial temple of appreciation read if youre a big pete majors fan youve come to the right place this is a labor of love for me im kevin all petes fans are welcome here str gay bi whatever enjoy str whit studied the arcane code a moment before realizing it meant straight kevin certainly had scads of free time whit explored the message board there were a few dozen messages some months old several messages were titled pete leaving porn it was a hot rumor and petes devotees promulgated reason after reason aids erectile dysfunction drying out in betty ford conversion to fundamentalism an ongoing bicker with porn directors the final message was posted by kevin it is my privilege as you know to know pete slightly because hes appreciated my efforts online and i just talked with him via phone and he said no way is he cutting out from porn he said to tell you all he really appreciates our concern but he is due back in la in a few months he is doing some socalled legit work hush hush back in texas where one may surmise that everything is indeed bigger dont know if hell still be exclusive with director velvet mojo but some pete is better than no pete so stop the rumors hes not sick and hes not dead and he should be back in front of cameras soon the message was dated last monday early afternoon hours before pete died whit found nothing of interest in the rest of the messages mostly discussions of which films showed big pete majors to advantage films of particular merit were awarded a two dicks up by one enterprising pair of critics comments on his acting skills discussions of which starlets he had the hottest sex scenes with all from participants with odd code names such as lovergrrl and madforpete and boyslut consumers of sex as opposed to those actually having sex needed reviews before plunking down their hardearned money whit supposed he scooted back to the temple of appreciations main web page he found a link to send email to web master kevin whit clicked on the link and typed in hi kevin id like to talk to you about your recent conversation with pete i know pete here in texas and im afraid i have some unsettling news and would prefer to talk rather than email you would you please call me my phone will pay the bill if you call my cell phone thank you judge whit mosley justice of the peace encina county texas he hoped his title might induce a more rapid response curiosity got the better of whit and he clicked on the gallerys front link the pictures were organized by action pete alone pete receiving oral sex pete masturbating pete doing it doggy style pete doing it with asian girls with black girls with bottle blondes with two girls at once a wide menu to appeal to the widest possible lack of taste whit remembered the boy that pete had been fun carefree quick to tease helping to toiletpaper the oaks in front of delfords house highfiving the mosleys after the infamous peptopink paint incident with delfords house that boy was gone maybe all this sex all this pleasure was a dam against the grief over what he had done to his brother whit returned to the search engine and typed a search on velvet mojo the list returned a number of sites selling videos and one site entirely devoted to velvet herself this site proclaimed itself to be velvetrocks the only site for americas preeminent female director of porn a picture of velvet that was at least five years old dressed in a leather biker garb with carefully moussed platinum hair she sat astride a gleaming motorcycle a sternness hardened her face instead of the wanton pucker of the rising starlet the site included a listing of the movies she had directed over sixty links to purchase her videos a listing of awards she had garnered from the adult film industry seven and a whole bevy of reviews by the pornorati as whit mentally termed the more slavish fans she had performed on the other side of the camera at the beginning of her career for ten films two of which were described on the site as classics there were pictures from her appearances available for download a guiltiness whit hadnt known since hed stolen peeks at his older brothers carefully stashed playboys when he was young rumbled along his bones he had never seen naked photos of a woman he knew socially but curiosity won the advantage over refinement and he clicked on a thumbnailsize photo what slowly filled the browsers screen was a color still from a movie that portrayed postal workers breeding at will velvet was in a badly buttoned clone of a mail deliverers uniform her breasts about to break out from the confines of the cloth her blond hair was combed huge her lips painted crimson her cheeks rouged one hand crept down from the flat plane of her stomach to the tootight serge of her uniforms skirt whit swallowed velvet looked far prettier in person in her sweats and jeans and her hair not a cumulus cloud in the picture she was a barbie doll maddened with lust she didnt look like any real woman he knew the true woman lay buried beneath the tryingtoohard stance and the stage paint he selected a second picture for download as the picture slowly built whit could see that pete lay atop her her oversize breasts jabbing into his overpumped chest both of them grinning with ecstasy so faked it looked like pain a kiss gone bad she had called it he clicked off the downloading picture before the whole bonanza presented itself he knew these people he couldnt watch them this way on a whim he did a web search on pete hubble instead of pete majors he slowly paged through the results zip that was relevant only a cluster of genealogy sites that listed various peter hubbles from the past three hundred years in their databases he did a similar search for corey hubble and got one result back other than the regular cluster of genealogy sites the enthusiastic kevins petetribute site odd he moved the mouse toward the link at the same time the office lights went black and a finger of god shrieked past his ear the imacs screen burst with a bright blinding nova whit fell behind the desk clutching his head hello judge a voice rumbled from the doorway low throaty a mans voice hoarse neutral of accent or drawl stay down on the floor and you wont be hurt whit stayed exactly where he was his heart pounding hard against the thin carpet the desk shielded him but in the pitchdark he couldnt see his assailant a faint electric crackle served as the dying gasp of the ruined computer whit heard his own ragged breathing far too loud listen your honor the polite voice said i could have blown your motherfucking head off now and i didnt thats because i want you to listen are you listening yes whit croaked he tried to think of any weapon there might be in the office nothing good you rule that pete hubble committed suicide if you dont you die and so does your father and so does his wife and so do claudia salazar and delford spires you will all be killed at the same time by uh multiple operatives understand jesus whit thought jesus mary and joseph and should you go to other authorities with this threat not only will you be killed but also your five brothers and their families in houston and in atlanta and in austin and in new york and in miami we know where all our little mosleys flock do you understand yes whit answered his voice sounded raw say it with conviction i think judges need conviction a small sickening laugh pick one of your brothers ill kill him to prove i mean business horror flooded whit pick a brother the voice said genially or i order them all killed whit gasped please dont ill do what you want which one the voice oozed enjoyment teddy in houston itd make fathers day rough for his three little delectable girls or joe in atlanta that software company probably pays him big his widow should live large on insurance how about mark in austin who so wants to be a writer isnt he your favorite brother lets spare the world another crappy poet please dont hurt them please pick one the shooter snapped me i pick me he screamed just leave them alone a slight laugh said with conviction so how will you rule suicide suicide suicide fine im generous tonight so all your brothers get to wake up tomorrow and fuck their wives and breathe the air a pause sorry about irinas computer but better it than the back of her head in the darkness he sensed the shooter leaning over the desk toward him to look up would mean death now heres what were going to do asshole youre going to stay kissing the floor here for the next thirty minutes because a buddy of mine is watching this cafe and if a light comes on or you move i come back and shoot you do you understand me yes whit answered i completely understand dont let me down judge whit heard the door shut he heard only the harsh labor of his own breathing he fingered his neck face and ear there was no wound he lay perfectly still on the floor the guy sounded like what a polite psychopath a government agent or like a tough guy whod seen a lot of bad movies multiple operatives who the hell was this you willing to take a chance with your life and your familys he let the thirty minutes pass not moving in the darkness his cell phone rang and rang and rang but he did not answer it from the bay port leo appeared as a luminous stitch against the black fabric of the night the always open port leo state pier glowed along its long thrust into st leo bay and even from this distance whit saw stick figures moving eclipsing the lights and he imagined he could see the lines the fishermen cast out into the bay as thin as spiders silk whit sat in the bow of dont ask and sipped at a jelly jar full of bourbon he had left the cafe hauling irinas ruined computer after him and cleaning up the debris hed phoned babe said he wouldnt be home that night and that hed dropped irinas computer while moving it he promised to replace the computer babe sounded unconvinced youre not with this girlfriend of hubbles are you you better not be blowing this election thinking with your dick im not and thanks for the vote of confidence be sure all your doors are locked daddy and keep your gun at your bedside what christ whit what is it whats wrong just do it whit said i got to go whit felt safe in one place and that place was now settled in the calm of the bay a bigass moat between him and the world gooch poured the right bourbon and was the consummate listener when whit finished outlining the investigation the attack and the threats against him and his family gooch said of course we have to destroy these people whit said nothing its an insult to the rule of law even when the rule of law is the notalwaysrespectable but everhonorable whit gooch sipped his spring water and stared out over the empty dark of the water i should warn dad and irina and my brothers if this jerk wanted them dead right now he wouldnt have bothered telling you listen to me whoever did this is scum and he deserves a quick ending whit listened to the water slap against the sides of the dont ask if theyre following me they might figure out that ive told you im hardly the authorities im simply a grizzled fishing guide gooch finished his drink im curious as to who could field this army of darkness devoted to nothing but eliminating a legion of mosleys junior deloache gooch shrugged junior doesnt strike me as the forceful type on his own so he sends one of his goons in his place but this person knew details about you your family junior is not oriented toward homework who elses cage have you and claudia rattled well delford took her off the case and shes steamed about it but delford was threatened as well whit shrugged could be a cover so i dont suspect him but theres a huge stretch between delford yanking claudia off this case and then delford ordering me to be shot at and my whole family threatened my god ive known delford spires for years no way what about our senator not lucindas style you may not like her but shes not the kind to use thugs lucinda hubble is exactly the type to use hired muscle i am not fooled like our fair electorate i do not find her amusing or colorful or even particularly bright there is something missing in that womans eyes some common trace of humanity i dont doubt she lets faiths hands get dirty while she keeps her own gloves white but this guy clearly didnt know about the suicide note sam found the note makes it much more likely ill rule for suicide even without a threat if the shooter knew about that why threaten me i think it puts the hubbles in the clear indulge me whit what if it was a hubble say your fair faith im indulging whit kept his voice steady at the least lucinda is petes mother theres a bond there that should survive just about anything and you say she was clearly torn about him coming home but faith this is nothing but nightmare for her if pete comes home and sours the election for his mother faith loses her job pete wants her kid and thought he had enough leverage against her that he hired a lawyer if he did have dirt it had to be radioactive for him to be considered the superior parent shes down two strikes and shes fiercely protective of lucinda her i could see whit took a hard swallow of the bourbon let it burn his throat shed be capable of killing pete i have no illusions there but they consider the case closed now because of the note she doesnt benefit from this threat against me unless she doubts you buy the note and wants insurance gooch showed compassion the only way he knew how by shifting subjects and jabez jones his name keeps popping up here i think not whit said why gunplay doesnt seem his style theres a lot of testosterone in his ministry you know the bible is deplorably violent gooch smiled youre neglecting one other possibility who velvet youre joking am not shes the one clamoring hardest for me to rule homicide it makes no sense look whit she could be working a carefully constructed sham she looks like petes advocate but she retires from town quietly when you rule suicide she nicely puts herself out of suspicion i just dont see her as a killer christ whit are you sleeping with her too no you never know about people whit the statement and goochs even tone made whit stop no i suppose not another blanket of clouds unfurled over the western gulf after the fall of evening whit longed to see the long swath of stars that scored the autumn sky over the coast he heard a soft whispering and he looked over the bow barely discernible in the darkness several dark shapes surfaced into the gentle cups of waves puffed misty air then slowly submerged again a small herd of porpoises sleeping he listened to them rise and fall in their total calm so how are you going to rule gooch finally asked whit set down his drink the shakiness had passed but the liquor hadnt calmed him just made him scared and drunk all at once ruling for suicide makes everyone safe for now but what does that say about me you think people here would vote for me or respect me if they knew i caved in to a threat ive known cowards whit you aint one i lay on that floor for the instructed thirty minutes i didnt even answer my cell phone when it rang not cowardice prudence learn the difference in the dark gooch cracked his knuckles i still vote we find out whos behind this and destroy them and by destroy you mean call the papers and the cops and put them away forever i mean making sure they can never threaten anyone again by means fair or foul i cant support anything illegal for gods sakes im a judge whitman please the court of gooch is eminently fair these people put themselves at risk when they threatened you you would have been entirely within your rights if youd had a gun and shot the bastard selfdefense think of this as extended ongoing selfdefense no i remind you that you could have chosen to run to the police you did not you came to me do you expect me to sit with thumb in ass while my friend is threatened you knew i would take action i just dont want anyone killed gooch for gods sakes you sell me short every time whitman i never said i would kill anyone you never said you wouldnt you can hardly open up a can of certified highoctane whoopass on these people and then start setting boundaries gooch stood and stretched ill sleep under the stars even if theyre playing hideandseek tonight i have my own ideas on how to move forward whit said but i want to think them through then well talk in the morning gooch pulled a sleeping bag from a kit on deck and unrolled it stretched out his big body on it without getting inside good night your honor good night a pause thanks gooch i mean really thanks gooch turned his face in the direction of the sleeping porpoises youre welcome whit went below to the guest stateroom and climbed into a berth the draining of adrenaline throughout his body hit him hard his head dropped onto the pillow and his last waking thought was he had come as close to death tonight as he ever had and did he even want this stupid justice of the peace job anymore or did he even deserve the job the honorable whit mosley fell asleep before he could decide heather farrell stood in the dark curve of little mischief beach she knew sam hated surprises he was such a careful thinker but money was money and they could use another five thousand new orleans was expensive sam never worried two seconds over cash but heather had searched in trash bins for halfeaten sandwiches burgers doubling as housefly helipads and fries cold and clotted with grease only she had the money sense no amount of money lasted forever and five thousand bucks was worth waiting on the cold dark beach in the middle of the night heather eased down on the sand holding her flashlight in the dark of the beach she would be hard to find just like she and sam would be once they got to new orleans they could rent a cheap room near the quarter under invented names and nab some weed and lay in bed and smoke spend whole days making love stopping only to wander among the tourists devour crawfish and boudin and drink icy jax beer it was funny she wouldnt have touched a younger guy back in lubbock but travel broadened a girl sam was different than the pimpled boys confident and funny and making love he did not act or feel like a kid but a fullgrown man sweet and kind and smart he had it all worked out where his mother and grandmother would have to let him go and have his life he had convinced heather his outlandish plan would work just fine shoes crunched against the crushed shells along the lip of the beach her thumb moved to the toggle on the flashlight hand over the money she nearly growled as a joke like she was robbing the guy but then she thought he might not appreciate humor he didnt smile much funny the way people were the way you could never guess about them what lay under a skin heather a voice called softly behind her she wasnt afraid she knew he was coming and she stood and dusted damp sand off her jeans she clicked on her flashlight the cone of light illuminating her worn sneakers hey a soft hiss of a laugh you can turn that off lets get out of here i could use some coffee no this wont take long all right she said do you have the money yes five thousand dollars as we agreed and you and sam hubble leave town the guy was so stupid he had no idea she and sam were planning on leaving town anyway and here he was bribing her to do exactly what she wanted its going to screw over his grandmother in the middle of this election heather said in her toughchick voice you sure thats what you want i want the man said ill miss you though and ill miss you too you never looked down on me of course not a pause the only sound her breathing and the soft swish of the waves i like you heather a coyness tinged his voice and she wondered if numerous unsavory strings were attached to this sum of money on the road a car passed loud jazz blasting from the windows and the man held himself perfectly still until the car was gone the police he said they questioned you pretty thoroughly about finding pete hubbles body yeah but they didnt bug me too bad i could handle them did you really not see anything hear anything when you went on petes boat suddenly her stomach roiled and a prickle rose along her arms her legs the small of her back she just wanted the money and she wanted off this dark beach a whirl of what was going to be a narrow little room in new orleans street curbs reeking of beer blowing sugar off a hot beignet onto sams face for fun zydeco drifting from a hundred open bar doors her pockets heavy with money sams breath cool against her ear after loving flashed through her mind her throat ached there was nothing to hear i mean pete was already dead he killed himself yes but the police doubt you she blinked no they dont they know you lied to them i didnt lie he was dead when i got there and you saw nothing suspicious heard nothing suspicious nothing to see nothing to hear she said more annoyed than afraid just between you and me were you going to make a movie for him she heard a creeping breathlessness in his tone what she said no too bad i wouldve liked to have seen him fucking you heather blanched just give me my money yes darling he said and the knife swung up hard burying itself in her stomach deep his hand slammed over her mouth heathers eyes widened in agony and disbelief and blood bubbled out of her from the wound and surging past her lips sam oh jesus sam help me and then she tried to scream for her mother and then the knife was gone and she didnt even feel the flick across her throat but she slid into a strange darkness quite different from night the blade held her close against him smelling peanut butter crackers on her breath feeling her death shuddering through him then ended the embrace heather farrell fell bonelessly onto the sand blood soaked his clothes but after all that was very easily remedied he wiped the knife on heathers jeans he pulled a large folded square of plastic from the back of his pants it was warm from resting against his butt like the knife had been carefully he rolled the body onto the plastic sheet and wrapped her in the showercurtain shroud he carried her toward the far end of the beach the fishing skiff bobbed in the shallow waves he dumped the body into the boat grabbed a small shovel and a plastic bucket and dug up the bloodsodden sand he motored the skiff into deeper water and aimed the prow across the heart of st leo bay he trembled he really had nothing against her didnt really want her the way he desired his darlings but now it was done and a shaky rush of triumph dried his mouth again he was okay again no one had seen again for all the times he felt dumb as a stump lost among other people this he could do and do it okay the blade steered the skiff out into the night deep into the bay he spotted a rather grand fishing trawler anchored in the middle halfway between port leo and santa margarita island but its lights were down and he gave it a wide berth the clouds lay heavy and low over the sky like a second shroud blocking out the clear stars and he moved unseen on the waters at nine thursday morning claudia supercharged by a large chocolate croissant from an art district bakery and a double espresso stronger than gulf crude waited to interview jabez jones about the marcy ballew case david stood in the small bare study hands on trim hips inspecting the photos of jabez bodyslamming a thickbarreled antagonist during his pro wrestling days davids uniform needed pressing and she wondered if he wore it as a silent youfleddomesticbliss rebuke im pretty sure all this wrestlings faked david said delford had called her last night asking her to work with david per his request are you pissed at me or what she had asked why are you putting me through the wringer first you cut me from the hubble case now youre inflicting my ex on me im just expecting you to work with the man its a whole hour out of your day claudia just do it she wondered if the pay was better in rockport or port aransas than port leo jabez jones entered filling khaki shorts and a crisp tshirt that read be strong i samuel his thighs looked like wooden blocks and a light sheen of sweat coated his face morning workout or morning prayer she wondered he mopped at his face with a hand towel hello deputy power he shook davids hand warmly and nodded toward claudia detective salazar were blessed again with your presence carrot juice smoothie we probably even have coffee although im not fond of polluting my temple with stimulants his temple but jabezs expression remained perfectly serious no thanks claudia said david shook his head well i could use a protein shake jabez said why dont yall come with me and we can talk in the kitchen they followed him to a kitchen where a young woman sliced cantaloupe with the precision of a jeweler she gave jabez a comehither grin but her smile froze when she saw claudia and david claudia thought where do i know you from the girls slender doeeyed face looked vaguely familiar she moved with a complete awareness of her small body setting down the knife with a shrug of shortsnug hip turning from the counter and leaning against it slightly to bring her breasts to full tilt against her shirt good morning she said rachel would you mind excusing us jabez said just a moment claudia sidestepped around jabez she held up the picture of marcy ballew have you seen this young woman rachel glanced at jabez who shrugged she studied the flyer claudia remembered her then the girl from the volleyball game when she and whit had interviewed jabez before no ive never seen her rachel said thanks claudia said jabez nodded so rachel left claudia noticed david watching her exit it was probably inspiring to a newly single guy and she thought quit it quit looking at her jabez startled her may i see the picture of who youre looking for yes she handed it to jabez her name is marcy we think she was in this area recently david said jabez handed claudia back the photo after a blinks worth of looking i dont know her her mother told us that she was a big fan of your wrestling career and your new show claudia said the adams apple rose slightly in his oak of a throat a fan well im sorry i dont know her then and sorry i cant be of further help to you claudia smiled i dont know about deputy power but i think i will take one of those shakes you offered if you dont mind im afraid i skipped breakfast then we can ask you a few other quick questions jabezs smile was as tight as his shirt certainly melon or strawberry i load them with vitamin mix and wheat germ as well it would nullify the chocolate and the espresso ill have whatever youre having nothing for me thanks david said fruit tears up my stomach real bad jabez turned to fix the beverages do you take in runaways here she asked jabez pushed aside the cantaloupe that rachel had been slicing and began to peel a banana he peeled a second one and upended both in a blender then he began to wash and slice several strawberries people come to our camp for succor for comfort i believe they are safer with us than on the road dont you i dont know much about what all you do here we pray we minister he dumped the cut berries in with the bananas poured in some milk and ice and thumbed on the blender claudia waited until the pureeing stopped this girls id turned up alongside a road two miles outside port leo she didnt come here he sprinkled wheat germ and shaved carrots and some other powder claudia hoped wasnt strychnine into frosted glasses and poured the blended froth over them he rummaged in the industrialsize fridge and held up an egg to her with a raised eyebrow she shook her head and he cracked the raw egg into his frosted glass she heard david gulp jabez garnished her glass with a slice of cantaloupe and handed it to her thank you the drink tasted sweet on her tongue but had the texture of cement mix jabez gestured for them to follow him they went into an adjoining living roomcumtraining center if jesus preached poverty jabez wasnt listening a stateoftheart nautilus machine towered in the corner expensive contemporary furniture danish and out of character with the victorian exterior of the home adorned the room a widescreen television dominated one corner photos of jabezs glory days in the wrestling ring covered the wall in one he held aloft a weighted championship belt and snarled at the screaming audience of modernday gladiator junkies one small cross hung on the wall fitted in between a pair of ringside wrestling photos no pictures of jesus the gentle shepherd wed like to show her picture to your followers david said they dont follow me they follow jesus followers makes it sound like a cult well david said pleasantly no offense meant you start a new church offer seekers new answers to old questions find success with it and then people question you you glorify the body though claudia said he flexed the muscles in one arm we consider our bodies temples to the lord since we are sculpted in his image our own bodies are reflected in the body of christ that the church forms he ran a hand over the muscle in his arm like it was sacred velvet a priest admiring his vestments you certainly have a lot of young women here she said im sure there are many young women at your own church claudia smiled but they dont live with father ohearn or father aguilar i dont sleep with these young women if thats what youre implying you just focus on having female disciples that it david asked his gaze hardened the way i bring god to them appeals to them just as a prayer book appeals to an episcopalian or bowing toward mecca appeals to a muslim youre sure the ballew girl didnt make her way here david asked i will happily swear on a stack of bibles that ive never laid eyes on her face before you are the only connection weve yet found between this girl and port leo david said bluntly jabez drained his shake in such a pronounced swallow it reminded claudia of a python downing a rat you have no cause to bother us this girl had no reason to be in encina county that we know of except for you claudia set down her drink on a glasstopped table im sorry but i feel like youre not being completely honest with us ive given you no reason for doubt i wonder she said hoping to shake the tree you have this missing girl who might have come here to see you youre seen arguing with pete hubble on his boat and he is now dead i suppose it might be coincidence i suppose it might not david shot her a questioning look with the barest shrug of his shoulders jabez crossed his buffed arms i dont get easily intimidated jesus is on my side in my heart in my brain i can withstand satan comparatively youre not that frightening satan cant get a search warrant reverend and satan cant put every aspect of your operation under a microscope how do you think your television flock would react to news of you being investigated claudia asked on what charge ive cooperated fully he laughed i might expect this of a provincial buffoon like delford spires but i always marked you as fairer and more intelligent ms salazar claudia shook her head so why do i believe im going to have to lean on you very hard to get the truth he smiled beatifically lean away i have a great pr firm in austin theyve already laid out a plan for any crisis arrest investigation scandal not that its likely she let the silence hang fine anything else deputy power david shook his head a numb look on his face loved the shake claudia said go with god jabez said she wanted to slap the sure smirk off his face they got into davids cruiser and shut the doors david didnt start the car you know claud i miss that little spark of tough you got he said you said you wouldnt do this talk about us sorry i just admired the way you wouldnt let him walk all over you a group of jabez disciples jogged past the parking lot legs lifting into perfect beat mouths moving to a chant of prayer i knew i shouldve joined a gym david said i saw the lustful stare you gave those arms of his you saw nothing claudia said great david was teasing her now bantering as david drove down the palmlined road leading to the encampment and halfway down to the highway the girl rachel stepped out of the growth waving her arms david stopped the cruiser and claudia lowered her window cops right can we talk a minute the girl asked her voice shook sure claudia said not here someplace else david let the girl into the back of the car rachel ducked in and pointed at a side road curving off to the right pull in down there so no one sees us hes gonna be looking for me soon enough david obeyed claudia turned to rachel do you know that girl in the picture no never seen her but i know pete hubble what petes a friend from california i did a couple of movies with him this year and he lent me some cash claudia studied the young womans face and saw anew the vixen clinging to pete on the cover of one of the tapes cleopatras love slaves done up as a horny queen of the nile pulling a rubber asp through her cleavage and kissing the snakes head hadnt one of the stars had the silly name of rachel pleasure different hair but the same girl the same wide blue eyes the same elfin face rachel hunkered down in the seat just listen okay if im gone long mary magdalene will kick my ass bitch already hates me were listening claudia said pete wanted dirt on jabez jones and he asked me to help him said hed pay me what i make in a months work doing flicks i said sure he flew me out here and i checked into the camp her voice wavered we dont get to watch television except for jabezs show or listen to radio or read papers but last night i was in jabezs room and heard them say on the tv news pete was dead he shot himself claudia said but pete was supposed to get me out they watch us like hawks didnt velvet know you were here claudia asked rachel shook her head he didnt want velvet to know about his business plus she doesnt like me too well im a way better actress than she is um well get you out david said you want to go now look if jabez knows pete planted me here no way am i staying but i dont have the evidence pete wanted what were you looking for claudia asked rachel bit her lip pete thought jabez knew who killed his brother years ago he thought maybe jabez had made all his money by keeping his mouth shut or maybe was in on his brothers death i couldnt find anything about that though but i did find something else dope do tell david said i made sure i got close to him once i got here rachel peered out the back windshield as though the hounds had been released thats why mary magdalene hates my guts im the new favorite he says he doesnt sleep with his followers claudia said right he was screwing me last night while the news was on i had to keep lying there while he huffed and puffed and watched himself in the damn mirror i thought i was going to die when i heard them talk about pete hes rough about sex too somethings not right with him let me tell you he likes to snort a little coke especially when he and i are about to get busy he keeps it in his bedroom david revved the engine if we get you out right now will he flush the cocaine i dont know im due for phone duty for the prayer line in thirty minutes theyll look for me claudia frowned can you sit it out so he doesnt suspect and let us get a search warrant rachel nodded if you think it will help she got out of the car but hurry and you got to get me out of here when you get back we will i promise claudia said i promise david backed out onto the road floored the accelerator and peeled down the road toward the highway jesus claudia jesus this is huge he roared holy hell claudia thought oh no way was pete gonna kill himself with that girl stuck at the camp no way now whit can rule for suicide lying on the bunk in the thin morning light whit opened the file of clippings patsy duchamp had given him yesterday he heard gooch clopping about on the deck they had already scarfed a quick breakfast of yesterdays doughnuts and were chugging back to shore where whit would begin his great judicial charade and try not to get himself or anyone else killed a note from patsy was stuck on the thick file of clips whit sorry if its overkill but the lady who did this is a retired military librarian and lets just say she is a completist hope this is helpful you owe me a pitcher of shiner bock patsy completist was right the woman had found practically every mention of corey hubble whit skipped the first clippings looking for the ones specifically related to coreys disappearance the first articles were entirely straightforward except for the inherent lurid appeal of headlines like senators son missing or hubble suspected runaway and it was the same information claudia had shared with him from the police report the tone of the quotes most of which were from delford and only a couple from lucinda went from fear of corey being a victim of foul play to a seeming certainty that he had run away no indication pete or anyone else was suspected of killing corey the story garnered fewer inches as time passed no new developments emerged he set the clippings from during and after coreys disappearance aside and went back through the rest one was lucindas husbands obituary with corey simply listed as a survivor many were articles about lucindas original campaign for the texas senate picturing her stumping for votes with her two sons pete beamed happy and proud corey wore the smile his mother told him to in a photo showing his mother on election night when she narrowly won corey smiled in stunned amazement as though victory was an unexpected pleasure a few more clippings offered coverage of legislation lucinda hubble sponsored he had stopped to read one article dated a month before coreys disappearance about lucindas fiery stand on nursing home reform when his gaze drifted to a picture on the far side of the page it was a common photo for the port leo mariner proud fisherman hoisting aloft a sizable catch the paper actively courted showoffs to promote port leo as an anglers paradise four goofily grinning teenagers held high a trio of big bulletshaped fish the caption read tight lines for teens corey hubble and friends caught a trio of beautiful red boogers and while out on st leo bay on nov not pictured are the many biggies that got away the kids used dead shrimp pictured l to r corey hubble and marian duchamp of port leo thomas deloache jr and eddie gardner of houston whit stared at the photo he tucked the clippings back into the envelope then he went up on the deck to help gooch dock at the golden gulf marina after gooch gave him sound advice on how to avoid assassination throughout the day watch your ass something constant and scream fire if attacked whit headed for his car the thead and the docked boats smelled of sharp diesel fuel brewing coffee and the sugarypiss tang of spilled white zinfandel he watched terns arcing over the gently rocking boats scouring for generous breakfast scraps his cell phone chirped whit mosley here hi my name is kevin mckinnon you had sent me an email about pete hubble a low baritone calm an accountants voice kevin creator of the online temple of appreciation web site dedicated to pete yes kevin hello thank you for calling back yeah well what did you want no point in hemming and hawing im sorry to be the bearer of bad news pete has passed away silence youre not funny im afraid im quite serious im the justice of the peace here in port leo texas petes hometown he died monday night im supervising the inquest into his death more silence oh jesus oh god the pain in his voice the raw loss stopped whit whit waited a moment letting the man regain composure i saw a posting on your site that you had talked with him this week yes how did he die whit told him briefly without mentioning the suicide note kevins low baritone became a breathy agonized mewl if this is a joke its in really bad taste under other circumstances an amateur pornographer chiding him on taste might have been good for a laugh over drinks with georgie and gooch deep grief colored kevins voice sounding as true as the grief of the hubbles im so terribly sorry but it would be helpful if you could tell me what you talked about i want some confirmation of this mister you fax me a death certificate how about if you call me at my office at the encina county courthouse ill give you the switchboard number you can talk to the operator and know youre really talking to a judge the offer disarmed him oh shit this is real you talked to him in the hours before he died did he sound suicidal hardly he sounded elated hed gotten the funding for his movie his regular movie did he mention where this money was coming from no i guess he couldnt get the producers who regularly funded his porn work to back this movie he said he needed a half million and hed gotten it whit kept his voice under control he had landed a halfmillion dollars kevin coughed why would he kill himself if he had gotten the money that makes no sense he didnt mention who his investor was im sure i cant believe hes gone whit wondered what was pete to you for gods sakes a picture on a computer or more forgive me kevin but can you tell me what your relationship was with pete just a friend yeah i dug his movies i dug watching him he was hotter than hell man but he was straight as an arrow there was nothing between us he liked that i had done a web site about him he was cool thought it helped sell more videos for him and it didnt cost him a cent did he ever mention his brother corey to you whit remembered that the one internet search hed done on corey hubble pointed him toward kevins site oddly enough yeah he told me the whole sad story once i posted a page about his brother on the site a few months ago you know thinking to help a picture of corey details about when he vanished a number you could call if you had information petes answering service did he ever mention any of these names to you junior deloache or eddie gardner or jabez jones no sorry kevin said jesus now i got to write an obituary where the hell do i start kevin thanks if theres anything else you remember yeah wait the money he joked about it i figured his financier had just given him a check but he joked about how heavy the bag was maybe he got the money in cash thank you kevin thanks so much condolence seemed even more awkward now than it had with faith but he tried please know how sorry i am for you losing your friend thanks thanks i got to go kevin hung up whit hurried to his car made sure no mobsters hunked behind his tires and fired up the engine the car didnt explode the day was off to a positive start why would anyone give a notalent porn hack a half million in cash to make a movie another hack whit thought junior deloache his phone buzzed again where the hell are you claudia demanded i need a search warrant and i need it fast you arent going to get away with this mary magdalene screamed claudia ignored her and watched two county deputies search the back closet of jabezs master suite it would be helpful if you would just tell us where jabez is david said his eyes shone brightly in excitement mary magdalene flinched he was called away on the lords business one of davids fellow deputies came in the room shook his head no sign of jones on the grounds cars gone so where is he mary claudia asked i dont know youre his righthand woman and you dont know claudia crossed her arms suspecting that jabez leaving mary behind to feel the heat was an increasingly tender subject so i guess he just figured you could take whatever rap was coming thats really christian of him what a guy mary magdalene trembled but not from fear a deputy a lanky young vietnamese man carried an old worn maple box from the closet inside was a thick bible inside the bible in neatly hollowedout trenches of scripture lay three vials of white powder david daubed a bit on his tongue tasted and nodded at claudia the pause that refreshes cocaine boys and girls claudia turned to mary magdalene help us mary or we cant help you when the judge starts throwing books your way where is jabez mary magdalene fell to one knee her mouth twisting in silent prayer start searching the other barracks david ordered and lets call the dea in corpus and we need to get an apb out on jones she knows where he is claudia insisted pointing at the prayerful mary she knows and shes mary magdalene exploded from the floor and piledrove into claudia sending them both sprawling out into the small hallway thick fingers with sharp nails like pikes dug into claudias windpipe and a fist slammed against her left eye claudia rammed upward with her knee finding the softness between marys legs and she grabbed marys thumb and bent back hard a scream and then the hands were yanked away the other officers pinning mary on her stomach cuffing her in an instant claudia climbed to her feet david helping her her shoulder ached and the skin around her eye was numbed mary screamed imprecations not the sweet language of theology but the salty poetry from her days on the street im fine claudia said before david could start fawning over her hurts she knelt by mary you just complicated your life about a hundred times im starting to think youre not particularly bright heres a chance to get smart mary where is jabez his enemies shall lick the dust she hollered her face purpling in rage youll die just like the trash does yall the ones licking dust or snorting it david said die like the trash does claudia asked or die like the trash did delford spires shook his head i hope everythings nice and clean about how yall got that warrant and did that search he pointed at claudias eye thats gonna go shiner its not like i was having my photo done soon for employee of the month stiff silence so that leaves us delford with an awful interesting situation claudia said pete hubble placed this girl in jabezs camp i cant imagine he would go to all that trouble then blithely kill himself delford sipped a cold coffee i cant explain away a suicide note claudia especially one that has just petes and sams prints on it his tone was final dismissive and he fixed her with a glower designed to make her crumple she fired a salvo back tired and achy and sick of being railroaded i assume youve spoken with judge mosley about the coroners findings and the problems with the bagging of the hands yes i have delford said eddie gardner reddened claudia you saw the body with me gardner said i didnt screw up the bagging i didnt say you did she said evenly im just telling you what the me and judge mosley said delford tweezed a mustache end into sharp perfection eddie review the chain of custody for the body make sure we can account for the bag damage probably the goddamned mortuary crew tore em yes sir gardner said one other thing on hubble since we have a time of death we can locate the boats that came in and out of golden gulf during the period since real shame was at the end of the thead claudia and i already have accounted for five of the six boats that departed and all the boats that arrived no one saw anything helpful and this last boat a cruiser called miss folly owner lives up near new orleans and treks all over the gulf coast he didnt file a float plan a float plan was the maritime equivalent of a flight plan required of commercial vessels optional for personal craft lets get that boat found delford said to eddie i dont want the press suggesting were not being thorough claudia lets talk after gardner had shut the door behind him delford folded his hands on his desk i noticed you checked out the corey hubble file find anything interesting no not really youre still pissed about being pulled as the lead no its your decision claud come on i know you too well youre madder than a wet bee but listen i want gardner handling this like he did the bags i did bruise your ego well now a crinkle a near smile crossed his face point taken hubbles just about over soon as whit gets off his ass and issues a damned ruling focus on the ballew case its really the sheriffs case not ours claudia said unless youre scheming with mine and davids parents to stick us back together delford laughed the low tremble that she knew and she felt a sudden warmth again toward him this contrary whimridden old fart who could either advance you fast in the department or mire you down forever your mama scares me claudia and i would be reluctant to cross her i just want you to provide the sheriffs office with support consider yourself loaned to them and therefore out of your hair claudia thought so you go put some ice on that eye or a nice steak delford said claudia went back to her office a whirl of paperwork covered her desk two new burglary reports to follow up on a shoplifting case gardner came in a few minutes later swigging a dr pepper he shut the office door and leaned against it arent you clever he said pardon me you screw up so you start trying to make me look bad youre mistaken youre gunning for me claudia maybe you damaged those evidence bags without me seeing oh get over yourself he shot an unexpected missile across her bow you think because youre mexican and a woman you should get all the good cases just because youre an idiot she said sweetly doesnt mean you should get all the bad ones eddie gardner leaned toward her and growled i bet you scratch when you fuck she stood get away from me and dont you ever talk to me like that again he stepped back a wounded look on his face i dont know what youre talking about detective salazar he opened the door and left she sat bile polluting the back of her throat wondering why autocracy and viciousness had suddenly fouled this perfectly nice police department delford had turned tyrannical gardner who she always suspected was a pig had gone from mildly amusing to notolerance disgusting she went down to the kitchen to get a glass of ice water she found patrolman fox snacking on a butterfinger bar chocolate gummed the corners of his mouth whats up bill she asked and he swallowed his candy working hard for eddie i wore my fingers to the bone phoning on the hubble case whats going on with that she dumped ice into a glass and filled it from the faucet fox shrugged i called all the numbers on pete hubbles phone records he knew some strange people let me tell you most of them seemed to be people that he knew through his um film work the milkbreathed baptist boy could hardly say the word pornography i made notes i havent typed them up yet claudia picked up his scrawled pieces of paper in the last days of his life pete had called a couple of porn directors and a screenwriter in legit film hed called his mother several times his exwife three times there were a couple of calls to the placid harbor nursing home the home davids grandfather lived at down by little mischief beach and that reminded her that she wanted to have another talk with heather farrell she wondered who pete knew there and still the number in far east texas in the little hamlet of missatuck the one shed tried the morning after petes death and fox had similarly gotten no answer the phone company said that the number belonged to one kathy breaux pete had called her four times in the three days before his death claudia went back to her office and picked up the phone she dialed the missatuck number it was now disconnected and no new number listed the afternoon light slanted through the tilted blinds bars of light and dark lay against whits desk for once cleared of the usual fan of papers and the halffull coffee cup whit sat across from claudia still in his judges robe an askew collar of yellow tropicalprint shirt peeking out from the sober black he had finished with traffic court by two and shed given him a quick synopsis of the developments with jabez jones i dont care much about that suicide note claudia said but theres no way i believe pete put rachel into jabezs camp as a spy then decided to kill himself whit loosened a stray thread from the throat of his robe did rachel say shed told pete about the drugs shed seen actually no she hadnt talked to him since she arrived at the camp it was too risky they thought so lets say pete found out another way jabez was dealing dealing whit said he clearly had more than he could personally use gives jabez a motive i suppose whit shrugged claudia cocked her head you sound like youve graduated from the delford spires school of lowkey investigation so delfords finally made it to your hallowed shit list ive made room for him gardners king she told him about her confrontation with eddie gardner be careful of him very careful whit said hes a mouth i can handle him seriously claudia whit said and she saw he was dead serious the sharpeyed glare on his face was the one he usually reserved for magistrating repeat offenders and irksome litigants his mouth twitched slightly hes trouble whys he on your shit list honorable just dont cross him okay trust me whats going on nothing tired inquest is tomorrow at one i decided to call a full one in the courtroom instead of just issuing a ruling of death she supposed the political capital of a highprofile death was too good for him to waste right before an election sure fine ive got my notes ready to testify he dug into his desk drawer and handed her a phone number this is a number pete used in california with an answering service it might be interesting to see who in port leo or in texas called him havent you been the busy bee claudia said thanks ill have fox check this ive got to go promise me youll be careful about what just be careful all right sure she walked back across the street to the police station wondering who had wedged the coal lump in whits ass whit watched claudia cross the street a sudden whip of wind from the bay mussing her dark hair she tucked the errant strands behind her ear and darted inside the police station he let the blinds fall that morning he had called each of his five brothers he heard updates on teething nieces and upcoming software releases and the casual cruelties of writer critique groups but nothing of bullets of shady characters lurking in darkened driveways ready to make innocents pay for whit being the wrong judge in the wrong place at the wrong time he ended each conversation with a story about random violence he claimed to have seen on tv and begged them all to be extra careful he had trudged through the days duties of signing warrants a brief truancy court and a long and maddening traffic court session tomorrow was the inquest he didnt have much time he picked up the phone velvet its whit mosley i need a favor from you do you still have a key to real shame i do she sounded lazy sleepy as though just awakening for the day if she was he wondered what shed been up to all night id like to stop by and borrow it if i may the cops have a key id like to borrow yours she was silent for a moment well yeah thats okay ive got an errand to run first but ill be over in an hour or so ill see you then judgie he hung up doffed the robe and in his beachwear shirt and khaki shorts and sandals headed over to the trashy west end of port leo the blade watched the little waves surge up little mischief beach the sand flat wet and clean the damp fine air the ocean exhaling smelled of salt and freshness no sign on the beach heather farrell had ever been there no blood on the sands not a gaptoed footprint to mark her passage he turned away from the water and the little voice tinged with his mother that whispered and berated in the curvy hollow of his ear roared do you think she only had the clothes on her worthless back he stopped he turned toward the beach past the gentle crescent of sand into the parkland was a motte of live oaks ringed with high grass hadnt he watched her there once stretching against the towerofpisa benttrees scratching her foot she had to have camped nearby he bolted along the stretch of sand up through the bluestems and the grasses panic drumming its ratatat in his chest mamas voice laughing at him hiding in the wind he searched for a half hour among the askew oaks and the tall grasses he found only a narrow rectangle of crushed bluestems where a womans sleeping bag might have lain recently a discarded peanut butter crackers wrapper fluttered caught in the tall grass the trailer park was named rainbows end the pot of gold however was nowhere in sight he knocked on the wrong door and a sleepy elderly woman told him marian duchamp made her home in trailer number six the woman pointed over to an immaculately maintained trailer a veritable palace among the weedchoked lots whit wondered why anyone would voluntarily live on the texas coast in a mobile home one hurricane one mild tropical storm roaring ashore could move the trailer half a county inland in small fragments whit knocked once on the door inside an afternoon talk shows theme jazzily trilled the door lurched open a woman who should have looked younger than she did wearing frayed cutoffs and a faded corpus christi ice rays tshirt tottered in the doorway marian duchamp maybe she blinked against the bright afternoon light im whit mosley the justice of the peace for encina county im conducting a death inquest and id like to ask you a few questions um okay um what about lunch had apparently been of the liquid sort corey hubble she stared a friend of yours who disappeared several years ago whit prompted marian duchamp digested this request she was clearly drunk a wine bottle rested against her hip french beaujolais surprisingly not your typical trailerpark fare georgie the walking shedatabase had provided him with the local lore on marian a goodlooking tomboy and jock up until the last year of junior high when her father drowned in a boating accident the dead father had reached from the grave to drag his daughter down marian duchamp had raced into a selfdestructive spiral of drugs booze and petty theft dropout from school lived on her mothers mercy georgie had said just a shame corey yes she spoke slowly can we talk about him well im drunk but you know im not out in public judge so i dont think that im in the wrong this time im not here to arrest or bug you okay as long as youre not planning on driving anywhere today are you dont have a car so i guess not she laughed a rough unpleasant guffaw and the wine wafted on her breath she contemplated him with a half smile i remember you one of the mosley boys yeah the youngest at once he almost regretted his words forever the baby of a certain notorious family but when five older brothers had already speeded and fished and slept and drunk a path through the towns consciousness cutting your own distinctive way got progressively harder yeah i knew your brother mark she said her smile warmed not quite sultry but at least friendlier come on in a sober feminine hand clearly maintained this space goldtrimmed family photos a small milk bottle holding fresh carnations on the dinner table a sofa with neatly arranged pillows embroidered with platitudes like bloom where youre planted and princess of quite a bit dust would not dare show its unsightly face the home appeared as pristine as a freshly tended hotel suite a stand of wine bottles emptied stood along the breakfast bar whit read the labels cakebread la crema cuvaison not a dollar vintage in the bunch you have a nice trailer whit said i found quality help marian smirked and you know good help is really hard to find im ever so lucky have a seat you on duty do judges do duty want a glass of quality red her gaze drifted across his throat his chest no thank you he sat on the couch and she tumbled into the recliner he knew shed once been attractive in a lanky way but now her skin looked sallow her belly was a little wine barrel and patchy shadow new applied over old caked her eyelids whats mark doing these days she asked hes living in austin still single getting an mfa in creative writing at ut hes finished a novel and is working on a collection of poems well ladida fancy fancy fancy poems she paused i know some words that rhyme she confessed this with a tinge of embarrassment as though she had neglected a gift handed her by the gods whit let silence sit between them for twenty seconds and marian fidgeted and half smiled at him i understand you knew corey hubble when you were kids whit said ancient history now like vietnam and the renaissance his brother pete died recently and he was working on a film about coreys disappearance were interested to know who he talked to about corey we being who the police we being me really he suspected she had no liking for the police the inquest determines if someone is responsible for the death of another the voters are my boss i work for the county you dont work for delford spires he wouldnt hire me to wipe his ass whit said marian the wild teen would have no love for a longtime police chief im not one of his favorite people marian abruptly got up from the recliner and refilled her glass with beaujolais not the gentle arc of a pour more of a rough slosh spilling the wine she licked wine from her hand then drank half the glass down then refilled again before she tottered back to the recliner so this is upsetting to you or youre just thirsty whit said theres nothing to tell about corey hubble pete didnt think so yeah and now hes gonna be crammed in a coffin for eternity she shuddered no thanks whit was silent marian duchamp in this state could hardly be considered a credible witness at least in court but instead he got up found a glass poured in a small trickle and sat again i remember corey you know he said i knew him but not well watching him sample the wine she visibly relaxed she traced the ring of the glass with a fingernail he was jealous of you she said with a soft laugh does that surprise you sure does im nothing special well you had a mess of brothers you always had family around corey didnt have nobody after his daddy died pete was the pet and his mama just wanted to go write laws and fuck around in austin serving the people my ass didnt he have you as a friend she laughed friend theres a nice clean word we fucked now and then she watched him for a reaction to her crudity he ever hit now and then she giggled hey i hit him back he was a mean little shit when he got crossed you ever hear of him roughing up other women she tongued the rim of her glass i was the only one stupid enough to date him so what do you think happened to him marian i really dont know she sipped some wine not looking at him why should i tell you anything anyway well i need your help and youre the only one who can help me no one else will thats a lousy reason you mentioned delford spires before she shrugged you think delford did a crappy job of investigating coreys disappearance she laughed not a funny or kind laugh that was the fox watching the freaking henhouse why corey hated delford spiress guts didnt every teenager in town whit cajoled laughing tasting a little more of his wine i was in the terrorist crew that painted his house pink you remember that she brayed laughter recognizing the widely loved or at least widely discussed prank played long ago on the police chief so what was coreys beef with delford i think she said slowly corey took off because delford caught wind of what he was planning which was well corey was probably kidding you know loudmouthed kids but he told me he was gonna kill delford spires she held her wineglass very still in both hands whit kept equally still how did he plan on doing this she shrugged he had his daddys shotgun whit watched her she stared at the hem of her cutoffs why do you think he told you this marian just to impress me he was ten pounds of shit in a dixie cup why did he want to shoot delford i dont know he never told me why so i never took him seriously i mean look he couldnt have been serious delford spires is still alive but corey probably isnt he said and she burst into tears you think delford killed corey she cried she shrugged shit i shouldnt have said anything shit delford might be many things political pushy too goodoldboy for a changing world but whit didnt believe delford was a coldblooded killer especially a killer of children why didnt you tell anyone this i did coreys mama i was afraid to talk to the police afraid of delford i mean i didnt know what to think so i told the senator i phoned her and she thanked me and nothing ever came of it you know i figured corey would come home and she didnt want him into trouble with delford marian duchamp got up with overdone precision stumbled to the kitchen and freshened her glass we build these little worlds for ourselves whit thought remembering what velvet had said and then we never get to move out do you remember two friends of coreys from houston a boy named eddie gardner another boy named junior deloache think so they summered down here sometimes and fished in the fall on weekends junior always had lots of cash and dope to share she remembered too late whit was a judge and murmured well i dont do anything illegal anymore okay what about eddie just some lameass friend of juniors and now he was a detective on the port leo police force a very recent hire you seen either of them around lately she shook her head not in years not since corey took off the door to the trailer opened and a tall fiftyish woman peeked her head inside her hair was pulled tight into a proper gray bun and she wore a cleaning smock festooned with a brightly colored grinning cartoon chicken waving a spatula she carried a grocery sack oh excuse me hon i didnt know you were entertaining the lady smiled with maternal grace at whit as though about to pat whits head and offer him a sugar cookie oh come on in mama marian said this is whit mosley hes a judge whit helped mama duchamp tote grocery sacks one bag clinked full of bottles of wine merlot chardonnay pinot noir all of it the better stuff he put the bags on the kitchen counter without comment and mama duchamp murmured that shed just brought some refreshments for her sweet baby girl and oh shed tend to getting those bottles put up have some red mama marian called perhaps later mama duchamp said i was just going whit said he thanked marian for her time she blinked as if confused as to why shed been crying why he was here with her mother in the room marian seemed sunnier as though reassured like a puppy that the milk dish brimmed full mama duchamp stepped outside with him shutting the door on marians hollered slurred goodbyes i know youre a busy man with a lot of doors to knock on mama duchamp said good luck in the election i hope you win i dont trust people named buddy its like they want to be your friend before you even know them thanks but i actually wasnt here campaigning i was asking marian about corey hubble he could smell the wry odor of throat lozenges on her breath why she says corey was planning to commit a murder before he vanished oh my lands marian doesnt know what she says she doesnt think its hard to think when youre drinking all day mama duchamps smile twitched shes nervous it soothes her do you do this all the time bring her what she needs to live her long narrow hands smoothed the chicken apron marian doesnt fend well for herself she messes up its just easier if i arrange things for her my brothers and i used to do that for my father he was a drunk dont you presume to stand here and lecture me for gods sakes arent you tired of helping her along whit asked she brought a hand to her lipsticked mouth tired of it my god marian could be lying out in an alley scrounging on a beach selling herself for loose change this way i can keep an eye on her in a cage nicely gilded by the glint from wine bottles i suppose its one way to be sure the kids stay in touch he felt a sudden fury with this woman letting her daughter drown by inches in scrubbed comfort ill bet her livers like wet tissue paper do you see the yellow tint in her eyes thats death creeping in jesus marians about my age she wont have long get her some help get off our property im certainly not going to vote for you now and i doubt that any member of the garden club will either once i make a few phone calls i dont want your vote mrs duchamp whit said her face crimsoned and she fled to the trailer she shut the door quietly whit roared out of the trailer park his hands shook get up iil bit make me some bourbcoffee now move your ass babes voice slurring from the past and whit crawled from bed being extra quiet and made the coffee poured in the extra big dollop of whiskey to ease daddys morning nerves he was eight whit pulled in at the next gas station and filled his tank delford corey what else to that story was there say corey did come after delford with a shotgun if delford killed corey in selfdefense there was no reason to keep it secret marians testimony about coreys plans would have made a selfdefense plea simple if delford or any of the authorities had heard of coreys threats corey would have promptly been arrested charged and dealt with in the judicial system that was delfords way he would never play judge and executioner he had too much at stake to risk it over a punk kid like corey hubble but if delford had killed corey then delford could eliminate every iota of bothersome evidence this theoretical killing might be impossible to prove he tried to imagine corey stalking delford a grungy doper rich kid following around a respected officer corey would follow delford learn his routine attempt to strike when delford was most vulnerable so when was that what had the boy seen what had he known why was he headed north he wondered where delford was that fateful weekend whit got out of his car filled his tank bought a fried apple pie and dr pepper at the convenience store and ate a second lunch all the while considering what would light the fuse of a pissy selfcentered fifteenyearold he didnt think of it until he thought about his own childhood his own missing parent and what actions lit his own slow rage jealousy resentment the hungry need for a parent even one who shows no interest whit got on his cell phone and called georgie thursday evening as the sun began its dip below the horizon claudia drove down highway searching for heather farrell no one at little mischief beach had seen heather and claudia suspected that she might have moved on whits constable lloyd had not been able to serve heather the subpoena to appear in court tomorrow lloyd was cruising around the other local parks hoping to spot her and was concentrating on the northern half of the county claudia decided that heather might have migrated south at least her need to find heather had taken her away from davids gloating claudia we just made our careers both of us he had exulted the jabez jones case was the biggest of his rather staid term in the sheriffs department and he could hardly contain his excitement you need to find jabez first she cautioned i wouldnt be counting any promotions until then what do you think i should wear for entertainment tonight if they want an interview david wondered they cover wrestling stories right your uniform claudia knew any answer was easier than an argument for sanity but pressed okay she turned off the main highway at an intersection marked by crumpled woodgrayed county piers a reminder of the last big hurricane three years ago the money to repair them had gone instead to new piers in port leo and laurel point the piers were abandoned now except for a flock of pelicans preening on the rotting posts she remembered walking along the short piers with david hand in hand breathing the smell of buttery popcorn of salt of dead mullet of bait souring in the air of spilled chocolate ice cream melting between the boards her wedding ring had felt newly heavy a sudden anchor with a chip of diamond there was a small park on the south side of st leo bay and she drove slowly past it a family of three was strolling along the beach an elderly woman sketched in the fading light perched atop a picnic table squinting at the windwhipped bay claudia stopped and gave a description of heather to the family and the woman no one had seen her claudia got back in her unmarked taurus and headed farther south the road curving down toward the hamlets of encina pass and copano she saw a white bmw speeding toward her the driver intent on a phone the car bulleted past and claudia saw faith hubble at the wheel claudia lacked both a radar gun and jurisdiction she headed down toward encina pass and three minutes later she spotted whit mosley getting into his ford explorer the campaign sign magnets peeled off the sides in the parking lot of a little puck of a motel a twentydollaranight joint that catered to poor hipsters tourists on bony budgets and cheating husbands from corpus christi it didnt cater to justices of the peace and senators chiefs of staff she pulled in beside whit just as he started his car she saw him force the smile the fakedpleased look that suggested gosh im glad to see you when it really meant oh shit to the nth degree and a deepinside part of her never touched by david twisted claudia got out of her car whit powered his window down hi she said what are you doing all the way down here in the bumfuck part of the county he didnt answer right away talking with a friend faith hubble maybe he didnt say anything i saw her speeding down the road not three minutes ago i couldnt imagine why she was gracing a remote part of the county with her divine presence so whats going on honorable i wanted to ask her he said mildly about a shotgun shotgun corey hubble owned a shotgun i asked what happened to it after he vanished and you had to discuss this with her in a backwater motel she remembered their faces when shed arrived at whits door the way they both focused on her the way they didnt look at each other with her standing there the wineglasses set close together on the coffee table whit clicked off his engine i cant discuss it cant or wont doesnt matter either way im not talking about it claudia swallowed aware suddenly of a sheen of sweat on her palms the back of her legs her shoulders if youre involved with her you should recuse yourself from the inquest i disagree claudia but i cant discuss this with you youre going to have to trust me whit please i have to go now ill see you tomorrow and he powered up the window and drove out of the lot she stood in the oily smear of his parking place watching him go she got back in her taurus and looked for heather farrell for another hour without success before she headed home whit lay on his back in his bed watching the ceiling fan rotate above him did you think you were james bond a romp in the hay would loosen her tongue shed talk about whatever she knew about the day corey vanished the meeting had been rushed the lovemaking awkward her kisses wore on his lips like sandpaper and she had pulled away frowning saying we doing this or not and so he had but the sex felt more duty than pleasure and her finishing gasps when she arched against him sounded forced perhaps velvet should have taped them with all the sincerity they had shown faith claimed to know nothing about coreys disappearance a shotgun or a grudge against delford spires the more he talked the more hastily she rinsed and dressed and when she left all she said was give me a lead time of a couple of minutes okay and you drive back via old bay road not the highway then the door shut with not a single kiss goodbye and claudia he wanted to tell her confide in her but if he did she and his family were at enormous risk what if the man in the dark had been delford or eddie gardner what if his brothers were being watched right now as threatened the risk was too much he would go on with his plan conduct the inquest tomorrow rule and then worry less about the peace in his job title and more about the justice finally he slept and he dreamed of himself and claudias brother jimmy boys gigging for frogs in the murky backwash creeks claudia tagging along the serious pest at twenty till one friday afternoon the blade debated whether or not he should take a seat for the inquest the hearing would start shortly but he did not wish to be conspicuous by his presence it was pleasant to sit in the cramped confines of the vw beetle and watch the few television reporters strutting on the county courthouse lawn all three of them from the local corpus affiliates primped their doughnutglaze hair again the sudden urge to simply get out of the car walk over to them and say do i have a story for you but you must call me the blade washed over him and he pumped up his beach boys tape listening to them implore rhonda for help and the desire ebbed to the boys rhonda was a patron saint of love perhaps he could find a darling with the same name one day encina county was a rhondarich environment and perhaps one day he would walk up to a reporter and let his infamy begin but not today if that scumbucket judge did his job and ruled for suicide then velvet would have no reason to stay her time in port leo would end and her sojourn with him could begin he would treasure each second with her each second an eternity to play again in his mind for the rest of his life his mouth dried with want then it would end as always and he would be sad for a while until the next craving rose like a lick of fire so dont do this dont do this anymore the voice in his ear was not mamas but a boys voice perhaps like his own from long ago im sorry for what i do but it has to be done i need it to be done he pulled his bowie knife out of its sheath and slid it beneath the drivers seat he had cleaned and sharpened it again after its last use the blade saw velvet hop out of her rental car and hurry inside the courthouse she was modestly dressed in black jeans a thin dark sweater a baseball cap and the reporters took little notice of her which pleased him he switched the boys off he could wait for her here he smiled soon his darling would breathe his same air know his wanting share the beginning of a brief forever whits clerk was a chainsmoking widow named edith gregory she was on the outer edge of her fifties with a thin sparrows body dieted by years of smoking she stood in whits office as he pulled his judicial robe over an unusually somber blue buttondown and khaki combo and eyed him critically them pants need pressing she said you think that little russian gal could learn an iron edith was friends with georgie those communists probably all wore grocery bags im responsible for my own laundry edith edith worked her empty fingers as if she had a cigarette we need to get responsible for keeping you in office i got to work for buddy beere they gonna have to give me a raise whit straightened his robe and gathered the papers of the inquest record okay lets go edith stopped him and he glanced at her an unexpected softness touched her blue eyes and he thought if my mom was alive and here shed be about your age you just got this hangdog look on your face thats got me worried edith said just remember youre a judge act like one make me proud six months and she doesnt give me a pep talk until now thanks they walked out of his office and down the hall he followed her into the small courtroom lloyd the constable bellowed all rise and the packed courtroom stood in near unison the hubble contingent occupied the front row faith lucinda a tiredlooking sam the rest of the democratic power base for encina county to their left claudia salazar watching him as though he were a leper trying to blow kisses and delford spires and eddie gardner a couple of patrol officers his father and irina in the back sat a large bevy of the curious velvet squeezed among them replete in cap and dark glasses in the back corner to his surprise junior deloache lounged wearing a houston astros baseball cap and a houston rockets tshirt deloache stared at him and he wondered if he ruled for homicide if junior would just go outside flip open a cell phone and call in the death orders the honorable whitman mosley presiding lloyd blared whit sat and the crowd settled into their seats wood creaking as butts eased down he opened his inquest file carefully prepared by his clerk he glanced at the court reporter borrowed from the county court he wanted a written transcript of the proceedings to file in the inquest report take step one and dont get killed good morning everyone this is a tragic event this loss of life and it has received a lot of local publicity but this is a courtroom and outbursts will not be tolerated anyone who creates a disturbance will be held in contempt and removed from the courtroom by the constable is that understood silence from the gathered lucinda hubble looked pained velvet looked tense junior deloache pushed his astros cap back farther on his head and scratched his forehead with a beefy finger let me explain quickly the point of a death inquest hearing it is to determine whether or not anyone is responsible for the death of another whit said i will question the witnesses there is no jury in this case and no one stands presently accused of a crime he glanced at lloyd constable brundrett please call the first witness lloyd said i was unable to serve process on heather farrell your honor i have not been able to locate her i believe she may have left the jurisdiction shes a known transient and she lied to the police regarding her whereabouts did you find any trace of her constable he already knew the answer but wanted it in the record yes sir we found she had bought two tickets on greyhound her reservation on the bus was for three days from now but shes already gone apparently your honor thank you constable next witness calling detective edward gardner of the port leo police department gardner came to the stand whit swore him in gardner gave a precise rapid account of last monday nights events did you find a suicide note whit asked no yhonor the deceaseds son brought one to our attention later who covered the deceaseds hands with protective bagging gardner stared at him i did yhonor i was told by the nueces county medical examiners office the hands were improperly bagged gardner turned his gaze out to the crowd yes sir i checked the chain of custody at some point before delivery to the morgue the bag covering the right hand was damaged the end result being the medical examiners office had difficulty getting an accurate gunpowderresidue reading on mr hubbles hands i suggest detective before you investigate another crime scene that you refresh yourself on appropriate forensic procedures whit knew he sounded like a textbook but he watched as the borrowed court reporter recorded every word gardners face soured with anger yes sir was all he said but he did not look at whit he stared out into the crowd as though at attention whit dismissed him from the stand claudia looked ready to jump out of her seat notes in hand but whit didnt call her as a witness next dr elizabeth contreras deputy medical examiner for nueces county gave the same summation of autopsy findings shed given to whit stressing that she could not make a definitive call as to whether the gunshot wound was selfinflicted whit asked her only a few questions and liz kept her testimony concise was there any other indication of violence to mr hubble he asked had he been drugged or assaulted in another way he was intoxicated and were awaiting toxicology results but no there were no other signs of violence on him whit thanked liz and she stepped down im introducing into the inquest record whit said a suicide note found at the scene by the deceaseds minor son whit held up the note properly bagged the audience was silent tears coursed down lucindas cheeks in fact i would like to read the note into the transcript of this hearing whit read the note aloud in a slow voice the final pain of pete hubble and his confession for the death of his brother corey lucinda sobbed noisily and faith hugged her sam trembled his eyes locked on whit velvet made some protesting noise the other attendees shushed her she glared at whit as he finished whit let the silence hang before he picked up his gavel this court rules that the deceased peter james hubble committed suicide by selfinflicted gunshot wound on last october i am going to certify a copy of the inquest summary report for delivery to the district court this court is adjourned whit rapped his gavel it was over quick and he saw the disappointment in faces that the hearing had been peculiar and short velvet didnt disappoint are you freaking kidding me what is this crap do i even get a chance to talk court is adjourned maam lloyd warned in an even tone you got a complaint take it outside velvet yelled if i cant get justice here i goddamn well will get it somewhere else fuck you mosley whit ignored her gathering his papers a low chorus of boos erupted around velvet and she pulled away from one older woman who tried to console her she stormed out of the courtroom whit whispered to lloyd follow that woman please i want to know what she does lloyd navigated through the throng leaving the courtroom claudia pushed past and caught whits arm id like a word with you your honor in private she said her voice was low but her tone was white with rage about what about why you didnt call me to testify in this hearing whit shrugged i really didnt see the need he stepped down from the bench claudia stared at him incredulous the need jesus whit you ignored petes connection to jabez his dealings with deloache the bad blood with the hubbles the custody battle that was brewing christ what didnt you ignore he walked out of the courtroom by the back entrance and she followed him down the hallway the departing crowd buzzed like angry bees whit imagined senator hubble holding tearful court before the television reporters claudia shut the door behind them i really dont want to tell you what i think of you right now she said you can i dont break easy you had acres of room for doubt whit the fact he consorted with known criminals the fact that everything about this movie project seems to have vanished the fact he was taking on his mother and wife for custody of his son the fact that he had a young woman actively digging dirt on jabez jones and finding it the fact that evidence was improperly handled by your department maybe you should just trust me on this claudia trust you trust you when you wont tell me why youve suddenly dropped a hundred iq points christ whit you have a responsibility or is your responsibility to make faith hubble happy now the police dont have to continue the investigation he didnt look at her doffing his robe and sliding it onto a hanger i guess not delfordll have hard nipples over this thanks for the image he said you know if additional information came forward at a later date i could reopen the inquest i suppose so but will big faithie let you thats enough he snapped in a hard voice you might consider keeping your venom to yourself until you know the whole story she ground her teeth together fine your honor she made the title slightly mocking in tone so tell me i certainly left enough room in the inquest record for more information to be brought forward whit said slowly i didnt call sam hubble as a witness didnt have heather farrell testify to what she found didnt mention the connections between jabez and pete between deloache and pete and i emphasized the sloppy job that gardner did like you said acres of doubt claudia stared at him what the hell are you cooking up honorable im going to leave town for a few days why its the smart thing for me to do she was silent for several seconds jesus christ whit have you been threatened she surprised him he liked claudia but she had struck him as the plodding sort of investigator who was dogged and determined but not particularly given to flights of imagination she seemed more given to flights of impatience irritability and stubbornness he kept his face very still of course not delford spires opened whits door knocking at the same time and bestowed a thin smile the kind used at funerals when you see someone you havent visited with in a while and youre glad to see them but sick over the reason whit claudia delford nodded you kept justice swift whit i know this has been hard on everyone another cleared case claudia said delford shook his head youre taking this the wrong way claudia ive known lucinda a real long time and i knew pete just like him to come home and mess this up for his mama she gave her kids the world and look what it got her he brushed his mustache with a nervous flicker of his fingers now i want you to focus on helping poor mrs ballew in finding her girl how about finding heather farrell whit said delford shrugged shes a runaway who bought two tickets on the bus didnt use them and now has vanished whit reminded him i wonder who that other ticket was for heather being gone was unexpected to him she might have seen something and been silenced by the same people who had threatened him a sharp hot shame crawled through his body yeah heather might be sitting under a railroad crossing right now picnicking on fried fish or she might be facedown in the bluestems two bullets in her head if so he decided they would not get away with it fuck the election i would certainly feel better if yall would find heather fine delford said well put a notice out on the wires for the nearby counties claudia would you excuse the judge and me for a moment claudia stepped into the hallway and closed the door behind her with a final stabbing glance at whit you think youre big shit delford said let me give you every assurance youre not get out of my office i dont like you dressing down gardner in open court you talk to me and only me about problems with my officers you made our whole department look bad whit opened his mouth full of sharp responses he remembered the bullet whizzing past his ear irina babe his brothers their wives his beautiful nieces his wriggly nephews not yet he thought not yet but oh if you threatened my family im so going to fry you he said ill keep that in mind delford put his stetson back on his head as carefully as hanging a picture see that you do at least while you get to wear that robe he smiled and left shutting the door behind him whit sat down at his desk and waited lloyd returned in a minute face flushed from exertion what happened did she leave whit asked yeah with that guy in the astros cap junior velvet had left with junior of all people if i cant get justice here i goddamn well will get it somewhere else he wondered what sort of justice junior might offer did it look like he forced her to leave with him no they talked outside for a few minutes she was all in a tizzy and he calmed her down then they walked to his porsche talked some more and she followed him in her car thank you lloyd lloyd left and whit stopped at ediths desk im taking some time off edith please clear my docket and reschedule my hearings if judge ramirez can take them thats fine with me if not reschedule for late next week edith frowned at him well thats damn short notice sorry i have to go shouldnt you be campaigning whit shrugged in an odd way i am he gave her the inquest papers had her make a copy for him and then had the originals prepared for filing with the district court he ran a quick errand to the police station then drove toward golden gulf marina velvets key to real shame in his pocket claudia returned to her office gardner was talking low on the phone serious and somber just saying yes or no she felt a mix of worry and anger toward whit he was in some kind of trouble she was sure but he wasnt about to let her help him men thought they could do everything themselves truth be told he was probably bedding faith hubble and that ruling was just a pure favor to her cleanly sweeping a doubtriddled case under the rug do you really think so little of him gardner finished his conversation and left without a word he had barely spoken to her after their exchange a pink message slip lay on her desk david pestering her about the party for his grandfather perhaps a party would do her good even if it was full of davids relatives who seemed to regard her as clinically insane for leaving their darling boy and even being held at a nursing home the kind of place that inevitably depressed her she opened the ballew file desperate to take her mind off whit and eddie and pete hubble maybe a reread would prompt her mind to look at the ballew problem in a new way wait a second speaking of nursing homes marcy had worked at one the encina county deputies had called the home in louisiana and garnered nothing useful from the staff regarding marcys disappearance inspiration struck she and david had concentrated on the flimsy connections between marcys wrestling interest and port leo but what if there was a professional connection she phoned the director of port leos home placid harbor a snipvoiced woman named roselle cross ms cross have you ever heard of a nursing home in deshay louisiana called memorial oaks no claudia drummed a pencil yall ever have much contact with the staff at other nursing homes well the administrators do if theres a transfer buddy beere usually handles that id like to talk to him sure hes usually around thanks claudia gathered her notes and the ballew file and headed for the door the boat still smelled of death whit closed the door behind him real shame had not had its windows opened to the air since pete had been found and the atmosphere felt as oppressive as a wool blanket in summer the deloaches would soon take back possession of their boat and scrub away all traces of unpleasantness he suspected that real shame would sail within days away from police scrutiny in port leo he went down to petes stateroom the air still smelled slightly of human waste and blood the mattress still lay bare the closets were empty the diver claudia recruited had found no trace of petes laptop and no sign of discarded diskettes or papers whit figured pete had not destroyed his research as a sad presuicide gesture he had either shipped it off to someone else for safekeeping or the killer had taken it or destroyed it unless pete had hidden it and the boat still seemed the most likely place and where had the supposed half million in cash gone if whit had either of those he might have enough information to protect himself and his family or enough to get them all killed he rooted around the boat for an hour finding nothing no more tapes of pete exploring scenes for his corey movie no computer diskettes squirreled away in couch cushions no notes outlining the past he was pawing through the small cabinets in the head when a phone rang not his cell phone in his pocket whit followed the ringing to a bedside table in a drawer was another cell phone its readout announced caller id blocked he clicked the phone on hello he said hello pete a womans voice yes whit said simultaneously thinking what the hell are you doing dumbass why arent you answering your other phone lost it whit improvised look some cop in port leos been calling here and leaving messages i had to fucking disconnect my number i want to know whats going on nothing he made his voice tired indistinct im still waiting on my money sweetness your money okay whit said lets get that to you silence hung like a blade in the air who is this wheres pete he cant come to the phone right now whit tried lamely who am i speaking with she hung up whit clicked through the menu options on the cell phone there were no unheard or archived messages no numbers listed for speed dialing no numbers listed in his phone book no numbers listed in his call log pete had covered his tracks whit cursed but it had sounded longdistance and the womans voice was a soft throaty drawl definitely southern not one of petes california starlets and she was expecting money he pulled out his own phone and called the police station claudia was out and he had no intention of talking to gardner or delford but he got nelda the dispatcher to go look in the hubble file and tell him that the phone number in missatuck texas the one that claudia had been unable to get an answer from was registered to a kathy breaux he tried the number disconnected and no new number given in its place he could force the phone company to give him the number but chatting on the phone would accomplish nothing it was gambling time whit pocketed petes phone and left the boat hurrying to his car he headed home a loose plan hed formed earlier taking solid shape he called velvets hotel room got no answer left a message for her to call him on his cell phone he left a vague note for babe and irina packed a bag tossed it in the back of his explorer and headed out of town he didnt notice the flooring company van following him from the marina idling on the other end of evangeline while he stopped at home and he didnt notice the van and another car staying a good distance behind him when he roared north onto state highway aiming toward houston and the east texas piney woods beyond claudia hated nursing homes because she suspected shed slobber her last in one someday probably a wellmeaning niece or nephew would shuttle her ass into a medicare bed tsktsking the whole time about poor old aunt claudia placid harbor wasnt bad as nursing home facilities went the word placid suggested residents in a druginduced fog but the view across st leo bay and little mischief park was postcard pretty and many of the residents were mobile and articulate and management kept it clean not so bad for an iceberg to die on roselle crosss office was modest furnished with a victorian desk memorabilia from local port leo girls softball teams on the walls and photos of cheery and plump roselle hugging residents the decor in the photos showed these lovefests happened during thanksgiving chanukah christmas st patricks day every day a holiday at placid harbor roselle returned to the office buddy called in sick today but i checked our files we havent had any transfers from any homes in louisiana where have you had transfers from recently say in the past year maybe she could delve further into the ballew girls employment history see if there was another connection through another home roselle cross kept a patient holidayquality smile and vanished into the front office she returned five minutes later armed with documents well in the past year weve had three from corpus two from san antonio one from aransas pass one from port isabel and one from austin what about transfers out people leaving placid harbor for someplace else she scanned her papers one to brownsville one to laredo two to corpus when these people transfer how do they get here well with the closeby cities like aransas pass or corpus usually its an ambulance service that moves them or family members depends on the clients condition and what about the more distant towns again the family often brings the client or for a charge we can take or fetch them ourselves depending on the clients condition so who would do this buddy or more likely someone working for him and a nurse or nurses aide if needed and nothing on deshay louisiana absolutely not okay thanks she stood to go i understand theres a party here this weekend for my exhusbands grandfather mr power oh yes hes a delight roselle cross managed to say this without the barest hint of sarcasm claudia liked her better immediately claudia paid a guilt trip to davids poppy ready to shrug off blistering blame for making david unhappy if david had gained a spine and told his grandfather about their divorce but luckily poppy was asleep snoring in his bed with wild abandon his mouth slack lips pale with age his roommate watching a spanishlanguage soap opera turned up the volume higher and told claudia in strident spanish you live your life for all these years and then you got to worry about roommates roommates like youre in college and me with a purple heart velvet awoke slowly clambering toward wakefulness required enormous effort her limbs weighed like stone the darkness around her was oceans deep so dark that it was not an absence of light but lights very opposite she breathed and fabric blocked her mouth and throat her tongue dry as sand wriggled against the plug and felt rough texture of cloth and masking tape she strained to move cords bound her wrists and ankles in her confusion she remembered a silly flick she directed two years ago fit to be tied and mostly she and the cast laughed and giggled through the scene they had found nothing enticing and erotic in bondage lacking few restraints themselves pete starred in the movie and groggily she called for him but the mouth plug turned her plea into an inarticulate moan she ached her head her jaw her stomach and she became aware that thick dense silk covered her eyes she could see no light creeping in around the blindfolds edges fear rose in her sudden and sour as bile she wrenched hard against the cords they did not slacken she tried to remember where she had been junior deloaches condo after that numbnuts whit ruled for suicide junior had invited her over for a drink to calm down and think over the next move he said like he was suddenly petes advocate the jerk talking about the army of lawyers his father could command but she had not wanted to be alone she would have preferred having a glass of wine with claudia salazar trying to persuade her to keep the case open somehow a female friend a tart in arms would have been nice to have she wanted to slap whit he had said he was on her side and god he was a liar kangaroo fucking court is what it was but junior was there being kind kindness had always mattered she remembered coming out of the fog a scream forming in her throat theyre at juniors condo drinking whiskey ansons not around thank god he gives her the shivers creeping around in that wheelchair velvet gets quickly and angrily drunk junior paws her breasts and mutters about film speeds and money shots lets do a movie he says right now cmon she shrugs off his hand and pours more bourbon thinking hell be too drunk to get hard and too little to notice and suddenly he belts her harder than shes ever been hit before she realizes she spoke her thought aloud the world devolves into a spinning circle of stars and she fights as junior yanks down her jeans rips her thong in half pulls loose her sweater snaps off her brassiere the sigs still in her purse and she clambers toward it but he punches her once twice and shes lying on the carpet stunned bleeding through the foggy haze of pain she sees junior setting up a camera aiming it toward her then shucking his houston sports team clothes gonna make a movie now bitch he says the working title is fuck velvet hard already planning the sequel gonna call it velvet tells me where the fucking money is stop it stop junior this isnt funny he is erect and he jabs a button on the camcorder im not gonna get screwed over anymore im a businessman im gonna get to be in a fuck film and im gonna get my money back she stumbles to her feet intent on getting that gun and shooting him wheres her damned purse but he hammers her again his fist bouncing off the back of her head and she falls to the floor she pukes up the bourbon and then what she breathed around the mouth plug god this wasnt the movie was it her head ached junior she tried to say she hears the doorbell ring not the condo elevator door creaking open not anson wheeling back but the other entrance the stairs and she hears junior cuss softly a chair creaked next to her a finger callused ran along her cheek no darling juniors not here she held herself very still the voice was low a mans a little gravelly would you like the gag removed darling she nodded you should understand no one can hear you but i wont tolerate you screaming at least not for now a metal point inched down her leg it stopped at her knee and pressed gently owww she groaned if you scream darling well get right down to my fun ill dig open those tits and well see if theyre real velvet held perfectly still not even daring to breathe nod once if you understand she nodded the knife point left her knee gently the hands caressed her face she heard a lock snap jesus he has this thing locked on my face and the mouth plug was pried loose from her lips a finger wrapped around a damp cloth cleaned out her mouth dribbled welcome water over her tongue she resisted the urge to bite down and take the finger off there you go darling the man said she wetted her lips with her tongue who are you im your new lover a sick chill goosepimpled her skin will you take off the blindfold not for a while more fun this way fun that word again where am i heaven wheres junior hell where he belongs she offered a fake soft laugh no really junior isnt going to bother you anymore i took care of him for my sweet darling why am i here i need you he said her tongue felt dry as dirt again yeah baby i can sure understand that we all need perfectly natural she used her film voice coy trying to keep from shaking but i cant give you what you need all tied up baby quiet now he said brushing her hair with his fingertips i have a name baby velvet he hummed low in his throat you untie velvet hon you let me go ill give you what you need she felt a finger run along her naked breasts her stomach the cup of her navel she suppressed a shudder whats your name honey she asked she heard the chair shift she could smell his breath reeking of garlic and fried shrimp he nibbled her ear and ran his tongue along its edge whats your name she tried again in a whisper her voice cracking my name is corey he whispered back corey hubble then he climbed on top of her she began to scream whit drove following highway as it snaked up the slow curve of the texas coast merging into highway north of freeport then sliding onto interstate s thick rope when he reached the sprawl of houston he crept through houstons neverending rushhour traffic and headed up toward the deep pine forests and shallow bayous of far east texas he could take i to beaumont and then north to a farmtomarket road to the little town of missatuck where he suspected kathy breaux was waiting for pete and her unexplained money whit reached beaumont around eight friday night the towers of the refineries glowed like an alien metropolis with his window cracked he could smell the sour egg odor of natural gas and chemical plants overpowering the barest hint of pine hungry he parked in the oilstained lot next to a cheap diner with a neon fork spearing the window in the counter he ate a greasy hamburger topped with killyourneighborsstrength onions and gulped a jumbo glass of iced tea as he ate he studied again the clipping file that patsy had sent he reread each article and found himself going back to the first article outlining coreys disappearance corey is impulsive senator hubble said in a brief statement to the press i dont think corey wants to be spending much time in austin i have no reason to suspect that corey has run afoul of someone i hope that if he is reading this he realizes the joke is over and he should please call us soon the accompanying photo showed a stolid yet pained lucinda hubble leaving the port leo police station brave head held high but wearing dark glasses a clearly shocked pete young beyond his years walked next to her grimacing delford stood next to lucinda a rock of gibraltar of course he had the phone call to georgie whit had placed yesterday was a simple question of whether there had ever been rumor of a relationship between lucinda hubble and delford spires georgie the human archive of local lore and gossip had said well theyve always been friends i wondered if delford wanted more at one point but i guess any chance of romance fizzled after corey vanished lucinda never let another man close to her it was circumstantial it was wispy hearsay but it made whit wonder a boy who felt anger and unending grief over his fathers death and acid resentment toward his mother would not welcome a new suitor whit had felt the same sting when babe split with georgie and began wooing local divorcees he had cordially hated all his fathers girlfriends childish yes but common but he still could not envision delford ruthlessly killing a teenage boy he gathered up his papers and walked out of the diner heading across the dark plain of the parking lot hey fucker a voice boomed and a hand borrowed from goliath grabbed whit off his feet dragged him several feet behind the building and slammed him into the back brick wall of the diner the back of his head hit hard and pinwheels filled his vision whit lashed out with a fist and grazed a temple he blinked and cool fingers curled into his throat making themselves at home squeezing the life out of him his head pounded back into the bricks hey fucker the voice repeated gonna talk in the dim light whit could see mr words was a young rough kid with thick arms big hair and a pair of narrowlensed sunglasses most commonly found on pimps hed seen the guy before the muscledup kid at juniors condo out of the corner of his eye whit saw more movement heard the quiet creak of a wheelchair oh shit i hate a goddamned thief worse than anything anson todd said in a hushed voice and you an elected official goddamn american democracy is going down the fucking toilet you corrupt bastard yeah mr words agreed what whit attempted to breathe grabbing at mr wordss hand trying to pry the fingers from his throat i want the money judge smartass anson hissed he wheeled close to whit and with an arthritic fist punched whit in the balls hard whit gagged amazing how slight a punch it takes to savage a pair of testicles mr words slammed whit to the oily pavement yanked his arm straight spread his fingers against the parkinglot grime the throat grip relaxed momentarily so whit could breathe and speak what money wrong answer fist squeezed blood fled from his throat the wheelchair heavy itself and full of old man rolled over his fingers backed up rolled forward again whit gritted his teeth wondering if he would first hear or feel the bones break dont fuck with us judge anson said he steadied the chair letting its full weight settle on whits knuckles did a cop once mr words said never a judge cool start with fingers i dont have your money get him into the van anson ordered you can have your fun with him there he hacked phlegm and shit its time for my medicine mr words jerked whit to his feet keeping an iron grip on his throat with both hands whit tried to wrench free hoping for a weak spot to punch or kick but mr words was four inches taller and fifty pounds heavier all muscle whit smelled the pineapple reek of cheap cologne the soft odor of trash from the diners dumpster the goons sweat mr words hurried whit along toward a dark blue van parked at the far end of the lot with a flooring company name on the side ansons motorized chair purring behind them cooperate get off light mr words murmured in a spate of eloquence you dont die in fucking beaumont talk to us be cool the half million they think i have it as mr words dragged him along by his neck whit considered options a kick to the nuts and about a dozen hard punches to the jaw were the ticket actually a small nuclear device would be the ticket but whit couldnt budge an inch all he could see was the smeary grease stains of the lot a few flattened cigarette butts and the dark shadow of the van barely illuminated in the halo of light from a streetlamp at the corner head held down and stumbling whit saw the damage before they did all four of the vans tires lay flat he made a noise and mr words stopped and saw and said well fuck whit the baby of six dirtywrestling brothers just needed that second he fought just the way he learned at his brothers knees and elbows and fists he smashed his heel down on mr wordss arch gouging the foot with the modest heel of his loafer mr words yelled whit slammed a forearm against wordss right arm then elbowed backward into the thick throat mr words yelped whit spun free of his hold then drove headfirst into the mans abdomen mr words staggered back and whit jabbed hard with two left uppercuts that sent the kid sprawling onto the asphalt eddie get the fuck out here anson screamed whit whirled trying to get his breath back his throat felt like it had been scalded his fingers felt like rubber either broken by ansons wheel or mr wordss jaw eddie shit new plan run he bolted and mr words kicked out catching both his feet on a muscled leg hard as fallen timber and whit slammed hard into the pavement well you tried fingers closed around his throat again yanking him to his feet movement came from behind the van eddies indisposed a familiar voice gooch holding a sleek automatic pistol neatly fitted with a silencer the pistol was aimed at anson the grip on whits throat tightened let the judge go son gooch said or i shoot the old man then you mr words moved whit in front of him as a makeshift shield or maybe i just break his neck if you dont drop the gun i can shoot you first son gooch said conversationally or i can shoot anson you want to explain to papa deloache how you got anson killed let him go anson said quietly even when whipped mr words made an excellent lapdog he let go whit gulped a long sucking breath one that scorched his throat but his lungs savored judge come here by the van gooch said i dont want you to get blood splattered all over your nice clothes dumbass anson snarled you fuck with us you dont have any idea what youre buying oh i do gooch smiled but fuck with me and you buy a grave no one will ever find understood whit leaned against the van he said eddie eddie gardners in there hes catching some shuteye right now whit peered inside eddie gardner lay propped in the back of the van bleeding lightly from his nose and mouth but breathing yellow rope wrapped around his arms and legs you get in the van gooch ordered mr words the young man stared stupidly clearly youre no fulbright scholar gooch said but do what youre told and youll be fine you come out of that van before i say i shoot him and then i shoot you you understand mr words glanced at anson the old man nodded the boy climbed into the van next to the unconscious eddie and gooch slammed the door he then held up a clear plastic bag to anson three black pistols s a switchblade a blackjack and a cell phone lay inside i dont think i missed any of your toys when i went through your van anson if i did and muscles comes out shooting you get a bullet in the brain whit thought no gooch dont do this but he said nothing still rubbing his aching throat im old do your worst anson huffed i probably get a fucking colostomy bag next year you think im afraid of you i dont believe you want to die one second before you have to and i really dont think you want to see muscles die isnt he deloaches nephew in the dim light ansons stare narrowed who are you why are you following judge mosley kiss my ass gooch brought the gun up how hard are the cops going to look for your killer anson i think not very he thinks i took petes half million whit coughed feeling was slowly creeping its painful way back into his fingers and throat gooch raised an eyebrow anson i dont feel good i need my medicine moments ago he had been all snarl now he was all plead i got a permanent cure here if you dont start talking gooch said anson shrugged with a baleful look at whit youre like me arent you he asked gooch always cleaning up other peoples shit we aint done anything wrong were the wronged ones oh i bet gooch said junior gave pete hubble a halfmil cash of his dads money for some adult film series because pete promised junior a percentage of the sales the starring role and all the bimbos he could screw well that aint the movie that pete was making he was making some shit about his fuckedup brother junior found out and wanted his our money back and pete balked kept saying itd be a much better investment than porn but junior hadnt told his dad about this unapproved investment we got to get that money back and you couldnt find it on the boat so you figured the judge had it we been keeping an eye on petes boat saw the judge leave it and head the fuck out of town like his ass is on fire i figured he had it or knew where it was i dont have your money whit said dont feel bad that its lost gooch said he bought it with the veins and noses of kids gooch pushed his gun into the old mans face did you shoot at whit the other night threaten him about the hubble inquest anson shook his head i dont mean you personally anson gooch said im talking anyone you know anson shook his head again i maybe junior got a guy to come up from corpus some local muscle just a theory howd he know about whits family gooch snarled grabbing ansons throat anson coughed junior drinks at the shell inn the owner brags about her former stepsons in excruciating detail again just a theory ah thank you gooch said he eased his grip i dont suppose it had occurred to you that pete might have spent the money whit said he was surprised at how calm his voice was anson huffed not in a few days in port leo its still our money he lied to us and we want it back i figured either you or that velvet bitch had it wheres junior whit asked a sudden icicle forming in his heart he said he was going to houston explaining all this to his dad bull gooch said you know damn well where he is whit pulled out his cell phone and dialed velvets motel room no answer he left another message with the motel clerk to have velvet call him as soon as she could maybe juniors trying to rough velvet up the same way you roughed up me whit said shit hes not gonna hurt her he wants to be in her movies anson shook his head fuck films no values left anymore the world is just going down the toilet why hollywood dont make a nice musical is beyond me lecture your sunday school class about it gooch said whit played a card you know i just heard on the radio that they caught jabez jones and hes talking he had to get his dope from somewhere and he might be implicating junior anson kept his face stone still i dont know what you mean gooch laughed very softly whit go back to your car ill join you shortly what are you going to do with them whit asked just go goochs voice sounded soft lazy as though nothing was on the agenda more compelling than a tall glass of lemonade no im calling the police were not doing that gooch said im a magistrate for gods sakes im having them arrested at the least for assaulting a public servant gooch glanced back at anson what if the next schmuck they come after doesnt have the luxury of me to save their ass whit if theyre in jail they cant go after anyone i cant testify in court whit gooch said mildly its not going to happen youre not going to kill them may i suggest anson said quietly a compromise no gooch said shut up do you think this is how i wanted to spend my fucking retirement anson said to whit picking up after drunken littledicked morons who think theyre tough better than retiring behind bars and being sold for cigarettes whit said you lose those dentures youre gonna be real popular what can you give us on junior deloache anson smiled and shook his head i aint giving you shit on junior judge fine then i wont call the police this isnt my jurisdiction anyway he knew hed miscalculated in pulling the moral high ground attitude with gooch anson saw whits worry as weakness he walked away and thought please gooch dont kill them wait a second anson called but whit kept walking there was only the silence of his footsteps no sounds of shots no sounds of screams no sounds of life ending the highway gave off a distant rumble of its uninterested traffic he sat inside his explorer and closed the door whit waited and waited thirty minutes later gooch sauntered from behind the diner with a slight smile on his face he climbed in next to whit im afraid to ask whit said theyre fine theyre in custody whose custody and under what charges assault gooch shrugged that kid and eddie beat me up anson helped him you know he paused i think the feds might be interested in them drug trafficking money laundering all that kind of stuff sheer nastiness i see thank you gooch you want to tell me why you followed me to beaumont saving your ass isnt a good enough reason please tell me you didnt kill those men theyre in custody i told you go outside and see if you want whit walked to the back of the diner the van with its four flats was gone he walked back to his car that diner any good gooch asked im starved after leaving the nursing home claudia returned to the station there was a message from david jabez jones remained at large of course no one was looking for marcy what with a highprofile quarry like jabez claudia started the tedium of phone work buddy beere was home with a bad cold but he did confirm the transfers that roselle cross had mentioned he sounded horrible stuffy and wheezing and said that he did personally supervise a few of the transfers when family couldnt be bothered he couldnt remember ever having hired anyone from deshay louisiana or having heard of the nursing home there i do remember having made personal trips to fetch clients over the past couple of years buddy said he stopped for three thunderous sneezes but other placid harbor folks handled transfers and i can check my files on monday if you want to know who exactly did what or sooner if this is an emergency thats okay i hope youre feeling better soon im mainlining nyquil i hope thats not illegal he laughed i wont report you she said detective i know youre buddies with whit mosley but if i win the election i just want you to know ill work hard and ill look forward to working with you thanks buddy she said feeling awkward i appreciate that im sure wed work together just fine okay let me know if i can be of further help she thanked him again and hung up so no connection there between deshay and port leo she rubbed her temple with her pencils eraser but what if there were similar cases to marcys her disappearance might be part of a wider blanket maybe so she phoned the department of public safety in austin where the states missing persons clearinghouse database was located and she gave them a set of parameters to check young women last seen at places of work there did not seem to be a spate of women abducted from nursing homes dps faxed her a list of disappearances and she studied the dates odd she flipped back to her notes from roselle cross a week after the transfer of a client from port leo to laredo last november a young woman angela marie norris had gone missing from a laredo taco bell restaurant after her shift ended in may three weeks after a patient moved from placid harbor to another facility in brownsville another young woman laura janelle palinski disappeared from a pizzeria she worked at claudia called dps back and they faxed her details descriptions and photos of both young women and she sat studying the pictures both bore a passing resemblance to marcy ballew with dark hair round faces naive smiles but then they were all of a common type nice girls working in lowwage jobs saving for college maybe or just trying to live from paycheck to paycheck the times when buddy or whoever had handled the transfer had been in the two towns were close but not the same and buddy had not been alone on the transfers there had been a nursepractitioner accompanying him but then the women hadnt vanished when buddy had been in town and buddy had never supervised a transfer from deshay louisiana it was just odd she called the police departments in laredo and brownsville got the names of the detectives in charge of the missingwomens cases and left messages for them to call her back she then called roselle crosss office id like to know if buddy was at work on these days november of last year may and september this year those were the days morris palinski and ballew had all dropped out of sight why im just trying to piece together a chronology of where hes been my word do you suspect him of something the woman sounded appalled no its a way to simply get a clearer picture i just talked with him hes being entirely cooperative well roselle cross said ill have to check monday morning mrs cross claudia said its getting late its friday night im sure you want to get home so do i you can go check this on a computer in about five seconds i just need to know if he took vacation or sick time then one moment roselle cross said with clear peevishness and put claudia on hold a pang of hunger gnawed at claudias stomach she dug down in her purse for a candy bar she usually had stashed away in the depths and her fingers found paper instead she pulled out an envelope marked open in private god probably a love letter from david hed stashed in her purse she tore it open out slipped a copy of a newspaper photo a teenage junior corey eddie gardner and a girl holding fat fish whit had attached a note not sure if this means a single thing but thought you should know also i think junior gave pete a half million maybe gardner got it back for his old fishing buddy the tough way and maybe gardner ruined those evidence bags as a favor to junior thought you should know watch your back will call you soon be careful whit she could have strangled whit mrs cross huffed back on the line buddy was here those days no vacation time thank you claudia said i appreciate your help mrs cross hung up without further comment claudia dialed whits cell phone and got a message saying the phone was out of the calling area she left him voice mail you better call me back as soon as humanly possible she said leaving her home and office numbers she tried velvet again at her motel still no answer the woman might have decided to leave town once the inquest went against her but according to the clerk she hadnt checked out of the room yet claudia went to delfords office he sat at his desk his service revolver unholstered sitting next to an untidy hill of papers he glanced up at her with a sharp look she was clearly unwelcome late night she asked trying to sound casual the hard look in his eyes made her throat feel thick i just got a complaining phone call about you from some woman over at the nursing home you have bigger problems than me she said she placed the photo and whits postit note on his desk jesus christ delford finally said claudia sat across from him i dont understand he finally said youre saying thats eddie gardner i think it is he knows deloache delford said yes have you talked to him about this no he took off hours ago she paused did you get a copy of his service record from houston of course eddie was as clean as a whistle references the whole shebang delford pointed at the picture shit maybe this is just coincidence kids go fishing on the jetties meet each other during a day then never see each other again eddie and junior are both from houston them and four million other people lots of kids from houston fish here not a crime no thats not dealing drugs and covering up a murder sure are youre just full of serious accusations arent you missy delford squinted at her i mean whats with you lately you question how i do things around here you check out files you dont got any business worrying over you screw up evidence bags and blame a colleague i dont even know you anymore claudia said softly why the hell are you having these meltdowns tell me delford i can help you delfords phone rang and he scooped it up he listened and muttered holy jesus three times then he hung up we got us a dead one floater in the bay a girl delford gulped clicked his service revolver back in his holster shes not whole some sick son of a bitch carved her up velvet came awake suddenly she had finally managed to doze after a while time was impossible to measure after he had finished his assault now she felt a wet rag move along her skin cleaning her legs and privates cleaning where she had soiled the sheets removing them and curling towels under her hips a voice humming surfin safari ignoring her shivers of rage and fear soup darling corey asked she nodded barely he spooned lukewarm chicken broth into her mouth she swallowed it and made herself not cry some goddamned last meal she heard the spoon click against an empty cup he dabbed her mouth replaced the gag and refastened the lock with a dainty click sleep now he said and she heard him leave the room the door shut and then there were five or six snicks with terror she realized they were dead bolts being thrown she was locked in times six tears would not come she strained and pulled against the cords but they were intractable jesus christ ive been raped she thought in disbelief and her fathers unbending methodist voice the pride of an omaha pulpit crowded into her head are you surprised what you do its an abomination and a shame and you get what you deserve no she shook her head against the imagined voice her father never said those words to her hed never lived to see her sink she shuddered and the tears came in a hot flood she cried silently the tears sopping into the blindfold a pool of snot forming at her nose that she blew out to clear her airways she wished for a cloth so he it would not see she had cried screw a handkerchief wish for a gun so you can blow the son of a bitch straight to hell she must not crumple someone would realize she was missing and gone whit and claudia would look for her wouldnt they shit maybe she wasnt even in port leo anymore she had no idea how long she had been unconscious think think he had said he was corey hubble oh god pete and that movie pete had been too tightlipped about his research pete had found corey but corey didnt want to be found corey might be a complete freaking nut a drug runner a smuggler clearly he didnt balk at kidnapping or rape maybe he hadnt balked at fratricide she had to get out she could not simply lie here and wait to be killed first she needed to see where she was she needed to slip free of the blindfold the restraints on her legs gave way enough that she could push with her heels and bring up her knees slightly she did so pressing her head down against the sheets she felt a knot in the blindfolds side where the fabric gathered and she pulled herself down mashing the pillow against the fabric then she raised herself up again pushed back and tried to drag the blindfold off again again slowly the knot yielded its position rolling up her scalp after several minutes of steady pushing all breathless work she had shoved the fabric up enough all she dared where she could open one eye the room was dark one small lamp in the corner down by her feet emitted a feeble glow the lamp was kitschy featuring dancing circus elephants cavorting in a circle the kind of lamp you might find in a childs room with the one eye she saw that the room was windowless or rather that neat planks of blackpainted plywood covered where windows had once been dingy wallpaper hung on the walls strips dangling the paper showed cartooned cowboys riding on the range lassoes awhirling wild ponies bucking in corrals the antiseptic s version of the wild west a childs room left to rot she turned her head to inspect the cords thin yellow rope like the kind shed seen on boats at the marina although some softer material cushioned the rope around her wrists and ankles the bed she was bound to was metal an old twinsize contraption she remembered with a grimace that the springs were noisy but metal meant parts sharp edges that might cut rope yeah and im goddamned houdini she pulled again trying to free one hand liberate one foot the tape covering the ropes gouged her flesh no ease no relief she wept again hating the rubbery taste of the mouth plug so talk him into letting you go she stopped crying she snuffled not wanting to block her airway how was she supposed to work that bit of mojo she heard her own voice bickering with whit in his yard im superior to any man who pays money for my tapes she knew whit believed she demeaned herself with her work but this this was debasement beyond her dreams but she knew she was greater than the men who snuck into the adult bookstores under cover of night quickly paid in cash to rent her movies ordered them via internet anonymity plugged the tape in darkened dens and watched the men and women she arranged act the charades of love she knew what would turn her audience on what turned on corey clearly was control brutality hurting her was foreplay to him her death would be his climax so she needed to slow his madness subtly wrest control away from him her attempts to get him to see her as a person had flopped he would not call her by name but by his creepy term of endearment so maybe the solution was in being what he wanted her to be an object a nonperson who only existed to satisfy his lust but an object who would kill him dead dead dead velvet took a deep breath fuck you corey she whispered she would be ready the shrimper was a thin grizzled vietnamese man named minh nguyen and he was unusually calm considering the catch in his illegal nets the partial remains of heather farrell the corpse gutted and slashed had been collected for autopsy i can tell you the cause of death a freaking nutcase the mortuary service driver told claudia as he and his partner loaded the body bag into the transport in the bright gleam of the harbors mercury lights after one good look at heathers sad remnants claudia vomited leaning against a pier piling and spewing into the greenish gray water she had never seen such butchery you looked for her you didnt find her you should have made her stay in a cell you failed that poor girl please let her not have suffered claudia staggered away from the piers end wiping her mouth hoping the others wouldnt say a word to her two other cops had puked but they were both rookies mr nguyen the shrimper smoked a bummed cigarette while he repeated the story to the four officers ringed around the table he was unflappable and precise about his account and claudia wondered if he had seen far worse in his life the man was in his fifties certainly old enough to have witnessed the horrors of war in his native land besides claudia and delford there was an investigator from the encina county sheriffs department and a ranger from parks and wildlife both of whom would be interested in any possible crime committed on the waters of st leo bay mr nguyen was trawling on the edge of the bay when his net tangled night shrimping was against the law but no one was debating with him about this at this point a heaviness caught in one of the sleds had kept the netted shrimp from tumbling free and when he inspected it he had found the girls body her eyes staring up at him from beneath a mask of wriggling shrimp it was nearly midnight when claudia went out for a breath of fresh air from the police station stoop she could see the curving arc of port leo beach park aglow in the streetlights the statue of stern saint leo watching over the bay autumn moonlight made the small waves gleam she watched a family tourists amble from one of the restaurants down near the waters edge toward the colonel james house bed and breakfast they seemed uneager to surrender the day one of the family was a teenage girl and she shyly waved at claudia sitting on the steps claudia waved back jesus heather was someones daughter just like that girl she had told delford she would call the girls family in lubbock and she had but there was only an answering machine the parents perhaps out late dining wining not looking for their daughter no sir what did people do who had runaway children did their lives resume with faked normalcy she would keep calling she heard footsteps behind her and delford appeared he still looked gaunt and pale were gonna find this fucker claudia jesus you expect shit like this in houston not here he mopped his brow and she noticed the dark circles underneath his uniforms sleeves he was sweating as though fevered i thought you were taking care of this girl her throat worked i she didnt want help she didnt want protection i tried christ he said christ try harder next time silence fell between them the soft sound of the waves boats creaking in the harbor a block away claudias heart hammered in her chest marcy ballew delford finally said maybe this is what happened to her i dont know claudia said she told him about her research im still waiting to hear back from laredo and brownsville on their missingpersons cases we got a missing girl and we got a butchered girl and the way farrell was killed jesus he took out her organs lets not get ahead of ourselves she cautioned marcy ballew could be sitting on a beach in california for all we know and i think that this might have more to do with pete hubbles death for gods sakes once it gets out that the girl who found him is dead herself its an awful stretch for coincidence delford surely you see that he blanched shes a transient theyre always easy targets sure could be a coincidence maybe she saw something she wasnt supposed to pete hubble committed suicide there was nothing for her to see hell she was prone to amble at night she just might have walked herself into some new trouble claudia kept her voice low im not going to argue with you because it seems pointless but this is not like you delford bullying me sticking your hand in the middle of investigations just wait until the press learns the girl who found pete hubble is gutted and sliced up in the bay you tell people theres no connection youre gonna be looking for a new job why are you fighting me every step of the way she felt sick breathless delford spires sank onto the steps next to her all the bluster from before was gone and she saw his hands tremble as he slowly rubbed his jawline whit mosley believes and im not sure how since i cant get in touch with him pete hubble got half a million in cash from junior deloache the moneys gone theres no trace of it in petes account petes dead now heathers dead i think this missing money is at the heart of this delford he blinked at her jesus christ thisll kill lucinda claudia cared very little for lucinda hubbles feelings at the moment its already killed pete and heather you think the mob cut up that little girl and dumped her yes i do at least based on what i know now we need to find deloache yes he agreed ill talk to him you talk to eddie yet eddies not answering my calls delford said im gonna go over to his house and see whats up he turned and headed back toward the station claudia went back inside to the interrogation room a slip of paper from the girls jeans was there secure in an evidence bag claudia stared at the phone number that had been tucked in the girls wallet it was blurred from the water but still readable faith hubbles home phone maybe faith had offered to help the girl given that shed had the trauma of finding petes body right faith hubble good samaritan she turned to the worn grassstained duffel after heathers body had been found patrolman fox and another officer immediately combed her hangout little mischief beach for information a couple of girls puffing cigs on the beach transients knew heather and when told of her fate shattered into tears one produced a duffel bag within ten minutes they thought heather had just blown town and you know they could sure use her stuff if she didnt need it theyd last seen her on wednesday night claudia sorted through the contents a pair of jeans crusty with sand a pair of panties she examined the manufacturer and the size on both counts the same as the panties found at petes death scene claudia let out a long breath shed had heather show that she had underwear on but shed been given a bathroom break before and had her duffel with her she could have changed into a pair of fresh panties before claudia asked maybe she was messing around with pete hubble and suddenly had to get dressed in a hurry yeah if she killed pete or if she was with pete when he was killed she called the crime lab in corpus and asked them to compare any pubic hairs found in the panties in petes case with heather farrells pubic hairs once they had processed her body she had a sick feeling that there would be a match she pawed through the duffel bag two sweaters threadbare a couple of tshirts with port leo themes one for the port leo varsity swim team a small stash of cash thirty dollars a couple of bus tickets to go as far as houston unused the ones the constable had mentioned at the inquest who was going with her a notebook full of stiff but accurate pencil drawings of whooping cranes caspian terns egrets and roseate spoonbills boats people walking on the beach she hadnt been kidding about being an artist with instruction she might have been quite good another page full of hopeful scribbling heather hubble mrs heather hubble heather farrellhubble heather and sam the h and the s ornately drawn together to form a lopsided heart holy god the drive to lucinda hubbles house took three minutes lights were on both upstairs and downstairs even at the late hour lucinda answered the door in silk pajamas and robe the skin under lucindas eyes was dark like a pale bruise she tore open the door quickly after claudias knock her eyes wide seeing claudia seemed to make her breath freeze hello senator im afraid im the bearer of bad news is faith here bad news she repeated dully but she led claudia into the main den where faith was speaking softly into a telephone faith clicked off the moment she saw claudia not even bothering with a goodbye whats going on faith asked without preamble the young woman who found petes body heather farrell is dead a shrimpers net caught her body out in the bay a couple of hours ago oh my god lucinda said paling the women exchanged glances was it an accident faith asked did she drown hardly stabbed disemboweled throat slashed claudia let the silence hang lucinda sank into a chair there are those who might be tempted to treat this as a coincidence heather finds pete dead and ends up dead herself in a matter of days i dont believe in coincidence i dont care how judge mosley ruled she glared at faith hubble then turned to lucinda i never thought your son committed suicide senator and i think so even less now you have anything you want to tell me lucinda folded her hands in her lap i can think of nothing that could help you im horrified beyond belief that such a crime could happen here faith said lets call delford as though claudia were not sitting there that boiled claudias blood we have another young woman missing and if heathers death is not related to petes i think its related to this other case have either of you heard of marcy ballew both women shook their heads she vanished from deshay in western louisiana she worked at a nursing home there faith shook her head but lucindas mouth worked and she made a noise in her throat senator claudia asked no im sorry i dont know her or of her in heathers jeans we found a piece of paper that had your home phone number on it had either of you been in contact with her faith looked stunned lord no i gave the girl that number lucinda said quickly faith looked over at her surprised when did you see heather farrell claudia asked lucinda folded her hands in her lap i ran into her on the street on wednesday i think it was i gave her our number in case she needed any help you know a place to stay food perhaps some clothes or money i felt sorry for her how did you even know what she looked like claudia wondered but she decided to play this out she turned to faith did heather farrell ever call you no faith said she glanced over at lucinda and some unspoken code seemed to hover in the air between them id like to talk with sam why faith asked claudia decided to fish a little heather farrell hung out a lot at little mischief beach if sam hung out there he might have seen who else was around heather i dont think sam knew the girl i mean im sure he would have mentioned it if he had faith said claudia watched her im quite sure sam knew her she left a notebook in her duffel with hearts drawn around their names along with two bus tickets to houston both women stared i think i should call delford lucinda finally said fine claudia smiled she played her trump cards i suspect the fbi will be interested in talking to sam even more than i am if farrells death is related to ballews disappearance and ballew was kidnapped and brought across state lines the fbi takes the case maybe even before the election she let the cold knife sink and twist should i have the agents call you faith or you senator you despicable bitch faith said under her breath faith lucinda gasped faith grasped the arms of her chair shes enjoying this shes wanted to turn the screws on us for a long time you dont matter one iota to me claudia said evenly but id like to talk to your son now please faith closed her eyes and a shudder went through her body you cant we dont know where sam is a minute later claudia called delford at the police station sam hubble is missing she told him what she had found in the farrell girls belongings i just spoke with the senator and faith sam is gone no sign of him he took his own car delford wheezed goddamn it you had no right to go over there that suicide note cant be for real sam hubble faked it you think that boy killed his daddy and heather farrell i dont know but we need to find him she paused did you find eddie no hes gone his car everything his apartments empty i sent fox over to junior deloaches i just got a call they found deloache there stabbed to death stabbed like two dozen times jesus whats happening claudia leaned against the kitchen counter lucinda and faith watching her sam hubble jabez jones and eddie gardner had all gone missing heather farrell was dead and her story about pete hubble was a lie junior deloache was dead welcome to chaos whats happening is that pete hubble stirred up the wrong hornets nest he stirred up the past people are dying because of what happened to corey hubble all those years ago she waited for him to react to speak and he said nothing if theres anything else you can tell me you better tell me right now delford his breathing grew harsh youre goddamned leaping to conclusions no reason to think that notes a fake boy might have just gone partying in corpus youre making all kinds of unsubstantiated claims bothering lucinda i wont have it i wont have it from an officer of mine she started to speak again delford shut up youre fired claudia whit and gooch barreled on deep into friday night north heading for missatuck texas they had left goochs car parked in a brightly lit truckers stop on the outskirts of beaumont the easternmost slice of texas unfolded ahead of their headlights an endless ribbon of road bordered by tall loblolly pines the weather cleared the cool night the luxuriant reward for a toolong sweltering summer whit drove and gooch sat in the front seat reading a battered mickey spillane paperback by penlight i cant read in a car it makes me sick whit said there had been little conversation between them since leaving beaumont although whits mind was full of questions over goochs ability to make felons disappear im highlighting the appropriate tough guy phrases for you so you know what to say the next time you encounter an anson type youre a little too larry mcmurtry for that crowd gooch glanced although you acquitted yourself well against that slab of a kid i feel like i broke every finger in my hands on his face if you did you couldnt steer gooch said matteroffactly enough selfcongratulations what matters is that junior thinks youve got his moolah he shut the spillane moolah theres a word that needs a renaissance perhaps pete hid the money somewhere before he died for what purpose stealing from mobsters even the iqchallenged contingent that junior represents is an extremely bad idea gooch shrugged we may be crediting pete with greater brains than he deserves he may have only had one large working organ i think that juniorboy had pete killed so where is the money i would think if pete doesnt have it velvet might im sitting in slackjawed amazement you generally consider velvet as some whore with the heart of gold pardon the cliche if she had the half million wouldnt she give it back to junior having seen what happened to pete and if she took it shed be gone and junior and anson would be off in hot pursuit we dont know pete ever kept it on the boat but they thought it was on the boat where else might he hide it gee in a bank gooch asked has anyone looked in the poor schmucks accounts yes claudia researched his bank accounts its not there so who could have taken it velvet anyone who came on the boat me claudia delford gardner the other cops heather farrell sam hubble who do you like i dont see either of the kids taking it they were too rattled didnt you say delford spires was blasting you and claudia yeah hes probably threatened by claudia in that she has twice the iq gooch said unless maybe the deloaches already had a different purpose attached to the money as in drug money money thats due to be freshly laundered and shouldnt be given away or money to grease local palms perhaps delfords whit considered okay say papa deloache gives poor junior an operation to run off the beaten track from main centers of illicit commerce like houston or galveston port leo would qualify not too far from corpus christi or san antonio only hours from major markets like houston and austin and not too far from south padre where your seasonal business is junior would mix well with the college students the old frat party guy with a thick wad of cash gooch stared out at the darkness the outlines of the pines etched in black of course the frat boys and sorority girls would be laughing at junior behind their hands are you ever going to tell me what happened back there in beaumont jesus quit bitching not a hair on their sainted little asses was hurt youve got friends in the police department there im not on the witness stand in your courtroom am i he fell silent topic over so what do you hope to learn from this mystery woman pete had called so often gooch asked she clearly expected money when she called pete she clearly didnt know he was dead gooch cracked a window and the thick earthy smell of the pine forests stirred with the odor of gasoline fumes streamed into the explorer you want me to drive for a while you tired whit nodded they pulled over and gooch took the wheel whit moved to the passenger seat feeling too revved to relax but as the nighttime road unwound he slept whit and gooch crashed at a cheap motel off the highway around two am rose at seven and arrived in missatuck a town three miles off the main highway with one bumpy major street and two stoplights around nine saturday morning missatuck was little enough that asking for a local address at the small grocery got results kathy breaux lived at cotton creek road the house was a brick duplex in a very modest neighborhood the only kind missatuck offered illkept flowerbeds dominated the yard and a motley crew of lawn gnomes congregated in one untilled bed lets be careful gooch warned anyone who collects lawn gnomes is not to be trifled with whit rang the bell no answer he rang again and knocked no answer the door to the other duplex creaked open and a woman in purple jogging sweats holding a purple mug of coffee stepped out onto the concrete slab that served as a joint porch she was tall and skinny with ravendark hair pulled into a sloppy ponytail and a bevy of unfortunate whiskers on her chin awful early to be pounding on a door the woman observed in a gravelbruised voice im sorry whit said im judge whit mosley im a justice of the peace in encina county down on the coast and this is my associate dr guchinski gooch interjected and whit kept his neutral smile in place doctor god help us im looking for kathy breaux whit said the woman sipped her coffee what do you want with her a man committed suicide in my jurisdiction and he had called the phone number at this address repeatedly whit said were trying to establish the reason for the suicide and we thought ms breaux might know his mental state the woman blinked who is this man his name is pete hubble does that name ring a bell well do you have some identification she asked whit produced a laminated card with his name and title issued by the texas secretary of state he didnt offer her one of his regular business cards to keep because what he didnt want was her phoning the encina county authorities buddy beere if given half a chance would make widespread hay about any wildgoose chases whit pursued right before the election she studied the card then handed it back to him kathys at work got a double shift its about ten fifteen minutes away i can give you the address thanks whit said the woman returned with hastily scribbled instructions follow highway to the louisiana border where it becomes louisiana fm go straight until you get to deshay memorial oaks nursing home is on the left after the second light deshay louisiana a nursing home a tremble rose along whits spine thanks he said shes not in no trouble is she no i dont think so whit lied cause shes a pretty good renter the woman added as though this were a treasured commodity in missatuck promptness with rent is always to be admired gooch said thanks again the woman shut the door and they went back to whits explorer a nursing home in deshay whit said thats where that ballew girl vanished from the one whose wallet they found outside of town her face has been all over those blue flyers claudia mentioned the case to me it cant be coincidence they drove thirty miles over the speed limit zooming into louisiana deshay was the kind of town repeated ten thousand times across america an unhealthy selection of fastfood chains a neonlit doughnut shop a pair of peeling strip centers a furniture store with plasticsheeted inventory overflowing into the parking lot and five gas stations lining the main road memorial oaks squatted on a corner bricks the color of creek dirt lined the concrete walkways and illclipped japanese boxwoods stood beneath the windows the home didnt look dirty or unhealthy just glum a sad coda for lives in their final movements despicable the way we treat the elderly in this country gooch said when i hit sixty im moving my ass to china where the old are revered i hate nursing homes whit said under his breath theyre like parking garages for people would you rather die young i could call anson and see if hell hook up with us again when they asked at the information counter for kathy breaux the dour receptionist nodded toward a hall that fed off from the central hub shes down in the television room probably doing a little feeding the woman said gooch whispered to whit as they walked a feeding how evocative is there a trough the room was large but fusty its cornerstone a sparkling new tv that dangled the joys of the outside world a trashy morning talk show blared from the set mothers having their mouthy punk and gothdressing daughters made over into pinkangora debutantes several patients watched with blank stares fixated on the lives on the television instead of anything else in the depressing room blankets covering their laps an array of shiny black dominoes lay spread out on a table awaiting players no nurse loomed to greet them one patient in her early eighties glanced up at them as they came in and gave them an intelligent smile she was reading the norton anthology of english literature volume her bony mottled finger stuck in the mammoth book the other hand holding a magnifying glass hello maam whit said how are you today lovely how are yall doing were fine maam gooch said were looking for kathy breaux the old woman puckered in distaste kathy is no doubt outside sucking a cigarette down to the filter as i would if she gave me half the chance she ought to be back in a minute which way maam whit asked the old woman nodded toward a door that opened into a hallway whit thanked her and moved toward the hallway ill stay here gooch said in case she comes back he leaned down toward the woman to see what she was reading she flopped open her book for him robert browning whit heard gooch say goodnaturedly youre not wasting your time on him are you hes a psychobabble bore nonsense the old woman said now when i taught browning at the end of the hall whit found a bay of large windows that opened out onto a grove of mossy oaks in the foyer formed by the windows a bathrobeclad crone hunched in a wheelchair while a spare trim woman dressed in the bright magenta scrubs of the nursing staff mopped up around the chair bad bad girl the woman chirped in a singsong voice reminiscent of a preschooler ditty you keep your hands off your diapydiap now so i dont have to clean up after you again a half grunt half wail was her answer from the poor old woman in the chair excuse me whit said are you kathy breaux she gave him a bright smile he suspected was reserved only for visitors yes im here to talk to you about pete hubble the smile barely dimmed who the man who placed several phone calls to your house over the past week the grin stayed as fixed as stone im sorry i didnt catch your name judge whit mosley i was a friend of petes hes dead her grip whitened against the handle of the mop im conducting the inquest into petes death and id like to talk to you about why pete was calling you whit said you know i would love to help you with whatever this is but i cant talk now im working she tucked a lock of hair behind her ear with a coy little flick of the wrist considering this is an investigation into a possible homicide im sure the homes administrators would be glad to provide us with a private office and time alone whit kept his tone friendly hed heard enough voice to know she was the woman who had called on the boat he was shot in the mouth please she said let me get her cleaned up and then ill talk with you she turned and wheeled the woman around in the foyer then said oh why dont you just come with me while i get her settled and then we can talk a tenseness framed her face just come right along with me whit got the distinct feeling she didnt want him out of her sight actually i need to borrow a rest room he had noticed a mens room right off the foyer he didnt wait for her permission he turned and ducked into the bathroom he washed his hands while counting to one hundred and then came out kathy and her incontinent charge were gone he hurried back to the main room gooch was still there arguing the merits of victorian poetry with his new friend no kathy whit wandered back down the hallway peeking into the rooms one room was tidy with its lack of occupants another held an ancient black woman napping and snoring loudly the third room was occupied whit peered into the dimness an emaciated figure lay in a bed a rope of drool uncoiling from his slack mouth his eyes at halfmast his dark hair was cut in a crisp burr and an ugly scar split the hairline his skin was sunstarved his cheeks sunken but whit could see the man was young too young oh my lord whit said it was corey hubble velvet was awake when he returned wriggling carefully she had worked the blindfold back into place she kept her head turned to the side to hide any lopsided silk did you miss me corey asked why do you hate me so she said to do this to me i dont hate you not at all i love you she wanted to scream this isnt love you freaking nut bastard even as screwed up as i am i know this isnt love instead she said are you doing this because youve seen my movies a soft laugh ive seen your movies am i better than pete she didnt answer he touched her cheek gently tell me of course you are she lied she heard shoes easing off feet and hitting the wooden floor the soft rustle of clothing sliding down legs a jingling of keys tossed to the floor dont velvet said please dont silence again why not corey finally said sounding amused since im so much better because she said her voice calmed with a mighty effort you dont have to not this way i need to corey silence again longer this time she heard the even rasp of his breathing near her ear what he finally said corey please dont she put even more fear into her voice than she felt no talking now he climbed upon her and forced himself on her again she gritted her teeth tried to summon memories from faraway sweetness the tang of lemonade on a summer day the soft pinecologne smell of her fathers camelhair jacket cinnamon and butter pooling on hot toast sitting in the quiet dark of her daddys church on a saturday afternoon leaning back in a wooden pew while he practiced his sermon pretending to snore if the sermon got a little dull him never getting mad pete bedecking her with roses on her birthday but all the good failed her and she screamed and cried muscles aching body sore she told herself it will be over soon over soon over soon it was he lay atop her when he was done his skin sweaty and smelling of burgers her skin clammy his face was buried in her hair and she felt him breathing in its scent lingering on her like they were lovers she so wanted her gun she would fire a thousand bullets into his guts and brain and what odd lump passed for a heart why did you kill pete she asked who says i did his voice was muffled in her hair did you kill him to get at me no answer his seed trickled out of her and she wanted to vomit tell me she said please i didnt kill him i wanted to but i didnt liar she couldnt hide her contempt he sat up going on his knees straddling her and slapped her hard once twice three times her ears rang blood leaked from her nose he stopped she felt his erection return pressed into her breasts i thought i was your darling she managed he made a guttural sound she could feel his legs shivering against hers velvet wet her lips tasted her own blood pete loved you corey he only wanted to help you another low laugh do you want me to love you corey maybe i could she heard him laugh but not move i cant love you if i dont know you though she said you love whit mosley his voice grew distant i saw you hug him i sure as hell dont love him i hate his guts dont hate his guts i might bring them to you velvets tongue felt stuck she expected him to rape her again but instead he clambered off the bed she heard him gathering his clothes and then the door shutting behind him in a minute or so the soft hiss of a shower began to run he was gone and he had not shoved the gag back in her mouth with its tiny lock its edged metal lock in the end of course she called david claudia awoke early saturday morning and lay on the futon for an hour her body stiff against the flowered sheets she had no job she had rent she had food to buy she had a car payment she would have no health insurance she had less than two thousand dollars in her checking account and less in a savings account she owed six hundred on a visa card with seventeen percent interest twice she reached for the phone to call her mother but even before she dialed her mothers voice rang in her ear like discordant chimes whats wrong with you you give up a wonderful husband now you lose your job what you want to shrimp with your father theres a future why did we bother sending you to school she wasnt up for her mothers blunderbuss catechism heather farrells face swam before her dreamedged and twice claudia stumbled to the bathroom surrendering to dry heaves of sick and shock so she finally called david whispering to him about losing her job about failing heather he came over at seventhirty in the morning arrived with a bag of breakfast groceries drew a hot bath for her made omelets while she bathed and dressed in old nubby pajamas soft as a kiss she heard him in her kitchen sliding drawers chopping vegetables pouring juice sizzling butter that didnt take long did it miss tough youre just gonna let him right back in arent you she popped open the drain let the soapy water begin its downward swirl yeah maybe i am they ate their eggs and biscuits and juice and claudia rather than talking went under a wave of exhaustion she fell asleep curled on the futon david lying beside her stroking her dark hair she awoke at am her blinds were lowered the room grayish dark she stumbled to the kitchen david sat drinking coffee reading the corpus christi paper he lowered the paper hope i didnt overstay my welcome i thought you might want to talk when you woke up thanks thanks for the bath and breakfast and everything but i want to get something straight okay new steel in his voice she hadnt heard before im not trying to take advantage of the emotional train wreck youve just gone through im saying that out loud because i know how your mind works claud and sooner or later youre gonna think im trying to tiptoe back in oh david i dont think that she said unsure of what she thought okay i just dont want you to be alone if you dont want to be she got herself a cup of hot coffee hed brewed hazelnut her favorite and added generous milk and sugar he had his back to her sitting at the kitchen table and she watched the set of his shoulders his burr of auburn hair his wiry arms the constellation of freckles on the back of his neck she wanted to hold and kiss him and feel him against her and she nearly dropped her mug carefully she sipped the piping hot coffee standing in the kitchen away from him he turned around in his chair you want to talk options delford cant just terminate you claudia he could and did she shrugged its a righttowork state he can fire me at will i had to go back in surrender my side arm my badge i didnt have a box to clean out my desk i guess i have to do that monday are you going to appeal to the mayor ill write him a letter she said but i dont think im overflowing with options here come work for the sheriffs department he said instantly and then stumbled i mean youre a good investigator you could work for dps too or parks and wildlife maybe im sure something will come up i can always shrimp with papa that should drive mama into the crazy house a full ten years ahead of schedule she finished her coffee so what about your big jabez jones case he shrugged he was spotted in new mexico i think hes probably heading back to california where hes got a lot of friends the dea agent from corpus told me they think jabezs donation receipts dont match the figures in his books hes gotten maybe thirty thou in donations and three million on his ledgers mary magdalene still aint talking sits in her cell like a freaking amazon warrior silent i thought maybe junior deloache was bringing drug money into port leo david nodded probably with junior dead and jones running i wouldnt be surprised if there was a connection that three million maybe its jabez laundering juniors money i just wish velvet would turn up claudia said thinking of heathers waterpaled face her car was at juniors condo her purse with a gun in it but she wasnt you think she killed him no i mean i doubt it but who knows i dont know her she gave a thin nervous laugh i for sure thought i knew delford but he turned on me quicker than a rabid dog david shook his head again with all this insanity i cant believe delford fired you he needs everyone he can get does he if the crimes this big the dea and fbi will take it over delfordll just wax his mustache and make press announcements she retrieved the coffeepot freshened their mugs came and sat next to him at the table i dont get how the ballew girl fits in david said comes from louisiana to see jones gets involved in this money laundering and ends up dead claudia explained what she had found about the nursing home connections its strange and maybe i chased a shadow she said but i found well not quite a pattern but a couple of odd coincidences of timing are all your notes at the station yeah but i can get you a copy i mean its really your case david phoned the station and got a clerk to make copies of claudias notes on marcy ballew ask them if ive gotten any messages from outoftown police claudia said he did he paused gestured at her for pencil and paper which she handed to him he jotted notes well this is interesting you got messages from investigators in brownsville and laredo neither police department had made much progress on the morris or the palinski case both women seemed to have vanished into thin air no witnesses no evidence lets call them back she said he reached for her phone not on my unemployed dime she said lets go over to the sheriffs department she dressed quickly and they drove over david made the calls asking the investigator on duty if there was a nursing home near either womans workplace the laredo detective said yes there was a nursing home right across from the taco bell that angela morris vanished from bellewood it was the same one that placid harbor had handled a patient transfer from brownsville didnt know if there was a nursing home near the pizzeria theyd find out and call or fax david back so david called the pizzeria to ask if st marys nursing home was close by no not at all the pizzeria was at the northern edge of town on highway st marys was on the east side of brownsville but s the main highway claudia said when david hung up anyone going to st marys might still pass that pizzeria id just like to know more about these transfers about how they work the time involved david set the phone down you want to go talk to buddy beere with me im not a cop anymore she said the truth of it still sounded alien to her ears you are to me cmon youve already talked to the guy better than sitting around updating resumes and harboring grudges now she smiled at him sure lets go the little lock lay in the nomansland between velvets torso and her elbow and if she moved her arm slightly the lock and its strap teased her skin but she could not move it toward her hand she wept briefly in frustration and then she slept again sleep was the escape door in sleep her fathers arms enfolded her and he said i forgive you i forgive you and i love you no matter what she woke at his touch she wasnt sure if it was minutes later hours time ceased to hold meaning need to pee he asked abruptly yes yes she said she had peed in the night like a baby and the towels were sodden with the smell i dont got no more sheets or towels to put under you right now he said of course not who has time to do laundry when youre busy kidnapping and raping she thought crazily she felt a bag roomy made of soft chamois reeking of dust and fuel go over her head he loosened the cords at her feet first rubbing her ankles for her im taking you to the bathroom now you try anything ill cut and gut you you understand he muttered yes ill be good she answered in a timid murmur ill kill you if you give me a moments chance he slipped her hands free from the shackles she heard the toss of keys again on the floor she slowly massaged her wrists do what i say he pulled her to her feet bolts of numbness shot up her legs she nearly fell every muscle screaming he yanked her forward and the doorjamb brushed her shoulder and seven steps down she was counting along carpet that felt frayed he steered her to the right cold tile prickled her bare feet he pushed her down onto a cold toilet seat she urinated emptying her aching bladder he hummed along a bouncy tune she recognized as i get around i am so gonna kill you i need to poop too she said in a very quiet voice im not leaving she couldnt see him with the sack over her face corey youre not gonna find watching me take a crap sexy please no please corey please no he sounded amused again he wanted her to grovel wanted her to beg just so he could say no if he kills you now at least its over she had acted the queen bitch dominatrix in her movies and now she called up that icy imperial voice do you get off on bathroom functions corey how sad i thought you were a real man a long silence and she thought either i got you or youre about to strangle me here on a toilet he said im not some freak im normal his denial almost sent her into peals of hysterical laughter she gripped the cool bowl of the toilet i know corey she made herself say youre normal and a normal man lets a lady go to the potty in private she paused you do that and ill show you fun in bed youve never ever seen before long silence she prayed a true prayer for the first time in a dozen years please god please help me now please all right he said ill wait outside but dont try anything i wont she heard him step out and the door gently close she yanked off the cloth hood and ripped the silk blindfold from her head the bathroom was small decorated in seafoam green tile at least thirty years old the shower was a stall and the shower rod was bolted to the wall there was a small bolt on the door if she locked it he would hear hurry up he called i am she yelled putting a teary tone in her voice she groaned as if troubled by a pained stomach just a second if he heard her rummaging hed crash in she almost wept in anger nothing nothing to fight with she knelt gingerly opening the cabinet under the sink cotton balls toilet paper disinfectant spray yes he shoved the door open she sprang to her feet and jetted disinfectant hard into his eyes he shrieked and fell back eeaggggh he screamed clutching his face velvet shoved past him and ran down the hallway to her left the hall opened up into a den and she saw a front door she threw herself at it locked you bitch bitch bitch he staggered to his feet clawing at his seared eyes six locks on the door and three were dead bolts these she clicked open and tried the door again still locked the other locks required a key where would he keep the goddamned keys fighting a surge of panic velvet scanned the den nothing on the table except a plate dirty with sandwich crumbs and a milksmeared glass nothing on the small kitchen counter she had heard the jingle earlier when he tossed the keys on the bedroom floor she turned and he charged at her his face set in fury his eyes red slits she grabbed a lamp from a side table and swung hard it nailed him on the shoulder he went down and velvet raised the lamp to smash it on his head he seized her legs trying to topple her and she slammed the lamps base against his neck then against the back of his head dont let him get you down he wins if he gets you on the floor teeth closed around her ankle biting hard and deep down to the bone she screamed and fell to the floor kicking him his teeth tore the flesh of her ankle she grabbed the fallen can of disinfectant and fogged him again trying to loop the lamps cord around his throat he sobbed and lashed out with a punch that caught her hard in the windpipe she gagged gasping for breath he swung the lamp hard connecting against her skull the lamp breaking and she went down eyeballs rolling up her final thought was not like this no the blade stood then sank down again his eyes burned like the bitch had poked hot matches into the irises he crawled to the sink and splashed water repeatedly into his aching eyes she hadnt gotten him so good with the last cloudy burst of disinfectant but the first had been unadulterated hell toxic waste hitting his eye tissue she might have blinded him maybe even caused permanent damage he puked into the sink he rinsed his eyes for what felt like an eternity the pain subsided down to a dull roar enough to where he could read the instructions on the disinfectant call a physician not an option right now god he would make this bitch pay he went back to the rinsing thirty minutes later his hands still shaking he could see well enough to relock the dead bolts and to drag her back to the room her left ankle was a meaty mess and she wheezed but she was still unconscious this is what being nice brought he thought but none of the others had fought him so hard and when the pain faded that fire of hers would make punishing and crushing her sweeter than killing mama oh the fun he hardened at the images even with the pain in his eyes and his head hed hold her eyes open and spray till the can was empty he put on his knife sheath so she could see what waited for her after their chemical games he choked down a halfdozen aspirin and slung velvet over his shoulder he tossed her onto the bed and started to retie her to the posts a knock pounded on the front door youre in a bad situation whit said softly kathy breaux sat in one corner of corey hubbles room watching whit her soaproughened hands lay in her lap fingers laced together her fingernails were short and bitten and she smelled of the antiseptic that wafted through the home like souring perfume hair dyed a slightly toobright red a starved look about her face and hips gooch had left them alone to go perform an important errand at whits request kathy said i dont know what you mean theres several different ways this can play out whit said pretty much all of them involve me calling the police and me calling the fbi what happens between now and then will make a big difference look i just work here okay i just do what im told she kept her voice hushed accustomed to talking around the napping old she glanced at corey propped up in the bed eyes shut breathing slowly abandoned to a world of his own just following orders that didnt work at nuremberg why do you think its gonna work here what do you want she asked i want to know how this man got here kathy swallowed johns been here at least five years i dont know much about what happened to him john john taylor i think his names corey hubble i said i dont know what youre talking about i want to see his files go get them and bring them back here i cant do that i can either tell these folks you attempted to extort money from pete to reveal his brothers whereabouts or i can tell them you discovered this mans real identity and sought to help his brother find him your choice kathy breaux stood and said ill be right back then she hurried out the door whit got up and went to coreys bedside he took coreys hand it was limp and bony and pale someone had created a new identity for him someone had financed his care all these years that narrowed the suspects considerably he had trouble visualizing junior filling out insurance forms for a guy he turned into a vegetable it had to be the hubbles he tried not to think of faiths face on the pillow next to him smiling tracing his lip with her fingernail hey corey whit said quietly corey gave no answer a thin dribble of drool collected in the chapped corner of his mouth and whit wiped it away i dont suppose youre gonna tell me what got you here whit said corey kept his silence the vicious trench of scar on his head looked like a bullet wound long healed corey had been shot the bullet must have obliterated his mind but not his functions trapping him in this limbo if someone had tried to kill him why keep him alive attempted homicide made no sense it must have been an accident but then why the secrecy because the accident and its circumstances if revealed must threaten someone powerful he searched coreys room neatly folded sweats from walmart white tube socks vanillascented hand lotion an uncracked bible in the back of the closet lay a plastic bag of new sweats also bought at walmart a sales slip still inside paid with cash but bought twelve days ago he figured that was a monday an exact week before petes death he had no idea about lucindas schedule but it would be easy enough to find out if she was out campaigning and where she was or where faith was he pocketed the receipt from the clothes bag careful not to get his own prints on it so what did he owe faith a consideration phone call honey im about to reveal to the press that your longmissing brotherinlaw isnt so missing anymore you want to tell me what you know before i call the cops if he cared for her he owed her this didnt he corey lay in the bed like a broken dream not yet he couldnt call her he would need more proof fingerprints dental records the business of proving who lay in this bed meant more than simply picking up a phone and summoning the press they wouldnt run a story without harder evidence and he had none gooch came back into the room whit tucked coreys cool hand back under the sheets corey moaned rasped a shuddery breath any trouble nope the local drugstore sells them gooch produced a cheap disposable camera from the bag and began to snap photos of corey from various angles whit had thought it an appropriate precaution he told gooch what kathy had said so what are you thinking gooch asked i think lucinda put him here gooch gave him a disbelieving squint i dont like her but if her child was hurt shed want him taken care of he is taken care of and his brother tracked him down here he at least was in contact with this nurse here and dies youre suggesting lucinda killed one son because he found out about her other son i dont know and that missing girl marcy ballew she worked here then she vanishes from port leo she has to be connected to this somehow consider this gooch said kathy knows that john taylor really is corey hubble longmissing son of a prominent politician maybe she wants to sell that information to pete and maybe the ballew girl was in on the scheme she goes to port leo to deal with pete loses her wallet and ends up missing or on the run if pete thought corey was in this town why not just come here and get him and publicize the hell out of it it doesnt make sense whit said maybe he didnt know shes calling him from little missatuck texas coreys in deshay louisiana god only knows what story she told him gooch finished his roll of film whit ran a finger along the burr of hair and scar along coreys scalp so you think lucinda shot her own kid and set him up here gooch asked no whit said i think delford spires shot him why would delford shoot a teenager before he disappeared corey told marian duchamp that he was going to kill delford spires i think delford and lucinda were involved he is still extraordinarily protective of her and corey found out that weekend he vanished i think he headed north to houston to the conference his mother was attending suppose delfords shacked up there with lucinda corey finds them theres a fight the gun goes off coreys wounded they would rush him to a hospital gooch said youd think but maybe delfords worried hell lose his job maybe lucindas worried about the political ramifications of her lover shooting her son obviously they chose another route how would they have taken care of him though if hed been shot shes an rn i saw her diplomas in her office it got mentioned a lot in the papers when she first ran for office and she was big on health care nursing home reform he shook his head i dont know gooch but this is corey and he got here with a new identity so how would this kathy have found out about corey gooch asked a web site about pete hubble included a picture of corey and the number to petes answering service sort of an online milk carton kathy might have seen that and realized she was sitting on a financial opportunity a jowly man with reddened cheeks and wispy blond hair stormed into the room he wore a shortsleeve buttondown shirt crisp with starch a succession of chins nearly hid his ties knot im felix duplessis the chief administrator here who the hell are you people and why are you terrorizing my staff he demanded were not terrorizing anyone whit said mildly im judge whit mosley from encina county texas and this is my associate leonard guchinski a judge duplessis blinked one of our nurses said youre bothering this patient good whit said its about time someone bothered about him im asking you to leave were not going anywhere whit said this man has been missing for sixteen years and hes just been found and were calling the police and the fbi duplessis gaped whit explained at the mention of marcy ballews name duplessis grew graypale a return to the main office of the nursing home showed kathy breaux was gone duplessis paged her over the intercom what can you tell us about john taylor whit asked duplessis shook his head as he dug through a file not much hes our youngest patient by far hes supposed to be transferred today we just received a call this morning transferred someone wanted the evidence whisked away dumped in a fresh bed how is his care paid for whit asked a trust fund pays for what the government dont duplessis pulled a thick file with taylor john on the tab who administers this trust a woman named laura taylor from texas austin i believe faith worked out of austin as lucindas chief of staff does she ever visit rarely she was here oh a couple of weeks ago what does she look like duplessis shrugged big old girl type early forties tall heavyset pretty hazel eyes no nonsense pretty hazel eyes faith whit flipped through the file john taylor thirtytwo years old born in san antonio texas suffered severe head injuries in a car crash sixteen years ago and vegetative since the accident he had been moved to deshay six years ago from a home in texarkana where he had spent the past ten years at the back of the file were the transfer papers from texarkana the signature at the bottom a loopy scrawl with the name typed beneath buddy beere oh no whit said oh no he reached for the phone david knocked on the door again claudia stood at the porchs end watching the oaken limbs sway in the wind yeah stay out of the way because youre not even an officer anymore just a tagalong give david a peck send him on his way get on your own feet find yourself a job maybe out of port leo mr beere david called through the shut door sheriffs department open up please he gave claudia a half smile warm just happy she was there she half smiled back they had driven out to buddy beeres address in davids cruiser outside the port leo city limits cutting through a grove of bent live oaks and driven into a small clearing studded with a few laurel oaks and a tidy cabin a van was parked next to the cabin beside it was a shanty garage tilting slightly with age the cabin faced away from the road faced away from the direction of town and bay as though the little house had turned its back on the world anyone home david called mr beere they heard movement inside then a scuffling sound someone hurrying across a wood floor locks unlatched slowly six of them and the door creaked open an inch a brown eye oddly reddened and squinting peered out at them mr beere david said yes im deputy power with the encina county sheriffs department this is claudia salazar you spoke with her on the phone yesterday claudia nodded not drawing closer she wasnt here in any official capacity and didnt want to give the wrong impression to buddy that she was still an investigator one hint of that and delford in his current mania would press charges against her the eye blinked hello yes sorry it took me a while to reach the door i was in the bathroom not out campaigning today claudia asked in a little toobright tone from her end of the porch oh no not today buddy said over your cold yet claudia asked mostly thank you the door did not open any farther i dont want to give my cold to yall david cleared his throat we dont mind your boss is helping us with some inquiries were reviewing when certain patients were transferred into your nursing home buddy opened the door a little wider and over davids shoulder claudia could see his whole face now round soft some slight scarring from old acne a puzzled look he wore surgical scrub pants the kind shed seen at the nursing home a thick tshirt he slid his hand up along the locks set into the door transfers gosh all those records would be at placid harbor he opened the door a little more he was stronger than he looked stocky arms and chest thicker than she would have guessed from the hunched way he bore himself about town okay mr beere would you mind stepping outside here for a moment david asked so we can talk sure let me get my sandals theres splinters on that porch buddy beere said reaching by the door just a second david turned and took four steps toward claudia shrugging a question forming on his lips you wanna ask and then a blast of thunder exploded from the door david fell blood and flesh flying from his shoulder buddy beere stepped entirely out of the door bringing the shotgun around and up claudia threw herself off the porch as the barrel roared again and little meteors screamed past her heat cutting near her throat her hair she had no weapon she scrabbled to her feet and ran for davids cruiser another blast and the cruisers windshield dissolved into pixie dust she was a clear shot in his sights she swerved left hard running low putting the corner of the shanty garage between her and him another blast into the cruisers hood he was laughing no giggling mother of god hes killed david claudia hunkered down by a corner of the weathered garage trying to guess which approach he might take there was a rifle and radio in davids cruiser but it was twenty feet away and she imagined buddy beere the gun steady in his hands watching for her to stick her head out as a sweet target the garage might offer a weapon but once she went in she would be pinned the doors were antique opening in the middle like a horses stall unlocked and slightly agape running across buddys acreage offered little in the way of cover beyond the motte of live oaks situated on the wrong side of the garage to the other side seacoast bluestems grew thick but only thighhigh not enough he could take a leisurely bead on her head and fire at will she heard the kick of his feet coming along the side of the garage between her and the police cruiser she made her choice she slipped inside the garage it was neatly kept small windows offering a hint of light tools were aligned along the back wall a broom a set of fishing tackle an old skyblue volkswagen beetle parked on the right side cramped in the space a trailer carrying a small fishing skiff was next to the beetle she hurried to the back of the garage squeezing between car and boat her eyes ranged along the back wall of the garage screwdrivers wrenches a pair of wickedlooking gardening shears claudia she heard buddys voice ask he said it claudia the honeyed singsong a child might use in playing hideandseek hoping to lure a playmate into the open she grabbed the gardening shears and hunkered down behind the skiff it offered the most immediate cover but it gave her the least room to run or fight she crouched the shears heavy in her hands shot pummeled through the doors just in case shed been hiding there sunlight glowed through the frail splintered wood silence followed and she saw one of the doors creak open you know buddy said almost conversationally to the empty air john wayne gacy invited the surveillance cops to breakfast at his house thats when they noticed the funny smell and found a basement full of dead boys i always thought he should have killed the cops how stupid just to cave dennis nilsen pointed to where the choppedup remains of his darlings were when the police came knocking he should have at least killed those cops gone out with a bang kneeling breathing through an open mouth she saw his feet paddle past the other side of the beetle come out now he called i dont want to shoot up my nice car and boat and ill make it quick she didnt move that other cop hes messy but still breathing come out or maybe i go back up there and make sure he stops she didnt move he began to walk toward the back wall a few more steps and he would be able to spot her she braced herself as he turned the barrel swiveling toward the ground she launched herself up slamming her forearm against the blued bottom of the shotguns barrel it swept right exploding cannonading into the garage wall she pistoned her legs driving buddy hard into the side wall of the garage she dropped the shears both hands grabbing hold of the shotgun trying to wrest it away he slammed the shotgun barrel against her head hard twice stars and sharp pain blurring her vision shoving up with her arms she got the gun above her head and powered her knee square into his gut he squirmed back gasping still holding the gun and she kicked hammering him in the mouth teeth broke and lips opened under her boots heel buddy staggered back blood bursting from his torn mouth she pulled hard on the shotgun it discharged once more in the air deafening in the small space of the garage with a scream he yanked the weapon free from her grasp and swung it at her head she fell to her knees ducking taking the blow on her shoulder he pulled the gun back to its firing stance squeezed nothing empty jammed she thought buddy charged at her raising the model like a club and she plowed back into him knocking him to the dirt floor she scooped up the fallen shears and vaulted into the narrow skiff to clamber toward the garage doors he rammed the side of the light boat with his body and she fell from the prow diving headfirst scraping her back against the trailer hitch hitting the hardpacked dirt the shears were beneath her and she twisted trying to free them from her own weight she saw buddy squeezing through the narrowed space between the tipped boat and the volkswagen he tried to vault it land on top of her but he tumbled headfirst as she scrabbled out from underneath the boat he grabbed her ankle claudia screamed trying to kick him again he tugged her back toward him the shears slipped from her grasp and she saw him pull a long brightness from a shoulder sheath bowie knife he slammed the knife into her calf and she screamed her throat raw in one second she felt her own flesh tearing the knife colder than ice she kicked hard with the other leg impacting collarbone and pushed away frantically grabbing for the shears she smelled her own blood as her fingers closed around the shears handle pain beyond pain raced along every nerve in her body he lifted the knife from her flesh quit fighting quit fighting he yelled he climbed on top of her and lifted the reddened knife claudia rammed the shears into his gut hard feeling buddy beeres innards part before the points she surged to a sitting position as she pushed felt the blades slide along rib bone and the shears vanished into him all the way to the hafts her face was an inch from his she felt the bowie tear into her shirt below her arm the blade catch in the fabric its edge whisper along her skin buddy did not scream he fell away from her hands slapping the shears smooth handles blood seeped from him and she crabcrawled backward smelling his blood her blood kicking the dirt between them buddy lay on his side blinking at her mewling no mama help he wheezed you fucking loser claudia gasped she hobbled to her feet agony lanced her leg blood greased her skin she staggered toward the cruiser and threw herself inside glass from the broken windshield crunching under her buddy beere still lay on his side the shears protruding from his stomach mouth a wet ruin from her kick eyes dimming of life claudia flicked at the radio it still worked officer down help me this is claudia salazar with david power officer down officer down hes been shot gunshot ive been stabbed suspect is buddy beere i think i killed him officer down were at buddy beeres house off fm couple of miles past port leo on the right fm hurry hurry she clutched her leg movement at the edge of her vision through the shattered windshield she saw a woman stumbling from the house naked bruised her face a mass of blue the county dispatchers voice blared on the radio telling her to hold on help was on the way velvet claudia called velvet velvet limped toward the car but saw buddy collapsed in the shadow of the garage claudia clutching her leg pulled herself out from the cruiser velvet stopped stared at claudia then stared back at buddy velvet honey its okay claudia gasped its gonna be okay god she hoped she wasnt sure she could stay conscious much longer and david oh babe velvet knelt by buddy yanked the shears out with a decisive pull tore open the scrub pants and began to perform crude surgery in the distance sirens roared in their approach velvet stop stop claudia called the blood flew upward with velvets blows dotting her face and soaked the ground i need to talk to claudia whit said into the phone she dont work here no more judge the weekend police department dispatcher a lady named trudy told him delford fired her she went and raised holy hell with the hubbles and he canned her hell over what that girl they pulled out of the bay the one that found pete hubbles body apparently she had something going on with sam hubble and sams disappeared although delford dont want to put out an apb i heard him and claud arguing about it delfords furious with claudia i dont even dare say her name aloud when hes around she quickly told him about junior deloache heather farrell all the whirl of death since he left town god almighty claudia fired heather and junior dead sam missing jesus his stomach tottered on the lip of a pit i need spiress home and pager numbers trudy gave him the numbers he dialed delfords number no answer he tried the pager number keyed in the nursing homes number hoping for a quick response think think buddy beere knew about corey hubble perhaps even assisted in the grand deception pete had found out where corey was and buddy silenced him perhaps silenced marcy ballew as well but how did buddy learn that pete had found corey who knew what pete knew not even velvet hed kept even her in the dark not kathy killing pete meant no money and whit didnt even know if she knew buddy beere they authorized him to be moved felix duplessis said again sitting in his chair staring at whit his face sagged with the worn look of someone who suspects a good day will not come in the immediate future the call came this morning she insisted he be moved to a home up in shreveport immediately she gooch asked johns trustee duplessis said laura taylor let me have her number please whit said aside from the austin number was a area code texas coastal bend duplessis clicked on his speakerphone and whit dialed the phone chirped and a womans voice answered hello duplessis said miz taylor a pause yes this is she she sounded tired anxious and exactly like faith hubble whit leaned over the phone still silent his eyes closed this is felix duplessis at memorial oaks in deshay how are you all right have you moved john yet theres been a delay here maam he has to be moved immediately to the home in shreveport thats what we pay for immediately well yes maam but weve had a problem duplessis said theres a gentleman whit stood by the speakerphone and leaned down faith its whit im here i found corey no answer from the other end of the line faith whit tried again are you there im here she finally said why does corey have to be moved so quickly i and as soon as he asked the question he saw his own logic misfire pete had died because he learned the secret the secret the other hubbles had cultivated and manufactured but neither faith nor lucinda knew of his plans for the movie that he was bloodhounding coreys trail pete would have had only one confidant one person he needed to turn against the hubbles is it sam whit asked it is sam hes run off he may be on his way there her voice broke whit dont let him do anything stupid please he killed pete whit said he killed his own father goddamn it faith you knew if sam is there please dont hurt him dont hurt him whit turned to felix duplessis we need to move corey i mean john or get guards here one of the two now now wait a second we just got to get this sorted out duplessis said and through the blinds whit saw a bmw slide crookedly into a parking space bumping a van a lanky figure loped toward the nursing homes front door faith hes here whit said sams just pulled up do you know if hes armed gooch bolted from the room dont hurt him faith screamed please whit ran out of the office he spotted gooch heading toward coreys room pushing the wheelchaired patients back into their rooms telling the aides to get them out of the hallway the aides collecting the breakfast trays began to argue with him call the police now whit yelled back at duplessis his yell made the hallway go silent whit faith screamed from the phone dont hurt him hes my baby dont and her voice vanished as duplessis jabbed a button and dialed whit reached the lobby just as sam hubble wearing a denim jacket and dark glasses left the information desk with a nod heading toward the north ward of rooms sam whit yelled sam hubble turned you fucker sam reached behind him pulling a ruger from its tucked spot in the back of his jeans hidden by a baggy tshirt he pointed it at whits head six feet away the woman at the information desk screamed and ran down the other hallway its over sam whit said holding his palms up its over i just talked with your mother she wants to talk to you give me the gun and lets go to the office and talk with her you fuck my mother so you think you can tell me what to do sam narrowed his eyes into a hateful stare i dont think it works that way he knew oh damn he knew like corey knew years ago i dont want you to get hurt your mothers on the phone she wants to talk with you i hate you sam said why did you have to come here drag her into this its over whit repeated the only person pete would have trusted with the whole story of what he found was you youre the only one he would have told because he wanted you to be with him he had dirt so bad on your mother and your grandmother that he actually might have won custody from them so he told you what happened to your uncle corey but you decided to side with the home team your grandmother and your mother you didnt want pete ruining their lives so you ended his he softened his tone its over sam put it down shut your mouth sam gestured with the ruger he glanced at the others in the lobby a woman visiting a wheelchairbound man both cowering by a coffee table i start shooting and maybe i dont start with you theres no point in hurting anyone else the police are on their way give me the gun and lets go talk to your mom no sam backed down the hall keeping the gun leveled at whit whit followed him slowly pete told you what he thought you should know about your perfect family all to convince you to be on his side sam hurried down the hallway residents and aides and nurses scrambling and screaming hurrying into rooms at the end of the hall whit saw gooch move out from coreys room then duck back in he was lying sam managed he bumped into a food tray trolley shoved it over fish sticks and macaroni greased the floor the gun shook in his hand the boy began to cry whit kept his voice even his movement even with sams close but not too close monday night he thinks hes spending it with you he sends velvet away and maybe you call tell him you need some time to think hes alone your friend heather goes to see him you hide out on an empty boat nearby maybe had she been befriending him for you spying on him they drink she flirts maybe she sets up the camera for him you sneak aboard he strips and gets on the bed maybe she strips and you come into the room shove the gun in his mouth and fire or she does which was it heather didnt do nothing sam whispered stop saying that hes dead your familys safe and you found a bonus a half million in cash youve also got his computer and all his notes on corey heather pretends to find the body but when your fathers other associations start producing questions you produce a suicide note and pete conveniently confesses to his own brothers accidental death just so no one bothers to pick up looking for corey sam stopped they stood ten feet away from the end of the hall near coreys room the screams had died down as the terrified clients took cover except for one rasping old womans voice calling from a nearby room nurse nurse i couldnt let him couldnt let him do this to us tears streamed from sams eyes i know you were just trying to help your grandmother sam your mothers on the phone down at the office she wants to talk to you give me the gun and come with me we know how all this happened theres nothing to be gained from hurting corey or anyone else a shrill of sirens screamed in the parking lot a hard light gleamed in the boys eyes sam muttered fuck you and gooch launched himself from the door piledriving the boy down smashing a fist against the boys wrist the pistol fell and whit grabbed it sam wriggled beneath gooch cursing crying gooch yanked him to his feet holding him with one massive arm you okay he asked whit whit watched sams face yeah sam jesus jesus jesus officers charged into the hall demanding all three of them lie facedown whit put the gun on the floor as ordered and put his face on the cool tile duplessis hurried among the police explaining telling them gooch and whit were okay as the deshay officers pulled sam down the hall he sobbed let me call heather please let me call heather oh god he doesnt know whit went to go deal with the police and to tell faith her son was still alive hours later when evening began its soft slide into deshay whit returned to corey hubbles room corey lay in the bed eyelids like halfmoons moaning softly a police guard at the door nodded whit in whit pulled up a chair next to the bed well hello its been a long while i know you and i werent close but i also dont know what you can hear what you can understand im gonna assume its more than we think he touched the bonethin arm under the sheet remembering the smiling boy holding a proud string of redfish aloft the fishings been good this year corey although i sure havent had time to go we dont have a prayer in football season this year the coach doesnt know his butt from a hole in the ground so were all resigned to losing we ought to do better in basketball next spring one of the lindstrom boys is sixseven and would you believe im a judge i know a mosley acting all respectable but it may only be for a little while now he cleared his throat i went to go see marian duchamp she cares about you you know even if things werent exactly running smooth between you the talk went on for another hour before corey dozed into sleep whit stayed by his bed watching the ghost breathe the one true suicide note composed that october in encina county read as follows i deeply regret the things i have done and left undone i murmured that at church each sunday for the past sixteen years and each time it felt like a bees sting near my heart and god knew i was a rotten liar if i make it to heaven ill know hes forgiven me i take full responsibility for what happened to corey hubble and in turn what happened to pete hubble i heard as a boy that love made you do great things but i never figured good love would make you do evil i write this not as explanation but as apology and because regretfully lucinda will not tell one moments truth lucinda and i became lovers before her husband died his death from cancer was long and drawnout and the love between them faded long before he got sick we were very careful and discreet but corey found out about us after lucindas election to the state senate i dont know how maybe he started following his mother and spotted us at one of the motels we used he delivered flowers for spending money so perhaps he saw us where we shouldnt be while we were staying at a friends house in houston corey surprised us he burst into the upstairs bedroom with a shotgun and we fought i got the shotgun away from him but then he grabbed for my service revolver and i grabbed it back and it fired twice once hitting him in the head he was hurt but he didnt die lucindas an rn she stabilized him but refused to take him to a doctor because she was worried about the scandal i began to cease to love her then what kind of woman does that a kiss can fool you but i went along with her idea scared shitless of losing my career and we drove the boy to texarkana where she knew of a nursing home where she could cut a deal shed been doing legislation on nursing home reform so she knew which homes were crooked and might cut her a deal and would benefit most from her protection lucinda greased some palms and he got care at the home we thought he would quietly die but he didnt we returned to port leo late that saturday me driving coreys car lucinda driving mine i took command of the investigation into coreys disappearance and i stamped out any evidence that could point to him having fallen victim to violence i am sorry to the people of port leo for betraying their trust but i was young and foolish and scared i have read a lot on head and brain injuries and they are confounding unpredictable things corey hovered over our lives not alive and not dead he haunts me even now the administrator at the home phil farr was a goddamned crook and hed done medicare fraud before creating clients that never existed after we took corey there lucinda protected this home against agency investigations farr and this clerk made corey into john taylor this clerk was a creepy little bastard who was suspected at one point of smothering a lady patient at the home but nothing came of that now we know that clerk became buddy beere and followed lucinda eventually to port leo and now he has killed some poor young women i take blame for that as well i thought lucinda had killed pete or perhaps his exwife faith i did not want a murder investigation centering on the hubbles i behaved badly i am sorry to the people i have hurt i am not sorry to lucinda hubble and the people of the coastal bend should not suffer her one moment longer i apologize to the people who have suffered so because of my mistakes including claudia salazar who i wrongfully terminated and should have her job back claudia dont hate me i always loved you more than a little god forgive me my wrongs delford morton spires he hanged himself with a stout length of rope his service revolver lay on the floor below his feet polished and oiled next to his gleaming badge and his carefully folded uniform claudia and whit stood on the slope of land leading away from buddy beeres cabin watching the work crew spear the ground with their shovels the men dug slowly carefully methodically unearthing the land around buddys house looking for the mortal remains of marcy ballew and the women from brownsville and laredo claudia stood on crutches her leg heavily bandaged her hair pulled up from her eyes whit leaned against an old laurel oak he held blank autopsy orders ready to fill out in case the searchers found human remains whit watched her her face was emotionless you sure you want to be here its okay you got to look the beast in the eye whit you gonna bring david here whens he released whit asked david was recuperating at a corpus christi hospital having suffered severe bone and nerve damage in his back and chest from the shotgun blast he was out of immediate danger but the road to rehabilitation looked to be long and winding if he wants to come she said not looking at him you havent talked about david much david needs me right now badly claudia said nothing for a long while watching the dirt slowly pile a pair of fbi agents came out of the cabin notepads open arguing buddys belongings had been boxed and catalogued and no doubt would be sent to quantico for the criminal psychologists to purr over all the evidence they would need to scribe their papers on buddy beere add him to the literature of the compulsive killer patsy duchamp given a meaty story had delineated most of the facts in the paper and whit had read the account with a greasy kink in his stomach buddy was born darren burdell in milwaukee with a hophead mother who disciplined her tot with blades and lit cigarettes little darren killed his mother at age thirteen when she tried to castrate him he decapitated her an hour after her death which gave the social workers pause he spent time at a juvenile home and mental ward seemed to improve worked odd jobs fell out of sight and headed south apparently killing the occasional prostitute or runaway one pundit quoted on television opined that buddy preferred work at nursing homes since he would get to see people expire on a fairly regular basis this might also explain his desire to be a rural jp serving as coroner inspecting dead bodies would have been delightfully stimulating for him creditcard receipts showed he had visited deshay at least twice a year perhaps treating corey as a trophy an example of his cleverness paralleling the serialkiller fixation on visiting hidden remains of victims a check of the human resources files at placid harbor showed that buddy armed with a master password had altered the personnel records three times to indicate he was present at the nursing home when he was not the dates were the dates when marcy ballew angela norris and laura palinski all vanished claudia watched the federal agents walking around the cabin i wonder why he didnt bury heather if he buried the others she said in a dead voice whit inched onto the thin ice you couldnt have saved heather claudia you couldnt know she was in mortal danger neither did she i could have convinced her to stay in a safe place stop it whit said she was a coconspirator in murder no way was she going to get close to you or let you help her you saved velvet and david and anyone else buddy would have killed along the line that has to be enough delford could have told me she suddenly shivered he could have turned himself in he had years of outstanding service on his side he could have cut a deal testifying against lucinda you want pearls with your hair shirt claudia whit said he put an arm around her and she leaned against him old friend to old friend they watched the work crew begin to dig on a fresh stretch of land between the oaks fifteen minutes later the crew found bones claudia stayed in the shade of the trees while whit completed the autopsy authorizations four days later whit came home to find faith hubble out on bond sitting on a deck chair by his fathers pool waiting for him she wore jeans a dark blouse a ball cap dark glasses the uniform of the incognito i assume im not in violation of some restraining order she said not lowering the glasses im behind on reading my mail youre not whit said but if my father spots you here i imagine hell say youre trespassing he couldnt see her eyes behind the sunglasses i suppose you will say you were just doing your job she said destroying my son me look in the mirror faith he saw her hands tremble my mother always said i had dreadful taste in men i think you and pete proved her point go see your son at the jail faith while you can they dont arrange visits between prisons youre a cruel bastard i spent about five seconds feeling sorry for you whit said lucinda dragged you into the coverup made you dirty your hands instead of her but you did it willingly for years faith if you hadnt sam never would have had a reason to kill his father you dont know thing one about my life what my life has been like no i dont i cant comprehend it he felt a tremor of revulsion that hed ever touched her she stood we have very very good lawyers and i promise you when justice is served and our names are cleared a straight reading from their press statement he thought youre done in this town you wont be able to get a job scrubbing toilets probably not he said i have a feeling youll have filled that position selected election results from the november election texas senate district encina county tally only aaron crawford r lucinda hubble d hubble formally withdrew from race justice of the peace precinct one encina county buddy beere d whitman mosley r deceased but not removed from ballot whit could only suppose those twelve voices of democracy did not read the newspaper or voted strict party lines death and felonies notwithstanding whit watched the results with a somber irina and babe gave patsy duchamp a neutral comment for the paper and went to bed you dont act like a judge and you end up getting elected he thought before sleep claimed him politics is just strange enough for you to stay the honorable whit mosley savored the beauty of the late january afternoon as the borrowed dont ask puttered out of st leo bay and beyond escudo and margarita islands before him lay the wideopen gulf of mexico the sea gunmetal gray the waves whipped by justright wind january had been warmer than usual the breezes sweet the sunlight healing gorgeous the fresh air like vitamins sucked straight into his lungs you let me know if you get seasick whit called to velvet she sat in a chair face tilted toward the sun she had returned from la for sams trial starting in two days and had been quiet since whit picked her up at the corpus christi airport she had hugged him fiercely but said little nodding when he suggested spending an evening out on the gulf and out of the reach of the reporters just dont steer this leaking contraption like a drunk man speaking of drunk whit said where are these legendary margaritas you promised i knew youd put my ass to work her first laugh he dropped anchor and followed her down into the spacious cabin she was dressed in casual jeans and rugby shirt her hair pulled back into a modest ponytail and skin lightly touched with makeup this was the velvet he thought that might have been if the cameras never rolled the velvet that still might be what can i do whit asked i dont trust you to mix the booze right but you can juice me some limes while i work my tequila magic she inspected the bottles in goochs bar im gonna kick goochs ass if theres no grand marnier in here i strongly suspect goochs boat is grand marnierfree shows what you know she raised a halfempty bottle in victory from the cabinet just hiding back here waiting for me she began to rinse out a blender he sliced the limes they worked in amiable silence i should hate sam and oddly i just feel sorry for him velvet said suddenly he doesnt deserve it but i do whit poured the lime juice into the cleaned blender she had set next to him i thought i knew what family tragedy was i didnt velvet poured liquor into the blender and turned it on whit moved behind her and hugged her carefully she leaned back against his shoulder he felt the flutter of her sigh she finished the drinks and he tasted god thats good he said a tart margarita is my specialty she blinked that used to be a joke he smiled she didnt smile or laugh much he couldnt blame her they took the blender up to the deck the two of them drank and played at fishing caught nothing and listened to a strange mix tape gooch had made smashing pumpkins italian opera patsy cline jimmy buffett sad songs but somehow not so sad they hurt they sang along with margaritaville and velvet leaned back against whits chest the sun sank into the horizon they cooked steaks and velvet blended another pitcher of margaritas the night air was crisp but not damp the breeze a constant caress they talked as the moon rose velvet reminiscing about growing up in omaha whit telling tall tales on his brothers thinking this is it this is life this is fixing her sitting on the deck velvet and whit watched the stars glimmer over the gulf and finished the hearty dregs of margarita whit was drunk pleasantly and amiably so for the first time since coming back from louisiana velvet leaned back against his chest her hair scented with the tang of lime juice the stars away from the smears of light crowding the coast were like virgin light glistening in their first night velvet started to count them each ones a wish you get to make she said whit let her get to a hundred before he kissed the side of her throat dont she said he stopped but she didnt pull away from his arms his lap im sorry he said i thought i know whit you want to make what happened to me right i love you for that im not gonna let what that bastard did to me dictate the rest of my life he was quiet listening to the water lap against the hull but you dont want me she shook her head turned to face him she traced his jaw with her fingertip i got a plan b im going back to omaha when sams trial is done no more movies for me im glad very glad but and so im kind of taking life slower if you and me well it would just be for the short while before i left i dont want that anymore whit she laughed softly i went so long not saying no and now i say no to a guy like you i got no brains he kissed her once softly letting the boat rock them like a cradle and finally she fell asleep against his shoulder she slept in his arms until the morning and he watched over her counting the stars for them both
