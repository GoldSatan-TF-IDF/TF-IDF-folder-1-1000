who in real life is nothing like the jerry fleming of this and other novels in the killer series ive twisted his character in the name of storytelling and hes a good sport to go along with it ridley pearson shanghai china walt fleming didnt want to be in the river any free time away from the office should have been spent applying for a loan of a hundred thousand dollars that or risk losing his house and his daughters to the divorce but credit was tight time short and so there he was along with his nephew kevin kneedeep in the big wood river the evening outing was a favor to his sisterinlaw myra who could guilttrip along with the best of them kevin who would turn nineteen in august glanced over at his uncle looking away from the fly he was tying on his own line what walt asked water gurgling past his waders he slipped on a pair of sunglasses to protect against flying hooks and the glare of an evening sun at eightthirty pm it still shone brightly in the summer sky behind walt a rock wall rose out of the gurgling and bubbling river water reaching two thousand feet nearly straight up into the cobalt sky dusk would linger well past ten during which time the best fishing of the day would be had no uniform once a sheriff always a sheriff youve seen me out of uniform plenty of times dont give me that not recently then obviously we havent been spending enough time together walt said which is why were here in the first place kevin remained on the shore poised as if reluctant to enter the water a narrow concreteandsteel bridge crossed fifty feet downstream carrying the cracked asphalt of croy creek road from downtown hailey idaho west into rugged terrain walt had parked the jeep cherokee in a dusty turnout before the bridge the license plate read bcsiblaine county sheriff vehicle walt glanced east over kevins head up the slight rise at the town he called home with a population of three thousand hailey was smaller than its famous neighbors to the north ketchum and sun valley but larger than bellevue to the south the valley was defined by mountain ranges east and west shaped into an upsidedown v the mouth of which emptied into a great plain of high desert populated by nothing more than rodents rattlers and lava rock you hate fishing kevin said youre all about softball and gliding and your dogs besides thats a radio right a police radio he pointed to the handheld clipped to walts fishing vest so its not exactly like you left the sheriff thing behind are you going to fish or not walt said pricking his finger on the hook as he attempted to knot the fly to the line he sucked the tip of his finger tasting blood youre doing this because mom told you to its true that i suck at fishing not true about myra were here together and i want to take advantage of that its your call but if you dont get in the water were done here and my job at the lodge your idea or moms that one was all mine buddy boy your mom had nothing to do with it kevin waded in up to his knees progress thought walt hows that working out anyway walt asked im good with it walt had thought he might get a thankyou hed pulled strings to get kevin on as a bellboy at the sun valley lodge better than working as a fry chef they moved downstream in tandem keeping their distance from each other in order to avoid tangling lines walts brother robert had taught his son to flyfish at the ripe old age of eight kevin had taken to it like a prodigy walt studied kevins technique hoping some of it might rub off on him he tried casting his line were trying to hook them not whip them to death kevin said sounding just like robert haha walt replied a lump in his throat less wrist walt stiffened his arm his second try was an improvement thanks no charge walts radio crackled he and kevin exchanged a look ive got to monitor it thats all promise walt bit his tongue kevin was asking the impossible and they both knew it christopher cantell couldnt avoid looking at himself in a mirrorany mirrora windows reflection a shiny hubcap waiting in the sun valley airports parking lot he was unaware that hed turned the rearview mirror of the rented yukon his direction it wasnt that he considered himself outrageously handsome in fact his attention focused on the flaws the crowsfeet framing his dark eyes the fans at the base of his earlobes the asymmetrical black eyebrows the smirk on his thin lips that so many found offensive when it was nothing more than genetics his father having suffered the same slash mouth but the habit of looking was a tic a kind of illness he suffered that he couldnt stop that he hated so much he lived in constant denial of its existence it wasnt really him this vanity and if not him then someone else which implied a case of mild schizophrenia something more troubling than the vanity itself the busier he kept the better more focused less selfaware all his adult life hed sought out impossible tasks with enormous consequences some might call him an everyday thief but he considered that an insult he could outsmart the smartest and steal what couldnt be stolen he thought of himself more as a magician making valuable objects including cash disappear the bigger the risk the better anything to keep him from seeing those two faces in the mirror the courier wasnt much to look at either he had a purple birthmark on his neck that extended beyond the open collar of his green golf shirt and he looked a little soft though cantell wasnt buying it couriers with branson risk knew their stuff this guy was certain to put up a fight if given half a chance but cantells plan eliminated chance altogether the courier mustnt be allowed to place a call or use a pager cantell suspected he was carrying two gps transmittersone inside his phone or blackberry the other secreted in the oversized black carbonfiber briefcase in his custody cantell watched as the courier slipped behind the wheel of a ford taurus cantell had expected a bigger rental an expedition suburban or yukon like his but neither the make nor the size of the car bothered him his team was well prepared hed spent the past two months and a good deal of money planning and scripting the events of the next few days he liked to make things complicated law enforcement couldnt handle complicated theirs was a world of systems records and repetition he adjusted the rearview mirrorwhat the hell was it aiming at him forto see out the back of the yukon he used the nextels directconnect feature to broadcast his report to the others its a metallicblue taurus leaving now idaho plate victoralphafiveseventwo im the black yukon pulling up right behind him matt in position came the nasal reply lorraine said cantell the full cycle is two minutes twenty on my mark were currently fortyfive seconds into green she said cantell tracked the second hand on his watch mark im in position pulling up to the attendant now cantell reported okay the taurus is in play cantell rolled down his window and handed over his parking ticket to the woman attendant who clearly didnt catch that cantell was holding it by the edges to avoid leaving prints the first half hour of parking was free the display showed amount you owe have a nice day the attendant said cantell rolled up the window the redandwhitestriped restraining bar lifted the yukon followed the taurus out through a lightindustrial park the airport access road passed the hailey post office where the two vehicles stopped for a red light on the green they turned left onto main streetstate highway with the taurus now behind a red tow truck cantell pulled even with the wrecker preventing the taurus or any other vehicle from passing traffic was moving at a steady twentyfive miles per hour just as the posted signs required small towns he thought as main street angled north passing a medical clinic cantell got a good look at the towns main traffic light it was yellow two blocks to go passing elm cantell announced each of his three team members checked in the operation was a go the light changed to red traffic slowed and stopped cantell looked out at the pavement between his yukon and the wrecker to the left the evening light made a shadow on the road that came snaking from under the wrecker it was cast by matt salvo who hung upside down from the undercarriage salvo was already moving toward the back of the tow truck had the light stayed red only a few seconds longer but it was not to be the light turned green and traffic rolled ive got your twenty lorraine announced showtime cantell spotted five feet seven inches of wellpacked california girl on the next corner she had her hands on a baby carriage and her eyes on the prize hed met her at the telluride film festival and had been with her for the three years since she pushed the stroller off the curb and into the pedestrian crossing idaho law required traffic to yield he and the wrecker braked together they blocked all trailing traffic not a single car horn sounded in protest small towns cantell watched matts shadow move all the way to the back of the wrecker lorraine in the pedestrian crossing now dropped her bag hitting the pavement it spilled out pampers a babys bottle and a stuffed toy as she scrambled to reclaim the contents cantell popped his door and hurried to help her before some other goodnatured soul felt obliged to do so small towns he made a dramatic effort to search beneath the wrecker as if something had been lost under there he then stood and motioned for the driver to back up the tow truck to where it nearly hit the taurus he looked again and came up with one of the stuffed animalsall a ruse beneath the wrecker matt salvo released his harness and dropped to the pavement he quickly fed a tube through the tauruss grille and into the vehicles freshair intake he then turned the valve on a small tank the size of a fire extinguisher that was attached to the wreckers undercarriage he freed the tow trucks hook reached under the taurus and found the tow ring with it hooks on he announced into his headset ten seconds to green lorraine told cantell under her breath she made a show of thanking him for his help he hurried back into the yukon just as the traffic light changed salvo grabbed the undercarriage and clipped himself back into the harness he worked the hydraulic controls from there as the wreckers engine labored the tauruss front tires lifted off the pavement cantell once again behind the wheel of the yukon stole a look at the taurus the driver was slumped against the side window were a go he announced into the nextel he fastened his seat belt stretching to sneak a look at his face in the rearview mirror the traffic lights leftlane arrow turned green roger threw his hand out the window of the tow truck and made the turn from the center lane tethered to the truck in front of it the taurus swung left from thirtyfive thousand feet the two pivotirrigated parcels of farmland looked like large green eyes above a smile of curving mountains summer sumner peeled herself away from the window of her fathers prized learjet to glimpse him across the aisle contemplating a laptop open on the collapsible mahogany table that separated a pair of leather club seats each the size of a recliner his airphone was pinched beneath his chin the lear could seat eight including mandy the flight attendant mandy wasnt on this trip however which told summer more about the familys financial picture than her father teddy probably intended summer relished her fathers panicstricken expression as he ran his twohundreddollar fountain pen across a notepad he wore his fatigue well few would have guessed hed celebrated sixty a few years earlier the golf tan helped so did tanya his personal trainer summer enjoyed hearing the tension in his voice she turned her attention back out the window but secretly kept an eye on him in its reflection if you know yourself but not your enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat and he thought she never listened to him how much teddy sumner barked into the airphone what exactly are we talking about shortterm he danced the pen through his fingers like some kind of circus act to her just another example of too much time spent at a desk he dared a look in her direction she hoped he wouldnt say anything she had no intention of ever speaking to him again okay sevens doable he said how soon he listened for a moment no not possible a month at the earliest sixty to ninety days is more like it he grimaced listen i would if i could but this is my last trip on it let me get this straight seven will put a clamp on it twopointtwo to tie it off he ran his hand across his mouth a gesture signaling pentup frustration and potential anger they knew each other all too well summer wasnt about to start feeling sorry for him hed explained their financial situation as being fluid but she knew more than she should have hed cobbled together some televisioncommercial work to help pay preproduction costs of a feature film that was never going to get off the ground he owed payments on several loans all of them large he couldnt face that he was a onehit wonder mastermind had been his only success and without the foreign box office even it would have failed compounding his frustration no doubt his wife had started up that film not him summers mother had been the successful filmmaker and she was gone now gone for good she squirmed in her seat wishing hed allowed her to stay behind in la shed given in too easily he had an eleanor roosevelt quote for that no one can make you feel inferior without your permission so when had she given him her permission anyway i know i know i know he repeated into the phone his unpredictable temper barely contained i will okay listen were landing in a minute ive got to hang up he paused yeah okay you too he hung up she braced herself for what was coming she became his verbal punching bag when things went south which basically was all the time he would apologize later as if that made it all okay so he asked what do you think pretty isnt it she didnt breathe shed not expected a tour guide are we going to go through the whole weekend with you not talking to me he got his answer its not right not at seventeen somewhere inside you know that and dont compare it with my meeting your mother because that was completely different and we both know it it was at a country club our parents already knowing one another having socialized together it wasnt some twentytwoyearold brazilian on the tennis circuit guys like that sweetheart thats not you but your hooking up with tanya she felt like saying what kind of training was she supposed to be helping with exactly youll like it up here its like telluride only better more to do really nice people and i promise therell be all sorts of kids around everybody brings their kids along on these weekends she hated him calling her that i can still get us into the mixed doubles tournament you know we can whip some butt with that serve of yours its all for a good cause she thought it unfair that silence was her only available weapon no matter how effective it wasand it was effectiveshe felt robbed of a voice he treated her like she was still thirteen and that it was still bc before cancer dont sulk he pleaded please summer dont do this ive got enough problemsshe mouthed his next words as he said themwithout you acting like this so predictable in the world according to teddy sumner she was the cause of everything bad that happened to them somehow he always managed to bring it back around to her her head slipped too close to the window and her breath fogged the plastic she doubted it lasted long enough for him to see what she traced into the fog with the tip of her index finger an l for loser match the hatch walt closer to the bridge now and still kneedeep in the rivers chilly current tried to fix his eye on any one of the few million swirling insects long enough to snatch it he swiped his stubby fingers at one and managed to grab it but squeezed too hard and crushed it unidentifiable the idea was to match a live insect to a fly in his kit he considered using the ubiquitous caddis fly but was afraid kevin would criticize him for being lazy the cycle of most flying insects included four stages an emerging stage where it rose to the water surface as an embryo the parachute stage where it opened its delicate wings to dry the reproduction stage and then the spinning stage where it fell propellerlike to its death not only was walt matching the fly to the insect species but was matching it to the correct lifecycle stage he found the whole process slightly depressing since it served only to remind him of his own life cycle hed risen through the water of his youth lost his mate stopped reproducing ending up with two young bugstwins no lessto raise on his own how far was he from the final spinning stage he wondered a thought that didnt preoccupy him but did rear its ugly head occasionally like now beatrice his twoyearold irish water spaniel sat patiently on shore eyeing the river mischievously wanting to join walt if for no other reason than out of obstinate loyalty walt told her to stay and she obediently lay down and crossed her paws with her moon eyes and forlorn expression she could and did play him still studying the swirling insects overhead walt was suddenly distracted by the rattling of a tow truck crossing the bridge it had a taurus on its hook but what business did a loaded tow truck have heading west out croy creek road more to the point the truck wasnt localwalt knew both towing services in the valleywhich incited his curiosity there was nothing west of this bridge but a few dozen mcranches and the valleys animal shelter what could possibly be the point of towing a vehicle out of town all these thoughts flashed through walts mind as he swiped at another insect instead of looking into his hand to see if he succeeded he eyed the tow truck and its catch he briefly saw into the taurus it might have been a trick of the evening light or maybe a reflection in the glass but the disturbing image lingered the driver slumped behind the wheel it was not only illegal but downright dangerous to ride inside a towed vehicle walt grabbed for the radio and checked in with dispatch have we got anybody in the vicinity of croy creek he had to wait for a response from the dispatcher the mountains wreaking havoc with radio reception he headed for the rivers edge hoping to improve communication hey kevin complained youll put the fish down sorry got to run now now youre leaving me just then the radio spit static negative sheriff no patrols in town at the moment ill be right back walt called out to kevin kevin moved to the opposite shore forget that he said im coming with you walt broadcast over the radio that he was pursuing the wrecker requesting backup you stay he told kevin maybe with me gone youll actually catch something walt scrambled up to the bridge the waders bulky and awkward beatrice seeing this sat up electric with anticipation her eyes pleading for walt to call for her kevin moving faster in waders than walt reached the cherokee first no way youre ditching me kevin said beatrice trembled at the waters edge suit yourself said walt grabbing for the drivers door but its only a traffic violation some yahoo from out of town youre going to wish youd stayed here pointing back down toward the river kevin said you cant just leave the gear i can and i will walt answered stripping off his waders and dancing out of them he climbed behind the wheel in stocking feet we dont have all day kevin stuffed his rod into the back and climbed in front still in his waders walt whistled for beatrice who raced to the vehicle throwing dirt in her wake she jumped into kevins lap pressing up against him thats her spot walt said you think the road ran nearly perfectly straight due west walt worked the cherokee up to seventy miles per hour the wrecker now nowhere in sight we cant catch a tow truck you want me to drive im dying of laughter over here how bout you use your eyes instead of your wit kevin kept his attention on walt did you happen to see those pronghorns back at democrat walt glanced at his nephew they were moving along real good kevin said they were up and going before we came along what would a wrecker be doing up democrat gulch walt asked that makes no sense chop shop maybe tow it out there and cut it up a taurus nah but a moment later walt slowed and threw the cherokee in a uturn he drove off the road and navigated through the scrub we should have seen lots of dust if they went out there he said thats a dirt road not if they stopped somewhere kevin said the ride turned loud and shaky as the cherokees fourwheel drive bit into the dirt road rising up democrat gulch when walt took the first rise a little hotly the fishing rod slapped the window frame and kevins sunglasses flew off his face walt sensed trouble the pieces of the puzzle just didnt fit together the wrecker coming out croy canyon the person behind the wheel of the taurus the wrecker heading up democrat gulch kevin was right it felt more like auto theft than anything else but a taurus the economy really was tough youre going to stay here in the jeep walt announced his plan already forming you keep driving like this there wont be a jeep kevin said gripping the panic bar walt slowed it down some for the next hill not for kevins sake but because the clear idaho air was faintly clouded by a shimmer of dust as the cherokee crested the hill walt cut the wheel sharply skidding to a stop a few feet short of the back of the taurus the road narrowed here and though the wrecker and taurus were pulled to the side of the road they still blocked it walt spotted two men one working the wreckers hoist to lower the taurus the other on foot already fleeing heading for an aspen grove seeing the cherokee and its rooftop light rack the other took off the man behind the wheel of the taurus was either dead or unconscious walt calmly reported the situation to dispatch then dropped the mic on the seat stay he called to beatrice you too he added for kevins sake then he threw open the cherokees door and hit the ground in his stocking feet he ducked when he mistook a sputter of an engine starting for small weapons fire two camopainted atvs raced out from the aspen grove and headed away from him walt snapped a mental picture trying to grab any identifying characteristics he could but the two men had their backs to him and the atvs were commonplace he hurried back to the cherokee climbing behind the wheel before realizing kevins door was ajar the boy was curled in the dirt in front of the tauruss open door beatrice was pacing nearby refusing to go closer she smells something walt thought for a fraction of a secondonly a fractionwalt considered pursuing the atvs he then held his breath and approached kevin the boys condition matching the drivers a lump in his throat he dragged his nephew away from the scene he checked kevins pulse and found it steady he elevated the boys feet wondering what he was going to tell myra he called for an ambulance and his ad hoc crimescene crew including local news photographer and parttime deputy fiona kenshaw far in the distance a spiral of dust rose like smoke marking the path of the two atvs headed north toward deer creek road he issued a bolobe on the lookoutfor the atvs or for a pickup truck carrying atvs but given the few hundred thousand acres of uninhabited wilderness facing him he understood the atvs were likely long gone he turned his attention to the taurus and the wrecker quickly spotting the gas canister the tubing and climbing under and shutting it off wondering what could possibly justify such elaborate planning an attempted kidnapping breath held he pulled the driver from the vehicle and searched for his wallet randall everest malone carried a corporate amex issued to branson risk llc he knew about the private security company it being one of many repeatedly mentioned by walts father as an employment possibility a search of the taurus revealed a black attaché case handcuffed to the frame of the passengers seat larger and thicker than a standard briefcase it featured a thin slot underneath the handle next to which glowed a red led government work he wondered corporate securities in all likelihood a delivery to one of the many financial moguls living a few miles north in sun valley he heard the ambulance sirens approaching he returned to kevins side the boys eyes were open he was coming around what the hell kevin said i told you to stay in the truck i dont think thats going to help me right now what were you thinking i was trying to help the guy kevin said now sitting up and leaning on his elbows pleading his case i couldnt believe you just abandoned him i walt cut himself off he wasnt going to explain himself you okay he asked head hurts my stomach feels weird kevin rose higher from his elbows to his hands and looked over at the car and tow truck what the hell uncle walt i think we interrupted an attempted robbery walt said maybe a kidnapping seriously like oceans eleven walt didnt answer he hurried to the top of the rise to slow down the ambulance all the while wondering about the contents of the attaché how much if anything branson risk would tell him about it and when if ever hed apprehend the two who had fled before disturbing it walt photographed the sceneincluding the wrecker and the taurus he then lowered the taurus hoping fiona would arrive before the paramedics left he wanted as much of a record of this as possible and she was five times the photographer he was malone was coughing while being attended to respiratory occlusion the male paramedic said we cant seem to stabilize him were going to move him malones eyelids fluttered revealing only the whites of his eyes even with his mouth covered by the oxygen mask he was caught in a downward spiral of suffocation kevin was now on his feet and next to walt cant they do something kevin pleaded tears sprang from his frightened eyes help him someone fucking help him the paramedics moved the man to a gurney puffs of fine brown dirt swirled out from under him like smoke ashes to ashes walt thought when the convulsions began the two stopped the gurney and tended to him but death was upon him in its unforgiving way a series of violent guttural gasps were followed by an oppressive silence and he had passed kevin went quiet looking on in horror longing for a pause button that didnt exist the paramedics not giving up finally got the gurney into the back of the ambulance kevin sank wordlessly by his uncles side god kevin finally choked out lets hope so walt said cantell heard the insectlike buzzing of the two atvs approaching the rendezvous hed parked the yukon engine running on deer creek road at the intersection with harp creek their reckless speed along with the fact that theyd been told to keep a low profile told cantell all he needed to know roger mcguiness and matt salvo drove the atvs straight into a thicket of golden willow along the creek and disappeared they ran out on foot a moment later frantic and panicked the two piled hurriedly into the vehicle mcguiness shouted go too loudly for the confines of the trucks interior salvo climbed into the front passengers seat and dragged a sleeve across his face mopping off the sweat and dirt cops he said sheriff s office roger mcguiness clarified an irishman of unpredictable temper mcguiness was a hell of a wheelman cantell wished he were driving did we no matt salvo cut him off we lost the case a wiry man of thirty salvo could benchpress twoeighty run a forty and contort himself into ungodly positions he was their spider capable of freeclimbing anything the shit had it handcuffed to the seat frame resourceful cantell said keeping his disappointment in check a vehicle approached in the distance cantell slowed the yukon get down he instructed matt into the far back roger between the seats use the blankets salvo scrambled into the back cantell pulled the yukon over he was climbing out when mcguiness spoke up what the hell are you doing my part stay put he closed the car door rounded the back of the yukon unzipped his fly and spread his legs he urinated into the scrub it was a blaine county sheriff s cruiser it pulled alongside the yukon just as cantell zipped up help you cantell called out to the young deputy who was just rolling down his window looking for a pair of atvs we got a complaint ill bet you did cantell thought he made a point of keeping his back to the deputy not allowing him to see anything more than his profile no face to remember news to me this is the road to the dump right no sir thats ohio gulch you want to the left as you enter the highway heading north its up the road then head east east cantell said wouldnt you know be safe the deputy said he rolled up his window and took off if trained welland he had no reason to believe otherwisethe deputy had made note of the yukons license plate that meant salvo would have to steal some plates or theyd have to dump the yukon rent another or do without and so the challenges began but rather than resent them he savored the chance to prove himself he climbed back behind the wheel stay down he ordered are you telling me you just stood out there taking a piss with your back to a cop salvo called out from the back cantell said nothing angling the mirror so he could see himself what now salvo asked he talked too much we got some kind of backup plan were going to get the case right well see only cantell knew the full plan he returned the mirror to its center position and drove on walt walked kevin to the back of the ambulance im going to ask you not to say anything about this he said not even to myra especially not to myra if shes picking me up at the hospital its going to be kind of obvious isnt it i mean what do i say you got dizzy out on the river i wanted you looked at seriously whoever did this attempted to do this they dont know the guy died they dont know the kind of charges theyre facing thieves an organized robbery like this they dont give up easily they may hang around thats in my favor but myra god bless her loves a good rumor got it kevin said id still rather not go to the hospital no choice in that my gear ill get everything together how come its always got to be something kevin asked you and me this family one crisis after another whats with that it just seems that way thats bullshit and you know it when do you and me ever get ten minutes together i saw a lot more of you when dad was alive is that it i remind you of him or something youre not so much like your dad walt said we can talk about this later we can but we never do the paramedic was ready to shut the door not a word walt reminded i love you too said kevin climbing down walt called myra next relieved to reach her voice mail kevin had fainted but appeared to be okay he was headed to the hospital for tests walt would see her at the hospital or hed drive kevin home then he tried her cell got through to her and endured high drama for five minutes fiona kenshaws subaru crested the small rise she parked and disembarked laden with two camera bags parttime fishing guide and sometimes wedding and local news photographer shed been on her way to silver creek for a pleasure fish when located by dispatch she looked good in her forest green silver creek outfitters polo the shirt tucked into a pair of brown canvas cargo shorts belted tightly at her waist her right knee bore scars either from an operation or an injury her left ankle was bruised a pair of gray keens kicked up the dusty road she peered out from under a baseball cap that read kiss my bass several dry flies stuck in the brim along with the bags she carried a grim expression on her face the sight of the ambulance did that to herhe knew this about her that and the latex gloves walt was wearing she couldnt be considered chatty thoughtful maybe and part turtle if challenged she retreated inside herself hed known her to spend whole days in the engletons guest cottage that she called home alone and content the world shut out he never asked about these times she spent by herself she had enough looks and brains to be doing much more than scraping by working three jobs in ketchum idaho but that was part of the allure and mystique of the place phds worked as waiters former ceos played at being ski bums hey fiona said tucking an errant sprig of brown hair up under her cap weve got a body on the way to elmers walt said i know thats not your favorite but weve got to shoot it apart from the body i need closeups of the scene all the details there are some broken toothpicks on the mat of the drivers side of the wrecker strapping and rigging on the wreckers undercarriage some kind of gas canister attached down there near the back and get a shot of the plastic tubing leading through the grille of the taurus plus interior and exterior shots along with a shot of that black attaché case thats locked to the passengersseat frame the victims carrying a boarding pass for a flight that just landed he continued so chances are it came through security which means its not an explosive weve got some shoe and tire impressions i marked them for you he pointed were losing light fast she said im on it fiona kenshaws ability to separate her social self from her work self was one of the qualities he most admired in her she worked quickly and methodically against the fading light of the setting sun fifteen minutes into it she added a flash and a light stand that bounced a strobe off a silver umbrella what was his name she asked randall everest malone he was carrying a loaded handgun in a holster at the small of his back he had two boarding passes in the billfold pocket of his sport coat no way he flew with that weapon on him so it was in his checked luggageall legaland he took care of it immediately after landing that tells me something about him maybe about the contents of the case which is hightech like nothing ive seen as fiona continued shooting pictures of the wrecker walt reviewed the contents of several evidence bags hed kept with him hed collected a money clip holding one hundred seventyseven dollars three receipts all labeled sun valley in pen a tul pen a blackberry and a roll of tums in a separate bag was the mans creditcard wallet containing three cards a california drivers license a medical insurance card a vehicle insurance card a twentyfourhour health club membership card that by the look of him went unused and six business cards so who is he she asked the business card says branson risk llc ive worked with them during the cutter conference personal security drivers surveillance private eye she asked they dont call themselves that but yes essentially that makes the briefcase or whats in it all the more interesting doesnt it though id like to have a look inside before branson risk puts their attorneys to work can you do that i can try they moved to the taurus walt used a pair of bolt cutters from the cherokee to liberate the bag boys and their toys fiona said looks like something from sharper image more like an exhibit at the spy museum walt said you think hes not a spook hes private im done with the front seat she said walt unsealed the freezer bag containing the dead mans wallet and tried each of the four credit cards in the slot beneath the handle none worked to open it he rummaged through malones overnight bag there were no other cards walt tried every zippered compartment the toilet kit the pockets of the clothes judging by the single change of clothes he wasnt planning on staying long she said longer now walt said can you break it open im tempted to try he admitted but malone took the time to arm himself at the airport before getting into the rental maybe he was expecting trouble given the sophistication of the case its contents are either valuable or dangerous or both possibly rigged youre frustrated by this i can hear it in your voice a private courier delivering something up here it could be anything this guy took this job very seriously thats worth noting fiona spent the next few minutes finishing up the photography and then caught back up with walt he was behind the wheel of the cherokee malones blackberry in hand he was taking notes ill email you the pictures within the hour she said sorry to cost you the fishing hey its a paycheck anything there she asked indicating the blackberry a reservation at the sun valley inn an unspecified appointment at nine who calls his family to tell them she asked ill talk to branson and well take it from there but itll likely be me fiona kenshaw looked sad and sympathetic at the same time looked like she wanted to say something more than what she did say ill get these to you the sun valley resort with its two hotels outdoor mall condominiums golf course yearround outdoor skating rink and a twothousandseat amphitheater was situated at the mouth of trail creek a canyon that narrowed as it headed east toward the copper basin the milehigh air was so clean it was almost drinkable window down walt inhaled savoring his choice of lifestyle a redtailed hawk patrolled overheadpredators seldom rested suvs bearing bikes kayaks and canoes were stacked up at one of the towns five traffic lights a bustling portecochere fronted the sun valley lodge a newly redecorated version of the grand hotel that had once hosted marilyn monroe gary cooper and the kennedys ernest hemingway had written part of for whom the bell tolls in suite walt drove across the packed fiveacre parking lot and borrowed a space reserved for deliveries in front of the modest sun valley post office he carried the carbonfiber attaché case with him its cut chain dangling like a dog collar he passed a golf shop a jewelry store a bank and a bookstore on his way to the slightly less prestigious but equally luxurious sun valley inn the dark beauty behind the registration desk wore a softgray suit starched white blouse and a bronze name tag that read sladana and beneath the name croatia she had an appealing provocative accent that also made her difficult to understand her eyes so dark he couldnt see her pupils walt was three inches shorter than she his eyes level with her mouth she had nice teeth a mr malone was scheduled to be your guest he said his uniform introducing his authority id like to see the room if i may any messages or packages anything at all you may have for him short dark purplepolished nails tapped the keyboard randall malone she asked walt nodded i am show voice mail for mr malone you like yes please house phone across from restrooms down hall to left room twosixteen he had been hoping for a fedex package containing a card that might unlock the attaché case his disappointment was somewhat abated by the existence of the voice mail he worked his way past designerlabel hotel guests crowding the lobby barpearlwhite teeth and breast implants golf tans loafers without socks he connected with the hotel operator the man on the voice mail did not identify himself he recited a phone number and a timenine oclockand hung up the time matched malones unnamed appointment in the blackberry walt checked his watch fortyfive minutes late he had little patience for the cloakanddagger that private security firms often embraced they were wannabe spooks he doubted the call originated from malones office theyd have phoned his blackberry so maybe the phone number had to do with the attaché a ransom payment was it timesensitive life or death a kidnapped journalist in iraq an oil company employee in venezuela not much would surprise him given the residents of sun valley whom to call first branson risk or the number left on the voice mail if the person answering the call failed to hear malones voice would that have consequences convinced the attaché would disappear behind a wall of attorneys he decided to hold off contacting the security company until hed returned the call left in the voice mail concerned that the person on the receiving end of the call might be expecting to see the hotels caller id walt first picked up the hotel phone and connected to the operator but he quickly hung up what if the caller id from malones blackberry had been supplied and was part of the verification procedure walt returned to the cherokee retrieved malones phone and searched its contact list for the phone number that had been left on the voice mail it wasnt stored he contemplated his options dialed the number left on the voice mail and impatiently awaited an answer summer sumner spotted her mark as the black escalade rolled to a stop in front of the sun valley lodge the boys lanky frame wasnt well served by the gray bellboy uniform the collar was too big the pants an inch short but he had an agreeable face that was currently caught in a faraway stare that resonated with her she doubted he was of drinking age which put them pretty much in the same boat her father was on the phonesurprisehis face overcome with anguish the money problems continuing she sneaked the second button of her shirt open a crass but necessary step a boy like that if her father had taught her anything it was to take what you want you dont get ahead by waiting for handouts an older bellhop helped her from the escalade this wouldnt do she worked to make eye contact with the boy her age hoping to provoke him enough to come to her rescue instead he moved toward the doors and pulled one open she fired off a coy smile that shed borrowed from a beyoncé music video he didnt seem to react which left her hunting for another easy mark there was no time to waste she had to put her plan in motion they entered the sumptuous lobby of dark wood and brass fixtures alabaster chandeliers bathing the space in honeycolored light foreignaccented voices of the receptionists mingled with small talk coming from the couches and chairs directly ahead beyond the couches was a second set of double doors that she saw led to a patio and an outdoor iceskating rink her father handed her an envelope with a card key in it and joined the bellman in the elevator dont lose it he said ever the voice of confidence the last phone call had obviously not gone well gee ill try not to she said tell you what ill meet you up there they remained fixed in a staring contest until the elevator doors closed she scanned the lobby no one remotely her age maybe the pool or tennis courts would turn up a worthy candidate although she was hoping for a local boy someone with a car she hadnt given up on the hotel staff just yet you dont get ahead by waiting for handouts hello a heavily accented voice answered walts call he wasnt any good at deciphering accents but just hearing it made him wonder if hed stumbled into a kidnapping ransom drop malone walt said youre late complications three twentyfive aspen hollow northwood twenty minutes the line went dead french or italian he thought hed been to mexico a couple of times it wasnt spanish he called dispatch requesting backup the office had eight patrols out at any one time covering an area roughly the size of rhode island he was told there were no cruisers in his vicinity how about brandon he asked his stomach turning hes graveyard tonight deputy tommy brandon lived close by two miles south of ketchum with walts soontobe exwife gail it had been going on for the better part of the past two years though walt had only discovered the affair a year earlier on call yes sir you want me to raise him please ten minutes later a shiny black pickup truck pulled up beside walts cherokee in front of the elephants perch an outfitting store in the center of town brandon a big man with a boyish rosycheeked face had thrown on his deputys shirt and gun belt over a pair of blue jeans and running shoes he walked with urgency to the door of walts cherokee whats up walt filled him in on malones death and the discovery of the hightech briefcase currently in the cherokees passengers seat if its a ransom drop walt said maybe it gets tricky when i show up in place of this guy im going to tape down the talk button on my radio so you can monitor the situation its just us theres a possible time element he checked his watch lets move you get shot up sheriff and im the one backing you up well given our situation how do you think thats going to look not good for you thankfully thatll be your problem not mine youre making jokes walt indicated his radio handset clipped to his shirts epaulet if you hear it going south do something thanks for clearing that up brandon said walt parked down the street to keep his cherokee out of view and walked up a horseshoeshaped driveway of handlaid brick pavers the attaché case in his left hand his gun hand free the driveway contained a small aspen grove with a manmade rocklined gurgling brook the aspens blocked any view of the front door from the street he heard a truck rumble past brandon the log home was constructed of huge timbers the gaps sealed with toothpastewhite chinking walt rapped the pewter cowboyboot door knocker twice sharply the door opened revealing a thin man about walts height with a stubble of closely cropped black hair black eyebrows eurostyled greenframed eyeglasses and rough skin he wore crisply pressed black trousers italian loafers and no socks he had a diamond earring in his left ear his lips pursed in confusion as his eyes settled on the attaché excuse me sheriff he said reading walts name tag i was expecting a mr randall malone walt said it took the man a moment to recover i believe this is yours walt said the contents yes not the case he leaned to look down the driveway and mr malone is dead walt said adding sheriff walt fleming offering his hand the two shook handsthe mans skin was clammy dead how looks like a heart attack walt answered you are arthur remy he stepped back and gestured for walt to come inside good god im a houseguest here he shut the door im a guest of doug and ann christensen walt said just so remy sounded impressed sun valley could just as easily be named small valley walt said dead remy repeated but i spoke to him not fifteen that was me walt said we traced him to the hotel but then where when has anyone called the company the living room smelled of vanilla and from the cutflower arrangements to the chinese silk pillows atop the offwhite couch it looked like something straight out of architectural digest a nineteenthcentury sevenfoot bösendorfer grand piano was parked in the corner it cost roughly the same as walts house branson risk no not yet we had concerns about the contents of the case if a ransom drop then ransom not hardly the living room led to a stately dining room and through to the restaurantcaliber kitchen off of which was a family room with hearth four couches three coffee tables and a glassedin breakfast nook the interior of the log home was santa fe stucco with handworked walls sponged with bricktinted paint remy poured himself a glass of red wine from a bottle on the counter offering walt something to drink walt declined i need to view the contents of the case walt stated for the sake of the investigation what investigation the heart attack may be related to an assault and kidnapping jesus christ remy sat down in an overstuffed chair pulled up to a harvest table beneath a deerantler chandelier walt set the attaché onto the table just out of remys reach malone died at the scene remys hand shook slightly as he worked the wineglass to his moist lips i interrupted the assault what may have been an attempted robbery walt continued because this is now a criminal investigation mr remyquite likely a homicide investigationi need to know the contents of the case so you said my office will do its best to protect your privacy that goes for your relationship with branson risk as well but we will investigate remy coughed twisting his face uncomfortably jesus he finished his glass of wine and eyed the bottle on the counter go ahead walt said remy didnt appreciate being so easy to read but he wouldnt deny himself the refill he returned to his chair with a full glass you want andy on the phone remy asked i can get andy for you he pulled a mobile phone out of his pocket andy cohen bransons director that can wait at present im interested only in the contents of this case remy seemed to consider his situation he looked down at the case then back up at walt he nodded yes all right you will wait one minute please he left the room returning with a plastic card that fit into the slot underneath the handle and turned the red led green ive never seen a case like this before walt admitted a branson original remy explained when locked the internal gps is constantly broadcasting its location if the case is jimmied or violated in any way a hidden camera transmits photographs continuously branson predetermines the route the case will take the camera also engages if the gps track varies from that route were you notified the case was off route i was remy said it went west of hailey thats correct bransons reaction i assume they attempted to contact the courier you didnt hear from them again there were several calls back and forth remy said a good deal of concern so in theory branson has photographs that could prove helpful to the investigation walt couldnt take his eyes off the case if they exist i will have them make them available to you remy caught walt staring go ahead sheriff be my guest theyre a piece of history walt opened the lid inside packed in custommolded gray foam were three dark green bottles of wine cantells team boarded sun valleys river run highspeed quad chairlift at fiveminute intervals so as not to be seen sitting together the views behind them were spectacular the town of ketchum in the foreground then farther east the sun valley resort with its hotels and golf course a second chairlift carried them to the very top from which one could see for a hundred miles in all directions craggy mountaintops north east and west and to the south a vast expanse of highaltitude desert cantell avoided the busy mountaintop ski lodge mountain bikers and parasailors prepared for descent while day hikers huddled in groups trail maps in hand the grid of ketchums streets spread out three thousand feet below the buildings and vehicles looking like toy models cantells team hiked down to a location that offered a view both east and south in late july the ski slopes were a vivid green broken by flecks of yellow columbine and red indian paintbrush that swayed in the constant breeze the four hoisted binoculars as cantell spoke first the bridge he said highway s only bridge was a formedconcrete threelane span crossing the big wood river roger placement is everything no problem salvo cantell said the power pole to the east will block the bike path sure matt said got it roger cantell said you can make out the roof of the new symphony pavilion behind the lodge yeah the golf course is just to the north cantell said the row of golf carts okay thats you before the truck it should look like an overcharged battery or a short nothing too spectacular roger smirked can do after setting the charge youll meet up with matt and we enter phase two you guys will be picked up on the other side by lorraine and well meet in the albertsons parking lot north of hailey sounds good lorraine youll pick them up in the starweather subdivision theres a private bridge there that crosses to a ranch thats the rendezvous lorraine nodded cantell trained his binoculars well south to his prize the asphalt shimmering in the heat any questions what if i cant get the keys lorraine asked has that been considered then you need to get yourself invited back to his room cantell explained matt will shadow you as planned hell call roger in if necessary we need that key and nothing no way can raise suspicion cantell addressed the three remember fort lauderdale he warned timing is everything these wine bottles fell into our lap weve done whats necessary we chummed the water but we screwed it up salvo said we can live with that cantell said it may actually play to our advantage he considered his next words carefully a word of caution to each of you he looked directly at salvo no screwups matt if i hear youre hanging around the hotel pools or trolling the skate parks ill cut you out our success depends on our anonymity he continued none of us can afford to be remembered and matt just for your information sixteen and seventeenyearold girls remember everything its not a problem salvos eyes hardened and his jaw muscles knotted addressing lorraine cantell said makeup and wig aside you cant be remembered either and we cant drug him because thatll set them onto us so its tricky i know she said trust me ill be careful ill have tattoos in all the right placestemporary but he wont know that and trust me hell remember them salvo started to chuckle but she stared him down you want to switch jobs matt she asked hotly maybe hes into boys who knows that would get me off the hook salvo tried to look confidenta losing effort hey he said im going to be the most exposed of anyone you want to switch ill switch shut up matt cantell said the risks and responsibilities are as equally distributed as possible im just saying well dont cantell said you take care of yourself thats enough he looked south of the mountain people like this he said his voice drifting salvo looked ready to brawl mcguiness patted him on the back we cool mcguiness said cool said salvo he was anything but lorraine duisit recognized the man from the photo cantell had showed her another of those surprises that made christopher cantell such an enigma it was as if he were two people one of them so deeply buried even a lover could not penetrate that was part of what attracted her to him this mysterious quality that constantly surprised her but it also put her off worried her he could be so difficult to read how could she ever commit to that michels christiania and olympic bar and restaurant dated back forty years it buzzed with conversation and the melodies of a piano man the splitlevel layout was divided into a lowerlevel dining room and upstairs bar a pair of antique wooden skis was crossed on a wall that rose to a balcony used for private parties if walls could talk she thought as she occupied a banquette in the bar close to the piano with a view of the crowded dining room and out the open french doors to a small patio beyond a man belonging to the face in the photo entered and immediately sized up the room his eyes finding the single women including lorraine she didnt make eye contactnot yet he took one of two open stools at the baby grandexactly as cantell had told her he would it took several inquisitive glances three songs and a white wine until she felt the timing was right she signaled for the check and took a moment to pull on a sweater that partially covered her metallicknit halter top she left her cleavage showing not leaving so soon he said materializing in front of her the wine gave me an appetite im famished she explained then let me buy you dinner he said i have a table for one thats horribly imbalanced no she said blatantly cautious its tempting but no thank you because again the wine i tend to to get myself into trouble that doesnt sound so terrible not for you she had a guttural melodious laugh and she used it to her advantage i have to live with myself in the morning she looked him directly in the eye id love the company he said but i wont push you you just did im william no strings i promise but its the strings she said softly that make it interesting why brush and saddle the horse if youre not going to ride it she paused do you like to ride william fly he said without missing a beat theres an unclaimed stool at the piano yours if you want it i want it said lorraine she caught the waiters attention leave it open she said following william to the piano put it on my tab gina william instructed lorraine glanced over her shoulder catching a glimpse of salvo he was sipping a sevendollar beer at the bar looking bored she ate a big meal lamb shank with rosemary mashed potatoes and asparagus cantell insisted men liked women who ate well she wanted william to like her they skipped dessert for snifters of grand marnier is there dancing she asked knowing the answer and i dont mean rock something more you know standards that sort of thing the duchin room do you like to dance william lets find out he said leaning toward her slightly so the heady scent of alcohol and oranges carried from his breath she caught the headlights of the expedition in the outside mirror of williams rented chevy salvo had replaced the plates earlier in the day and had been outside waiting for lorraine when she left the duchin rooms lights were low a competent trio working through the theme song to titanic the small dance floor was crowded with whitehaired couples a few trophy wives went through the motions thankfully this crowd would not distract salvo he was inclined toward the pompom set as william searched for a table he suggested the dance floor but she declined wanting another drink in him first business before pleasure halfway through their drinks a table opened up near the band and they crammed onto a bench side by side she warmed him up with some affectionate touching laying her hand on his arm pressing her leg against his with the first strains of a slow song she looked out at the dance floor and said so as the two of them stood she saw salvo lay a bill on the bar and move toward the dance floor she appreciated salvos ability to stay with the plan william was a decent dancer as he pulled her to him she let him feel all of her let him know where she was going with this his arms now surrounded her and his hands gently brushed her backside she broke free spun him around and pressed herself up against him as she did so her hands slipped into his pockets he tensed with the contact as she continued to playfully slip her hands in and out of his pockets she gently urged him closer to a post at the edge of the dance floor and as salvo appeared there released a ring of keys into his outstretched hand william none the wiser salvo entered the mens room surprised by the appointments marble wainscoting gleaming brass fixtures leadcut mirrors linen hand towels classical music oil paintings on the walls he closed himself into a stall and worked quickly to take a wax impression of what proved to be an unusual complicated key he arrived back at the duchin room in the middle of an uptempo girl from ipanema lorraine and the pilot were still on the dance floor she caught his eye and pointed to the floor salvo dropped the keys by the post made a final loop through the bar as if hunting for a friend and left it took william fortyfive minutes to notice his keys were missing the discovery came as he went to pay the check shit he said patting his pants frantically explaining his loss ill bet its my fault lorraine said allowing another of her provoking laughs your pockets she added wishing she could force herself to blush the slow dance they searched the dance floor between songs interrupted by a waitress the key chain had been turned in to the bartender she accepted a ride back to the christiania where theyd started im coming off a complicated relationship she explained from the passengers seat ive flirted tonight and im sure i came on a little too strong and i apologize for that im here for the wine auction tomorrow i may or may not stay a day or two more and if i do stay id like to see you again and this time with no excuses or apologies but tonight i need to collect myself and not do something selfdestructive is this making any sense or are you about to scream a little of both he said i hope it matters to you that i like you i hope it matters that if i stay after the auction it will be to see you were scheduled out sunday morning he said back to la oh so if youd like to reconsider i can be very forgiving she answered with a kiss knowing shed just cost him his job she slid out of the car without another word you can pick up the roomservice stuff summer sumner told the woman whod answered the directdial her father had abandoned her after his egg whites with salmon off to a meeting though hed booked a tennis court for the two of them at eleven am shed had a belgian waffle with mixed berries orange juice and green tea she felt bloated the suite was ginormous two bedrooms that shared a living room a balcony with views of the outdoor skating rink and dollar mountainthe kiddy hill she didnt care one bit about getting rid of the dirty dishes and the rolling cart it was the roomservice boy that interested her she was crushed when as it turned out an older guy with a russian accent retrieved the breakfast cart she waited five minutes and ordered wheat toast no butter and another cup of green tea fifteen minutes later a knock on the door drew her to the peephole she held the door for him put it anywhere he might have been the same bellboy shed seen the day before about her height and skinny it looked like his mother cut his hair he was either her age or a couple years older which would work just fine he had an honest face shy blue eyes and his adams apple bobbed as he spoke sign here please you delivered our breakfast too yeah he was fighting to remain professional is there anything else i can get you when do you get off work excuse me you heard me im pulling a double seven am to three and three to eleven tonight why why do you think she asked he placed the tray on the coffee table are there any hot springs in the area she asked it was a loaded question shed read in the town paper the mountain express about the hot springs being a magnet for teenagers i ah yeah there are could you take me she proposed me she made a point of looking around the room yeah i suppose you suppose or you could she asked i suppose i could but not until eight a friend can cover for me and like i dont have my suit or anything and i live about who said anything about suits ah hed turned beetred she had him exactly where she wanted him ive got to get out of this hotel she said this place is totally driving me crazy im like a prisoner i could definitely take you he said are you meeting someone there or dude no its just us you and me right unless you want to invite some friends along but i dont bite or anything it sorta sucks hanging around here and my dads got some private tasting and dinner thing tonight to do with the wine auction and obviously im not invited since the drinking age is twentyone which might lead you to ask why he brought me on this trip in the first place since i cant do anything he has planned and the obvious answer would be how stupid it was for him to bring me along and how i did not want to come but then again he is seriously stupid or can be and therefore here i am im not supposed to interact with guests he just threw it out there yeah so she asked his eyes ticked furiously back and forth he was cute enough but immature so ill meet you just after eight in the medicalbuilding parking lot its over by the inn you know where that is ill find it if youre not there by quarter after im gone he said i doubt that she thought oh ill be there she said smiling but if its vinegar fiona said standing on a small stepladder in the glare of fluorescent lights her camera mounted on a tripod and aimed straight down then why would anyone bid anything for it walt had set her up in the command center a room laid out like a college lecture hall that sat fifty there were half a dozen flat screens suspended from the ceiling and an electronic white board he carefully rotated the first of the three bottles exactly as remy had instructed it along with the others remained cradled in gray foam the initials etched into the glass below the label came into view ja john adams he said the john adams the wine was a gift to adams from thomas jefferson upon adamss return from holland where hed just secured the financing necessary to save the republic these bottles celebrate the united states before it existed but a million dollars its an eighthundredthousanddollar reserve they could go far higher than a million walt said they sell as a single lot remy says his experts claim the wine is still drinkable but to get that price it doesnt have to be you cant be serious theres ego involved since it benefits the center a nonprofit the bids get ginned up to astronomical prices its all about who gets what who can spend what not drinkability the more i learn about this place the less i understand its a pissing contest pretty easy to understand walt continued rotating the bottles she fired off shots does he get them back after this no its on us to protect and transport them a motorcade for a couple of wine bottles all because theyre evidence in a homicide you think other sheriffs deal with this sort of thing it was a question his father might have asked he reacted defensively muscles tensing a spike of heat up his spine then calmed himself down and said it is what it is we have to assume they may try for them again wine is like fine art theres always a black market willing to pay these people were obviously well organized well informed im assuming they have a backup plan she climbed down the stepladder he liked the way she moved enjoyed watching her hadnt realized how much he enjoyed it in fact until that moment they were interrupted by a deputy trying to suppress his contagious excitement sheriff weve got something thirty minutes later walt was riding shotgun in the hummer a vehicle anonymously donated to the sheriffs office by a hollywood star ostentatious and unnecessary most of the time the hummer rode high and carried four easily its roof rack light bar and the whoopwhoop of its siren cleared the three northbound lanes like a snowplow in winter its possible he told the other three all of whom were decked out in swat gear that the suspects may possess paralyzing gas theyre to be considered armed and dangerous i saw two men out democrat gulch now weve added a woman to that were going in small dont make me regret it he could have called up the entire twelveman special response unit but mobilizing the squad took time he didnt have brandon raised his voice to carry over the roar of the siren how do we know any of this evidence walt hollered back walt and fiona had been interrupted by a hyper deputy named carsman the traffic cams you asked for carsman had said poking his head into the command center weve got the wrecker before and after it hooks onto the taurus walt and fiona had followed carsman down the hall to the offices computer lab we picked up the taurus and the wrecker heading north on airport drive carsman explained the traffic cam archives produced color images shot at twosecond intervals because of the twosecond jumps cars appeared and disappeared from main street we dont pick them up again until the southfacing camera at croy carsman continued pointing to the screen he said the wrecker this is malones taurus now check this a woman pushed a stroller out into the crosswalk the traffic stopped and held as she bent over picking something up freeze it walt said she dropped something carsman said a driver had come to her aid on any other day this would have been cause for mild celebration traffic fatalities at crosswalks were a serious problem in the valley the fact that traffic had stopped for a pedestrian was a relief to see walt watched the same series several times the wrecker backing up the taurus making the turn attached to it the traffic cams are what two months old walt said if they scouted this back in june they wouldnt have known about them thats probably the only reason weve got them on camera the system was designed to capture the plates of cars running traffic lights within a few minutes they had the wreckers registration and the yukon alongside it the yukons going to be a rental or a stolen vehicle walt had informed carsman if its a rental its on a stolen or counterfeit credit card which wont do us any good but run anything you get as far as it takes you the yukons our lead for now call every hotel inn and lodge in the valley with parking being what it is most require plate numbers at checkin maybe well get lucky within twenty minutes the yukon had been placed at the summit guest house a sixtyroom midpriced hotel on the north end of ketchum room two twentysix walt now told brandon from the hummers passengers seat one night left on the reservation and tomorrow nights the wine auction brandon said i guess they arent sticking around afterward brandon soon killed the hummers overhead lights and siren pulling off main street into an officebuilding parking lot north of atkinsons market well out of sight of the summit guest house walt and the three deputies climbed out one carrying a door ram the three were armed with semiautomatic rifles flash and bang grenades tear gas and other hardware the group held to a tall wooden fence at the end of the parking lot that screened them from the guesthouse room faced west looking out at sun valleys bald mountain walt put a man on the back door and sent another to the front he and brandon addressed the receptionist and then the manager the sight of brandon decked out in swat gear and the county sheriff in a kevlar vest startled the man he was a tightly wound fortysomething with thick glasses and a high voice walt asked that the second floor be cleared a process that consumed the next several minutes walt asked for the elevators to be shut down he and the three climbed the staircase in double time hurried down the corridor and regrouped outside of the deputies wore gas masks helmets and ear protection walt used a master card key to crack open the door the ram took out the inside chain as the door flew open the three deputies swarmed the suite ahead of walt calling out loudly clear as they quickly determined the status of the bathroom closet and bedroom walt followed inside annoyed by his bad luck then he looked down and saw wet footprints on the carpet he called out a radio code into the room that meant suspect in hiding it proved a second too late a door on the bedroom armoire came open and a naked woman streaked across the small room dragging a shirt behind her she grabbed something off the desk rushed out the open door to the balconyleft open by brandonand jumped brandon was a split second behind her he leaped over the rail and fell straight down through a canvas patio awning that had supported her weight but failed to support his im okay brandon shouted walt watched the womans bare backside flee across the parking lot she pulled on the shirt midstride by the time the other two deputies took off she was long gone an escape route had been planned walt was betting shed grabbed a cell phone off the desk no one had seen her face but walt thought he had a vague idea what she looked like it was the woman with the baby stroller on a manicured lawn nestled behind the sun valley lodge and cast against a backdrop of rugged summersnowcapped mountains loomed an enormous white tent in a darkening sky fiery pink clouds began to melt and dissolve vintners put lastminute touches on their tables in preparation for the wine tasting a preview of the following nights auction items the presenters smartly dressed and deeply tanned knew one another well with the preview being as important to them as the rehearsal dinner was to the bride nerves were on display it was a matter of honor and company pride to fetch higher bids than the competition even at a fundraiser a few lots would sell with reserves the most famous of these was the john adams walt brandon and a deputy named blompier delivered the attaché case without incident the search for the female suspect had failed adding to walts unease although the motel was being watched walt didnt expect anyone to return with the temperature in the low seventies and expected to drop ten degrees every hour for the next three the adams bottles had been transferred to a temperaturecontrolled plexiglas viewing case brandon stood guard immediately behind the case despite remy having requested something lowprofile guests began arriving seeing the reverence in the faces of the onlookers as they approached the adams display walt understood how rare such a viewing had to be to him they were three scratched old bottles of wine but he overheard the discussions the story of remys discovery of the bottles in paris the lengthy authentication marred by some kind of myth straining to be legend the controversy and always the astronomical reserve price walt had posted several deputies four in uniform outside two in plainclothes inside he had the mobile command vehicle the mc parked nearby a thirtyfoot rv tricked out with all sorts of communications equipment all of it donated walt spotted remy crossed the tent and politely ushered him into the grand dining tent where a sea of bare round tables and a massive stage awaited the following nights festivities he handed remy a stack of nine photographs that branson risk had emailed to him do you recognize this man the photos were dark the faces distorted by movement the man in question had been wrestling with the attaché case which was locked to the tauruss seat frame two of the nine caught a piece of his face in focus no said remy you have to wonder how these people knew what they knew walt said they went to a lot of trouble trying to steal that case the adams bottles have been in the catalog for months sheriff whoever did this has had a long time to plan but as i understand it branson risk contained the delivery details to a handful of people im certain of it but they are in the business of moving valuable art are they not certainly they must establish patterns to their work no he passed the photographs back to walt it still doesnt explain how they knew which flight malone would be on or which car hed rented someone at the airport a tsa agent perhaps the case required all sorts of waivers because of the tsas ban on fluids we did as they asked if you paid off the right agent youd know whats moving where youve thought about this have you walt asked its my million dollars sheriff a man has been killed yes ive thought about it we are on occasion asked to provide transportation for valuable art walt conceded as you can imagine theres a great deal of it in this valley this kind of thing is not entirely foreign to me but honestly weve met private not commercial jets ive never known of any bigdollar private art arriving on a commercial flight that was at my request im afraid remy said your local airport ran out of landing times for general aviation given the high volume of private aircraft arriving this weekend that left us the option of landing the bottles privately in twin falls and driving them two hours north or flying them in commercially and requiring a nightmare of paperwork the less theyre moved the better i opted for the commercial flight going against branson risks recommendations so the blame falls on me and branson risk walt said im not convinced this is going to get you anywhere walt tapped the top photograph i need to identify this individual i need to know how they could be so well prepared and ready for malones arrival you believe they will try again remy made it a statement i seriously doubt that tonight tomorrow nighttheyve spent time and money on this theyll make another try itll be something bold daring and they hope completely unexpected the way they used the wrecker tells us that much he pulled remy deeper into the tent well out of earshot what if i could have a local artist duplicate the bottles copy the labels replace the real bottles with fakes remys eyes hardened dont be ridiculous this is an educated crowd not easily fooled i guarantee you just a thought walt said and a ridiculous one at that remy said do me a favor and protect my bottles sheriff dont go getting creative if we need to reinvent the wheel no one will be knocking on your door so do what youre good at and be a presence saliva popped from his mouth with the p in presence he thumped walt on the arm playfully okay he asked okay he answered rhetorically with lorraine duisit on his arm christopher cantell entered the wineauction preview displaying an invitation that had him as christopher conrad owner of oakleaf barrels a manufacturer of casks and distributor of distillery equipment he wore black silk pants a white linen shirt a handloomed sweater of burgundy raw silk and forest green microfibers and lots of gold bling on his hands and wrists he had donned a mediumlength hairpiece and green contact lenses easy additions that grossly altered his looks lorraine wore a copper satin top over tightfitting autumntoned linen pants and ceylonwhite crystalbeaded bianca sandals the pair exuded enough nouveau richness to repel any possible interest in them cantell left the photography to lorraine who even though she was a natural brunette could play the dumb blonde with aplomb she made a point of giggling and jiggling her way around the tent speaking a little bit too loudly namedropping and snapping shots she made sure to get shots with the golf shop in the background cantell took note of the large number of drivers and security personnel loitering outside he was less surprised by the two undercover and four uniformed men probably from the sheriffs office he and lorraine confined themselves to the lots of red wines tasting several cabernets and pinots sampled the hors doeuvres then pulled away keeping to themselves and making a point to stay away from the adams bottles this could get interesting she said already is are you sure its enough no he answered its a bit far and may not do the trick then what im considering fort worth he said you wouldnt why not people were hurt she reminded him mild stuff outpatient material it was a stampede im only considering no decision yet hello it was a blond woman whom cantell took to be in her early fifties though there was no telling with this set she might have been seventy underneath all the work susie she said extending her telltale hand her skin like a dried apple chris conrad and my friend laura cantell said oakleaf barrels she tried to look impressed but obviously had not heard of them its like those basf television ads cantell said you know we dont make the wine we make what makes the wine better in our case its the oak casks cant have a good wine without a properly aged cask oh of course how

tomorrow night then cantell offered her his hand and they shook itll be a blast lorraine said cantell flashed her a look it sure will be he said susie worked her way back into the crowd fiona entered the tent on the arm of roger hillabrand the ceo of a multinational defensecontracting firm whod been a central figure in a recent investigation of walts office he had a robert redford thing going rich rugged and ready for action seeing her walt wanted to simply disappear another junior high reaction to an adult situation is how gail would have labeled it his relationship with fiona was not entirely professional though he wasnt sure she knew that if forced to say hello to acknowledge the pair he might blush or stammer or otherwise give himself away that was to be avoided at all costs he should have realized shed attend should have realized guys like hillabrand didnt give up hed gone after her before during the investigation fiona had pushed back but had now obviously had a change of heart walt barely recognized her in the skintight designer jeans high heels and red silk westernstyle shirt unsnapped to the third button they arrived to the party like sun valley royalty thankfully they were swallowed up immediately by the social crush hey sheriff isnt that yeah walt said cutting brandon off forcing himself to look away she sure cleans up good ill be at mobile command stay on comm he headed for the far entrance of the tent the tent itself was now crowded with guests a confusing mix of pretensions and loud talk that went with wine connoisseurs overhearing such descriptions as a buttery nose and a chalky vanilla finish he wanted to laugh to him wine came in a box and eventually went down the toilet the more tasting that went on the louder the voices became a shouting match with builtin laugh track nearly out of the tent now walt overheard a young woman arguing with a volunteer hostess that she should be allowed in the party the volunteer politely explained it was by invitation only i wont be but five minutes the young woman complained bitterly i promise i wont drink any wine i could care less i just need a minute with one of the presenters who arthur remy its extremely important mention of remys name caught walts attention the volunteer hostess said something walt couldnt hear the young woman seeking entrance clearly disgusted charged past her into the tent when fiona spotted walt she gripped rogers arm more tightly and steered him toward the whites do you ever play that game where you make up what other people do who they are what theyre thinking she blurted out before realizing how childish it sounded forget i just said that she added embarrassed heavens no its a wonderful game the only problem is i know everyone here everyone damn near they each accepted a small glass of white wine what about him she asked the anxiouslooking guy you guess first he said ill tell you how close you are you know him of him absolutely someone intense a surgeon maybe or a broker who lost everything in the crash last year hes a wannabe worried sick by the look of him at not being the center of a conversation thats teddy sumner hillabrand revealed his wife was the film producer annette dunning you know the last look a farewell to harm i loved that movie she gasped she died of breast cancer two years ago now teddy took over the reins soon confirming the old adage that there cant be two geniuses in the same bed theres no such adage there ought to be hes squandered most of the fortune shed made themnot helped any by the crash of courseliving well beyond his means has a teenage daughter i think which cant be easy a nice enough guy who should have been content to live off her earnings rather than trying to prove himself which rarely works you want to feel sorry for him but he was his own undoing your turn she said looking around the tent she pointed out the engletons whose guest cottage she was renting he was tall with a wisp of white interrupting his dark hair she was exoticlooking wearing a shawl from india or pakistan i know michael and leslie very well you know that but if you didnt but i do thats not how the game is played is it okay fine how about the man with the pinup the blowup doll do you know them arent we generous i dont feel sorry for someone who looks like a teakettle you dont wear a copper top like that unless youre starved for attention id peg him as exmilitary german maybe something more exotic like czech or one of the zakis extremely confident runs his own business plays by his own rules is rough in bedand she likes it fiona punched him in the arm his wine sloshed nearly spilling and they both laughed shes the rough one fiona said wants all the attention all the time insufferable fired from the evening news in some backwater tv market like bakersfield more like atlantic city roger said exactly skipped college for a shot at showbiz failed miserably married three times no kids loves dogs little dogs yappy little dogs she dresses like dolls perfect fiona finished off the glass of wine see youre good at this for a moment there was something between them something she found dangerous and seductive at the same time but the feeling threatened her as much as excited her and it ruined the moment for her you okay he asked just then there was a commotion at the entrance on the far side of the tent a woman charged through the crowd stopping only a few feet from them walt signaled the volunteer hostess and pursued the crasher himself he reached out for the rushing womans arm but missed the woman was dressed casually and inappropriately for this crowd in departmentstore jeans a green polo and brown keens intrigued by what the woman might want with remy he gave her some distance he knew he stuck out in his uniform but no one seemed to notice him coming within earshot walt was disappointed that the confrontation between the crasher and remy lasted only seconds remy had rebuked her immediately turning his back on her but she was determined pulling a pen out of the purse slung over her shoulder and scribbling something on a cocktail napkin interrupting remy a second time she pressed the napkin into his unwilling hand call me she said remy leaned in close to her and apparently said something disagreeable her head jerking back as if slapped she turned and hurried out an opening in the tents wall a move walt had not seen coming he tried to catch up with her but became tangled in the crowd one didnt push around members of this set he politely squeezed his way through the throng making for the opening he was several steps past one couple before stopping abruptly to get a better look at the womans face ignoring the hair and makeup the outfit that made her look like a coppertopped battery he realized she reminded him of someone it took him a few seconds too many to wonder if she wasnt the woman in the hailey crosswalk the woman caught on the traffic cam the camera was too high up the pole and too far away to get a decent shot at any face and yet his moment of hesitation cost him he caught brandons eye handsignaling him over other peoples heads to get going out of the tent brandon whod seen walt pursuing the party crasher took off then walt looked back for the woman in the copper top gone not for the first time in his life he cursed his short stature in a sea of sixfooters he was forced to lift up to his toes and crane his neck the duracell battery and her man were moving away from walt but in no particular hurry he took a step in that direction then heard brandon speaking in his right ear bud shes getting into a car sheriff what do you want me to do grabbing the handset clipped to his epaulet he answered wave her down and stop her if you can no way get the plate then take down the registration tenfour brandon mumbled walt glanced back toward his quarry as another volunteer hostess blew into a microphone and began making introductions walt again lifted to his toes searching for miss duracell not seeing her or her escort walt hurried back out of the tent he caught up to brandon describing the womans copper outfit as the two jogged over to the sea of parked suvs the couple was nowhere to be found hows that possible a winded brandon asked professionals walt answered a sense of dread overcoming him hed had her within arms reach summer was having doubts her plan had seemed pretty simple at first but its execution required a commitment she wasnt sure she could make easier said than done her father would have lectured oddly enough just thinking of him whether he was right or not steeled her to her purpose shed left a note on the coffee table in the suites living room dad found a friend going out back by midnight she assumed the last bit would piss him off since her curfew was eleven pm she had no intention of missing her curfew but she didnt want him knowing that hed get in well past eleven but she just wanted to give him a little heartburn before checking her room and finding her asleep the events of the next few hours were critical to her bigger plan her mother with her many business dealings had taught summer how to use strategy the prize went to the best planner the one with the foresight to lay the necessary groundwork to cinch the deal to make the relationship stick you had to get the other person to take the bait without knowing what he was swallowing she would leave him this message tonight then obey the rules and by tomorrow night it would become routine hed automatically grant her an extension on her curfew in expectation that shed never need it then hey dude she said sliding into the passengers seat of kevins beater subaru the contents of the laundry bag she carried clattered he looked over at it curious whaddya got he asked she opened the bag revealing little liquor bottles from the minibar in the room goodies for real he said including four cold beers sweet she pulled the rearview mirror her direction to inspect herself she then pushed it back into place seat belt he ordered youve got to be kidding me you want to get stopped the cops here well i happen to know theyre sweeping for seat belts right now youve got the inside track do you she clipped the seat belt at her waist then leaned forward against the shoulder strap trying to emphasize her chest she wanted his attention in all the right places wanted him to be thinking ahead his cooperation was key to her plan i actually do have the inside track he said my uncle is the county sheriff no way way so are you cool with this she nodded at the laundry bag as long as its not open in the car youre going to drink with me though she said as if fact if i get too loaded i can borrow a friends bike and ride home he said she liked that a planner she let slip what youre a planner yeah i guess so sometimes you either are or you arent you id put a check in that box yeah she said but im no type a not hardly youve got a real thing about your father dont you my mothers dead she said the engine sounded rough when their voices werent covering it an unfamiliar rhythm under the hood like someone clapping out of time the silence between summer and kevin stretched out uncomfortably my dad killed himself kevin said catching his reflection in the windshield proud that he could look so emotionless whoa at least im pretty sure thats what happened no onell say mom lost like a million pounds after he died and i dont know changed my uncle and grandpa are pissed off at each other most of the time mainly i think because of what happened to dad it was ruled accidental but im pretty sure he did it and that my uncle covered for him and that the only reason he did that was because grandpa made him thats seriously random i dont know if he did or didnt hes just dead you know youre the first person ive met first person my age and all you know yeah same here the tailpipe didnt sound all that terrific and there was a low grinding noise coming from the back axle just her luck if the car broke down before tomorrow night how much farther she asked thats the ski hill warm springs side half pipes on the other side river run i board half pipe is awesome ive never skied what do you do tennis you any good summer stared kevin down though at no time did he take his eyes off the road yeah okay i get it he said im thinking of going pro a friend of mines on the snowboarding circuit he has endorsements and stuff like that but i think his parents basically pay for everything he hasnt exactly won anything yet he added you won anything of course ive won im a winner i win anything big big enough the road narrowed evergreens towering claustrophobically on either side sunset was fully an hour away but the sky was all pink and turquoise and full of promise wow summer said about it not meaning to sound so impressed yeah i know kevin agreed its like the town just disappeared thats what happens here the outdoors the wilderness it just kinda takes over thats what its all about its awesome la he guessed is it that obvious she asked i dont mind ive got a bunch of friends from there they moved up here absolutely whoa you and your dad could ah i dont think so she said you dont know my dad she leaned out the window to see the tops of the trees a pair of birds crossed the sky almost there he said another couple of miles hey just keep driving and dont stop as far as im concerned yeah i know what you mean they were quiet again but there was nothing uncomfortable about it silence was usually a contest for her a weapon with the window rolled down the wind was in her face her hair whipping and it made her laugh her father had been hammering this same message into her for the past two years youre growing up too fast slow down and have some fun dont be in such a hurry to grow up its oversold this is way cool she called into the wind yeah he called back not long after that kevin parked the car in the beatendown grass about thirty yards from the hot springs and well off the road steam rose from the springs he turned the key off and set the parking brake she got out of the car waiting to make sure he was looking as he climbed out from behind the wheel she reached down and pulled her tshirt up over her head while she walked toward the springs then she popped the button on her jeans and unzipped the fly she knew his heart would be racing by now she knew what she was doing her own heart was racing too but for a different reason she didnt want him decoding her embarrassment he wouldnt be able to get his pants off without some major awkwardness himself she thought that might slow him down give her more time to make a show of her striptease but despite all her planning as she wiggled the jeans over her hips and down to her knees as she sat on a rock stalling for time while kicking off her sandals her chest felt tight she wasnt sure she could go through with this only her fathers combativeness and certitude drove her on if he hadnt dragged her along on this trip she wouldnt be in a position of stripping naked in front of a virtual stranger now summers sandals sat on the grass alongside the jeans she stood kevin was looking right at her hed slipped out of his shirt but was taking his time with his pants his state of arousal was apparent from across the steaming pool its now or never thought summer she unhooked her bra taking a deep breath hoping for courage and let it slide down her arms goose bumps raced up her ribs she squared her shoulders to make herself look even bigger than she was hoping he was too far away to see her blush she slid her fingers into the elastic of her bikini briefs ive gone this far she pulled down the briefs with both thumbs and it was done dragging the liquor bag behind her she slipped into the water gasping at the heat by the time she looked up kevin was in the pool waistdeep oh damn she said sinking in up to her chin hiding herself from his stare but it was too hot to stay under for long can you believe this just comes up out of the ground all on its own he asked now i know what a mcdonalds french fry feels like hearing herself she thought she sounded about seven years old he came toward her and their legs touched terrified she pulled away and retrieved the bag she passed him a beer it made her feel more in control just one beer he said a woman died out here last year getting drunk and staying in the pool too long so if were going to get serious about drinking it has to be out of the water she couldnt stop herself from laughing what he asked you are like way different than most guys because because most guys would want to get a naked girl drunk in a hot springs and here you are all worried about it im not all worried about it he said defensively but i also know whats stupid and getting drunk in a hot tub is stupid he chuckled to himself i guess when your uncles the sheriff he let it hang there yeah that cant be perfect chindeep she was far too hot she felt his eyes search her as she stood up the waterline at her waist to his credit he tried to keep his eyes off her chest but he strayed youre sweet she said gulping some beer she moved toward him kissed him on the cheek and made a point of rubbing her breast against his arm she bumped against him below water as well just to make sure she had his attention pleased with her accomplishment she sipped some more of the beer he was right it went straight to her head he rambled on about something to do with geology but she didnt hear him shed already moved on to phase two she bobbed up and gave him another look at her front you want to take me down to the airport tomorrow night she said theres a shuttle every i dont want to take the shuttle she cut him off summer sank back down in the water she couldnt have some driver remembering her she had a plan and her fake drivers license was part of it her father was part of it enrico was part of it and now so was a boy named kevin yeah okay i guess why the airport he asked you going somewhere i ah i just wondered if youve ever seen the inside of a learjet seriously totally i left something in the jet and i want to pick it up and i dont want to take the shuttle i hate public transportation because because i dont take public transportation she said and youd show me around inside the jet kevin made it a statement id show you lots of stuff she tried to make it sound sexy but wasnt sure kevin caught it you mean i could sit in the pilots seat she bit back a smile boys whatever how big is it you wont believe it and the seats fold flat like a bed no way he still didnt get it itll be fun she said that time she thought he got it she didnt know he carried a pager until it suddenly beeped shrilly from his pile of clothes kevin moved to the edge of the pool and clawed for it damn im on call at the hotel he said got to go relieved she turned and pulled herself up out of the water offering him a view of her backside no towel summer wasnt about to wait around for a towel and just let his eyes dry her off but getting into the clothes while wet proved challenging so kevin what do you think can we do this again around eight tomorrow night she tried to load the question with innuendo again she wasnt sure he got it he stuffed himself into his jeans and zipped up his back to her the cockpit he said seriously im a hundred percent serious she said you can definitely sit in the pilots seat she was in her briefs and bra by the time he turned around covering herself up gave her back her confidence awesome he said her mother would have been proud walt had brandon to thank and he was not about to do it brandon had apparently correctly written down the registration to the car driven by the wineparty crasher walt had feared it would come back a rental but to his surprise it was a blaine county plate registered to nick gilman the mailing address was a post office box in hailey but the residence was in the starweather subdivision having transferred the adams bottles to a safedeposit box in a ketchum bank following the tasting walt headed down valley walt knew nick and lanne gilman well enough to say hello he was a builder she owned an art gallery on sun valley road they had three kids the oldest in fifth grade along with walts daughters the gilmans had installed a controversial steel sculpture a nude giving birth to the earth on their front lawn that had twice been vandalized requiring investigation by his office she had also installed a quartermilliondollar cairn of rocks on the back lawn by a british landscape artist which had fueled rumors of unexpected wealth not just anyone in the valley could afford to fly in british stonemasons to stack rocks and those stonemasons being big brutes and not averse to ending the day with a few pints at the local pub had made themselves known to the sheriffs office by putting their rockhard fists in the faces of some locals who found it necessary to deride them for their thick accents it was those brawlsthree in allthat had introduced walt to the gilmans and nick having a welcoming smile and lanne having an abundance of confidence and shrewd negotiating skills meant the masons had been cleared of all charges by way of thanks lanne had sent walt a tin of toffee at christmastime the gilmans lived in a sprawling log home on the big wood walt was greeted at the front door by a female employee of the gilmans who introduced herself as betty he was told the gilmans were attending one of the wineauction preview dinners walt asked about the whereabouts of their toyota land cruiser having its registration number in his top pocket janet has it betty answered a friend visiting from california a grad student at uc davis shes staying in the sheep wagon the land cruiser goes with the sheep wagon sheep wagon im sorry lanne names everything betty pointed up the drive its the guest cabin your first right on the way out youll see a sheep wagon turn there keep going until you see a cabin is everything all right a uniform always generated curiosity people had no right to ask but they always did nothing to worry about im not sure shes around i thought i heard her leave a while ago betty said but maybe im wrong i could tell her to call you she was fishing for information walt thanked her told her there was no reason to bother the gilmans about his visit and drove off in search of the sheep wagon he found the land cruiser parked beside the cabin if one could call an eighteenhundredsquarefoot log home a cabin it appeared to have been dropped into the middle of the aspen grove where it stood the whitebarked trees seemingly glowing in the darkness it also abutted the big wood the gurgling river reminding walt of his aborted flyfishing with kevin he owed the kid a rain check walt was about to knock on the cabins door when a blur of movement caught his eye he froze believing it an elk or deer or even a moose watering at the river he cherished such sightsone of the reasons for living here but the shadow moved again it was clearly a human being hey walt called out instinctively reaching for his sidearm a trespassing fisherman maybe but with a woman in the cabin he couldnt rule out a peeping tom and that required a discussion a thief would go for the main house not a guest cabin or a transient one of the dozens of mountain men who squatted in the national forest during the summer causing his office no end of trouble he eased his hand off of his weapon he might be able to run this guy down or at least run him off the property as the shadow took off so did walt his maglite in hand the light briefly caught the man from the back but it was enough to spot the gloves he was wearing gloves in late july walt dodged through the maze of whitebarked trees halt he shouted back at the cabin a floodlight came on and the trees made prisonbar shadows the man slalomed through the aspens increasing his lead walt who prided himself on his fitness pushed hard but failed to catch up he broke out of the aspen grove stumbling over an asphalt curb and falling down hard and found himself on a neighbors driveway the whine of a car engine starting interrupted the rivers growl by the time walt made it to his feet the sound grew smaller he took hold of his radio but had nothing to call inno description of the suspect or vehicle he stubbed his boot into the driveways gravel shit shit shit walt wiped his sweating face with a handkerchief and banged on the cabins front door the same young woman hed seen at the wine tasting answered the door her reaction to his uniform typical janet yes walt fleming county sheriff i was at the reception tonight for the moment walt held off telling her about the man outside her cabin janet had a sharp roman nose some faint acne scarring in her sunken cheeks her pale eyes were a remarkable grayish blue she appeared tired even drained he wondered if she might be ill i crashed it i know guilty okay i didnt realize id broken a law is there a fine or what or what he said id like to talk with you about arthur remy thats all thats all she waved him inside the cabin would have qualified as a native american extension museum blackfoot he asked looking around im afraid i dont know northern paiute he said correcting himself identifying an impressive horsehair basket bannock probably utoaztecans are you a collector i dabble an uncle of minekind of an uncle not by bloodis a blackfoot he got me interested in the culture he fingered a blanket wondering if the gilmans knew it was a fake and studied two pieces of pottery in a glass case your interest in mr remy is he asked shed taken a seat in a willowbranch chair on the other side of a walnutslab coffee table she motioned for him to take the couch but he declined and continued studying the collection arthur remy walt repeated did he lodge some kind of complaint she asked what a jerk no complaint should he have her forehead creased i didnt catch your last name walt said finch janet finch whats this about exactly my office is providing security for the adams bottles walt said well then youre wasting your resources because there are no adams bottles something arthur remy does not want to hear evidently okay youve got my attention he said he took a seat across from her im a phd candidate at uc davis sheriff oenology winemaking she finally said answering his blank expression my thesis concerns the jefferson collection she searched his face are you familiar with thomas jeffersons obsession with wine the adams bottles he said they were a gift from jefferson right fiction she scoffed thats arthur remys story but thats all it is a story im listening the socalled jefferson bottles were discovered by arthur remy in nineteen eightyfive and were sold at auction for nearly two hundred thousand dollars in part because the wine was judged to have survived the centuries no easy feat remy claims the adams bottles are also from jeffersons parisian cellar which is like totally farfetched and quite frankly brings into question the authenticity of the original find she made eye contact theyre fakes sheriff its a hoax an elaborate and expensive hoax but a hoax just the same walt heard the compressor of the kitchen refrigerator kick in there was a tv or radio playing upstairs i dont imagine thats a popular opinion he said all im asking for is access to the bottles and the test results i want to know that i havent wasted nearly three years of my life the point is that arthur remy is a liar and a cheat and everyone is so carried away by the story hes invented that theyve blinded themselves to this hoax hes perpetrated hes going to make off with a zillion dollars for some rothschild bottled as something quite different youve requested access i take it a dozen times and isnt it just a little bit curious that he wont even so much as take my calls calling something someone a fake is quite an accusation i understand that were the bottles vetted and tested of course they were and by some of the best but you want to take a guess at how many experts she drew air quotesthere are out there who could authenticate a find like this very very few and trust me he got to them i dont know how but thats not my problem one of those guys is dead by the way killed that should interest a sheriff right stabbed to death in amsterdam has any connection been made to remy no will it ever be made no but how convenient the man who signed off on the authenticity of the engravingthe glass and the method used to cut itends up stabbed to death in the doorway of a brothel and guess what he was gay he didnt even belong in a brothel dont get me wrong she continued i suspect remys jefferson bottles are legitimate but these adams bottles im sure the glass is from eighteenthcentury france the cork is portuguese the label is the right paper im sure all the facts support remys claims the bottles wouldnt be on the open market otherwise but my work on jefferson reveals no such bottles did you get that the adams bottles arent accounted for anywhere in jeffersons inventory i think remy saw a good thing and jumped on it not fully realizing that thomas jefferson was a freak of nature who inventoried every bottle cataloged every wine he served with every dinner no one knows jeffersons wines the way i do there are a total of three people in the world whove studied his collection the way i have and the other two did so before we had the science we have todaythe spectrometers and electron microscopes specifically arthur remy is not one of those other two i promise you she was red in the face the veins in her neck protruding but you lack proof walt said because you dont have access there you have it janet finch drew in a deep breath the wine industry is based on relationships dealers brokers consumers collectors and connoisseurs those relationships are carefully protected scholars like me were sought out when authentication is needed and were thrown to the wolves when we raise suspicions remy claims the jefferson and adams bottles were found in two different cellars in paris okay fine id like to know which cellars i know where jefferson lived in paris i know where he cellared his collection i know when and where he moved the collection if these are in fact authenticand im willing to go there if thats how it proves outthen i need to include them in my thesis if its to be complete ive worked forever on this sheriff im not going to give up now the killing in amsterdam walt said investigated and closed a random act of violence janet studied him you actually believe me if youre right youd cost remy a heck of a lot of money its his reputation hes worried about believe me not the money if im right hes ruined and i am right ms finch i think youd be well advised to seek other lodging no thanks the price is right lannes a friend from grade school when i approached your cabin just now i scared off a prowler you what i pursued but the individual fled and escaped there was some guy out there are you serious in light of what youve told me i think it would be smarter if you stayed in the main house or took a hotel room or even left the valley remy are you kidding she mulled this over good god you are totally freaking me out it could have been someone fishing or just walking the river right maybe walt said not sounding convinced but still you might consider staying over with the gilmans for a few nights i cant do that i gave remy the phone number here at the cottage hell either call or he wont and if not im gone by sunday morning he didnt like the idea of her staying here alone but was powerless to do anything about it the bottles would be heavily insured he said of course and if stolenen route to the wine auction he thought but did not saythe insurance would pay out and the bottles as well as any questions of their authenticity would disappear i suppose why callforward that line and stay in the main house walt said and im not asking as walt pulled up to the picket fence that fronted his house a house he wasnt sure hed live in much longer because of the divorce he flashed the cherokees brights flooding the porch and signaling his guest fiona kenshaw waved at him from the smith hawken bench by the front door hed given gail the bench on their tenth anniversary he wasnt sure anyone had ever sat in it before it was more a monument to his picking the wrong gift gail had gushed over it unwrapped it on the porch and had left it there never to look at it again hey there he said climbing the steps hey there yourself she said playfully in a voice he didnt recognize she looked beautiful despite the glow of the yellow bug light overhead he tried to think of her only as a professionala parttime crimescene photographer an associatebut failed miserably seeing her with hillabrand had caused him a moment of unease he hadnt processed it at the time but recalled it now feeling squeamish there had been a time not long ago when hed have felt awkward having a woman other than his wife on his front porch but it was just the opposite he wanted to wake up the nosey mrs mer imer and all his neighbors and show them hed picked himself up like gail he too could move on this is a surprise walt said fiona patted the bench beside her would you like to come in he asked he pulled open the screen door and held it with his foot no its a gorgeous night she patted the bench again walt sat down beside her she smelled like lilacs or maybe the bench was scratchandsniff her handsthey were rough from all her hours in rivers as a fishing guidetwisted in her lap hed never known fiona to be the nervous type singleminded independent socially cautious to be sure but agitated and uncomfortable how was the dinner he asked im assuming you did one of the private dinners surreal she said six courses too much wine way too much then he saw it she was drunk did you drive yourself she put her arms out cuff me but her eyes sparkled and he felt tempted to kiss her wet lips im driving you home he said party pooper she said do you know what the brits used to call spirits maybe still do for all i know ive never been good at trivia walt said unless the chosen topic is forensics dogs or wildlife courage she answered okay he said he clawed at the knees of his pants suddenly extremely uncomfortable so im just going to say this whether you want to hear it or not because i may never be like this around you again feeling my courage that is carpe diem and all that and all that he echoed then she said nothing his throat had constricted to the width of a cocktail straw he was afraid to try to talk for fear hed merely squeak you listen but do you hear she turned her head to face him and he felt a jolt i definitely hear he said i promise ill hear whatever you have to say you were jealous tonight she said guilty gail had complained he was never honest with her he had vowed to not repeat that mistake im not exactly sure why its because we both feel this thing between us you know thats true i feel it too walt id love to go on pretending i dont because i dont want to feel it acknowledge it but i do and so do you whether youll ever admit it or not because i saw it on your face tonight at the tasting it made the whole rest of my night a lie because it was all that i could think about you were all that i could think about which was hardly fair to roger you looked like you were having a good enough time youre a better judge than that i have no idea what roger must have thought but the point is well that is the point isnt it i dont know what the point is and theres something sad about it taking way too many glasses of the best wine to convince me to say something about it especially when i dont know what exactly it is im trying to say walt looked away from her out to the empty street and the porch light on mrs merimers cottage he had a resuscitation kit in the back of the cherokee he wondered if shed know how to use it on him he felt as if he was going to blow a valve you are going to say something right her voice sounded terrified he nodded hoping that might do until his pulse leveled off say something walt she sounded dangerously close to being angry im trying he managed to choke out dont leave me hanging here i dont think i can take it tell me i didnt just make a complete ass out of myself oh my god she said leaning over with her head between her legs he tentatively reached out and rubbed her back she was hot and damp she rushed forward then grabbed the rail and threw up into the lilacs he hurried to her and again placed his hand on her back okay he said do i look like im okay fiona sounded as if she was crying could i bother you for a paper towel he hurried inside composing what to say in order to rescue the moment he did feel the same as she but hadnt known it until shed confronted him he wasnt sure he knew how to explain himself gail brandon his two girls the house he heard a car engine start he ran to the porch the damp paper towel in hand taillights a swarm of bugs were circling the porchs yellow light a light that was supposed to repel them a dog barked a block away a drip of the water fell from the paper towel striking the toe of his boot a feeling of remorse overcame him of loss of missed opportunity more water hit his boot and he caught himself having squeezed the paper towel in his fist he turned and headed inside straight to the phone the scent of lilacs was gone squinting through the blinds of her hotel bedroom summer sumner watched a zamboni crawl across the ice of the lodges outdoor skating rink leaving behind a wide swath of clean ice like a glistening silver ribbon mirrorlike in the morning sunshine the bedside cdipodclock radio read a fairly typical rising time for her butand she was certain of thisunacceptable to her earlybirdgetstheworm father hed have been up since five am negotiating some deal with someone five time zones away she felt sorry for him he could never turn it off she assumed that even at the wine tasting the night before hed been talking up some film or television deal a deal that would never get off the ground she wondered what hed thought of the note shed left him certainly hed seen it shed placed it front and center on the table just inside the door impossible to miss as she crossed the bedroom she happened to glance into the living room and see her fathers laptop up and running on the desk alongside a pile of papers and his blackberry there was also some pocket change lying there and his keys but he was nowhere to be seen she heard the toilet seat clunk down the rustle of newspaper and knew hed be a while wearing nothing but a tshirt and briefs she hurried across to the desk nervously glancing back toward the suites powder room his key chain required unscrewing a tiny sleeve that sealed it shut she squeezed and turned the sleeve but it held tight she tried again and this time it gave she spun the sleeve out of the way then sorted quickly through the keys to find the strangely shaped one to the jet she freed it and was screwing the sleeve back in place when his blackberry rang summer heard the toilet flush impossible she thought panicking ill get it she called out trying to buy herself an excuse for being caught hovering over his things he came out the door fastening his belt ive got it he said but she answered it hello she said silence hello her father crossed the room ive got it summer im calling for teddy sumner said a mans voice shed heard the callers voice before and tried to place it her father would be proud if she presented herself correctly this is summer speaking whom may i say is calling her father stood there his hand out wanting his phone is your father there the voice was vaguely familiar but she couldnt dredge up a face to go along with it she handed her father the blackberry thank you he said though he didnt mean it he didnt want her answering his calls sumner her father said into the phone sliding down into the chair summer stood there her eyes on the key chain which shed set down but not where shed found it she shuffled closer to her dad putting herself between him and the keys wanting the chance to slide them back toward where they belonged this is a business call he said cupping the phone clearly wanting privacy her hands behind her back she moved the keys back in place sure she said wondering what was up with him he was constantly on the phone he never gave a damn about what she overheard we have a court in twenty minutes he said wanting her out of the room i know dad she said heading back to her room glancing at the keys on her way out to confirm that shed left them where shed found them gripped in her right hand was the key to the jet as she shut the door to her room behind her she was already celebrating her triumph tell me again why im awake at this ungodly hour fiona asked it was fivethirty am a meloncolored light graced the ridgetops of the eastern mountains as seen from the asphalt of the small sun valley airport she wore a down vest zipped snugly over a blue jean jacket the july dawn registering only fortyfive degrees fahrenheit shed reluctantly accepted walts invitation to a predawn flight in his glider an olive branch hed offered via voice mail following the debacle of the night before she didnt love the idea of the flighther last flight with him had landed her in federal custodybut his voice mail had left her smiling and here she was she nursed a slight hangover with a cup of green tea the glider was towed to ten thousand feet and released the tow plane banking sharply away and leaving them to the whine of wind over the wings and the orange sun rising over the horizon she sat directly behind him her camera around her neck brought along voluntarily this time she took a series of pictures working with the play of morning light as it caught the western spine of mountains framing the wood river valley the ridges aflame with a yellow light that sank slowly down the slopes toward the valley floor outstanding fiona said into the headsets microphone this is my form of meditation where i come to find myself whatever that means i cant believe all the planes at the airport she said looking down a lower ramp packed with parked aircraft revealed itself from the air the wine auction there must be fifty jets or more the glider bumped and shook as he found and caught a thermal uplift they spiraled higher approaching eleven thousand feet were going to dive lower in a minute walt warned theres nothing to worry about okay i want to get a look out democrat gulch where we found the wrecker this is a business trip she complained i cant pass up the opportunity do you want me to make pictures your call if we see anything sure such as tents a campground but im not expecting to see anything those two fled north and we never saw any hint of them thats been bothering me have i been shanghaied camera work is optional honestly i thought youd enjoy the view no ulterior motives none she said regretting it immediately i was an asshole last night yes you were i will work on being less of one i saved your voice mail she regretted he couldnt see her smiling evidence she added here we go he said dipping the left wing slightly the view of the terrain from above was wondrous the rugged landscape of everlarger mountains and more dense wilderness rose in a progression of deformities like sharks teeth north and east of croy canyon where democrat gulch lay like a dirt ribbon on the valley floor there was not a structure to be seen the barren floor of waxweed and rabbit bush gave way to aspen groves intermingled with fir and lodgepole pine from where a blanket of green conifers rose toward the jagged rock and the lifeless realms of gravel fields and iceall that remained above the tree line sunlight drew a sharp brilliantly bright line across the rock reminding her of a scratched negative a pattern of shadows moved in unisondeer or elk on the runthen vanished absorbed by forest fiona struggled for words to convey her awe or at least her appreciation without sounding stupid or overly spiritual but failing to find any she raised her camera and recorded the moment instead the glider rose as her insides pressed through her feet and out through the floor she rested the camera on her chest and shut her eyes holding on to the cold frame of the seat for a sense of security holy shit she said walt lifted the glider higher in everwidening circles it gained over a thousand feet in a matter of minutes one more pass walt warned i saw some shapes in the willows below those mine tailings she collected herself and pressed the talk button shapes might be tents or something ill make pictures the glider dove even the headphones noisecancellation feature couldnt hold back the roar she ran off a series of pictures the glider began its lazy climb there he said two oclock she aimed and saw the dark shapes zoomed in click click fiona listened as walt contacted the airport tower and asked for a message to be relayed to his dispatcher he requested a patrol explore the area when walt was off air fiona pushed the button and spoke i got a pretty good look at those shapes smaller than tents atvs he asked why not parasailors he said pointing through the canopy off the ski mountain three colorful parachutesred green and bluehung in the air with their ribbed foils bulging just below the top of the sun valley ski mountain the silk caught in the glare of the morning sun they were too far away for her to see the nylon cords the jumpers appearing to float beneath their chutes beautiful she said he steered the plane north flying directly above the parasailors and she took more photographs to the east the butterflywinged canvas roof of sun valleys new outdoor amphitheater caught her eye and nearby the enormous white tent that would shelter the wine auction later that evening she thought he might overfly this venue as well but instead he looped south and soon returned to the airport in a matter of minutes they were on the ramp near the hangars youre good at your job you know that she said im a hack he said why do you do that she asked shaking her hair out why cant you accept a compliment my father makes a point of it when the express covers my men chasing a bear out of a backyard or arresting a man for riding a lawn mower down main street you say im good at it and i want to agree believe me theres a jazz standard called compared to what you hold my job up against even a rookie cop in los angeles or new york and it looks like im sleepwalking but were not in new york and i meant it as a compliment she paused okay so thank you he was dancing on ice it made her uncomfortable ill email you the pictures she said she could sense his impatience to get going okay thanks dont hide from me she said walt looked at fiona curiously and she wondered if shed gone too far again ive known you for what two years i barely know you you know me better than most he said then thats a shame what are you looking for he asked i plead the fifth sheriff he fought back a grin i need to hangar the glider he said ill help you its light one person can do it consider this maybe its easier with two you think thats possible their eyes met id appreciate the help he said thats better she said moving behind the wing and awaiting instructions as walt left the hangar he heard a radio code spoken over his handset and decided to respond himself another day another weekend he would have left the call for othershe tried hard to avoid micromanagementbut with his patience worn thin awaiting word from the patrol hed sent out to democrat gulch he knew the short drive down to bellevue would keep his mind on other things besides hed known bob parker the owner of sun valley log homes for years a roundfaced man with clear blue eyes and hard hands bob had taken a small lumberyard and turned it into a company that manufactured homes of all sizes and budgets he dressed like a lumberjack disguising a sixfigure income he shook his head at walt from the summer porch beatrice whod been heeling nicely broke away to investigate an empty dog bowl by the porch steps damnedest thing bob said whats that walt asked one eye on beatrice he didnt begrudge her the pursuit of food but it was incorrect to break heel without permission like everything else around him beatrice needed his time the only way i can get five minutes with you is to have my place busted into bob said i thought you were probably still sore over the whooping you took in the tournament walt said a different thirdbase umpire and you would be the one thats sore so youre still sore a game should be decided by the players not the umps so lets have a rematch walt proposed for the trophy i didnt say that but bragging rights should be good enough for a losing team losing team you think why dont we find out oh well find out bob said or more likely you will walt called beatrice away from the bowl shed licked it any harder the glaze wouldve come off such claims are better settled on the diamond i couldnt agree more said bob sheriffs deputy bill tuttle was to walts left consulting two paramedics and overseeing their care of one of bobs employees sitting on the bumper of the ambulance a bloodpressure sleeve around his left arm so why am i here walt said its not exactly like we guard this place at night bob said you know me walt throw a chain around the gate out front make sure the keys are out of the equipment and pack it up home whats to steal a few handdrawn logs i dont think so cash never a penny on the property i suppose you might roll a john deere mower into the bed of your halfton but its never happened isnt that the dodge kid morgan yeah looking to get a jump on his college loan hows that walt asked college loan bob repeated as if walt hadnt heard hes been working nights for the past month starts over in moscow middle of august wanted to get a nut under him and i said fine why not if he wants to spend his evenings sharpening mower blades and swapping out air filters who am i to stop him i didnt know that that would mean working til one in the morning good god talk about initiative walt the kids got a battery in him that wont die so morgan was here late last night walt said hoping that might encourage the cliffs notes version he was wishes he hadnt been now i want to tell you kids walt asked vandals who the heck knows bob said whoever it was fried his ass with a cattle prod or taser or something knocked him flat on his ass ill tell you that walt looked around the yard five acres of piled logs mountains of split wood and stacks of scrap there were a half dozen badly wornout caterpillar tractors and forklifts damned near stopped his ticker from what the ambulance boys are saying said bob walt didnt like the sound of it the breakin itself wasnt all that unusual the wood river valley had seen a sharp increase in vandalism and burglaries over the past few years but a cattle prod didnt knock a person unconscious and a taser wasnt exactly a common weapon in the valley his department had twothe only two he knew of up here anything missing or messed with walt asked not as if ive kicked every tire or anything bob said but nothing sticks out im going to ask him a few questions before they get him out of here bob didnt object morgan dodge had an intense face with brooding dark brown eyes peering through floppy hair he was trying to grow a mustache which wasnt going to work out he looked like a hundred hungover kids walt had interviewed the morning after a dui you okay walt asked its kind of like a migraine morgan said only worse tell me what happened walt said not much to tell the boyhe couldnt have been over nineteenaverted his eyes other than i was in the shop minding my own business and some asshole zaps me and drags me outside and leaves me there you see him get a look at him no sir head down boots swinging forward and back reminding walt of his girls on a swing set in the backyard walt took a second to look around specifically over at the back door of the shop where presumably morgan dodge had been dragged you didnt see who did this to you walt repeated i said i didnt defensive a little too adamant the boys reaction fed walt the way a biscuit rewarded beatrice who currently was sniffing morgans right ankle give us a minute walt told the paramedic morgans head came up worry in his eyes walt sat down beside him on the ambulances bumper he allowed a good deal of silence to settle between them waiting to fill it let me guess he finally said to morgan it was beer morgan looked over at him puzzled what was beer no one dragged you anywhere morgan another long silence not strictly for effect he wanted to give the boy a chance to rethink the situation walt lowered his voice a girl you have a girl here keeping you company afraid of what bob might have to say about that no sir no girl what do you mean i wasnt dragged was too careful son its dangerous territory okay im the sheriff there are actually laws against lying to me serious laws you can get yourself into some big trouble so im going to start again and pretend your headache got the best of you and that you werent yourself okay you understand walt dreaded the day he would need to have a similar conversation with one of his daughters im your father you dont lie to your father he wished his girls could stay young forever and not grow up only to make the same stupid mistakes everyone else makes he missed his girls the freedom that summer camp had promised turned out to be much harder on him than hed imagined the house was too quiet and all he did was think about what they were doing the not knowing drove him nuts look down there walt said right there in the dirt what do you see wood chips the boy asked dont ask me walt said tell me what do you see wood chips sawdust dirt very good now what about them i dont get it the kid said see how scuffed up things are thats because this yard is about six inches deep in wood chips and sawdust everywhere you go you disturb it like walking through a light snowfall or something so so look over at the back door of the shop morgan turned his head you see any disturbance no the boy said a little too quickly walt toed the ground in front of the ambulances bumper drawing a perfect line if someone had been dragged out that door son wed be able to see it morgan did his best imitation of a bobblehead doll but i dont worry about it walt said its what i do what you dont want to do is lie to me anymore dont try telling me why therere no lines in the dirt because i know why therere no lines in the dirt and so do you no one needs to know anything about this no one but me understand theres no public record here youre not under oath and im not taking notes but you lie to me again and ill punish you for it son the state of idaho will punish you now listen youve got a heck of a year ahead of you the first year of college is something special believe me youre working hard to make it happen i respect that bob respects that dont screw it up the boy was breathing hard and fast walt thought he might start to cry not beer not a girl then what morgan dodge spoke so softly that walt had to lean down to hear him the boys chin was flat against his chest n smok in he mumbled didnt catch that no smoking he said deliberately its a lumberyard there were no smoking signs mounted everywhere bad for your health walt said tell me about it tobacco or something else walt asked and remember dont lie to me a cigarette yes im not a hempie and if you tell bob walt said leaving it hanging there i need this job so you were outside his head bobbed chin still close to the chest and you saw someone walt said a guy jumped the fence over there he pointed without looking up dressed how hard to see it was dark man i dont know all black maybe he was dark thats for sure he see you or did you call out or what you kidding me i freakin panicked the cigarette and all im like giing the thing and trying to stamp out all the sparks and shit i was so stupid giing it right into the chips i couldnt tell if it was smoke or dust but the more i stamped the more of it there was i could see myself setting the place on fire and trying to explain it to bob and then theres like this noise behind me i mean this guy was one fast dude or there were two of them walt was thinking coming up behind me like that i turned he had a balaclava over his head like a ski mask you know i know what a balaclava is walt said inside he was churning this was sounding worse and worse the taser the balaclava a professional again guy does this zorro move and im like gone fried no idea what hit me i woke up lying there no frickin clue how long id been there god he rubbed his eyes walt had been right hed been crying i mean im not out here i never would have known anyone was messing around probably could have gone right on with my work and nothing would have happened there are houses behind here right nice homes i figured thats what he was after not this place he was just cutting through trying to rip off one of those houses but i swear to god bob hears this and im gone doesnt have to hear it from me seriously you get a look at his face nah nothing it was the balaclava you know it was just so out of place that was all i saw and then he nailed me it nailed me whatever it was theyll want to run some tests walt said just procedure nothing to worry about and the you know bob was approaching walt patted the kid on the thigh ive got what i need how you deal with it thats your choice but youre asking the wrong guy if you want me to tell you to lie rule of thumb it never helps anything my call its better to man up and deal with reality lies tend to selfpropagate you know what that is yeah i got it walt hopped off the ambulance and took a long look around the yard the kids theory about the houses down along the river was an interesting one but he wasnt buying it one of the caterpillars one of the two tractor trailers he tried to see a use for the split wood or any of the hundreds of stacked limbless trees there were several splitters that ran off dieselpowered hydraulics how did stealing wine involve hydraulics for the first time there was a tingle at the back of his skull what if it isnt about stealing wine across the yard he heard bob blowing a gasket at the kid morgan caught walts eye from a distance clearly blaming him for him being on the wrong end of a rant bob steamed off toward the office beatrice came to a heel and sat down obediently as if bob was angry at her walt was going to have to try to make things right her father had returned from a massage and the sound coming from his room of the shower running caught summer in the gut a stockmarket update was running on the flatscreen television in his room the female anchor talking about puts and calls for whatever reason summer thought about enrico if she was going to do this it had to be now and just the thought of it flooded her with both excitement and dread despite being a moron and a loser her father did his best she was pretty sure he bent the rules and broke his word from time to time but only because he was desperate to keep her happy if it had just been him alone hed have bought a barcalounger and surrendered himself to espn for the rest of his days he sucked as a producer but as a father he looked after her and cared about her and would not approve in the least of what she was about to do enrico on the other hand made her feel like she was already out of college she kept one eye on the suites living room as she began repacking her suitcase she left the closet open so that if he happened to come into the room she could hide the suitcase hide her intentions she was sweating despite the rooms airconditioning her head throbbed and her stomach felt squeamish shed never done anything like this he would go ballistic she had no idea what hed do to her but she knew it wouldnt be pretty she flashed back to the voice on the blackberry call shed taken for her father there was a name attached to that voicea face evenbut she couldnt remember it exactly couldnt make a name stick to the face she shook off her wondering and continued stuffing her delicates in the suitcase she trusted he was too consumed in the wine auction and his deals to notice any change in her because she knew she wasnt going to pull this off perfectly she didnt lie to him and he didnt lie to her this was an oath theyd made after her mother died they were in this together only now she was deserting him it made her feel a little crazy in the head he didnt deserve what she was about to do to him no matter how much he tried to keep her being a kid instead of allowing her to be the woman she was her hand hesitated about to deliver a tshirt to the suitcase she could have undone this before it ever got started he begged her all the time to talk to tell him what she was thinking but she put the shirt in the suitcase continuing her packing there was no turning back now walt heard the aspen leaves overhead clattering like playing cards raking bicycle spokes he watched beatrice zooming around in the leaves on the ground chasing phantoms and kicking up dust this was where his heart was he was reminded away from town away from his badge on a walk with his dog in the backcountry gails abrupt departure from the marriage had driven him deeply into his work in an instant here in the sweetsmelling air with the wind whistling past his ears he realized hed used his work as a place to hide leave it to beatrice to reveal this truth to him yellow police tape ran tree to tree enclosing a thicket of golden willow at the center were two camopainted atvs the geometric shapes seen from the glider so fiona said watching brandon and the two deputies tuttle and blompier cut back the willows to make a path to the vehicles it was nice to see brandon do some hard labor tuttle on the other hand worked like a maniac going at the willow with lopping shears like a man possessed tuttle had spoken to a man peeing by the side of deer creek road a man now of interest to the investigation and he was taking out his anger and frustration at having not written down the yukons plate number on the willow stalks we want a record of the scene walt answered her including the boot print tuttle found he pointed same for the tire tracks everything to scale i was actually asking what youre hoping to get from this she said attempting to clarify walt checked his wristwatch the second hand seemed to be moving much faster than usual evidence something to follow the auction begins in a little over eight hours basically im hoping for a miracle you had them on the run you think they wiped them down she said shed been around his office enough that she was beginning to think like an investigator he suppressed a smile well find out he said he pulled her aside as a car pulled up behind them walt lacked a forensics team on those rare occasions when he needed one hed call the nampa crime lab but when in a real hurry he called barge levy the principal of the valleys silver creek alternative school levy held a masters in science from mit and he was something of an amateur lab technician as close as walt could get to a local forensics expert levy could perform basic tasks such as fuming dusting and lifting prints as well as the nampa team levy walked stifflegged the result of two hip replacements he had saltandpepper hair and piercing blue eyes he used his contagious selfaware laugh to his advantage a means to politely interrupt what goes boss levy asked hate to take you away from summer vacation no you dont he let loose a laugh startling some birds out of a nearby tree you want the rest of us to suffer right along with you you two know each other he said gesturing in fionas direction fionas been kind enough to help us out on professional day at the school levy said and she works with some of our girls i didnt know that walt admitted you dont have to sound so surprised fiona said levy let rip another of his laughs fiona knelt and rummaged in her bags switching camera lenses these may relate to an open investigation walt told him if they were wiped down it was in a hurry fiona will record your work if thats okay no worries but ive got to tell you theyre dust bombs levy said i doubt ill be lifting any prints whatever you can do got it try the gas cap and the valve caps to all four tires levy nodded nice you must do this for a living he barked out yet another laugh walt said before you start ive got a riddle for you riddleiculous levy said lets say ive got a group trying to boost a couple of bottles from the wine auction okay and i suspect one or more of them pulled a b and e at sawtooth wood products last night levy cocked his head curiously yeah the lumberyard has a couple of tractor trailers some cats of various sizes a pair of wood splitters both hydraulic some john deere lawn mowers some chainsaws a few hundred logs and mountains of slash and piles of split firewood okay theyve got a hell of a shop to maintain all that gearmaybe the best shop in the valley he paused allowing levy to take it all in how does any of that fit into a plan to steal a couple bottles of wine levy pinched his chin where are these bottles now in a vault a bank safe hydraulics might help open a vault a cat could take out a wall true enough but the bottles are more vulnerable once theyre at the auction right and if theyre pros they know thats just the way youd think okay walt said i can buy that house plans fiona said that company has built some of the premiere houses in the valley we did a profile of them in the express they must have plans on file for some of the biggest brilliant walt said i hadnt considered that maybe they need some lumber to build themselves a trojan horse levy teased chuckling to himself once again walt thought back to flyfishing with kevin his attempt to match the hatch a trojan horse he muttered listen sheriff my bikinis a lot more revealing than this bra is said janet finch so dont feel youre embarrassing me please stay so we can talk this through she pulled off her tshirt her back to walt while deputy sheriff wilma karl pinned a tiny bluetooth microphone inside the bra cup ran a wire along the right strap and over the collarbone to a small creditcardsized transmitter taped to the skin beneath the bras hooks at the back on the table lay a mobile phone to take the place of finchs whether on or off the motorola cabo would transmit whatever the microphone picked up enhanced by a bluedriving kit with an extended range of nearly two hundred yards even if finchs phone were taken from her switched off and placed in a room at the other end of the house walts guys in the mc would still be able to eavesdrop on her conversation with remy at her request walt stayed in the room it had been a while since hed seen a womans bare back and janet finchs was taut and smoothskinned he suffered the physical tug of being male the emotional whiplash of a betrayed husband and the selfrighteousness of always wanting to remain professional he felt a little sick in fact why would remy suddenly agree to see me she asked hes protecting his investment i imagine doesnt want a repeat of last night your barging in on the tasting hes hedging his bets but not to hurt me i cant see that no walt said hes a guest in that house and if he tries anything well hear whats going on anyway so not to worry easy for you to say it was you who called me not the other way around because he called me okay so im curious i want to do this she said i admit it youre nervous thats good if you werent id be worried with the deputys help finch pulled the tshirt back on deputy karl asked finch to speak to test the equipment which finch then did all set sheriff karl said walt thanked karl and dismissed her if you can get him on the defensive walt said to finch reminding her of what theyd discussed only minutes earlier yeah i know trip him up no actually i wouldnt go there he invited you youre not going to plant any land mines that he isnt prepared for that he hasnt seen coming but if you engage him intellectually you might get an emotional reaction you might get him off his game im listening we use these same techniques in interrogation the idea is to get the subject in his own comfort zone whatever that is then engage him on his own terms not yours speak his language act as if youre his guest not the other way around if he has a onesyllable vocabulary keep with one syllable pull him out slowly and then challenge him again on his terms dont back him into a corner until youve led him out into the middle of the room its an outgrowth of differential reinforcement people allowed to win early will later defend their positions people challenged from the start will shut down the catch is it requires you to forfeit your own ego its tricky stuff but i promise you it works which means i do what she asked basically let him do the talking as much as possible be aware that he may try the same techniques on you one thing i wouldnt do is state anything as fact questions are fine statements tend to backfire and in your case may shut him down but i know what im talking about she protested thats exactly what you have to leave behind that attitude someone may have been stalking you maybe or maybe not related to remy but from where i stand it only makes sense he may have wanted to scare you out of the valley when that didnt happen he moved on to plan b fraternizing with the enemy dismissing your claims if nothing else by questioning you he finds out how to be prepared for you he knows he has to come up with acceptable answers in case you try to crash the auction like you crashed the tasting hes playing you if the bottles are forgeries they are then hes fooled a lot of people already as you said that means hes already got a lot of time and money invested in this so a lot is riding on the outcome including his reputation and you are the antichrist if this was supposed to be a pep talk it wasnt he said and if he does try something he wont if he does were two to three minutes away tops walt scooped up the cabo phone and handed it to her were recording everything go in and get what you can janet finch stood at the front door of the christensens house on aspen drive the doorbell chiming her heart in her throat she took a deep breath to settle herself it didnt work remy answered the door his übercool glasses and stubble haircut silk pants and linen shirt lending him a moneyed look ms finch he stepped aside admitting her she entered the home admiring the furnishings including the piano in the living room he pointed to a couch she was swallowed by it remy took a sturdier armchair to her left she found him intimidating i would like to think youve come here of your own accord ms finchwhat a lovely name incidentally a practical and decorative bird the finchthat your thoughts are your own because i fear it is more likely that your socalled research is really an effort on someone elses part to devalue or invalidate my historic find either out of penurious underhandedness or scholarly jealousy he had taken the high ground attempting to drive her back on her heels she resisted the urge to defend herself i appreciate your time mr remy im delighted you called you are aware of the due diligence a find like this is put through he said the rigors of research and testing involved in verification i remind you these bottles were discovered nearly eleven months ago shortly after the jeffersons and have been undergoing authentication and verification ever since the best experts have examined reviewed and analyzed this find and yet you a graduate student who originally majored in animal husbandry believe the experts got it all wrong dont you find that the slightest bit presumptuous she took a deep breath i may have given you the wrong impression mr remy yes i have some questions for you its true and yes they are of a scholarly bent and for my doctoral thesis i did not do not expect to be compared in the same breath with such experts as shilling partuuk and hamlin i was hoping however presumptuous it may be of me to help you not to challenge you to prevent you from making what i believe would be a horrible mistake and thereby safeguard your incredible reputation a mistake that would be bad not only for you but for our industry he studied her squinting suspiciously through his thick glasses she felt violated and crossed her arms high on her chest that would presume i give your claims any credence he said indeed and i assure you i do not we have documentation and certification confirming the authenticity of this find what is more problematic is the damage your dogged determination to prove me wrong can inflict on the auction price if you are trying to make a name for yourself ms finch you may want to rethink your strategy i promise you its not my reputation thats going to suffer if you persist its yours again she fought the urge to do battle with him ha i see you figured me out she said sarcastically how clever you are mr remy she stood up from the couch believe it or not i didnt come here to entertain you if at some point youre interested in keeping yourself out of the tabloids and maybe out of jail you might study microfractures especially as they pertain to glass of a woodash composition you have my number he came out of the chair with a remarkable agility a catlike quickness that surprised her he had her by the upper arm his strength considerable ive insulted you he said how foolish of me you are a legend sir a broker that has put his name in the history books multiple times you must have plenty of money so i just dont see the point of this charade you may believe me out of my element and youre entitled to your opinion but in fact this is my element i am a student of the very experts youve used in your verification my interest is to complete the research necessary to finish writing my thesis microfractures he said glass is a supercooled liquid she said as a result there is no order to the molecules theyve been caught in a state between liquid and solid and wont achieve a solid state for aeons because of this random distribution of molecules glass when it is cut with an engraving tool or ground with a grinder produces microfractures aligning away from the tool or grinder modern engraving is done with diamond tips spinning at phenomenal speeds far faster than the tools of two centuries ago todays tools produce microfractures aligning into the glass not away from the tool dr weisling was not stabbed to death by a madman he was stabbed to death because his microfracture research uncovered your bottles as fakes either you knew that going in or it was too late to stop what youd started but either way your reputation is on the line remys eyes had grown even bigger behind the distortion of his glasses what do you want she hesitated you wont believe me try me to prove that jefferson inventoried every bottle damnnear every glass from his cellar and that these adams bottles were never a part of it in short the truth youre right i dont believe you is it money i want you to withdraw the adams lot from the auction she said i want accessfull accessto the bottles for further analysis i want a thorough descriptionwhich you have yet to giveof exactly where and under what circumstances you discovered the bottles and i want any documents that show any mention of these bottles as having been in the possession of jefferson john adams or john quincy adams as ive been unable to verify the existence of any such gift between the families thats all he said sarcastically gasping as he ran a hand through his hair stubble jesus you are a piece of work what did you mean by money what do you think i meant i think you were offering me a bribe nonsense i was suggesting you wanted a bribe thats a far different thing i have to wonder about the attempt to steal the bottles she said finally finding her way into the line of discussion the sheriff was hoping for that was a horrible thing a man died a mana good manwas killed in amsterdam as well these bottles have blood on them if youre accusing me of something just say it very well she studied him for a minute she wanted to make him wait dr weislings murder put you in a bind you expected someone like me would show up youre smart enough to know that would happen sun valley was already arranged if you could have withdrawn the lot i believe you would have but that would only focus more attention on dr weislings tragedy however if the bottles never made it to the auction having been authenticated and properly insured if only i was so smart as all that since you have me as a murderer and a crook already if not you then who an investor someone put you up to the adams bottles brought you the idea forced it on you maybe its no time to be defending someone like that unless you plan on killing me too i had nothing to do with the attempted theft he said would i have profited i suppose so the bottles are well insured its true do i plan on killing you why would i invite you to this meeting if that were the case to find out just how serious a threat i am he winced and pursed his lips you are a graduate student my dear the bottles were vetted and authenticated you value yourself a little too highly im afraid how should i know who killed weisling if its as you say i dont believe a word of it then you have nothing to worry about she said the reserve on this lot is seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars i have plenty to worry about if you cost me that reserve ill sue you so that any paycheck you earn for the rest of your life goes to me id consider that if i were you no you wouldnt she said not if you were me i studied under weisling i worshipped that man he laughed god you are impossible now youre catching on she said think it through whoever buys these bottles is going to have them vetted by their own people and you can be sure i will make myself a part of that process microfractures mr remy it will all come down to microfractures what you want to be doing is getting yourself out in front of this thing ahead of it if it wasnt you behind dr weislings death then you know who was speak up say something save yourself while theres time his eyes danced behind the magnification so dramatic he whispered harshly perhaps you missed your calling dont bet on it she left hoping she could find her way back to the front door she began roaming from room to room before god we are all equally wise he called out and equally foolish albert einstein she said turning shed knocked the wind out of him microfractures she said pulling the door shut behind herself walt sat at his desk looking at printouts of three emails each a criminal record while tommy brandon tried to look comfortable in the small rooms only other chair his sixfootfour frame made the chair look like something from alice in wonderland you dont see a sheet like matthew salvo anymore walt said a secondstory man is what they used to call a guy like this i guess hes an atv man now brandon said hes a bridesmaid walt said all his arrests are as an accomplice no assaults two charges of statutory both pled out so he obviously likes them young nothing else here to get him more than medium time and a pair of reduced sentences hes matt damon in those oceans movies so whos george clooney brandon asked walt wanted to say you are because brandon was undeniably handsome he had piercing dark eyes a strong chin and perfect teeth it was hard for walt to look at him and not imagine gail straddling him there was nothing to break walts spell the grim porn movie running through his mind involving his soontobe exwife and his deputy i doubt its this guy walt said tapping roger mcguinesss face hes the wheel man we can bet he drove the wrecker one arrest six years ago no time served hes kept himself clean which i imagine appealed to clooney we issue a bolo brandon said be on lookout yes for both ketchum and sun valley pds need this ask them to walk these sheets around to the bars and hotels and property managers where do young girls hang out the pool at the y tennis courts id put those on the list too lets hope matthew salvo has been trolling during his free time got it brandon stood tommy walt said stopping him halfway to the door yeah the girls come home monday yeah it wasnt exactly an i couldnt care less but it was close enough that walt felt a stab in his chest brandon would never care about his kids the way he did its been two weeks the longest theyve ever been away i was thinking it might be nice if gail and i took them out to dinner you know just her and me what do you think i think youre asking the wrong person but youre okay with it walt said what are you asking walt hesitated you think shed be good with it brandon crossed his arms tightly listen sheriff we sign the papers next week yeah he said softly i imagine that sucks walt realized he should have kept his mouth shut what was he doing talking to brandon about any of this neither man spoke walts silence was the result of countless sleepless nights spent on the couch or in one of the girls empty beds anywhere but in the bed he and gail had once shared he silently suffered such heartache and physical pain that hed sought a doctors opinion not just once but several times only to be told it was all in his head walts silence was the silence of defeat regret shame and disgust well hey i ought to notify ketchum and sun valley brandon was blocking the doorway yeah walt said go arthur remy stepped out of the shower and reached for the monogrammed towel the initials on it belonged to his hosts currently hiking a trail on the ski mountain his hand swiped the air where the towel should have been jesus he barked his voice ringing off the imported spanish tile he quickly covered his groin what were you thinking the man asked what the hell are you talking about talking to the police initiating inquiries within branson risk oh christ did it not occur to you we would be keeping an eye on our investment that we would be watching you did it not occur to you that if you started turning over rocks something vile would come out from underneath he indicated himself voilà the sheriff came to me not the other way around and this theft an attempt at insurance money that wasnt me lying wont help you believe me it wasnt me insurance adjusters is there a lower lifeform like a dog with a bone you get them involved and now thanks to you they are involved what if they decide to look at this more carefully youre jumping to conclusions i had nothing to do with attempting to steal the bottles thats what i was told you would say i said you werent that stupid that you could be reasoned with it was someone else a third party has to be it was very very stupid it was not me ive already told you it wasnt us you panicked you were afraid that after what happened in amsterdam that a closer look that the insurance would cover it it was a decent plan had it worked you should have come to us but look where you are now he passed remy the towel look where it leaves you where it leaves us remy wiped the shower water from his eyes and then wrapped his waist lets just calm down okay i am perfectly calm this is me being calm its a misunderstanding remy said a fuckup your fuckup no no no let me explain the man stepped closer we have two concerns the first is that you might try to flee to shirk your responsibilities no that wont happen the second he said is that you understand the degree to which youve fucked this up he placed his hands on remys shoulders his arms locked the bottles will be sold our investment recouped end of story he kicked remys left knee snapping it as loudly as a tree branch breaking remy screamed and fell back into the shower more people break a leg or a hip in the bathtub than on ski slopes the man said did you know that he picked up the fallen towel and tossed it onto the writhing man no more reminders next time if there is a next time you dont want a next time the persistent squeak of the roomservice carts errant wheel created a counterpoint rhythm to the whoosh of kevins rubber soles on the hotel hallways carpet a goodlooking woman in her thirties with wet hair and pool water clinging to her tan skin like pearls strode toward him in a tiny bikini down boy came a girls voice over kevins shoulder he slowed the cart the woman passed by offering him a sideways glance that told him shed caught him staring and that she enjoyed the attention get a room why dont you summer said whats up he said trying to act casual i have an answer to that but its too dirty to say in a hotel hallway dude shes ancient give it a rest kevin pushed the trolley forward ive got to deliver this he said were still on for tonight she asked walking side by side with him she showed him the key to the jet fifteen minutes right im off at seven he confirmed but i owe a friend bigtime where do we meet ill have a bag with me and dont want to drag it all over the place a bag whats with that its just clothes and stuff no big deal i dont know about this he said are you kidding i am like totally looking forward to this she said it is so boring here you dont even know how much fun youre going to have you thought the hot springs were fun she took a step closer you dont have a clue do you she said in a raspy voice shed seen her mother tease her father this same way yeah i told you you can sit up front she reminded itll be so awesome he glanced over at her and she offered him as much reassurance as she could muster yeah i guess she relaxed awesome so where do you want to pick me up they made arrangements to meet in back of the hotel a few minutes past seven her plan saved her face brightened she kissed him on the cheek the same way her mother would her dad when she got her way kevin flushed and looked away youre running away arent you he said speaking down to the cart her brain seized what happens to me when it turns out im the one who drove you huh have you even thought about that ill bet you have and ill bet you dont give a crap do you because youll be long gone im eighteen kevin i can do what i want nice try he said im the one whos eighteen im the one gets in trouble for this i thought we were going to party in the jet i promise thats happening the flight im on is the last one out at ten oclock you think i could get on a plane by myself if i wasnt eighteen maybe with a fake id you could youve been hanging around your uncle too long dude this is not without a trace you know kevin looked at her remembering the hot springs you never drove me down there okay all were going to do is hang in the jet until my flight and if anyone ever asks ill say i took the shuttle bus i promise so then why dont you take the shuttle bus he asked i thought we were friends she said pouting and disappointed i thought we were going to party kevin slowed the cart and stopped in front of a room door ive got to do this he said come on she pressed against him please kevin seventen at the circle out back she said confirming their plans she hurried off before he had a chance to answer the door to the incident command center in the blaine county sheriffs office was closed a meeting in progress sign on the wall alongside walt addressed barge levy as fiona took pictures of janet finchs inspection of the adams bottles one thing you didnt explain sheriff finch said never taking her attention off the bottles is how you talked arthur remy into allowing this who said i did you have the access card you opened the case true and true go ahead be that way finch said every once in a great while blind luck plays a hand in an investigation you stole it from him remy showed up at the emergency room earlier walt said slipped and broke his knee he claimed i was contacted because the oncall orthopedist and his radiologist judged the fracture to be bluntforce traumaa baseball bat maybe a martialarts kick to the knee we ask them to report that kind of difference of opinion primarily to head off domestic violence against women and he left his pants excuse me finch said remy left his pants in the emergency room was driven home in a pair of hospital scrubs one too many painkillers and he spaced out and forgot his pants the pants and their contents were turned over to me im required to do an inventory and as it happens the card was in his pocket id seen it before this office has every intention of returning mr remys belongings we have been in communication with him and it was agreed i would pass along his things when i see him tonight at the auction holy shit did he ask about the card not a word im sure he didnt want to attract my attention to it who says theres no god finch said other than the photographs we can document the test results right walt said of course levy said still making adjustments on what appeared to be some complicated electronics id rather have a spectrometer finch said wearing cotton gloves she viewed the labels with a loupe and as she did she made noises like she was in the throes of really good sex trust me levy said the piezoelectric effect is just as conclusive we can measure density size clamped capacitance and lowfield dissipation english walt said she can determine the pattern of any microfractures levy said listen we wouldnt have this gear if i didnt know what i was doing it was donated by the father of one of our students after we found those pottery shards out at muldoon remember the mine cavein the piezoelectric effect was the cheapest way to determine if it was authentically native american without sending the shards out to a lab which would have cost aplenty he laughed one of his laughs turned out they were common gardening pots but hey i got the equipment donated so whos complaining the results will have to be verified finch reminded no offense but theyre not going to take the word of a grad student and a school principal alternativeschool principal levy corrected and i taught science for twelve years and graduated from mit dont forget finch didnt comment do you know someone walt asked i can ask one of my professors to examine the data we collect finch said there will definitely be someone on campus who can do this but not before the auction doubtful finch said it being a weekend and all but who knows these bottles are famous i can think of a couple people who would jump at a chance to examine them i can try lowry at mit levy said theres always a chance dr lowry would do it finch told walt if he signed off on this no one would dispute it she flattered walt with a look thank you for doing this dont mistake this as benevolence walt said those bottles are evidence in a homicide if theyre fakes that impacts the investigation its something i need to know i would so love to see you bust arthur remy finch said thats not how it works walt said but if remy is pawning off fakes he didnt finish the thought were ready levy said he ran nearly the exact same test five times the glass near the engraving was exposed to ultrahigh sound frequencies that were then measured from different places on the bottles a laptop computer crunched the data displaying it as a colorcoded graph that levy studied and then saved before repeating the test at the conclusion of the tests levy looked up from the laptop wearing a grave expression the microfractures are random he said i knew it janet finch looked as if shed won the lottery thats good walt asked levy theyre fakes said finch smiling widely as summer heard the television switch off she braced herself for the confrontation like a heavyweight fighter before the bout she lowered her head closed her eyes and visualized her opponents weaknesses his soft spots knowing all along that he had the weight advantage first she wanted to see if he would remember that hed invited her supposedly she was to be his date at the wineauction dinner but he tended to forget his offers to her especially if a better offer came along if he did remember then she intended to incite his anger exploit his sense of social punctuality with her wet hair and the towel wrapped around her seeing her like this he would make impossible demands she couldnt meet and would then desert her telling her to catch upand that was all she needed summer are you ready he eventually bellowed from the other side of her door we dont want to be late she drew a deep breath and strode into the living room just in the towel knowing how uncomfortable it would make him he could barely look at her at the pool perhaps he saw her mother in her or maybe he couldnt face his daughter as a grown woman but whatever it was it momentarily gave her the upper hand im running a teensy bit behind his face registered horror sorry is twenty minutes okay twenty minutes no thats not okay i told you ten of seven its already five til hey i dont get all dressed up that often she said changing to a tone of voice she knew he didnt care for besides i thought it starts out as a cocktail party right so whats the big deal we can be late we cannot be late cocktail hours more important to me than the auction he drew a deep breatha bad sign he was struggling for patience youre important to me i wanted to show you off he sounded so hurt she loved him for it once were sitting down at dinner were stuck with whoever were stuck with but at the cocktail party please go ahead she said ill hurry ill wait no she barked out too loudly and too quickly his parental radar switched on and she chastised herself for the outburst he could read her far better than she was willing to admit and he cared more about her than she let herself believe his look conveyed all of this and the guilt it caused her ran up her spine in an icy shiver youre trying to put together a deal she said right im always trying to put a deal together sweetheart he sounded defeated she resisted feeling any sympathy for him he had denied her the opportunity of watching enrico in the semifinals he had made her come to sun valley with him instead hed made her play tennis with him in the mixed doubles had humiliated her with his poor playing he deserved what she was about to do to him you go on she said im not real big on cocktail parties anyway i mean whats the point im sorry if this trip hasnt lived up to its billing he said i really thought youd have a better time than youve had im okay no i should have had you bring a friend or something i wasnt thinking right im fine dad the guilt now traveled to her throat where it balled up in an unforgiving knot she was not going to change her mind about this she was not going to cry fact is things are not going real well moneywise i think you know that i think you know im going through a rough patch times like this i know we both miss her miss her a lot more than we talk about dont we should talk more you know figure this stuff out together dad weve only got each other you know none of the rest of it matters to me sum i know you probably dont believe that but its true youre it youre all ive got the meetings the deals theyre just a means to an end a way to keep us going keep you going give you the best shot i can give you your pal the tennis guy eric enrico he was not the way to go he you know what thats all about you know what he wants from you and its not happiness its not safety and security it has nothing to do with any of that my job whether you like it or not is to help you make the right decisions not run your life thats not what im talking about just to make decisions with a clear head and your eyes wide open thats all that was not the case here you can be mad at me thats okay pissedoff absolutely but please know that in my heart of hearts i have your best interests first not mine yours violins dad yeah okay so get dressed ill meet you there if you arent there in ten minutes im sending the texas rangers after you i dont want to do this dinner alone i need you okay were a team tonight okay her voice cracked and she looked to the carpet ill hurry she choked out she pushed the door shut behind her then held her back to it as if blocking out all that shed just heard why tonight of all nights why tonight teddy sumners antennae were sparking he knew she was up to something secretive either it was something she was doing for him or against him and given the past two weeks he was betting on the latter he left the suite and headed directly to the concierge in the lobby a blondhaired woman in her late forties with an agreeable face he kept his voice low your house detective as quickly as possible of course sir if youd like to have a seat she indicated a wing chair with queen anne legs i dont need a seat i need your house detective right now he could be a real bastard when he needed to this was one of those times she pulled a walkietalkie from a drawer chuck she called into it sumner spent the next five minutes watching the door to the patio swing open and shut the bar on the terrace was active and dinner was already under way for the saturdaynight show on the outdoor ice rink but all he saw was the world moving on without him the concierge caught him looking scott hamiltons allstars she said best ice show of the summer would you like tickets no thank you he said just the house detective he didnt want to make conversation he checked his watch instead chuck webb filled out his navy blue sport coat to the point where it wouldnt button he had an agreeable face but a drinking mans complexion teddy sumner passed him a hundreddollar bill as the two shook hands webb gripped the bill but didnt pocket it theres no need for that he pretended to hand it back immediately cut short by sumners raised hand i have a seventeenyearold daughter who thinks shes twentysix shes up in the suite three twentyseven i wish i could say i trust her but i dont you have kids two boys a little younger than yours we use an outfit called super sitters the hotel im talking about good people patricia can arrange it he looked back toward the concierge desk a yard or two away shes supposed to join me at the wine auction sumner said im betting otherwise i need someone to keep an eye on her if she leaves the room id like to know about it and if she doesnt head over to the dinner i need to know about that too he pursed his lips how about it im spread a little thin tonight webb said i wish i could help out but you got cameras if she doesnt leave the room in the next fifteen minutes i need to know and if she does then maybe you or one of your guys could just keep an eye on her long enough to make sure shes headed to the dinner please he fished for another bill but webb stopped him room three twentyseven webb said his left hand slid in his pant pocket and came back out empty i appreciate it sumner said ill need a cell number the cherokee took the final turn pulling past the golf shop and up to the entrance to the inn where walt stopped to collect himself the tent set to seat six hundred for dinner glowed like a giant white lightbulb fifty yards ahead of him he viewed that distance as a gulf an open and exposed area where he was a target the bottles were fakes remys best bet was to have them stolen prior to the auction and collect the insurance salvo and mcguiness were part of the team hired to steal them walt felt certain but proving intent was impossible you want to run that by me again brandon said taking the lead guy into custody is more important than the bottles at this point brandon snorted whatever you say sheriff i know that doesnt feel right walt said but the only way to link this back to remy is to have george clooney in custody arresting salvo or mcguiness may not do it but it would be a start they probably dont even know who remy is and its remy we want but i dont know how to be incompetent brandon complained theres no way these guys get these bottles weve got to make it look convincing if they take the bottles the bee will return to the hive walt had replaced the gps device belonging to branson risk with his own bransons was in the back of the cherokee the mc was tracking walts and he hoped to follow it to whoever was running the heist if there actually is a heist he waited for word from the mc that they had a good signal on the gps he was still trying to fit together the connection with the kid getting tasered at the lumberyard in bellevue he couldnt make sense of it but somehow believed it was connected to the heist here comes trouble brandon said not now walt said spotting gail storming toward the cherokee he knew that stride of hers knew that look on her face was it for him or brandon he hoped like hell he hadnt got the date wrong for the girls coming home this is for me brandon said well send her packing we dont have time for this walt felt relieved but he also understood the power gail still wielded how was that possible how had he allowed such a thing to happen for all his strengths this womans reach was suddenly his glaring weakness it just leaped out at him you hear me walt said i get it sheriff brandon snapped his hand rested on the door handle but he had not opened it over the radio the mc dispatcher said all set walt tripped the handset roger that were rolling he said to brandon gail was five feet from the car yes we are brandon said walt drove ahead they both watched gail in the rearview mirror as she threw her hands in the air and followed i need you tommy dont get caught up in this tenfour brandon replied hotly his eyes never leaving the mirror walts cell phone rang the caller id read chuck webb ive got to take this walt said slowing the cherokee to a stop still a few yards from their destination alongside the tent shit brandon snapped he popped his door and climbed out give me a second ill handle this walt powerlocked the car doors behind brandon and answered the call his eyes lighting on a dozen different locations he felt absurdly vulnerable the wine case strapped in the backseat suddenly felt like a bomb chuck walt said into the phone listen i know weve both got enough on our plates but ive got a situation here can it wait i dont think so okay its kevin webb said weve got a seventeenyearold female guest who just left the hotel premises carrying a suitcase she was picked up by kevin walt your kevin his car out back by the circle reason i know this is the girls father is over at the auction he asked me to keep an eye on her considered her a flight risk and now shes flown shes a minor pal and that puts kevin smack in the middle of aiding and abetting and beyond that statutoryif you catch my drift and this is one hot babe so i doubt im really that far off blood pulsed so loudly in walts ear he switched the phone to the other side thinking it might help it didnt he could hardly hear once again he glanced at the attaché in the backseat you there webb asked yeah walt answered kevin would be nineteen in a few weeks that was how the courts would see it webb was basically right he drove off our property or id offer to help webb said you have helped chuck bigtime thanks ill get back to you walt ended the call he caught sight of brandon gail was tearing into him one of her rants that could peel paint off the walls four of his deputies had formed a gauntlet into the tent he speeddialed a number on his mobile phone he waited there was no answer he speeddialed a second number and was boiling mad by the time myra answered myra goddamn it myra walt what is it what do you think it is myra its kevin again hes not answering his phone and i need to speak to him because because he has an underage girl in his car underage and carrying a suitcase myra the girls father thinks she might be running away and that puts kevin square into the middle of it as in a felony count do i have your attention yet ill call hes not answering walt said which makes me all the more sick to my stomach did you do as i asked his phone service did you do that myra that location thing yes the web tracking walt said the gps did you sign up for that i signed up but ive never used it she said it seemed kind of like spying or something i need you to go on the web and find him myra now right now tonight of all nights he thought kevin had a knack for bad timing i dont have a clue how to do this walt you know me and computers figure it out walt said call someone do something but figure it out and call me back weve got an hour maybe less the fathers going to want answers kevin has got to bring that girl back here and right now oh god its up to you myra this is something youve got to do right now not a minute to lose me since the death of walts brother myras mothering duties often had been passed to proxies were lucky to have gotten the tip find him and then well deal with it walt hung up he climbed out of the car gail was halfway across the lawn heading away from him he felt her receding fury as a wave washing out to sea no longer directed at him he celebrated that burden lifting brandon was pale he looked disoriented walt knew that feeling savored the fact that it belonged to someone else stand ready he ordered his men as he opened the cherokees back door and removed the seat belt from the attachés handle chances are somethings going down fiona studied herself in the mirror she was wearing a black tea dress she wore it well it wouldnt be considered sexy or daring just right her cottage had warmed with lateafternoon sun if she stayed too long indoors shed break into a sweat she gathered up her camera bag and her purse pulled her only black sweater from a hanger and deposited everything into the passengers seat of her subaru then headed next door leslie and michael engleton had offered her a ride to the auction but shed decided to drive herself and wanted to tell them in person their house sat atop a secluded hill overlooking a teardropshaped pond it faced the slopes of the sun valley ski mountain to the west she heard children playing as she entered the house through the kitchena niece and two nephews from carmel here for two weeksand wished shed thought to bring them presents leslie would not be ready on time she knew shed find michael somewhere close by the children and there he was dressed for the auction and on his knees playing pickup sticks in the houses main living room one of three michael was a handsome man with a shock of white hair in the black that rode above his left ear like a feather she loved the way he looked at her like there was no one else in the roomone of his many gifts perfect he said when he spotted her shell be down in a minute she wondered if he meant the way she looked or the fact that shed arrived on time to his credit michael never flirted but she secretly wished he would try just once she explained her decision to drive herself that it was a job for her though disappointed he didnt act surprised well see you there then he said he rolled his eyes to the ceiling maybe by dessert she allowed herself a smile at leslies expense and was turning to leave when she remembered to say something to the children she had looked after them on several previous visits and liked all three very much it was only then she paid any attention to the pickup sticks she stepped closer to the game looking straight down at the pile of colorful knittingneedlelength wooden sticks interlocked in a jumbled mess perhaps it was flying with walt the birdseye view perhaps it was her photographers eye whatever it was she saw something in that pile of sticks that ran a spike of adrenaline through her she was in her car speeding out the drive before she realized shed been rude shed forgotten to say goodbye with the open attaché displaying the adams bottles inside the aircooled plexiglas case walt kept an eye on the crowd at the cocktail party an atkinsons market bag containing remys pants and belongings rested on the grass at walts feet if the bottles were stolen without the attaché and its gps then walts plan to follow it to george clooney would fail convinced he had not seen the end of these people he watched for the woman whod been wearing the coppercolored blouse the woman whod pushed the baby stroller across main street and stopped the wrecker the woman whod run naked from the motel room he believed she was the one in charge she was the one he was after arthur remy hobbled in on aluminum crutches approaching walt he looked like a man on too many painkillers sheriff walt handed remy the bag remy rummaged through his belongings his pants his wallet found the security card stuffed his pockets he then dropped the bag and pants into the grass you have quite a few officers here this evening i counted four outside deputies yes an ounce of prevention walt said he had five total brandon and four others the radios were live the mc parked nearby its dispatcher maintaining control over the team walt had three roadblocks set up if needed remy shuffled over to the case containing the adams bottles like a mother hen checking her nest he glanced at the bottles then up at walt and for a moment walt sensed remy knew the bottles had been handled but fiona had photographed their position and walt believed they had been returned exactly we need to talk remy said anytime give me a minute a crowd was gathering remy turned and raised his voice so they could hear him an historic evening a piece of history will end up in a private collection its not every day that happens walt stepped back remy was surrounded at once condolences over his knee mixed with questions about his discovery of the bottles he caught walts eye briefly but if he intended to convey anything it was lost on walt whose attention was galvanized by a woman just then entering the tent fiona hurried toward him wow walt said eyeing her i know what it is she said breathlessly her present stateflushed and pantingexcited him what what is he asked sawtooth wood products the kid getting zapped he drew her away from the display tables what about it he said pickup sticks the kids at michael and leslies were playing pickup sticks the people doing thisthe thievestheyre going to use the logs to block a road they were after one of the logging trucks you spill one of those logging trucks you dump logs on the road it would stop traffic for hours he muttered realizing shed seized upon the escape plan he grabbed for his radio but dropped it pulling fiona close to him and throwing her to the ground beneath him as the walls of the tent briefly flared yellow and an explosion ripped through the cocktail partys peaceful chatter there were screams and immediate panic but no more explosions walt rolled off fiona and sprang to his feet it had begun in one ear walt heard the calm voice of the mc dispatcher report the explosion to all units in the vicinity of the sun valley golf pro shop her report began she was broadcasting a the radio code for an explosion over the secure frequency monitored by the valleys police departments and all onduty sheriffs deputies walt immediately returned over the same frequency code nine he said ordering the roadblocks established all units outside a halfmile radius hold your current positions three months earlier there had been a shooting in downtown ketchum in and of itself that was a rare event but not unheard of it being a slow night in the valley what made things interesting was that every patrol from bellevue to the north shore responded seventeen police officers and five sheriffs deputies in all walt could see it happening again despite a review board organized by him following a frontpage article in the newspaper ridiculing local law enforcement for overreacting fionas theory about spilling logs on the highway entered his decision making what if the thieves had read that same newspaper what if they expected and were trying to orchestrate the same overreaction within seconds he heard a siren approaching then another and another while four of his deputies hurried toward the fire in the golf shop walt and brandon secured the adams bottles in the attaché and made for the cherokee parked alongside the tent emergencies instilled a certain calmness in walt his hearing was heightened he saw things more clearly he loved this shit guests had scattered some had hit the deck like he had others had fled to their cars still others had been rescued by their own bodyguards but as the confusion settled down so did the remaining crowd and surprisingly quickly wineglasses were refilled they all seemed to be enjoying themselves again fiona was by the tent entrance camera in hand getting shots of the distant fire another siren and yet another it quickly became apparent that once again the actionstarved police were turning out in droves now behind the wheel of the cherokee walt called his own deputy who served as the bellevue marshal to ask him to recheck the lumberyard for logging trucks there should be two of them he told the man got it whats that about brandon said from the passengers seat the attaché in hand walt quickly explained fionas theory tying it to all the sirens and responding fire trucks and patrol cars so theyre shutting down the highway makes for an easier getaway but they dont have the wine brandon said patting the case not yet they dont walt said he drove off negotiating all the welldressed people gawking at the fire if they didnt get the rig from sawtooth that hardly matters there are plenty of logging trucks around all that work on the ski mountain true enough walt said first we get these bottles back into the bank why didnt they rush the party brandon asked why blow that golf cart and then not rush the party yeah i know thats bugging me too they passed five patrol carstwo from hailey three from ketchumheading toward the fire we screwed this up again walt said thats probably half our resources heading the wrong direction brandon grabbed for the radio and on walts instruction reiterated the order for dispatch to recall the patrols but as he did two more cars zoomed past lights blazing sheeit said brandon his face lit by the colorful lights like kids in a candy store entirely too predictable said walt they drove through their own roadblock then moved traffic out of the way with their lights and siren ten minutes later the bottles were returned to the vault courtesy of the manager who had agreed to be at their disposal all evening not exactly what we wanted walt said back behind the wheel the adams bottles now safe were missing something brandon said yup i dont get it nope they should have gone after the bottles yup beatrice stuck her wet nose between the seats and licked walt who reached back and petted her why block the highway if you dont steal the wine brandon asked roach motel walt said yanking the car into gear and racing out of the banks parking lot brandon clipped his seat belt what the hell sheriff they check in but they never check out yeah i remember brandon said but what the hell they set off the explosion we respond they use the logs to close the highway were all trapped they arent after the wine brandon said grabbing for the vehicles support handle they arent after the wine walt echoed summer signaled for kevin to pull over next to a chainlink fence that separated the tarmac and hangars from the airport access road beyond the fence a dozen business jets were parked and tied down kevin killed the engine his palms slippery on the steering wheel sun valley aviations up there he informed her why here yeah but we arent exactly going there because because of the small technicality that i am underage and neither of us is a pilot youre not a pilot are you she added as an afterthought no but my uncle owns a sailplane a glider im sure theyd let me show it to you i know most of the guys in there thats the point id rather just jump the fence thats insane no its not its easy look around dude its not like anythings happening around here hello its illegal we can be over in like two seconds but why bother if i can get us through the fbo fixed base operation he added answering her puzzled expression sun valley aviation we dont have to jump any fence he said maybe i should just go no way youre here you wanted me to drive you here and i did were good im way early for my flight she complained the inside of the jet is way cool thats it right over there she pointed im telling you youre going to totally love it im not jumping the fence thats nuts its like a federal crime or something are you afraid no im just not going to do it because youre afraid no because i can just walk through sun valley aviation and get to the same place at some point she said my fathers going to look for me we both know that tonight tomorrow when he does hes going to check everywhere he doesnt do anything halfway if you and me go through sun valley aviation weve been seen together and then when im suddenly not around which is why this is where you get out thats not going to happen yes it is he said seriously ive got to go have a safe flight she yanked the keys from the ignition popped open the door and sprinted for the fence she climbed the fence like a cat through the chain link she grinned playfully dangling kevins keys from her finger she glanced furtively to either side wondering if shed been seen then was all the more obnoxious when she realized she was in the clear if you want em youre going to have to come and get em she slipped the keys into the tight front pocket of her jeans throw my suitcase over while youre at it he left the suitcase in the car and climbed the fence landing flatfooted on the tarmac she backed away her right hand still guarding the keys in her pocket your bag for the keys he said looking around hotly terrified of being caught come and get it she said she sprinted toward one of the jets he caught up to her just as she was slipping a key in the jets lock the top half of the jets hatch lifted up as a set of stairs simultaneously lowered with the bottom half she grabbed kevin by the front of his shirt and pulled him toward her then as their lips were about to touch she spun around placing her backside against his crotch and pulled his right hand down around her his fingers inching into her pocket it was warm inside the pocket and terrifying theyre yours if you want them his fingers touched his keys she forced his hand lower deeper into the pocket it was like a furnace down there he grabbed his keys pulled them out stuffed them in his pant pocket she pulled his nowfree hand against the skin of the jet now that youve touched it she said confusing him dont you want to see it i dont think so his voice cracked he looked back at his car one beer she said have a look around stay or dont stay whatever you want but ive got time to kill and we might as well kill it together her warmth lingered on his fingertips now that youve touched it he followed her up the stairs having set the charge in the golf cart roger mcguiness had met up with matt salvo whod had a much easier time stealing the logging truck than on his first try mcguiness dropped the semi into a low gear and they drove off leaving behind sun valley companys cold springs base camp an area of collected construction equipment and material were good salvo said mcguiness replied i must have passed a dozen patrol cars headed north a siren whooped from behind them heads up mcguiness said his attention on the trucks wing mirror salvo checked the opposing mirror and he pounded the trucks dash shit chill weve got this said the driver the greenhorneast fork traffic light was just ahead less than a quarter mile past the light and slightly downhill was the highway bridge a threelane concrete span salvo reached over and picked up the fat black electric cable that lay between the seats the rest of it ran out of the cabs sliding rear window to the load of logs chained to the truck bed attached to the cab end that salvo held was a black button switch the cop car had pulled to within a few feet of the red safety flags stapled to the ends of the longer logs not yet mcguiness said the fucker is right there and whats he going to do run us off the road do not detonate those charges matt hold off salvos thumb hovered over the button the truck ran the light speeding toward the bridge timing is everything mcguiness said i set those charges i know how this thing is going to work dont freak out over some cop car the cop car jerked out into the turn lane and pulled up alongside oncoming traffic swerved to avoid it a hundred yards and closing salvos thumb loomed over the button you strapped in mcguiness said doublechecking yeah good hold on mcguiness tugged the steering wheel sharply left quickly corrected and then applied the brakes the tires squealed and smoked as the cab and trailer drifted in slow motion first in unison then like the tail wagging the dog as the truck jackknifed into a graceful skid the move got the cops attentionone second alongside the rig the next about to be crushed by it he veered off the highway spewing a rooster tail of dust and crashing headon into the berm that supported the bike path mcguiness had landed the cab and trailer squarely between the bridges opposing guardrails a thing of beauty now salvo pushed the button a great cloud of gray smoke arose from a series of small explosions along both sides of the trailer the giant logs tumbled from the trailer in both directions it happened exactly as cantell had proposeda nightmarish tangle of enormous logs rolling and bouncing off the truck the truck shuddered to a stop complaining steel squealing mcguiness had jackknifed the truck into the mouth of the bridge like a cork in a bottle nice salvo said as he grabbed the chainsaw at his feet see you at the rendezvous mcguiness said sliding down out of the cab salvo made his way through the fallen timber and keeping an eye on the damaged patrol car climbed to the bikepath bridge dragging the chainsaw with him he tugged its cord and the saw sputtered to life he planted its blade into a power pole he looked away avoiding the spray of wood chips and sawdust only to see cars everywhere in both directions traffic had come to a stop causing a few rear enders and leaving the highway in chaos he made a second cut with the saw a wedge of wood broke loose and fell out he started a third cut the driver of a pickup truck climbed out and started shouting at him the man ran for the wrecked police car sirens called from the north he looked south no sign of cops coming from there just as cantell had planned he leaned his weight into the chainsaw the power pole popped and splintered then it teetered and fell overhead wires sparked and flashed salvo had failed to remember he was bringing down a few thousand volts with the pole a half dozen wires now sparked and jumped on the ground he dropped the saw and took off south across the bridge car horns sounded he took them as applause for a job well done he sprinted across the highway jumped down an embankment lost his footing and rolled to the bottom he got to his feet and took off running some hero had left his car and was coming after him hey asshole hold up the man shouted salvo reached for his knife he stitched his way through a thicket of aspens and found himself in a yard next to a tool shed he ducked around the side silently begging his pursuer to give it up but the hero came crashing through the aspens a moment later and matt whod grown up in sparks nevada in a neighborhood where survival required a degree in viciousness timed the blow perfectly he swung around the corner of the shed just as the hero arrived delivering the hilt of the knife to the mans forehead the guy dropped like a rock nice try he told the hero he then looked around to get his bearings wondering how long lorraine and mcguiness would wait for him as walts cherokee approached a string of taillights his mobile rang seeing the caller id he answered it whatd you find out he asked myra hes at the airport she said i used the tracking thing best i can tell hes there or right around there thats not good he said she was seen getting into his car with a suitcase if hes seen as having aided her flight myra hes in trouble brandon looked out the side window pretending not to hear im on my way there she announced hes still not picking up no can you text him me i have no idea how to do that and im in my car she was about to cry ill call pete hopefully he can find him and put a cork in this she thanked him and hung up a flash of brake lights he flipped on the light rack and took the empty middle lane reserved for vehicles turning either direction walt quickly called pete head of operations at the airport and filled him in on kevins situation pete said hed head down to the terminal and take a look around ill call over to sun valley air as well pete said appreciate the help back to you shortly as they passed the entrance to the rainbow bend subdivision walt got a better look at the chaos up the road a long line of taillights ahead of him no headlights coming at him a patrol car off the roadketchum police maybe a second later he could make out the truck blocking the road are those logs brandon asked drivers were out of their cars a few had gathered around the wrecked patrol car walt and brandon hurried to the patrol car brandon moved the onlookers aside walt wrenched open the door and determined the driver was dazed but otherwise seemingly okay he looked around focusing first on the spilled logs then the power pole lying across the bikepath bridge the downed wires still spitting sparks he handed brandon the keys to the cherokee get the power pole cleared first no civilian traffic is to use the bike bridge but get me a couple of our guys across if you can got it brandon said you stay on comm walt said running for the bridge with the jet door shut summer encouraged kevin forward wcome on i want to show you she said she squeezed past him making sure to rub up against him not wanting his interest to lag seats eight all eight can sleep flat each seat has its own tv and theres the big tv on the wall she pointed light shined weakly through the oval windows she handed him a cold beer there were two microwave ovens a builtin coffeemaker a stainlesssteel sink a fire extinguisher was clamped to the wall beyond the kitchen a folding door gave way to a padded seat over a toilet it faced an emergency exit door just over the toilet was a partially open roller panel that accessed a sizable storage area kevin drank some beer impressed and overwhelmed a rechargeable flashlight hung next to the toilet there was a firstaid kit on the wall all the comforts of home he said thats the idea including a satellite telephone she pointed to her fathers seat are you okay he said i love this thing i never tell my father i dont want him knowing what i like and dont like because sometimes i feel like anything i mention liking means he has to buy or get it for me believe it or not i dont love that its lovehate with this plane hes so into it it actually bugs me but i love flying it tmi he said too much information whatever its very cool he said you should feel it take off oh my god its so totally random like a rocket or something my dad he puts his head back you know during takeoff shuts his eyes and its like hes getting off or something she blushed and giggled again forget i said that she spit out quickly but kevin couldnt forget it and he thought she probably knew it the more he thought about it the more she seemed to be acting and he wondered what that was all about so you ready she asked depends what youre talking about dont do that she said dont try to sound cool guys do that all the time and im telling you its a complete turnoff okay just be you youre cute live with it but dont try to sound like james bond or something because youre not she squeezed past him again and headed toward the cockpit what is it with you and your father he asked trying to strike back he didnt like being lectured to the question stopped her she didnt turn around to face him i explained that she said its just fatherdaughter stuff and your taking off like this running away coming here when you shouldnt thats just you getting back at him what are you my shrink im just curious thats all well lose it youre a buzz kill i dont think you should go no one asked you i wish you wouldnt go i wish youd stay why dont you just tell him whatever it is you want to tell him then we could hang out some more her face brightened but her look was patronizing thats so sweet she said im serious im leaving she said her voice deeper and her eyes darker because of the tennis guy you told me about he said mens finals are tomorrow sunday hes playing im going to be there but then hes gone right to some other tournament whats with that are you going to follow him you think hes down with that youre seventeen theyd arrest him so what youre suddenly my father lose it would you if you stay you get props from dad right coulda run off but didnt hes got to appreciate that he doesnt appreciate anything about me believe it and leave it im serious im going down to la and dont want to be talked out of it so just let me would you please the thing is he said and we know this better than anyone else its a lot harder when theyre gone no matter how much of a pain in the ass they are when theyre around do you want to see the cockpit or have an oprah moment he followed her to the front of the jet and she stepped aside to allow him to pass he hesitated go on its why you came along isnt it he thought about it i dont know maybe to sit in that seat he remained standing i understand wanting to blow him off he said ive asked my mother like a thousand times to move everything here reminds me of him i cant stand living in the valley anymore im done how my mom does it i have no idea shes like trying to hold on to something that isnt there she is so lost he slipped into the pilots seat he could hear her breathing you could come with me she said that would go over big he sat there she said nothing we can turn on some music she said see those battery switches flip the second one i need the key right are you sure this is cool there is no key not for this part no way way the keys for the door youre bullshitting me no key no shit he doublechecked her instructions and then pushed the buttons as told lights came on in the cabin and she turned them off then she pulled down all the window blinds the dash had come alive the number of lights and instruments overwhelming have you ever flown it he asked ive steered it a couple of times sure my dad can land it he took instruction and stuff hes a complete safety freak theres a case in the closet she said with an extra radio a portable gps charts flashlight extra everythingthats my dad hell probably wish he had an extra daughter by this time tomorrow kevins phone chirped signaling a text message he slipped the phone out of his front pocket kev walt is looking for you where are you im coming to the airport mom he stuffed the phone back in his pocket gotta go he said how the hell does she know im here someone must have seen his car no way we just got here ive got to go he repeated cantell mcguiness and salvo entered sun valley aviation wearing flight uniforms they approached the reception counter with an air of confidence their caps pulled low on duty reba kline read the plaque cantell placed a small key on the counter along with a pen and some paperwork id like to settle charges for lear tangoalphaninerfiveniner absolutely reba said she worked the computer found the account and printed out a statement for him to review cantell paid her eleven hundred seventyfive dollars in cash something wrong he asked cash is king she said we just dont see a lot of it here she printed out a receipt wheres william this evening she asked the pilot wasnt that his name william the conqueror the man teased salvo and mcguiness laughed with him hes picking up the flight in the morning were the maintenance crew theres that pesky little requirement of tbo said mcguiness tbo was an aviation term for time between overhauls mcguiness had spun that into time between drinks reba kline got the joke and laughed with him there is that she said cantell scribbled a physicianstyle signature on the paperwork did you happen to cater she asked already checking a card file mcguiness produced a tin of altoids this is our food service he said winning another laugh from her were bringing it down to boise for a dvd issue salvo said cant have the dvd malfunctioning cantell shot salvo a look weve got some good electronics guys here reba said cantell smiled at her weakly boss wants it done in boise i hear that she said should be back around nine am tomorrow mcguiness added so well see you tomorrow then she said safe skies gentlemen cantell checked his appearance in a mirror behind her that had been frosted to look like clouds reba kline experienced a slight tinge of unease as the three men left and headed for the lear it wasnt the pilots vanitylord knows pilots are full of themselves it wasnt him paying cash not exactly though maybe that was part of it shed gotten plenty of dirty looks in her time but shed come to accept the egos of flyboys so the little guy had made a point of undressing her with his eyes big deal what pissed off and confused her was the wake of debris they left behind bark chips sawdust dried mud it was like theyd been climbing trees or cutting firewood minutes before coming in here what was with that she turned back to the keyboard and closed out the sale walt clambered over the logs already on the radio trying to identify possible highstakes south valley robbery targets the first thing that came to mind was the cache of arms and vehicles housed at the national guard armory every kind of weapon half a dozen hummers the theft could be catastrophic there were other prizes locally as well art collections famous and wealthy kidnapping targets when he looked at the valley from that point of view he was all the more aware of how vulnerable it was to an organized attack like this one the thought drove him over the final log all that much faster it was then through the obnoxious beeping of car horns that he heard someone falling and cursing behind him someone following him over the logs he turned prepared to give brandon an earful fiona stared back at him holding her black dress well above her knees she released the dresss hem and it fell i told you she said you cant be here walt said from the drivers seat of a toyota prius he had commandeered thankfully the driver hadnt put up a fight but i am so live with it youre a civilian im dropping you off in town no youre not i was the one who figured this out you obviously need me he smirked resenting that she could win this from him i also happen to be a woman she said which is something that has apparently escaped your attention if you take custody of this runaway then youre going to need a woman as part of your team how can you possibly know he cut himself off answering himself myra no it wasnt myra she said i may have run into chuck webb but im not saying i did i cant deal with kevin or the girl not now thats why im here you followed me you really are a brilliant investigator why would you follow me he said you ask too many questions thats not an answer im conflicted she said what does that mean some detective you are kevin scrambled down out of the pilots seat he pushed her back into the body of the plane what she said three guys heading this way no she said to a different plane chill dude i swear she eased into the cockpit and sneaked a peek not us she whispered but not convincingly first its not william or jack second we dont have three crew with us but as they drew closer she stepped back alongside kevin i dont get it they are not our crew i dont think that really matters at the moment what the hell do we do the powers still on she said diving forward and crawling on her knees to toggle the switches a loud electronic clunk came from the cabin door as it began to open shit shit shit kevin said my mothers going to kill me summer hurried him up the aisle and into the storage area over the toilet she slid the partition shut behind her but not all the way her eye to the crack both jammed into the small space his heart was beating too hard and too fast the cabin door came fully open summer pressed her index finger to her lips as she whispered at him i dont know these guys it cant be anything much prep for tomorrows flight maybe who knows she returned her attention to the passenger area as the three men came on board they barely said a word to one another which struck kevin as odd he could hear noises up in the cockpit they were doing stuff lights came on the air system hissed when he finally heard the mumble of a voice it was someone reading summers hair tickled his face thats the checklist she said i think theyre starting it up what they cant do that shut up and let me think for the first time she looked as scared as he felt cantell read off the checklist just as he and mcguiness had practiced dozens of times mcguiness had nine months of training invested in the next twenty minutes of flight and though he ran through the runup with authority his anxiety permeated the cockpit cantells responsibilities were limited to the radios and gps navigation he set the proper frequencies doublechecked the destination hed keyed into the gps and held his index finger over the transponder switch transponder off yes he said off mcguiness said busy with other switches cantells action prevented the broadcast of a radio signal that would allow act air traffic control to track the learjets flight above fifteen thousand feet the lear would be visible on most radar but mcguiness had no intention of flying above fifteen thousand feet hed keep it at ten thousand or lower once out over the desert it was only mountain flying that presented problems that and the fading light nice and easy cantell said no rush call the tower cantell had practiced his few lines to the point of impatience mcguiness had warned him that it wasnt just a matter of saying the right wordsthere wasnt all that much to saybut it was the cadence the indifference that would sell the call to the hailey tower cantell announced their tail number then requested taxi to takeoff the unusual wind direction meant a northbound takeoff the tower reminded ta that noise abatement was in effect cantell acknowledged mcguiness shook his head in disbelief we would have preferred threeone he said meaning the southbound runway cc salvo stood in the gap behind them hed been instructed by cantell to keep back and allow them to do their jobs i told you to stay out of the way cantell looked over his shoulder salvo was holding a heineken jesus salvo throw that thing out not now its not mine he raised the can the lear jerked into a taxi pretakeoff checklist mcguiness said to cantell ignoring salvo it was in the cup holder cc salvo said what do i care where it was cantell complained grabbing for the laminated checklist toss it and take a seat it was in the cup holder salvo repeated and its cold that won looks from both pilot and copilot cantell reached out and touched the beer can he glanced over at mcguiness its not like we can back up mcguiness said were cleared to taxi search it cantell whispered to salvo lets roll he said to mcguiness one of those guys sounds so familiar summer whispered into kevins ear but i cant place it maybe i think she didnt complete her thought with the jets rumbling she had to press her lips to his ear contorting them both in the small place and causing kevin to practically lay atop her ill take care of it she said its probably better if you stay here until i get it straight kevin reached to stop her but she shook him off as she slid the partition open and slipped out of the storage compartment kevin blocked her from shutting it completely wanting to see out excuse me she then called out she was met with three dumbfounded expressions the copilot pulled off his headset in five quick steps she was standing behind the short guy her back to kevin wheres william she said getting a look at the pilots face and realizing she didnt know him she stood erect trying to assert her importance who are you guys anyway she then addressed the copilot having identified him as the one with the familiar voice i know you right im summer you know me youve got to take me back to the fbo weve not met what are you doing on this plane the copilot said you cant be here you think my father owns this plane take me back to the fbo please can we turn it around the copilot asked the pilot it seemed an odd question for the copilot to ask of course they could turn around and would right now you can and you will she said reminding them who she was the pilot shot a confused look over at the copilot wheres william she repeated the pilot didnt seem to hear her but then he hadnt pulled off a headphone cup as the copilot had wed have to explain things to the tower the pilot said you really want to do that i need to go back i cant fly with you even if its only a short flight summer said i dont have the time okay the copilot checked her out then he looked out the planes windshield at the blue lights of the runway to their left is anyone listening she said step back a moment miss would you please the copilots demeanor had changed he was suddenly the one in charge which was not the way a cockpit crew worked she kept her feet firmly planted she wasnt going anywhere take me back she said the copilot had been ignoring her but now he faced her and raised his voice take a seat the reprimand turned her stomach i am not going with you you will turn the plane around now the copilot flicked his head and suddenly a pair of arms wrapped around her the third guy had her go the copilot instructed the pilot the jet rolled forward it swung left taxiing north onto the runway the engines screamed up to a highpitched whine no she said kicking and trying to break free but the man holding her was seriously strong and his hands were all over her kevin caught pieces of the confrontation at first it appeared that true to form summer had taken charge or tried to hands on her hips back arched shed tried to come off older than she was he heard her askdemand was more like itto be taken back to the fbo but then it went wrong the small wiry guy had grabbed her and kevins first instinct was to run to her defense the man pinned her arms behind her back and held them at the wrist with just one hand pushing her to the floor with the other he did it like hed done it a hundred times before he tied her hands with a seat belt then touched her face in a lecherous disgusting way he glanced hotly toward the pilots saw they were occupied and ran both hands over her chest kevin sat up furiously thumping his head against the plastic ceiling the guy looked back kevin hoped hed backed his eye away from the opening in time he reached for his cell phone as the jets screamed louder his thumb searching out the correct string of numbers walt pulled the borrowed prius up to the reserved parking at the blaine county sheriffs office it was his prize this longsoughtafter newly constructed headquarters and county jail it had taken him three failed referendums to raise the bond before finally convincing the public of its necessity erected in the lightindustrial zone adjacent to the airport it was thirtysix thousand square feet of stateoftheart law enforcement and he was as proud of it as he was of his daughters the airports right there fiona said pointing out the obvious let me just run over there and look for him if you want to sure he said climbing out of the car check with pete he tossed the keys into her lap ive got to stay on point happy to do it she said hey he said stopping her as she hiked up her dress to climb behind the wheel pickup sticks that was a good call caught she nodded wiggling and tugging her dress down he shoved the car door shut and headed for the entrance his cell phone vibrated the caller id read kevin cell walt pressed the call button where the hell are you he said by way of introduction the line crackled and spat unc alt kevins voice was nearly unrecognizable a roar erupted in the background got her he thought he heard he missed everything else he didnt want to hear the true confessions of a teenage conquest playing kevins surrogate dad required they both walk a fine line the roar grew ever louder it dawned on him that it wasnt static but background noise a planea jettook off to the north and he glared at it maybe the background noise hadnt come over the phone after all it took him several seconds to connect it with the jet even allowing for the delay over the phone the two were inseparable it meant kevin was close by maybe at a hangar party some rich kid throwing a rave where are you walt hollered into the phone im on kevins voice stopped midword walt checked the phone it had lost its connection on he wondered it was the operative word that lodged in his thoughts he waved for fiona to hold up rushed to the car and motioned for her to lower the window kevin just called have pete check the north hangars and see if teddy sumner owns or operates a private jet and if so have pete check that out as well i think kevins right here somewhere ridiculously close he realized he was ordering her around like he would a deputy that is if you wouldnt mind i wouldnt mind at all she said he looked up the jets lights blinked in the gray of the evening sky arent you glad i came along she said if im overstepping there are people here shut up walt im happy to do it this and more she backed up the car her hair caught in the window when she put it up amused walt stood there a moment wondering how long it had been since anyone had told him to shut up dave mccormicks gloved hands gripped the parasails plastic handles sensing the amazing control he maintained over the ribbed fabric overhead before him an astonishing waterfall of redandorange light cascaded into the craggy horizon without referencing the altimeter on his wrist dave could tell by his shortness of breath and the sudden bite to the air that hed exceeded eleven thousand feet he didnt want to go any higher or stay aloft too much longer it being far darker on the ground than in the air making for a difficult landing he spilled some wind from the sail and began a descending spiral he spotted a dark v coming from the north aimed directly for him it was several hundred geese he glided lower hoping to join the formation and descended into the twilight incredibly fast he arrived within yards of the lead goose startling the formation and scattering their symmetry the v quickly reformed dave mccormick suddenly a hundred yards in its wake a blinding strobe won his attention a jet coming fast at an absurdly low altitude he saw what the pilot could not the jet was on a collision course with the geese and quite possibly with him he tugged on the parasails controls trying to drop down and outrun the jets blowback the plane hit the geese like a dart the v scattering as orange flares rose from the jets engines smoke streamed thickly from the port jet he reached for the portable twoway radio strapped to his chest just as a blast of engine thrust hit him driving him upside down and away from the plane like a seed he struggled to control the fall bird strike mcguiness called out leaning back to look at the wing his right hand searching out toggles overhead cantell grabbed for the dash mac cantell said tell me were all right mcguiness studied the instruments starboards producing threequarter check that fifty percent power mac not good mcguiness reached for the buttons on the gps ive got that cantell said known airports mcguiness said known airports cantell acknowledged mac the gps can show us all nearby airports i got it but we cant put down at an airport mac fuck that weve lost our port engine starboards currently on fire so put out the fire cantell said eerily calm i hit the extinguishers and i extinguish combustion we go down like a rock fix it were not going to reach the nevada field we need to put this thing down now and it cant be some grass strip we need length hed worked the gps without cantells help stanley thatll work fifteen miles look it up in the book how longs the strip he kept his eyes on the instruments i need the length of that runway im on it i need it now and here he tossed a set of laminated pages at his copilot emergency landing checklist cantell had not moved read me the goddamned checklist were not putting it down in stanley cantell said we do that we walk away we dont do that mcguiness said and theyll be shoveling us into body bags were flying its flying right its on fire forget about everything else damn it his eyes searched the various instruments fortyfive percent and falling we are losing that engine we are going down we need to put this bird down i am not trained for this this is not good now are you going to read the goddamned checklist or not whats that cantell asked pointing to a blackandwhite screen on an instrument labeled maxviz a nightvisioning system designed to help spot deer on runways among other things at this altitude the screen showed the whole of the sawtooth valley before themmostly black representing cold but intersected by a thin white ribbon heat emanating from the warm asphalt of highway running north from galena up through stanley the streets of stanley showed as well the highway then curved right toward challis cantell was pointing to a perfectly straight white line about an inch long in a sea of black well northwest of the spotty glow of stanley thats nothing an anomaly its in the middle of nowhere mcguiness snapped now read the goddamned checklist chris but if its white like that cantell countered its asphalt i doubt it the signature is weak see how faint it is no no its almost the same heat signature as the highway its got to be asphalt a private strip out there starboard engines at forty percent and still burning thats where we land cantell said that strip we can make that youre suddenly the pilot mcguiness stole another look at the maxviz he glanced over at cantell we can do this cantell said we put it down there we make the call not so different than what we had planned the checklist mcguiness shouted the nose of the jet slowly moved away from the lights of stanley and pointed northwest thata boy said cantell he then flipped the laminated sheets and began reading aloud the periodic updates from his dispatcher began to weigh on walt he put two patrols on the armory he had his deputies there in vests and with shotguns connected with the mc from the incident command center using a video uplink he was apprised of the damage and informed of the overwhelming response from law enforcementeighteen officers in twelve patrol cars were currently on the scene including his own deputies that put the number at well over twenty by his estimate that left four or five officers total in the hailey area four his two already guarding the armory it was another screwup of epic proportions by valley police departments he had finally identified george clooney hed popped out on a federal sheet of known associates of the wheelman mcguiness a picture of one christopher cantell was in the upperrighthand corner of the onedoj sheet that lay in front of him it listed arrests not convictions and noted that cantell had a reputation for creating feints for his heists he was a master of deception calm to the point of sociopathic and a person of interest in four open investigations whatever cantells plan had been for the wine walt now believed it too was a feint a second robbery attempt planned south of the blocked bridge his patience stretched thin still reeling from cantells success with the roach motel baitandswitch tactic walt took a call from fiona not north of the terminal she said south sumners jet a lear no ones seen the kids okay but it wasnt okay and they both knew it the lear sumners lear it just took off that was the plane you saw tail number taninefivenine what his head spun hillabrands at the auction dinner he asked what has he got to do with anything yes or no yes but call him please tell him its an emergency that we need him to find teddy sumner in the crowd sumner needs to call my office asap can you do that of course is pete there with you yes put him on please walt waved off nancy as she entered his office to tell him something she leaned over and passed him a note armory clear standing guard he acknowledged it with a nod a gruff voice answered the phone pete have you got a flight plan for the lear ill look into it i think kevins on that plane if and when that jet lands in another state hes looking at a felony transportation of a minor we need to contact the pilot and turn that plane around for everyones sake i understand call me done deal the phone rang less than five minutes later it was teddy sumner fiona was proving herself invaluable whats this all about sheriff walt could hear the auctioneer prattling in the background your plane he said i need you to tell your pilot to turn it around my pilots at the best western running up movies and room service on an expense account sheriff what do you mean turn it around walt held the receiver to his ear but said nothing the bidding price in the background was up to seven thousand dollars your lear took off from the sun valley airport less than ten minutes ago i believe your daughter and a companion are on board summers due oh shit there was a long pause on the other end the bidding had reached eightfive i suppose its possible william needed a maintenance run he continued i dont always hear about those things maybe summer talked him into a joyride we need to reach the pilot i can call anything you can do to confirm the location of your plane and whether your daughter and a friend are on board would be appreciated to confirm youre mistaken sumner sounded dubious yes that would be a first what kind of cop are you elected walt answered sumner barked a laugh one other thing mr sumner can you tell me how much a plane like yours costs the general rule is if you have to ask you cant afford it millions walt made it a statement seventeenfive get back to me as soon as you can and thank you again for your cooperation the bidding stopped at nine thousand five hundred going once going twice walt grabbed his cell phone from its charger on his way out the door seventeenfive he stopped in front of nancys desk call myra he said get the details of how to track kevins cell phone well need her user name and password nancy reached for the phone walt moved around to behind her desk within a minute she had accessed the website and had the gps location for kevins phone which was north of ketchum walt checked the maps time stamp seven minutes earlier oh crap he said his eyes jumping between his watch and the time on the screen click history he said nancy moved the cursor and clicked the screen refreshed to kevins location of ten minutes earlier the airport nancy said that cant be right hailey airport to ketchum in a couple of minutes i dont think so no one can drive that fast he isnt driving walt said as the call went dead the plane shook and to the left kevin heard a series of loud pops followed by silence the roar now came only from the right he checked his bars zero he powered down the phone saving the battery for when they landed he looked at the phone cradled in his hand if they caught himand they wouldtheyd confiscate it the trick was to hide it come back for it later he tried slipping it under the pad he was lying on but it made an obvious bulge just outside the sliding partition he spotted a handtowel dispenser with the pilots busy and summer and her captor facing forward their backs to him kevin reached out of the storage compartment his finger deciphered the dispensers front panel and he opened it slipping his phone inside the challenge was to think like his uncle for all he knew these guys were planning a style suicide flight into some skyscraper in seattle or salt lake or maybe they were hijacking the lear to pick up some criminal like on prison break he relived all that hed seen on his brief tour of the jet a fire extinguisher next to the galley knives and a corkscrew in the drawer a flashlight above the toilet a firstaid kit he assumed there would be cleaning supplies possibly beneath the sink or in one of the larger drawers in the galley the wiry guy had taken down summer with one hand kevin wasnt going to let that happen to him hed seen enough movies to know the good guy never got a second chance hed get one shot if he was lucky he was bruce willis in die hard matt damon in bourne daniel craig as he had plenty of reference material to draw upon but could he actually stab a guy he convinced himself not to think about it just do it all the nike ads told him one factor in his favor was the element of surprise his uncle walt was not a hunter but was an expert marksman and one of the best trackers in the country kevin had been on overnights with walt when he would locate an animal or herd and then see how long and how far he could stay with them hours sometimes days and many many miles what hed learned on those outings came less from watching his uncle trackalthough he picked up some pointersand more from the latenight stories told around the campfire it was then that walt had talked about kevins father and he learned about the use of the element of surprise remaining hidden made him feel like a coward what would bruce or matt or daniel do he pictured himself going through each motion then with some sixth sense alerting him he sneaked a peek out into the planes main compartment the wiry guy was coming up the aisle straight for him trapped kevin thought it better to show himself than to surprise a guy like that he reached to push the partition back just as the creep stopped and opened one of the window shades that was pulsing yellow and orange the man pushed his face against the window turned around and ran toward the cockpit shouting were on fire kevin slid open the partition he climbed down into the galley his back to the emergency exit the doors small window revealed the source of the guys anxiety the engine was on fire kevins heart leaped into his throat he peered around the panel to see summer looking back at him her face was blotchy he wasnt sure she saw him she was staring off into space she seemed to be in shock he undid the clasp that secured the fire extinguisher and pulled the ring pin to him it felt like pulling the pin on a hand grenade time began counting down in his head if kevin was going to take a run at the wiry guy it was now or never what if he was the last line of defense between them and another what if these guys planned a suicide dive into the sun valley lodge or the wine auction a guy once had tried to bomb the cutter conference anything was possible the cabin went dark and the jet banked to the left his eyes adjusted to the green glow from an led on the flashlight his inner ear crackled telling him the plane was descending rapidly he had to get himself strapped into a seat he had no choice about that he raised the fire extinguisher rounded the corner and charged the guy facing forward was swearing a blue streak at the top of his lungs the pilots didnt seem to hear him kevin continued down the aisle the guy looked much bigger up close strong and dangerous he had a birthmark or tattoo on the side of his neck ahhhhh kevin shouted the guys head came around his hands lifting defensively kevin pulled the trigger it took walt three minutes to reach sun valley aviation pete was already there speaking to a woman that a counter plaque identified as reba no kids pete said as walt entered just a flight crew of three taninefivenine walt said yes the woman said her upper lip was moist it wasnt the same flight crew that flew it in but thats not all that unusual video walt said pointing to a camera high in the corner she led them into the back office where a dedicated computer screen showed four camera angles it took her only minutes to match a time stamp on the fuel receipt with the time stamp on the video and play back the images of the flight crew the first two guys wore crew caps down low obscuring their faces the third guy wore a baseball cap backward and managed to stay off camera most of the time finally he happened to look up thats salvo walt said the receptionist froze the image matthew salvo was looking right at the camera and salvo is pete said a person of interest walt answered cantell was no longer after the wine hed stolen sumners private jet worth seventeen million dollars i want to confirm taninefivenine is not on this ramp walt said he walked briskly to the fbos door and pushed out into the cool evening air taking in the large number of jets and the gaping hole in the back line where reba was pointing see but walt didnt see his eyes were fixed on the beatup subaru parked outside the chainlink fence a spray of noxious yellow powder huffed from the fire extinguishers nozzle coating the mans face kevin swung the extinguisher at him striking him with the butt end in a roundhouse blow that sounded like a ripe melon hitting concrete the man went down bouncing off one of the seats and convulsing to the carpet freed summer kicked the man twice before kevin pulled her away and wrapped her in his arms the pilots consumed with the complexities of landing a damaged jet were unaware of anything going on in the back kevin and summer stood there several long seconds their uncertain faces flashing green and orange frozen in place unable to speak kevin finally blurted out weve got to get buckled this things going down his cap she said bending down and feeling around in the dark she found it and handed it to kevin in case they look back here kevin moved the man so his legs didnt stick out in the aisle summer took her seat again while kevin donned the cap backward and sat in the unconscious mans seat facing toward the back of the plane meant the pilots wouldnt see his face if they bothered to check kevin glanced over at summer in the inconsistent light and caught her looking back at him inquisitively he had no answers for her wondering if he should make a move for the galleys knife drawer but the jet was losing altitude fast wobbling as if dangerously out of control white light washed the cabin when the landing lights came on at the last moment kevin bent forward and grabbed his knees summer followed suit in a flash of absolute certainty he knew what came next it was as if his uncle were telling him what to do he signaled summer motioning aft and to the left to the emergency door she nodded he pointed at her you go first she nodded again progress he thought now the knife the flashlight the phonein that orderwhile were still moving he and summer could do this the learjet landed hard bounced bounced twice more then shook hard as if about to break apart with the impact the man at kevins feet shifted and groaned he was coming to everything suddenly went dark kevin signaled summer its now or never summer released her seat belt and ran for the back of the plane walt should have been looking at a team of twenty trained deputies at his spankingnew incident command center instead he was looking at four two of them civilian clerks five oncall deputies were on their way but still twenty to thirty minutes out overhead displays satellite links the ethernetall seemed to be laughing at him in almost empty space the subaru was kevins the learjet was gone they had a parasailors report that a lowflying jet had hit a flock of geese and when last seen its engines were smoking or on fire the timing of the sighting matched the cellphonefollowing gps program that placed kevin over the town of ketchum walt attempted not to show the despair he felt but this last bit of news had sent a wave of panic and dread through himrecalling the us airways jet that had taken less than two minutes to crashland in the hudson he caught himself staring at the phone expecting it to ring hed lost his brother several years earlier he couldnt bear to lose his brothers son he reached to loosen the top button of his uniform but found it unbuttoned already he was not a man to shrink from responsibility yet for a moment he just wanted to walk out the door and keep going no more phone calls no more bad news he watched the clock on the walls second hand jerk around its face walt caught fiona staring at him from a seat in the otherwise empty front row she grimaced and cocked her head silently checking that he was okay he returned an indifferent shrug his eyes revealing the dead space inside he so did not want the phone to ring okay he said getting the attention of the four other people in the room including fiona pull together search and rescue apprise joaquin up in stanley of the situation update the challis sheriff and wed better at least notify the forest service to prepare for a fire response if the plane goes down well its mostly forest up there the speakerphone beeped sheriff walt steeled himself resolving not to fall apart in front of this group go ahead the mc has a theodore sumner trying to vidchat with you do you want to take it walt worked the laptop the screen came alive as did an overhead monitor walt didnt want the mans face overhead but didnt know how to shut it off teddy sumners stress could be measured by the sweat on his upper lip and the pain in his eyes ive got it walt said punching the phone and slipping on a headset go ahead mr sumner good evening sheriff sumner began as i suspected my pilot is in his hotel room watching television but i asked him to call for the plane and of course youre also right that its gone it took off right around the time you said it did which i can assure you it did without my permission the only conclusion to draw is my jets been stolen why i have no idea with proper notification it will be seized the moment it lands anywhere although fully fueled as it is it could reach mexico if that happens ill likely lose it i asked my pilot about the keythere are only twoand he has his when i looked for mineim loath to admit thisit was missing as is my daughter which im told by mr webb youre aware of putting two and two together my daughter took my key and got someone to fly my plane though for the life of me i refuse to believe it thats not how it went down walt said he briefed sumner on the sun valley aviation security video and allowed how they had three suspects all known for participating in major robberies though he did not name them its possible that one of the three convinced or coerced your daughter to take your key walt continued its also possibleprobablethat your daughter and a companion are on the jet circumstantial evidence supports that theory a phone call made to this department sumners reaction was immediate stunned breathlessness then a fathers fury filled his eyes and he choked out not possible that cant be right in the spirit of full disclosure her companion is assumed to be my nephew kevin fleming kevins employed by the sun valley company and works in the lodge where as i understand it youre staying your nephew and your daughter yes believe me i want them to be anywhere but on that plane we have a report sir that it may have suffered some damage while in flight come again geese a flock of geese we have an eyewitness report that both engines were smoking and on fire were organizing a search and rescue good god on fire my jet how certain are you summers on board its not all speculation weve got the phone call some mapping software and the times match the evidence is fairly conclusive but not definitive i would like to stress that point whats she doing on that jet he looked as though if he could have reached through the screen and grabbed walt by the collar he would have your nephew put her up to this christ almighty ill have his hide we know nothing about what led up to this what little we do know were acting on by deploying search and rescue beyond that beyond that were of the opinion that the theft was not an act of terrorism we have however notified the proper federal authorities as mandated by law they will scramble fighters and force the jet down jesus stop unless this was meant to be a robbery as i believe likely an insurance scam in which case the thieves never intended to fly very far the mountains block tracking radar mr sumner and seventeen million makes for a very attractive target walt added and they lured summer into this scheme somehow we cant confirm your daughters or my nephews involvement only that the evidence suggests theyre aboard that plane what a cockup sumner shouted his spittle flecked the camera lens and walts screen on fire his face seemed to melt down to his chin as belief slowly registered down to his heart walt was thinking feeling the same thing in his own chest lets hope not he said kevin watched out the small window in the jets emergency door his face pressed against the glass as the ground beneath them raced past illuminated by the orange flames coming from the engine he held fast to the doors handle as the brakes squealed the plane shuddered then slowed a cloud erupted from the engine followed by darkness the fire was out there were no runway lights no outbuildings visible ready kevin said the plane rolling to a stop summer didnt answer paralyzed by all that had just happened matches he said i forgot the matches despite herself summer pulled open a drawer in the galley and grabbed a pack of matches she wasnt as far gone as he thought he yanked on the handle pushing the door open and grabbing a suddenly unwilling summer its still moving she protested were going anyway he said holding the squirming summer around the waist he began lowering her to the ground tuck and roll he said and let her go as an afterthought he tossed out the knife he couldnt jump with it in his pocket he lowered himself getting his feet going in the direction of the plane and let go he slammed to the surface and rolled surprised to find it was a dirtandgravel strip not a paved runway he stood up and took inventoryboth elbows were scraped up as was his right knee but otherwise he was intactand then ran back to find summer risking use of the flashlight he located summer sitting up but in shock she had a pretty bad raspberry on her right temple and the hair on that side of her head was bloody and matted you okay she nodded anything broken she tested her limbs then shook her head a loud crash came from the direction of the stillrolling jet it had hit something a final screech of the brakes was followed by silencetotal utter silencethe kind of silence kevin knew from his time in the wilderness he switched off the flashlight the sky was filled with a million stars piercing the rich blue glow another sign of their isolation they werent anywhere near the lights of civilization the starlight was enough to see shapes by there was a small plane a piece of its right wing missing pushed off to one side of the runway about twenty yards behind where the jet had come to a stop that explained the loud crash come on he said trying to help summer to her feet but she just sat there like a sack of cement summer i cant do this she sobbed i give up no no nono giving up he pulled her to her feet took her hand and hurried her down the runway all the while searching for the knife he flicked on the flashlight revealing sticks a couple fistsized rocks and a glint of metal it was the blade of the knife he flicked the light off then ran in the direction of the knife hey a man shouted out kevin couldnt risk using the flashlight again he dropped to the dirt and felt around with his hands summer was at his side also searching what are the knife he said theyre coming got it he said adding were out of here they ran for the woods were going to be okay he said just dont slow down and dont look back okay more shouting came from behind as a faint beam of light cast their shadows in front of them kevin led summer off the dirt strip grass whipping their ankles they passed a shed then jumped a small stream an imposing hill rose up darkly in front of them stairs she said tugging him to the left no thats what theyll think he answered pulling her to the right the light from behind grew brighter their pursuers gaining on them kevin and summer fled through the trees and up the hill their footfalls quieted by pine straw they headed right away from the stairs but climbing always climbing dodging the black tree trunks weaving around opaque outcroppings of rock a voice called out from behind followed by the pounding of their pursuers feet on the stairs the faint glimmer of white teeth appeared on kevins dark sweating face he was smiling walt couldnt remember the last time hed spoken to his father there had been a brief ceasefire a few months back but neither party had followed up with negotiation stagnation had given way to rot a return to normalcy he had once hoped that his marriage and the arrival of grandchildren would help heal things between them had held on to the belief that family was a bond that transcended petty problems that cluttered other relationships but hope could not compete with reality the ideal collapsing under the glare of practicality hed begun to doubt they would ever be friends again in the end his brothers death had taken three lives not just one what are you doing here he said to fiona as he entered his office you said i could use your computer did i are you all right no he answered i have to call my father he has to be told ive got something for you she motioned for him to sit by her but he remained standing while viewing the screen ears she said ears he repeated as individual as fingerprints im aware of that you wanted proof it was cantell walt moved closer yes behold the magic of digital photography from a mug shot of cantell taken from a scanned image of his onedoj sheet she cropped the right ear then enlarged it made it transparent and laid it over a video still from sun valley aviations security camera it matched cantells ear exactly i can do the same thing with roger mcguiness she said although the angle is not as absolutely perfect as this so weve got them dead to rights walt said you dont have to sound so excited she snapped sarcastically walt snatched up the phone and barked out an order to arrest arthur remy on suspicion of fraud he added threequarters of my deputies and every cop in the valley are up there find remy and hold him for questioning hanging up he explained himself to fiona we know the bottles are fakes we can tie cantell to the attempted theft of the bottles and remy by association to the theft of the jet and the kidnapping of two teenagers it gives us someone to question an actual suspect you gave us that someone maybe we can catch a break then ill save my work she said by all means he glanced at the phone just take the punches if he throws them she said oh hell throw them all right its all in how you respond yes dear jeez fiona said coming out of the chairhis chair youre welcome im sorry he called out after her too late walt sat down let out a long breath and reached for the phone he started punching in the numbers he knew by heart but he did it more slowly than usual his index finger hovering over the final button refusing to punch he then sat up straight elbows on his desk and pressed the button well look what the dog drug in jerry fleming said been a while has it hadnt noticed ive got a situation here kevin may be involved may be in way over his head i need your contacts at air force kev what kind of situation walt talked him through the attempted theft of the wine the explosion at the auction the blocking of the bridge chuck webbs seeing kevins car behind the lodge and the theft of the jet he saved for last when he brought up the engine fire his father cut him off kevins on board we havent verified that but thats what i believe yes jesus h christ what kind of mickey mouse outfit are you running over there im told the air force may have radar that reaches up here the faa believes they do since you have friends over there i thought youd get me to bail you out not exactly how i saw it ill make the call walt outlined the window of opportunity as he understood it impressing upon him that they needed to make every effort to locate the learjet youre in over your head thankfully your opinion doesnt matter by now theyre likely well beyond my county well out of my reach not if that second engine was burning out any pilot with a beating heart would put that jet down in a matter of minutes if one engine had been lost and they were losing the second it couldnt have flown very far were on it were contacting every airfield takes a good deal of runway to land a jet were on it walt repeated the right kind of satellite might pick up a flare out i can check on that as well anything you can do the sooner we can track that jet im coming over there thats not necessary did i ask i said im coming over there if you find kevin then call me otherwise plan to pick me up in ninety minutes ill call you from the plane the company jet you could have had this walt this was your choice not mine ill call from the jet and give you a number where you can reach me see you shortly cringing walt hung up the phone he had ninety minutes to save himself from certain hell the forest floor was interrupted by chokecherry and brambles slash and deadfall often impassable the changing terrain required kevin to traverse the hill instead of climbing vertically summer not only stayed with him but occasionally took the lead while the forests darkness made for slow going using the flashlight would have been suicide revealing their position in the same way the glow of a light below them told them where the chase was coming from still a good distance away there was no question that at least one of the three men had followed them into the woods i dont get it he whispered huffing a bit why bother with us what do you mean she asked they obviously stole the plane right okay we were never part of that so why follow us because we saw them she suggested no he said we cant be the only ones who saw them that doesnt make sense i think its you what about me i think they want you the jets wrecked youre the prize and me im nothing but an inconvenience im disposable i think youre wrong i hope im wrong he said now picking up the pace summer suddenly passed him and leaped onto one of the huge boulders theyd been avoiding come on she urged she led the way up and over the rock dont scuff the ground she hissed dont give them anything to follow she led them nearly straight up the hill light played in the overhead branches then dimmed and moved left summer and kevin headed higher though considerably slower in total silence the next time kevin checked the beam had moved well away awesome he said summer shushed him the ground leveled off the trees thinned the moonlight shone brighter check it out she said they faced a rambling lodge cut into the rocky hill making it look as if its log walls grew right out of the cliff bluish light glowed from the windows nearest them less light came from the far end of the lodge where kevin now spotted a tall whitehaired man on a path leading toward some stairs emerging from the forest stairs that led down to the airfield a pair of floodlights shone from the corner eaves of the lodge casting a halogen glare across a field of wild grass the lodge was landscaped on three sides by a clearing summer stepped forward obviously wanting to call out to the man but kevin pulled her back we have two choices here kevin said his lips to her ear the forest or the house he pointed to the treetops the flashlight beam had turned yet again and was once again coming up the hill from behind them the tall manhe looked like an old cowboywore blue jeans boots and a lightcolored longsleeved shirt he stopped at the top of the stairs over here he called out loudly in the direction of the flashlight beam the beam froze illuminating the tops of trees then it began to advance again up the hill directly toward kevin and summer kevin tugged on summers arm making sure he had her attention he pointed to a pair of doors cut into the rock at the base of the lodge either a garage or storage area by the look of it he drew her close and whispered follow me fast and low straight for those doors hell help us she meant the cowboy the crunching of undergrowth grew ever louder whoever was following them was close now over here the cowboy called out he headed down the stairs the lawn was now empty trust me kevin said to summer he pulled her and she followed together they ran toward the lodge reaching the shadows sheltering the two doors okay he asked panting she nodded he felt for the door latch it engaged and the heavy door sagged open there are stairs over here the cowboy called out the flashlight beam paused briefly its going to be dark in there kevin warned summer nodded no noise he added so shut up she said whatever kevin slipped inside summer followed he took one look around then eased the door shut blocking out the light and gently lowered the latch in place the space smelled of cedar and grass oil and dust he slipped the flashlight under his shirt to mute its beam then quickly flashed it on and off to get his bearings they saw a pair of sawhorses a workbench trash bins tarps a small tractor a skimobile or atvmaybe bothand extension cords ropes and tools hanging from a pegboard on the right wall there was a stack of firewood against the back wall steps at the far left of the room led to a door he determined a route for them to follow we should have stayed in the woods she said in a hot whisper or said something to that guy weve got to get word to someone he said he pulled out his cell phone turned it on silenced its ringer no bars he said angrily jamming the phone back in his pocket ive got to pee she said youve got to hold it he said there is no way im going to hold it so pee yeah right ill turn my back i am not peeing in the dirt i am not dealing with this theres got to be a toilet in the house why dont you go ask if you can use it she huffed at him were somewhere near the middle fork he said therere a half dozen of these places max in a couple thousand square miles of wilderness there could be a neighbor a half mile away but it might be forty miles or more thats impossible we were in the air what like ten minutes fifteen how far could we have gone at three hundred miles an hour you do the math the point is all these places have radios maybe that cowboy dude lives here all alone we need that radio so come on kevin reached out for summer in the dark and found her arm she didnt resist him as he led her along his newly memorized route he moved slowly inching his feet out ahead and avoiding knocking over any of the objects he encountered as the toe of his running shoe connected with the first step of the stairs at the back of the room he pocketed the flashlight trading it for the steak knife he tested the step it accepted his weight without creaking they then climbed slowly eventually reaching the door at the top he tried the handle it wasnt locked he couldnt see a thing but he could feel summer trembling she squeezed his arm wanting him to reconsider he found her ear and whispered better odds if they dont catch both of us theres a tarp in the corner hide under it he tried leading her back down the stairs no way she hissed resisting way he said i may need you to save me right remember youre the prize not me we cant let you get caught he eased her down the steps found their way along the stack of firewood and reached the tarp it smelled pleasantly of oiled canvas triggering memories of his father and camping trips he sat her down stay here until i come back for you and what if you dont she sounded angry if we get separated he said not answering her directly then we meet at the far end of the runway near the jet you still have your key there are radios on the jet as well he pulled the tarp over her head before she could reply he tucked it around her he flicked the light once to make sure she was covered then waited a few seconds for his eyes to adjust to the dark again ud uck her voice muffled by the tarp shed either said good luck or get fucked kevin headed back to the door that led into the lodge walt paced the incident command center his father had come through with the lastknown whereabouts and vectors for the jet the mountain home air force base refused to admit they had radar capable of seeing into the mountains so none of the information that walt was given was official and since it wasnt official walt wasnt supposed to know that a pair of fighters had been scrambled to find the jet and shoot it down if necessary because it had been stolen walt reminded his father that hed delayed reporting the jet as stolen in order to avoid what to him was a predictable response his father had told him he couldnt have it both ways and to meet him in sixty minutes when he landed evelyn holmes a civilian employee of walts who typically ran numbers approached walt evelyn he greeted her he had no time to discuss budget but didnt want to seem dismissive as a civilian she had no business being in the incident command center but he wasnt about to throw her out word is youre looking for someone to calculate a flight path as its been explained to me he said not wanting to insult her its complicated stuff speed in the air speed over ground rate of descent the fact that the engines are constantly losing thrust may i take a look at the data sure i dont mean this the way it sounds but from what steven garman says it is rocket science i was awarded my phild in astrophysics from imperial college london you have a phd he said and a masters in material sciences she was working for him for just a few dollars more than minimum wage this valley he said my son wanted to compete at the national level in snowboarding his father and i made some sacrifices but youve been here six years yes he broke his ankle and blew out his knee in his second season his snowboarding career was over but we all fell in love with this place no way we were going back to southern california he showed her what little information they had on the learjet i need to predict possible airports and landing strips he said evelyn gave a cursory look at the data and grunted okay im on it she said a deputy knocked and entered the room he hesitated at the threshold under the glare of everyones attention well walt called out eoc has a report of a ufo thats right sheriff you heard me right seen south southeast of stanley a yellow light not running lights that just hovered there in the sky for about a minute then sank slowly over the horizon and vanished eoc thought it might be your jet give what youve got to evelyn walt said the guy making the call is retired navy made a big point of that didnt want to be taken as a quack he gave us his location in latlong in order for it to appear not to be moving evelyn said accepting the note from the deputy he would have had to have been directly behind it looking in its exact line of flight i can work with that walt referenced a map that was projected on one of the overhead screens as evelyn drew a line north northwest across stanley theres nothing out here he said no airports there arent even roads given the jets rate of descent it went down somewhere here evelyn said she drew a line perpendicular to the first line like crossing a t she glanced at the wall clock twenty to twentyfive minutes ago went down walt said kevin opened the door that led from the garagestorage into the lodge listened for signs of life and hearing none sneaked inside adrenalinecharged and terrified he hoped to find a phone or a radio since the death of his father hed manipulated his mother banked on friends pity bargained for better grades from his teachers and underperformed for his employers only his uncle wouldnt cut him any slack and now of all the people it was his uncle that he found himself emulating coats hung on pegs to the left boots were lined up neatly next to a roughplanked bench the coats were all big the boots all the same size large kevin worked his way down the hallway past the kitchen and into a living room it was furnished with couches overstuffed chairs and a dining table and chairs in the oversized fireplace the remnants of a summer nights fire glowed the room was unintentionally shabby chic the furniture didnt match there were wroughtiron lamps with cowhide lampshades a deerantler chandelier over the table there were no bright colors or flowers the tone was more hunting lodge than family getaway while the cowboy appeared to live alone this notion was contradicted by a better view of the kitchen with its eightburner range and twin refrigerators he was the caretaker was more like it searching for a phone and not finding one kevin didnt panic summer had told him about the radio and portable gps in her fathers emergency bag on the jet if kevin struck out here with the right distraction he might be able to return there just when he was about to give up he spotted a radio atop of a walnut cabinet its face was dark and a handheld microphone on a spiraled black cord was hanging from it that reminded him of the cb radio in his uncles cherokee kevin heard deep voices rumbling through the wall and he looked out the window to the top of the stairs where the cowboy was talking to the copilot from the jet the two men turned toward the lodge he now rushed to the radio switched it on grabbed the microphone and hit the talk button mayday mayday he whispered im at some lodge on the middle fork i think our plane went down a jet there are guys after me the guys who took the jet he heard the cowboys boots and the pilots shoes clomping up the steps of the lodge replacing the microphone ducking down and making for the nearest door he looked back to see hed left the radio on at that moment the front doorknob was turning only then did he spot the open gun case to the far right of the door it held at least five rifles he hurried through the door and found himself in the study with its twoperson couch beatup recliner and flatscreen television mounted on the wall there was a cowhide under the harvesttable desk and on the walls a pair of snowshoes a brass clock and some old blackandwhite photographs the fireplace was constructed of river rock with a wide hearth for sitting close to the flames and nearby was a closet with sliding doors the room smelled sweetly of pine sap and pipe smoke and it felt like it would be a cozy place to spend a long snowedin day kevin had his ear to the studys door while searching for a way outthe door and a casement window immediately behind him basically a tenacre island in the middle of gods country a mans heavily accented voice was saying on the other side of the door it was the cowboy the river is down there by the strip with gorges at either end amazed you made it in we extended that runway a year ago but the bosss pilot took three weeks of simulation before daring to try it what do you mean an island asked the other man the copilot this cabins on shady mountain its four thousand feet between it and the river its the isolation of this place the privacy that the boss finds so pleasing original cabin was built eighty years ago from logs cleared from the land major redo when the boss got it ten years ago you can fly in float in but you dont get hikers knocking on your door like at some of these ranches can i get you something im okay thanks so you take care of it by yourself that i do must get a little lonely not that ive noticed come back didnt copy a nasally thin voice broke in ah the radio said the pilot huh the cowboy said didnt copy your call the radio voice clarified i didnt call the cowboy raised his voice for the radio is this john said the radio it is ernie get yourself off the channel would you john said ernie youre clogging the airwaves someone was calling on this frequency keep your britches on john said there were a couple pops then ernies voice was no more not sure who we should contact first said john ive got a satellite phone im thinking you might want to call your boss before i go getting the custer county sheriff all in a froth youre right about that said the pilot ive got to call it in but i sure as shit can wait ten minutes if thatll keep you your job it might ill chase down that sat phone for you sounds good the cowboys boots sounded as he crossed the room then stopped abruptly you must have made a shoutout to atc once you caught fire the cowboy said the pilot stuttered with his answer ah of course we did well hell theres no putting it off then theyll be organizing searches we had something similar last yeara beechcraft bonanza gone missing radios probably the way to go call off the dogs you know not fair to them i know what youre saying but id sure appreciate contacting my boss first that phone would be a big help timing wont make any difference the cowboy said his voice suddenly cautious and reserved how many souls did you say were on board i didnt say said the other man but it was three of us me my pilot and one crew a loud knock caused kevin to jump yeah the cowboy hollered come in the door opened then banged shut whoa said the cowboy you took quite a hit thatll teach you to tighten that seat belt the copilot said wont it bobby bobby kevin knew the newcomer hed hammered him with the wrong end of the fire extinguisher kevin hoped the cowboys change in tone meant hed reasoned through the radio being found switched on the discovery had to be weighing on him had to have prompted the question about the number of passengers one thing became clear to kevin the cowboy wasnt part of the team he and the copilot were strangers to each other each testing the other distrustful of each other it was beginning to feel like lets do hold off on the radio the copilot said a little too insistently until i can reach my boss and let him know whats going on hes a lowprofile kind of guy hes not going to want a lot of attention over this whod you say the owner of the jet was i didnt say he keeps a pretty low profile the copilot repeated the tone between him and the cowboy had turned chilly kevin glancing again at the window then the closet was riveted by what he was hearing he knew he should run but his eavesdropping had him glued to the spot a plane that fancy and all the cowboy said surprised it dont have its own sat phone most do right you know what said the copilot his voice less antagonistic of course it does i didnt even check before coming up here the power being down after we fried that panel i didnt think anything was working let me go check not a problem the cowboy said also sounding less tense you can use mine now about keeping a low profile around here not possible im afraid its big news when a bear rips into the trash but a private planea jet no lesshell if this is handled wrong youll have boise news choppers getting aerial shots by sunup and let me tell you something my boss wouldnt appreciate that so im thinking maybe were of a like mind here first well call your boss then mine weve got to call off the search somehow but let me set on that for a minute we best go about this with kid gloves let me get me that satellite phone i just remembered its not upstairs the clompclomp of boots was now coming kevins direction as he frantically glanced around the study on his way to the closet he spotted a small green light on the bookshelf it was the satellite phone it had been there all along just five feet away he was late getting to the closet his hand on the sliding door as the cowboy entered the room they locked eyes kevins eyes must have looked fearful the cowboys eyes widened at first then softened wont be but a minute the cowboy called out to the others he then shut the door the moment the door closed the copilots footfalls hurried toward the study he wasnt having any doors shut on him the cowboy stabbed at the air directing kevin to hide in the closet kevin got in the closet but didnt shut the door in time he let it go rather than chance making any noise shutting it just then the pilot not the copilot charged into the room behind the cowboy he hit the cowboy on the head with a lamp dropping him with the single blow he was about to deliver a second blow quite possibly fatal when the copilot stopped him no said the copilot thats enough hes a big son of a bitch said the wiry guy let me give him another he knows this place hes our way out of here tie him up the wiry guy bobby raced over to the phone and grabbed it got it kevin behind the closet door peered through a crack a second light came on in the room were out of here right bobby asked same plan get real barked the copilot the airstrip and the river are the only ways in and out of here the jets not going anywhere matt we smashed up his cessna something he doesnt even know about yet maybe we could float the river or maybe we could contact lorraine and just sit tight lorraine kevin noted matt not bobby he now had two of their names what about the girl matt said shes worth something to someone trust me im aware of that the ranch is an island is how he described it those kids arent his voice trailed off with his narrow view of the room kevin couldnt see anyone but he hadnt heard them leave the room the silence stretched out i dont have time to play games said the copilot what the hell are you talking about said matt shut up matt when he spoke again he was immediately on the other side of the closet door there are two ways to play this the copilot said through the door you come out of the closet with your hands where we can see them or you stay in there and it plays out worse for you kevin held his breath the copilot was talking to him but how then he spotted his own wet shoe print on the floor outside the closet the toe pointing in his black reeboks were soaking wet from the dew okay have it your way the copilot said he then slid the closet door shut kevin was overcome by the darkness of the space find a broom handle the copilot said to matt and hammer and nails jesus said matt as he took off out of the room what are you kid a size nine too big for her and youre in there alone which means shes alone too or hurt or whatever if you want to help her you start talking kevin heard matts footfalls returning to the room then he heard wood crack the sliding door nearest him wobbled as the broken broom handle was jammed in place then there was more wobbling as the copilot tested the doors bad decision kid the copilot said through the door find the girl he then said to matt shes probably close by roger is not going no names the copilot shouted search the house first radio our friend at the plane tell him the girls alone were going to be fine kevin finally exhaled his head was spinning roger three names but get me those nails or some screws or something first the copilot said the storage room speaking to the closet door he added you had your chance kid summer squeezed her legs together her swollen bladder making it impossible to think kevin whod said he would hurry hadnt returned how long was she supposed to wait only moments earlier shed heard noises and voices coming from inside scary noises angry voices despite her sense of security beneath the tarp she had to get out of the garage both to relieve herself and to escape the claustrophobic panic spreading through her but she was no fan of the great outdoors the closest she had gotten to wilderness was orange county a wasteland without a decent shopping mall in sight the idea of fleeing alone into the woods at night made her have to pee all the more badly she slipped from beneath the tarp ducked behind a combination atvtrailer and kept still in the colorful eerie light of power tools recharging she searched the pegboard above her there she found a chisel with a razorsharp blade about the width of her little finger she leaped to her feet slipped it in her pant pocket and instantly cut a hole first in the pocket and then nicked her thigh noticing the leather sheaths on other chisels she stuffed hers into one and put it in her other pocket she then pressed her pants against the woundonly a scratch armed summer made her way to the shed door paused then slipped out into the chilly night air she pulled the door behind her ensuring it was latched shut and sneaked a look at the yard empty the woods were incredibly dark and more than a little terrifying how had she let kevin get away with the flashlight there was probably one in the shed but she wasnt about to go back there she tasted freedom in the crisp air if they were after her as kevin had claimed they were going to have to find her with the fallen telephone pole and wires cleared from the bikepath bridge an hour and twenty minutes after the log spill two vehicles carrying half a dozen search and rescue volunteers including two canines were the first allowed across vocal citizens demanding to be allowed to cross kept tommy brandon and four deputies busy i need to get across said yet another man from behind brandon you and everyone else buddy brandon said a group of twenty to thirty volunteers was working to clear the bridge using a combination of chainsaws fourbyfours with hitches and even a team of draft horses from out green horn gulch a third of the fallen logs had been removed and now efforts were under way to tow the semi clear give it another hour and well have it open again im the girls father the man said brandon turned excuse me he said the girl whos believed to be on the plane with the sheriffs nephew teddy sumner he said then introducing himself i need to get to the sheriff now yeah okay brandon said you parked back there somewhere thats right problem is mr sumner there are about a hundred cars in front of yours and no ones going to take kindly to someone jumping the line im going across that bridge officer its deputy and no youre not not unless i say so sir right now is not a good time as you can probably see those cars just came across theyre search and rescue we just about had a riot on our hands when we allowed that to happen so weve got to let things cool before trying it again one of your patrol cars someone could drive me im not exactly long on deputies here ive got four men to see that the bridge is cleared and to hold back a couple hundred very pissedoff people all of whom have a better reason than their neighbor for getting across im sorry sir itll be maybe twenty minutes i can walk across he proposed of course as you can see people on bicycles and motorcycles and on foot were crossing the bikepath bridge in both directions how far to hailey four or five miles i demand to be taken to the sheriff brandon looked at the man dumbfounded you demand call him tell him im here i respect your situation mr sumner and i really wish i could help a trickedout pickup truck rumbled off road through the sage just then and gunned for the bridge brandon hurried toward it waving the driver back a little busy here he called back to sumner the man was clearly frustrated call fleming tell him im on my way sumner charged across the bridge with overemphasized strides who walt said youre sure yes sir someone had called in some of the offices civilian employees walt had borrowed three deputies from the jail he recognized the woman he was speaking to but couldnt recall the department she was with here frontdoor desk wants to see you send him back absolutely teddy sumner wore attitude on his face as he entered the incident command center but as he saw the nearly dozen deputies and civilians at their laptops as he sensed the orchestrated effort led by walt who stood behind a central lectern his brow furrowed and he looked as if he might cry down here walt said sumner made his way through the room slowly taking it all in jesus he said your tax dollars at work walt said they shook hands walt reintroduced himself we dont usually allow civilians in here while were running an operation im happy to have you look around but youll have to wait in my office if you want to stay shes my daughter which is exactly the point walt said i make decisions here that affect the investigation the search and hopefully the outcome this is not a democracy one of the deputies looked up about to say something then went back to his laptop sumner looked around how certain are you that theyre on my jet before you even think about trying to get me out of this room i suggest you share some of the circumstantial evidence you spoke of fiona sitting in the front row met eyes with walt hers showing concern he motioned her over and she produced the onedoj sheets we believe three individualsa christopher cantell roger mcguiness and matthew salvostole your learjet after creating a diversion at the auction and by blocking the bridge with logs slackjawed teddy sumner stepped back youve already identified them he sounded far more surprised than impressed hows that possible are these positive ids confirmed ms kenshaw can walk you through the evidence later my daughter was seen leaving the lodge with my nephew thats also confirmed my nephews phone has a tracking feature called spot are you familiar with it no never heard of it it uses the phones gps and through a subscription service allows parents to keep track of their children my nephews mother is a bit overprotective and his phone is equipped with a similar device hes not aware that its been activated the point here is we were able to map a number of locations for him over the window of time provided and have confirmed he left the lodge at a rate of travel consistent with a car and arrived at the airport he then leaves hailey at pm and heads north at an accelerated rate that can only be a fast plane like a jet your jet that bit of information knocked the wind out of sumner and where is he now he finally asked thats the thing theres no cell coverage north of galena summit the tracking locator although its called gps it actually works off celltower triangulation a portable cell transmitter being flown up here from salt lake city as we speak may light up kevins phone if we can get the transmitter airborne were working every angle we can think of sumner looked around the room id like to put our guys in touch with your pilot walt said to see if theres any equipment aboard the lear we might be able to use to locate the jet summers on the plane sumner asked still winded we think so yes he looked around found a chair sat down he rolled the chair closer to walt looking somewhat pitiful in the effort something you could help us with first we need you to keep your phone turned on and ready wed like your permission to monitor and record any calls you receive same with the landline to your hotel room id rather you hadnt come down here frankly we need you in that room when that call comes well im here reroute the call insurance youre thinking extortion extortion would be welcome news mr sumner the two men stared at each other kidnapping sumner coughed up a laugh this is not a kidnapping at first glance id agree theres nothing on any of these sheets to suggest anything more than robbery largescale robbery but given your daughter and my nephew being on that plane we can no longer make that assumption our chief suspect christopher cantell is no dummy if he has your daughter whether by design or not he knows hes facing kidnapping and that changes everything sumner stared at him blankly no no youre wrong he said it with a fathers certitude its not a kidnapping a heist maybei can see that but as youve said their records nothing suggests kidnapping its not possible first thing is locate the jet and determine its condition and the condition of those aboard sumner looked at the map on the screen overhead a line drawn on it terminated in a t with a fairly large circle drawn around it i know you made an effort to get down here walt said but honestly youre of more value to us and to your daughter waiting for that call back in your hotel room forget that like i said reroute the call do what you have to do but im not going anywhere whos in on this sheriff besides you whos on this investigation its a big operation at this point prior to this we had issued a bolo for the suspects law enforcement for the fivestate region are on alertthe faa the air force homeland security the fbi given recent events this country doesnt take lightly the commandeering of jets the fbi homeland i dont want them on this theyll screw it up shoot it down without regard to whos on board everyones apprised of our suspicions its a fluid situation fuck that shes my daughter do you have kids sheriff sumner asked i do two daughters a little younger than yours and if they were your daugh he caught himself my nephew walt reminded believe me i dont want anyone else on this case any more than you do but the only way to keep that from happening is to find that jet tonight before the bureau or other agencies get their act together its all about timing nothing much is going to happen on their end tonight itll take them a while to even get here reminded of arrivals walt checked the wall clock his fathers plane was due summer zipped and buttoned her pants releasing a pentup breath of relief she peered around the tree trunk having chosen a spot in the woods with a decent view of the lodge partway down the hill and well away from the stairs a tendril of gray smoke rose from the lodges chimney her mother had been an expert problem solver getting from a to z in as straight a line as possible priding herself on being like her mother summer had resolved long ago to show her father that she need not depend on him for her every thought and deed pushing away her panic she would think her way out of this on her own kevin had yet to appear he was either hiding inside the lodge or had been caught not only was he of no use to her he probably needed her help hed made a big deal out of her being the prize these men were after could she use that to her advantage offer a trade she then wouldnt honor she owed him there was no doubt about that hed saved her from that creep with the wandering hands had messed up his face pretty badly hed gotten her out of the plane and into the woods when she was like a zombie she now saw how hard it must have been for him to stay with her rather than just taking off and leaving her was she supposed to leave him in that lodge or what she needed to think clearly it was growing colder by the minute dressed as she was in jeans and a tshirt summer wondered how long she could last she certainly couldnt make it through the night if she could get up the nerve to hide under the tarp again shed be relatively warm but going back inside the lodge felt all wrong it had eaten kevin up she wasnt about to let that happen to her that left the plane would they be watching the plane kevin had suggested they intended to steal the jet that seemed possible theyd picked the right target her father loved that lear more than he loved her hed have paid anything to get it back if hed had two nickels to rub together but now that it was out of the picture was she their target as kevin had suggested if so why werent they looking for her out here or are they she began to fall apart her sole focus for the past fifteen minutes had been to pee but with that taken care of she was faced with too many unknowns and not enough choices and no one to help her figure it out that brought her back to kevin and whether she should or even could actually abandon him and then she saw the woodpile to the right of the shed and heard a voice as plain as day it was her mothers voice make a signal the voice said if anyone was searching for the jet it was from the air there was far too much wilderness to cover on the ground she needed to make something big so they could see her smoke from the chimney fire if fire drew the attention of the three men and the cowboy it might buy her time to get to the jet where shed find food water blankets her fathers emergency kit its radio and gps she even could picture his sacred airphone next to his seat i can call anywhere in the world with this thing he had told her proudly so many times the best thing she could do for kevin was to get both of them rescued she reached into her pocket found the key to the jet alongside the chisel it warmed in her hand no longer cold suddenly she was burning with anticipation the whirring of an electric drill followed by the crunch and crack of a screw biting into wood prompted kevin to call out no he shouted banging on the closet door they were sealing him inside as the drill cried out screws splintered the doorjambs first one then the other kevin pounded let me out nothing not a word just the grinding whir of the drill now affixing the doors to the floor kevin had the knife from the learjet something they didnt know about as well as the flashlight if only he could get them to open the door he could fight his way out but that wasnt going to happen the minutes passed and there was even more drilling nearby the window perhaps or the door to the room or both they were sealing him up in a tomb listen to me kid now came a mans voice from the other side the copilot spoke in a hushed confiding tone kevin took a step back hit the wall and sank into a squat his heart racing the mans voice also had an unmistakable note of finality about it were doing you a favor here the man said this doesnt involve you or sam elliott here and lets keep it that way by morning youre out of here alive and well got that so give it a rest dont be stupid dont fight it youre safe stupid will get you hurt hurt bad be smart sleep it off by tomorrow thisll be just a nightmare you had why hadnt the man mentioned summer kevin thought this through from several angles because they already have her footfalls receding this doesnt involve you and sam elliott here for kevin the operating word was here did here mean that the cowboy was tied up in the study that gave him some sense of hope isolation scared him more than claustrophobia his eyes lighted on the closets oldfashioned plank ceiling the rough lumber probably had been taken from the property the ceiling casement and walls were all constructed of onebysix pine boards none of the joints fit together perfectly having withstood decades of deep winter snow and the unforgiving climate the gaps between the boards were about the thickness of a steakknife blade kevin stood slipped the flashlight out of his pocket and switched it on a pair of metal filing boxes were stacked in the corner he gingerly climbed atop them to inspect the ceiling he slipped the tip of his knife into a gap between the boards and gently began to pry them apart roger mcguiness lathered in sweat from having spent the past hour cutting pine boughs to disguise the learjet delivered cantells satellite phone to the lodges living room it rang but i didnt answer it mcguiness said cantell stared at the bulky phone hed left it behind on the jet having seen lights on in the lodge while landing and wanting to have an excuse if necessary to get inside the lodge hed been expecting a call from lorraine to tell him shed arrived at the remote nevada strip but to his surprise the caller id showed a different number he knew who it was and was thinking about when to call back as the phone rang in his hand with mcguiness and salvo watching he hit the power button and shut the phone off ill deal with that later he said what now mcguiness asked mopping his face with his shirt sleeve fyi were maybe eighty or ninety miles from hailey we flew damnnear directly over stanley so weve got to assume we were spotted a jet flaming out is a pretty spectacular sight so were made whats the plan salvo said anxiously were out of here right you said the idea was to get away from the plane radioactive isnt that what you called it all we need are the gps coordinates to find it right lets not forget we were going to be a hundred miles away from here before we even made our demands right mcguiness feigned disinterest by flipping through a pamphlet and we will be cantell said the schedule is changed but not the plan he lifted a framed topographical map from the wall and laid it on the coffee table in front of the oversized stone fireplace the map covered an area of roughly fifty square miles a red star stuck on the lower half of the glass next to a light blue line designating a river were not flying cantell said and the cowboy told me that if we float the river its four days minimumhe pointed to the map and shook his headmostly in a very long canyon through very steep terrain after the first day there are a few dry tributaries but if you hike any of them youre looking at thirty to fifty miles of total wilderness without trails which would take longer than floating out on the river and if we do that were sitting ducks theyll be waiting for us so were screwed salvo said no we need to be resourceful cantell said behind this cabin is shady mountain part of the river canyons walls it surrounds this part of the ranch sealing it off from unwanted hikers the grapenuts crowd now theres rockclimbing gear in the garage and my guess is theres a route set in the face of the mountain if its there it should be easy to see in daylight but first things first we need the girl we need to find her fast then we put sam elliott and shia labeouf in one of the rafts and send them downstream but theyre the biggest threat to us matt we eliminate the threat by getting rid of them we have to close the deal were going to need time to do it once theyre on the river weve got four days unless salvo interrupted they run into somebody on the river who has a phone trips on this river are strictly controlled mcguiness broke in holding up a dogeared forest service pamphlet from the coffee table theyre not to spoil and im quoting here the natural sights and sounds that campers deserve in a remotewilderness experience in other words this is no disneyland he pointed to sites on the map were just about halfway between these two camps a full days journey if we put those two on the river about sunrise theyre not running into anybody the only way they would would be to stop and wait for the next group floating downriver and then they might not have a phone if they have a radio its a day and a half before the terrain allows it to transmit theres a big warning in here about that the cowboy knows about it he wont sit around waiting for other campers to show up that gives us at least a couple days screw that its too risky we should just lock them up here good plan matt just let them dehydrate and die or maybe we should give them the run of the kitchen the cowboy is our number one threat he knows this place the woods he knows what our options are we need him gone but last i checked were not in the business of killing people tell that to the wine currier salvo protested all the more reason to get out of here think about it matt who turned on the gas valve that silenced salvo the girl mcguiness said usually the silent one cantell noted this change we tell the insurance company they have to pay up we tell them that without payment in full the jet will blow with the girl in it no way mcguiness shouted hang on relax shes with us the whole time not on the jet but we need to give them an incentive to speed things up because we dont know how long weve got but if the two somehow manage to make that call salvo protested we have the girl cantell repeated let them find the jet that silenced salvo and mcguiness both once weve rendezvoused with lorraine at a new location were free and clear we leave the girl behind no harm no foul but the beauty of the original plan mcguiness said was that we werent going to call the company until we were long gone if they didnt pay up then we wouldnt give them the coordinates and thered be no way for them to find the plane we could then go back four months later and fly the thing out of there sell it in south america that was our backup all of thats gone now were not exactly in the nevada desert and no ones flying that jet anywhere probably ever so if were going to play the girl card why not start there im open for suggestions cantell said throwing his arms out he searched the faces of the other two salvo appeared to be brooding mcguiness reeked of impatience mcguiness said what if we cant find the girl well find her if necessary we use the boy in her place we dont take hostages mcguiness said we dont kill people we broke one of those rules already cantell said he looked directly at salvo he wanted the man motivated its a work in progress we could put all three of them in the raft mcguiness suggested we could cantell said but im voting to bring her along as insurance and given her age and looks how do you think matts going to vote salvo grinned give her to me for an hour and i promise you shell do whatever we ask you disgust me mcguiness said like i should care salvo fired back cantell stepped in girls he could ill afford such dissension well make a lot of noise like were going off to look for her then one of us stays here while the other two keep an eye on the jet temperatures dropping fast out there he added shes not ready for that she wont last an hour im not going back in the garage summer told herself repeatedly but a little voice at the back of her brain told her otherwise the woodpile would need fuel of some kind to light it and she remembered seeing a beatup cooking grill and a lighter wand on her way out a row of jerrycans next to the atvs suggested gasoline or diesel fuel so while she had no problem connecting the dots she just couldnt muster the courage to go back in there and get the wand and fuel and if she could then what what if all three men responded to the fire did she head for the jet and try to phone out or did she head for the lodge and look for kevin what if only two men responded or only one what if they just let it burn she stood there shivering more than anything she just wanted all this to go away shed dragged kevin into this taking his keys and forcing him to follow what a jerk shed been and now shed gotten him kidnapped or worse a big part of her just wanted to take off to convince herself that it was in everyones best interest for her to save herself and somehow get word to her father her father how she had betrayed him abused his trust having argued her own case so many times that she actually had come to believe it now she saw the absurdity of her logic the product of her mistakes she now could see it all through her fathers eyes could feel his anger he wouldnt know where she was probably didnt even know the jet had been stolen and by the time he figured it out any concern he had would fester into rage he didnt lose his temper oftenshe should have been more grateful for thatbut when he did shed be on the receiving end dread now joined the cold and she felt like all the life had drained out of her balanced atop the file boxes the knife wedged between the boards and prying kevin at first thought his efforts looked promising as the boards began pulling loose but then an unwilling nail cried out sending a chill through him that was like biting down on an ice cube he moved the tip of the knife closer to the nail and tried again and again it squealed if he kept this up the sound would bring them running discouraged he pounded his fist on the closet door let me out of here he shouted it was a futile childish outburst but the longer he remained inside the dark closet the greater his growing sense of panic he was no lover of confined spaces and the closet felt ever smaller by the minute his fatheror had it been his uncle waltonce told him that everything happens for a reason he dismissed the platitude at the time the same way he dismissed anything an adult said but now things were different with the words reverberating in his head he tried to clear his thought he had a spark of realization now he understood everything happens for a reason even childish outbursts he stuck the knife between the boards again and kicked the closet door let me out of here he hollered even louder yanking the knife down the nail crying out and the board coming free the sound covered by his petulant plea please he screamed grabbing the board and pulling down his cry timed perfectly the board came loose in his hands painfully aware that the avicorps jet carrying his father was scheduled to touch down in fifteen minutes walt leaned over the incident command centers first row of tables and found steven garmans cologne a little too much the pilot was stocky with an irishmans florid cheeks and the kind of handsome that found its way onto the labels of soup cans he had spent the last several minutes proposing to fly the portable transmitter on the same vector as sumners jet the plan included some sophisticated flying that would allow the wireless carrier to locate the phone if walt could win their cooperation that seemed unlikely to walt but he wasnt going to squash garmans optimism walt moved another foot or two away the cologne had to have a name like brute force or demons mist i can tell you where id have aimed for garman said please some big guns have been buying up ranches along the middle fork there are what maybe half a dozen grandfathered deeded properties up there right in the middle of national forest those money guys love to have what no one else can have they also love to break the rules any one of them could have made improvements to their stripsi mean theyre not supposed to mess with the landscape but no ones going to know whether they have or havent right and let me tell you something if youve got one engine flamed out and another not producing power youre not going to be real picky about where you put it down he stood moved over to walts electronic map and drew on a pad with a special pen circling a shadedout area given the route youve predicted thats my bet mitchums ranch thats at least a mile or two past where the math puts them walt said a yellow circle had been drawn around a sizable area on the map the trajectory would put them here he indicated the center of the circle and if they crashed thats probably right garman said listen were always hearing about pilot error what no one talks about is pilot terror no one wants to crash youd be surprised what you can get out of a plane when it gets hairy up there given their rate of descent and the fact that mountain homes radar lost track of them somewhere in here if they had a bead on a private strip out here they could have been skipping right along the treetops he said his voice excited he was enjoying this they bank it into the canyonhis big hand thumb and pinky extended became the planeand now theyre off radar keeping maybe a hundred feet off the water full power because that engines down to thirty percent or less all they have to do is squeak out another mile or mile and a half his finger now followed the rivers twists and turns theyre down inside the canyon having executed this final turn and put it down hard hope for the best whether its in one piece i dont know but id start my search somewhere here thats miles off of where were planning walt said all im saying is a pilot doesnt follow math he tries to stay alive id have tried for mitchums anything short of that with a full load of fuel youre in a thousand pieces and burning no thanks he added and thats another thing the national forest is full of people this time of year if that lear crashed it would have produced a massive fireball youd have heard about it by now id like to take that to the bank send up a chopper im trying to avoid that walt said if this is a hostage situation god forbid the last thing we want is to broadcast that we know their location we want this done as quietly as possible until we know what were dealing with keep that in mind when youre up there okay but let me tell you something we have to face facts that the odds of hitting a strip are not good first and foremost we need to search for the wreck and for survivors thinking weve got a hostage situation here im afraid is nothing short of optimistic walt anxiously checked the clock dreading his fathers arrival so if you were conducting a ground search ahead of first light walt said garman nodded thoughtfully mitchums creek was their best shot the wireless repeater will tell you if theres a phone logged on it will but ill need to be well past stanley to eliminate any touristos whove left their phones on you can contact me on either of these numbers walt said scribbling them down and handing them over the room phone beeped and a womans voice filled its speaker sheriff i have special agent barlow for you line one the news of a call from the fbi won the attention of everyone in the room walts office was to be gently pushed aside in the name of national security all eyes turned to him he hesitated before answering tell him i stepped out for a minute summer stuck her nose to the jerrycans cap and sniffed she couldnt tell the difference between gasoline and diesel but the can clearly contained some kind of fuel so she dragged it out of the garage having spent less than a minute inside a moment later she faced the large pile of split firewood she circled the pile dousing the wood then drizzled a fuse of fuel some twenty feet away she wasnt sure how big the fire would be but big enough she hoped to bring them running and if all else failed she at least would have created a signal that might be spotted by planes although she hadnt seen or heard any she stood there with the empty jerrycan in one hand the lighter wand in the other thinking she wanted the can well away from her before she lit the soaked ground she screwed the cans metal lid down tight and ran it back to the woodpile launching it up on top she hurried back into the grass and found the lighter where shed left it the grass stank of fuel a trapezoid of light played across the lawn in the distance voices she fumbled with the wand its safety feature requiring both thumb and index finger working in concert to light she pulled the trigger click click a silhouette stretched across the lightpainted lawn as a man filled the doorway the wand sparked a tiny blue flame dancing at the end of its chrome barrel she lowered the wand to the grass expecting the flame to creep along but what happened was nothing like that whoosh in a fraction of a second the woodpile ignited black smoke spiraling up from it she fell back off balance and then scrambled to her feet and made for the woods fire she heard someone shout she raced down the mountain dodging tree trunks and tearing through bramble and shrub behind her the men were shouting frantically now as the woods glowed yellow from the fire then there was an explosion as the jerrycan blew up sounding like a bomb going off she stopped and turned around in time to see a ball of orange flame rising forty feet into the smokeblack sky sparks rained down like fireworks she continued her way down the mountain made easier by the light from the fire she reached the level airstrip the sound of the river not far off turning to admire her handiwork she saw the orange glow now lighting the rocky face of shady mountain keeping to the trees summer hurried toward the jet at the far end of the strip its wings and tail covered with pine boughs feeling in her pocket she took the learjets key firmly in hand jerry fleming all business from the moment his son had picked him up at the airport looked straight ahead out the cherokees windshield as he spoke as if it were twenty years earlier and he was teaching his son to drive how certain are we jerry asked at this point im convinced until something comes up to suggest otherwise is sumner prepared to play along with a ransom call walt asked no hes in denial says kidnapping is out of the question nothing strange about that no he seems able to reconcile someone stealing the jet but not kidnapping his daughter what happened to your mentoring the boy well that didnt take long walt said adding sarcastically this is all my fault you know myra has no control over the boy weve discussed it weve discussed nothing dad not since robert dont bring that up jerry stared out the side window haileys amber streetlights flashing across his face i knew you would why arent we going to your shop this new shop ive heard so much about walt had not told him about the new headquarters either myra was playing both sides or hed read about it in the paper since when do you keep up with anything im doing youd be surprised said jerry believe me i am i thought youd want to show off yeah thats me all right no need to get defensive were not going back to the office walt said hed stopped at his house and was loading in some extra camping gear for his father while his father remained in the passengers seat never offering to help so youre in charge are you jerry said is that right i cant go back to the office without dealing with the bureau at this point if were going to avoid their intervention then weve got to outrun them you and i are going to connect with brandon and the three of us are going on horseback into the middle fork are we now jerry said weve got a plane aloft with some cell gear that may help us pinpoint kevin its up there sweeping now were fairly certain the jet got down in one piece it was fully fueled so if it had gone down hard there would have been a fireball and nothing like that has been reported there are some private strips some grass strips maybe a few better than grass all im saying is its possibleprobable eventhat they got down that they walked away if we get a hit we can narrow this down maybe even talk to kev am i supposed to be impressed youre supposed to listen walt said your former employers would love nothing more than to take over this case for the time being my phone is off and if you noticed the radios off too of course i noticed i notice everything dont test me son this whole thing is going to test you dad because its my way or the highway this time you can follow or you can stay behind but you cant lead theres a system in place a system i put in place the arrangements have been made you can badger me all you want guilttrip me have at it but i wont budge were going into the backcountry all your criticism about me being a hick sheriff well welcome to hicksville dad you get to see it up close and personal now im going in and im getting kevin back were getting him before the bureau even hits the ground because once they do i know i know jerry said i was the one warned you about the sac remember he looked tempted to say more to challenge walt but he didnt then the silence set in a wall rising between them and where once walt would have done anything to tear that wall down including acquiesce this time he did not instead hands gripping the wheel he bit his tongue they stopped by a buddy of walts and loaded a raft onto the roof they bypassed a mile and a halfs worth of traffic backed up from the bridge by going offroad arriving at the bikepath bridge that still remained under brandons control how long walt asked his deputy out his window another fifteen or twenty almost there good youre coming with me walt said turn it over to someone they stopped for five minutes at brandons trailer she inside jerry asked probably walt answered but please dont jerry climbed out of the cherokee and went inside the trailer to speak with gail walt felt like driving off and leaving his father in the company of the woman he thought of as his exwife and the deputy she now was sleeping with instead he waited it out brandon threw some stuff in the back of the cherokee and when jerry returned offered his hand over the backseat but jerry wouldnt accept it brandon caught walts eyes in the rearview mirror walt aimed the mirror at the ceiling did you call willie walt asked brandon hell have three of his best saddled and waiting for us a fourth with a pack saddle we can borrow his dodge a dually that can haul an eighthorse no problem walt passed a topographical map back to brandon ive circled mitchums creek ranch you will figure a route while i speak to remy i left sumner at the office hes not going to like my bedside manner of leaving him in the lurch but it is what it is and remy is worth a half hour maybe well learn something jerry glanced in his sons direction if he had something to say he kept it to himself walt hoped some of his fathers toxic anger might transfer over to brandon for breaking up his marriage although that was asking a lot so brandon jerry finally said yes sir what if shed been your wife walt wished he hadnt moved the mirror sometimes he loved his father walt took a seat opposite remy on the brown velour horseshoeshaped bench at the far back of the mobile command rv a collapsible table separated the two but to walt it felt as if they were sitting too close on the table were a digital voice recorder a legal pad a stack of postits and two paper cups of tullys coffee there was a blackandwhite sticker on the cups advertising kbs burritos walt spoke into the recorder providing time location and both their names the formality won remys full attention he seemed ready to say something but didnt do you understand why were here mr remy walt asked remy adjusted his left leg bound in a straight position by the cast sticking it out to the point where it rubbed against walt ive been detained believe me it will all be straightened out shortly my nephews gone missing along with a hotel guest a plane has been stolen a private jet remy cocked his head if he was acting he was doing a good job of it he seemed genuinely surprised to hear any of this let me just lay it out for you walt said im not talking without a lawyer present so noted and yet here we are yes here we are walt stared at remys leg then looked him in the eye slipped in the shower remy said yes id heard that your possessions were passed along to me by the hospital i returned them to you as youll recall and i never thanked you properly youre welcome walt looked down at the mans cast again must hurt comes and goes he winced a grin the painkillers help were a sportsoriented community walt said skiing in the winter all sorts of stuff in the summer biking hiking tennis so youre the chamber of commerce all of a sudden we see an inordinate number of broken bones here have some of the best orthopedists in the country a little town of five thousand amazing really guess i was lucky i slipped here remy said but sure doesnt feel that way we know it wasnt an accident your doctor and your radiologist confirmed that its blunt trauma we know someone did this to you not true and i know youre lying remy stared straight at walt we know the adams bottles are forgeries fakes counterfeit whatever term applies to wine you can feign shock continue to issue denials but the fact is we have conclusive scientific proof impossible we conducted tests on the bottles earlier this afternoon remy grimaced perhaps he had known all along ms finch he began walt didnt comment shes a reckless overly ambitious amateur sheriff i wouldnt go taking her word some kind of soundwave test can determine the alignment of the fractures in the glass it wasnt performed by ms finch remy didnt appear to be breathing fakes walt said im operating under the assumption you knew as much that in fact youre responsible ms finch is evidently quite the researcher she believes she can help the fbi connect the dots a graduate student spoken with a convulsive disdain makes my theory of insurance fraud all the more credible which brings us to the death of mr malone and the attempted theft of the bottles which brings into question one christopher cantell and his associates one roger mcguiness and one matthew salvo you with me remy pursed his lips heres where it gets a little dodgy for you mr remy walt drank half the coffee in two swigs he was starving couldnt remember the last time hed eaten cantell was not only behind stealing the wine he stole the jet the missing learjet with two teenagers aboard a young girl and my nephew that means you mr remy are in all likelihood not only connected to the death of mr malone but also to the theft of that jet and the kidnapping of those kids you mr cantell and the others are all in serious trouble for a third time walt looked down at remys leg lets say he continued just for speculations sake that you had nothing to do with the jet i had nothing to do with any of this when this all comes unraveledand its already started toyoull be charged and youll need to dig yourself out innocent until proven guilty yeah right im not talking about our legal system walt bumped his leg into remys cast and remy flinched and gasped youll need to dig yourself out he repeated you know the rule of thumb about the first person to confess the leniency shown by the courts which leaves you in that dodgy position i just mentioned because when your attorney arrives hes going to shut this interview down shut you down and he has every reason to do so nine times out of ten its the smart move but this isnt one of those times in fact you and i are preciously short on time walt called out to the front of the bus how long hes about five minutes out came back the reply see how on top of things we are walt asked remy who was struggling to look at ease we have only your best interest at heart walt pulled back his sleeve and looked at his watch go on remy said his eyes ticked toward the front of the bus me ive got nothing more to say should i keep the recorder going he reached for the device remy glanced toward the front of the bus once again decisions decisions walt said maybe theyll stop with the knee walts hand touched the off button stop leave it running walt sat back at times he found the work boring and tedious then there were times like this i had nothing to do with the theft remy said either one i knew nothing about them walt kept his face expressionless but inside he was churning remy seemed so selfrighteous the bottles will not go to auction walt said theyve been pulled remy searched the bus as if looking for an escape in that case he said i need protection tonight going forward were not in the protection business then arrest me sheriff how can i you deny being involved with the bottles or the jet walt made it a statement for the recorder he rapped his knuckles on remys cast the adams bottles are fakes remy said head down forgeries my doing its true you have to convince me mr remy you have to provide details that as an investigator i can substantiate i have to bring something to my prosecuting attorney facts are often a good place to start the jefferson bottles are authentic i dont remember discussing the jefferson bottles walt looked remy in the eyes tick tick tick he thought the lawyer will shut us down i did very well off of that sale remy said his eyes devoid of light then the economy tanked and people werent exactly beating a path to buy wine up here in sun valley is different i dont need to tell you what recession people are saying but still the rest of the world is broke so i decided to find some new bottles something to tide me over it didnt come cheap neither did verification i had to find an investor which i did who put up a substantial amount of capital but then there were questions from one of the verification experts amsterdam walt interjected wanting remy to know he was ahead of him thanks to janet finch remy could not contain his surprise though he recovered quickly the theft the attempted theft here im being blamed for that makes sense to me but it wasnt me whats done is done it wasnt my investors either but they think it was me its a mess tell me about your relationship with christopher cantell never met him he waited for walt to say something you dont believe me dont sound so surprised walt said tick tick tick remy had gone ashen he ran his hand through his stubby hair he couldnt stop looking toward the front of the bus have i heard of christopher cantell remy said of course i have thats better no you misunderstand have i met him no spoken to him never but he had his fifteen minutes youre aware of that right walts head swooned he cursed not eating he should have looked more deeply into cantell you do go to the movies remy asked apparently not often enough christopher cantell remy said that movie italian job no that was a different one mark wahlberg right was it that one with hanks no no that was a con man i think i dont know i forget but they made a movie based on this guy cantell a heist movie above average nothing great but i remember the press they played up the reallife side of it thats as much as i know about him a movie walt said he felt the rug going out from under him look it up said remy imdb it what do i care and you think cantell just happened to go after your wine ask him a fine line of sweat pearls had formed on remys upper lip they both sensed the imminent arrival of the attorney how should i know remy continued there was lots of publicity advance pressbelieve me i saw to that churn up the market you know and part of that is churning up the rumor mill the trades have been covering these bottles for the past six months a man came onto the bus walt recognized terry hogue one of the valleys best attorneys the christensens had helped their friend out indeed i forged those bottles remy leaned forward and whispered harshly so charge me a movie charge me thatll be enough sheriff terry hogue called out to walt from the front of the rv were all through here charge me remy pleaded ranches gave way to national forest and soon there was not a structure in sight the pale moonlight played off the towering bluegray boulders to the right the rolling carpet of evergreens to the left a pair of amber eyes suddenly glowed at the side of the twolane road a blacktailed fox darting across in the glare of the headlights just barely in time to reach the other side sixteen miles on horseback brandon reported four to five hours if we can stick to the trail if were lucky we can cross to the east side of the middle fork by dawn jerry checked his watch hed been doing so often far more than necessary walt was pushing seventyfive miles an hour with the light rack flashing you understand it could get ugly jerry said to brandon in the backseat brandon looked up from the map and the handheld gps which he was programming but didnt speak he and walt met eyes in the rearview mirror there are times to wear the badge and times to put it in the drawer jerry said thats not the way we do it walt said if anyone survived if anyones holding kevin its going to get wet i just want both of you prepared for that rescuing the boy and the girl is our first priority brandon said ive got no problem with that the fbi gets hold of this jerry cautioned i happen to know the sac out of salt lake personally hes a shockandawe advocate loves the heavyhanded approach hell get them both killed were not setting up comm lines were not negotiating we get our sights on these guys well drop them just like that weve got to hit them hard without warning weve got one chance after that they take control and we oblige them but were not going to let it get to that kevin is going to walk away from this the whine of tire rubber on road filled walts ears im just saying jerry continued that thats the way its going to be i need to hear you say it too brandon or you can stay behind when we switch to the horses ive got no problem with your doing that its either all in or not in at all an operation like this its just the way its got to be we get it walt said i gotta hear him say it im in brandon said we might face charges jerry said walt and i that boys our blood its not fair to ask that of you but ive got to lay it out the way i see it im in brandon repeated and just for the record they fired first jerry turned to face brandon for the first time he was grinning cantell futilely sprayed the garden hose on the burning pile of wood while mcguiness shoveled dirt on it salvo was trying to flatten the pile and spread out the logs with a rake for all their efforts the fire continued raging throwing sparks and smoke high in the sky leaning against the rocks behind them were a loaded rifle and a loaded twelvegauge overunder shotgun cantell had no desire to use the guns but understood the authority they represented other thoughts competed in his head the fire had been deliberately set as a signal the girls doing she had a brain and a lot of nerveinformation useful to him but unwelcome matt take over here cantell passed the useless hose to salvo and took off for the front of the lodge throwing the door open and looking directly toward the study he could see that its door remained screwed shut he hurried outside behind the lodge and doublechecked the window to the study plywood was screwed down tight back inside he stood in the middle of the living room listening to the boy banging around in the closet like hed been doing for the past ten minutes it was driving cantell nuts but he had no way to quiet the kid to warn him cantell didnt see the girl but she could be hiding anywhere he pushed the front door shut first and last chance ms sumner he called out the kids banging stopped if you give yourself up cantell said well treat you okay if not youll be dealt with well it wont be pretty your call i need your answer right now he waited it was only when his eyes alighted on the destroyed radio that his head cleared the radio reminded him of the jet the girl has a key preoccupied with trying to copilot mcguinesss emergency landing he hadnt considered how his stowaway had gotten on the plane but now hed had to deal with sam elliott and the boy adlibbing as he went but now he ran to the fire shouting as he went salvo and mcguiness had gotten some control over it the girl has a key he announced watch the inside of the house he called to salvo youre with me he ordered mcguiness kevin had heard someone shout fire and then people stampeding out of the lodge this was followed by silence he sniffed the air didnt smell anything but he wasnt about to stick around to find out if the place was going up in flames he pulled the boards free from the ceiling as fast as he could two split and broke three others came out cleanly he now had a hole big enough for his head he shone the flashlight into dead space between the ceiling and the roof pulling free several more boards he pushed the flashlight through he climbed up into the attic again he smelled for smoke he got dust and an overwhelming putrid odor he now shone the light in both directions he could see the full length of the building the cowboy was tied up in the study below he was a big guy an adult he knew the ranch hed be a good ally kevin needed him as an ally the attic floor was covered with a mix of sand and what looked like shredded newspaper a decadesold attempt at insulation it took kevin a few tries to get the knack of placing his knees successfully on the crossbeams protruding from the sandnewspaper insulation was the occasional electrical wire following one he dug down until he reached a junction box if he could get to the study and untie the cowboy it would be two against threedecent odds once he got summer out of the garage it would be three against threeeven better odds he kicked the study ceiling hard but the boards held he thought he heard a mans voice so he stopped and listened it was coming from the general direction of the living room a few agonizing moments passed had they found the closet empty the sound of someone leaving the lodge allowed him to breathe again he waited there was no more shouting kevin drove his heel down on the junction box and it gave way opening a small gap between it and the ceiling boards he put his eye to the hole and could see the cowboy lying on the floor on his side he was gagged his hands were tied behind his back his ankles tied with what looked like electrical cord with the leg of the desk between them his blue eyes were staring back at kevin kevin knew he wasnt getting through the ceiling without a chainsaw the thought he might have to go it alone overwhelmed him he wondered if the hijackers had found summer or had the fire been summers doing that thought charged him with purpose leaving the cowboy wasnt right if the lodge was on fire he had no choice and he needed him he aimed the flashlight around the attic hoping to see another way down dust filled the beam he lit on a paper wasp nest in the far corner some sagging spiderwebs then he lit on a row of upsidedown bats stifling a reaction he now knew the source of the putrid smell he wanted out of therenow he lifted his knees from the crossbeam and squatted on his feet ready to move nothing he could do about the cowboy his knife poked him nearly cutting him his only weapon maybe the only way he had to defend himself it was crucial to his survival he reached down and adjusted it but the cowboy was down there staring up at him holding the knife kevin forced his arm through the gap he trained his eye through the same hole the cowboy nodded at him and bounced his way off to one side of the desk out of the way kevin sniffed the air again still no smoke what if he dropped the knife and the cowboy couldnt reach it but he had to try itd be cruel not to with the cowboys legs bound to the desk it was doubtful he could reach the knife if kevin just let it fall he had to throw it swinging his arm kevin signaled his plan the cowboy nodded kevin hoped like hell they were speaking the same language as kevin leaned lower to tell the cowboy to look out there was a bang to the right someone had entered the lodge boy you hear me kid it was matt the one kevin had hit with the fire extinguisher kevin let the knife drop it landed quietly on the rug which was good but well out of the cowboys reach which was bad be that way matt shouted from the living room even if the cowboy managed to reach the knife he was still locked in the room kevin began crawling quietly toward the opposite end of the long attic the hijackers had closed up the learjet and camouflaged it well summer used her key the lear was dark inside suggesting it was empty but she stood there a moment before climbing the stairs and then shut herself inside she hadnt thought through any of this everything for her was minute to minute and she feared her lack of planning would backfire her mother would have worked it out logically step by step her father on the other hand would have tried to talk his way out she was some hybrid of the two a stranger in her own strange family the jets soundproofing made the drumming in her ears all the louder this was the first chance shed gotten to stop and think and she couldnt think she felt removed she felt numb she headed straight for the battery switch the batteries had to be engaged in order to use the cd the tvs or any of the outlets next she headed for her fathers seat she slid back the wood panel and nearly squealed with glee when she saw the red led on the airphone flashing it had powered up come on she encouraged the red to change to green signaling a connection to the satellite she counted backward from ten had the antenna broken off had they covered it with pine boughs on the count of four it changed to green she snatched up the receiver and dialed for a moment there was nothing on the other end then came static and soft pops that went on far longer than she thought appropriate finally the phone purred in her ear it was ringing hello her fathers voice said shed meant to speak to say somethinganythingbut the sound of him choked her and she couldnt get a word out dad she gasped but far too softly she could see him clearly his face his smile she had a mental picture of him in the hotel suite she thoroughly regretted every ounce of grief shed ever given him felt so badly for making him pay for her mothers death when hed only tried to help her understand it she loved him so much but never expressed it always taunting him to fill the void an impossibility her accusing tone her reckless blaming him for her problems the bitterness with which she dealt with him it all washed over her in a wave of selfloathing sum her vision blurred just the sound of his voice yeah she choked out its me im on the plane a very long pause oh thank god she thought he might be crying as well we landed kind of crashed into something theres a river theres three of them she rambled through a quick disjointed explanation laced with apology and begging for forgiveness i dont know what to do she finally said you jesus listen they wont hurt you you dont know that theyve got kevin i think im pretty sure i wont let them hurt you he said it wasnt so much what her father said as the way he said it that gave her pause she knew better than to interrupt she needed him to talk and to just keep on talking i want you to youve no idea where you are none no the woods a big river kevin said it was the middle fork but he doesnt know that for sure theres a log cabin on top of the mountain with a huge cliff we took off the same direction we landed the other day so thats toward sun valley right i dont know we could be anywhere i lit a fire a big fire someone should be able to see it but it wont last long can you get someone to look for it a fire of course i can you lit a fire that was good thinking sum what do i do dad what am i supposed to do static on the line interrupted them isnt there some kind of locator or something on the plane she then asked there was no answer she pulled the phone away from her ear making sure the light was still green dad im here i need to talk to them sum i need to start a dialogue forget it i am not going there doesnt the gps know where we are the gps he sounded distracted yes of course are you on the airphone is the panel lit theres a color map in the middle of the panel with a readout for latitudelongitude can you see it i dont want to let go of the phone put the phone down summer write down the coordinates and read them to me its important he added that last bit in the same condescending tone he used to use to let her know how stupid she was she resisted her immediate reaction of turning against him i cant she whined summer please she pulled the receiver away from her ear but even a few inches made her feel alone she smacked it back against her ear and stretched the wire instead making it to the aisle she squinted at the illuminated instruments panel youve got to do this for me he said im trying and dont forget the bag in the closet theres a gps in there as well a portable and a radio handheld an aviation radio planes continually monitor the frequency theyll be able to hear you get me the coordinates and read them into that radio listen go get that bag right now and then give me the coordinates over the phone i cant you have to sum you need that bag i need the coordinates its easy you can do this stay in the plane turn off the batteries to conserve power and use the handheld to broadcast everything you need is in the plane food water blankets youre there alone right yes can i lock the door i couldnt figure out how to lock it no it doesnt lock from the inside you could probably hold the handle which would keep the key from turning the thing is now listen to me i need those coordinates okay youve got to do this for me she looked to the front of the jet it seemed impossibly far away i want to go home she said im so sorry dad i am so so sorry summer sumner you listen to me youve done incredibly well there is nothing to be sorry about well come get you and your friend this is going to work out okay but i need to speak to the men who flew the plane i need to speak to the guy in charge the guy with the dark hair youve got to figure out a way to get him on this phone in the jet i can call back forget it she said theyll listen to me sum weve got to make this happen theyve got kevin theyre not listening to anybody for all i know they killed the cowboy what cowboy wait a second her heart raced even faster as if that were even possible you didnt say anything about any cowboy he said what cowboy she tried to focus but her thoughts were like a scratched cd they kept jumping back playing a riff then leaping forward again i need to speak to the guy in charge the guy with the dark hair she was repeating in her head summer are you there shed frozen she couldnt speak the copilot had seemed so familiarespecially his voiceand now she could place it he was whod called her fathers blackberry summer i need your coordinates put down the phone and get me those coordinates pause summer sum i need to speak to the guy in charge the guy with the dark hair repeated again in her head she dropped the phone spun a full circle and marched trancelike into the cockpit she looked to the right saw a logbook with a pen shoved in its spiral spine she tore out a sheet of paper wrote down the string of numbers doublechecking them against the navigation screen she returned to the airphone sum you there sum im here that shut him up do you have them ive got them read them to me what did you mean the guy with the dark hair she asked what are you talking about no dad im the one asking you what youre talking about who said anything about dark hair youre imagining things i didnt say anything of the sort you just said it read me the coordinates whats going on dad he called you right in the hotel your blackberry the call i answered i know him who is he she had it then she slumped in his chair she recalled him sitting there on the phone as they were about to land hed said listen i would if i could but this is my last trip on it how could he have known that hed said nothing to her about giving up the lear he had a trip to new york planned another to toronto hed talked to her about going with him on the jet i need the coordinates if im going to help he said that and i need to speak to whoevers in charge the man with the dark hair if hes the one in charge sure you said he was summer youre in shock youre not thinking clearly come on sweetheartkiddoyouve done amazingly well phenomenal keep it up just read me the coordinates would you please sweetheart the torn piece of paper trembled in her fingers what have you done she gasped into the receiver the static hissed and popped there was a snake in her ear the devils tongue now you listen to me summer youre in shock its completely understandable expected youre inventing things it happens but youve got to clear your head okay i want to help you you asshole now you listen to me young lady she pushed the end button tears began flowing as she stared at the receiver in her hand it represented him it represented everything wrong with him she beat it against the seats console and threw it against the fuselage pieces of plastic broke loose she stood and moved toward the closet but in a drunken disconnected way these werent her feet her hands this wasnt her she stumbled fell into another seat and buried her face in her hands she didnt remember coming to her feet again she found herself facing the closet she fumbled in the dark for the case and found it it opened by twisting two metal tabs she rummaged through the case and withdrew two devices she couldnt see well enough to know what they were but both were small and electronic a loud noise came from the front the door was opening the jet was so well insulated she hadnt heard anyone approaching only now as the key activated the opening mechanism did she know she hurried down the aisle only to slip and fall she banged her head against an armrest and dropped both devices leaving them she crawled ahead on hands and knees and reached for the door handle just as it was raising up and the stairs were lowering she threw her body on the handle forcing it back down from the other side a mumble of mens voices seconds later came a rustling from the jets right wing she kept her shoulder against the lever preventing it from moving she squatted down to get a better look out the right side she couldnt see anything but someone was out there crawling around the fuselage then she heard two loud snaps one directly beneath her the other directly overhead the shattered airphones led changed from green to blinking red theyd snapped off the antennas rendering the satellite phone and no doubt the planes other instruments useless the door lever pushed against her she kept her shoulder against it it was the last place she wanted to be more banging around outside with each sound she flinched he was out there on the wing there was more sound metal on metal something was going on out there she focused it was coming from the rear of the plane from the emergency exit the same hatch through which she and kevin had fled the plane again the front doors lever attempted to move again she braced against it but her attention remained on the rear of the plane where obviously someone was opening the door from the outside she spotted the handheld gps and radio she had dropped on the carpet she stretched out and kicked the gps beneath the first seat she then hooked the radio with the toe of her sandal noticing for the first time how scratched up her foot was keeping her shoulder to the door handle she saw things get light at the back of the plane paralyzed with fear she left the radio on the carpet a few feet from her the planes captain stepped into the aisle he aimed a small but blinding light at her were not going to hurt you he said dont do anything stupid the flare gun her father kept a flare gun for emergencies somewhere on the plane shed heard him mention it to william before the closet briefcase had she been so eager to find the radio that shed missed the gun step away from the door and keep your hands where i can see them the pilot said or else what she called out i thought you werent going to hurt me dont be a smartass she kept her shoulder against the handle too late she said if she could get past the pilot if she could get her hands on that case in the closet maybe just maybe ill hurt you if necessary i saw what you did to to my associate now keep your hands where i can see them and step away from the door her knees wobbled her arms and legs shook tears threatened once again she hated herself for it do not test me the man said his voice ominous and chilling summer stepped away from the door willie godfrey a thirdgeneration trust funder who could trace his lineage back to william brewster sported a mane of white hair even though only fortyodd years old tall and moviestar handsome he had a largerthanlife persona that was even bigger than his oversized overaccessorized pickup truck i can shave a good hour off your route he said loudly drawing brandon to his side the two men studied a map under the glare of a mercury light mounted on an outbuilding walt watched things play out between the two through a kitchen window cellphone and radio coverage having died passing galena summit ninety minutes earlier and wanting to preserve every watt of the satellite phones battery he was taking advantage of the godfreys landline he was brought up to speed on events in the valley the bridge was open to traffic again no further attempt had been made on the wine or the armory or half a dozen other potential targets things were returning to normal his biggest concern he was told was the barrage of phone calls from the fbi and homeland security and a growing anger because of walts silence sumner walt asked hanging around miserable he cursed you a blue streak when he found out youd left remy hes booked and in jail since when do we actually lock up a guy like that dont they usually make bail its complicated walt said back to sumner his hotel phone is forwarded and under surveillance and his wireless usage is being tracked in real time we cant hear conversations but we know the caller id incoming and outgoing walt said sometimes his own staff treated him like he didnt understand his own requests he considered the delicacy of the sumner situation where have you got him hes turned the break room into an office leave him there thats okay i have fiona on hold waiting to speak with you do you want to take it walt said to put her through hey fiona said everything okay he asked i answered your phone she said apologetically your office phone i figured that with you gone and me using your office if they put through a call it was probably you and who was it walt asked bracing to hear shed communicated with the fbi or another federal agency digging him into an even deeper hole a guy named bremer faa walt said hed dealt with charles bremer earlier when trying to make sense of sumners missing jet makes sense i gave him my direct line a plane a frontier jet spotted a fire from thirty thousand feet walt caught his breath wreckage just what i asked too small and organized more like a bonfire kevin the boy was smart enough to start a signal fire they eyeballed the coordinates it was definitely in the backcountry could have been a rafters bonfire on the middle fork but it was big very big maybe too big for that a signal fire walt said thinking aloud who do i tell this to what do i do next my first reaction was to jump up and tell someone but then that was something like twenty minutes ago and ive been going crazy since trying to figure out who youd want me to tell do we send up a search plane does the faa do that for us how does any of this work you didnt ask me that walt said excuse me the reason i took off without telling anybody my father knows the sac who will take this one the guys a wannabe rambo we dont want kevin caught in the middle of that ah okay so you dont approve of my dodging a potential disaster walt said hearing it in her voice when it comes to you and your father its not exactly like there arent issues there walt you know im not doing this for my father walt said im doing it for kevin and you know for a fact that this sac is who your father says he is no but walt saw his father out the window he was on the trucks tailgate checking out a rifle and a handgun would his father lie in order to hold off the fbi and give himself a chance at some fieldwork would he put kevin in the middle of his own ambitions christ walt muttered inadvertently into the phone what do you want me to do came her voice it has to be reported youd better tell brad but if it takes you thirty minutes or more to get down the hall if you told brad to call back bremer and determine the veracity of the report you want us to stall were still several hours from the ranch walt said id like to hold off the helicopters and jump squads until i know the situation out there i can understand that you think its a mistake i can hear it in your voice im new to all this she said dont give me that its your father she said yeah he said still watching him through the glass ill do this however you want okay then he said not changing his instructions the line went silent neither said a thing walt didnt want to be the one to end the call he felt like he was fourteen its kevin in trouble not me he said softly doesnt exactly feel that way from here about the other night whats interesting she cut him off is that its important to me youre important to me i handled that all wrong he said shut up walt im not talking about the other night but i am if you were in my position with gail and brandon the need to protect the girls it gets so you dont trust anybody or anything you can trust me she said he thought rather boldly im beginning to figure that out yeah well speed it up a little would you i shouldnt be smiling with all thats going down he said give it a rest it wont kill you kill you hung on the line between them he knew what she was thinking and she knew what he was thinking okay then he said to her credit she didnt get maudlin or overly dramatic which hed half expected okay then she said just before hanging up kevin discovered an attic access hatch at the opposite end of the lodge from the study given the change in framing he believed he was somewhere over the kitchen whoever had entered the lodge only minutes before was still there hed heard an occasional footfall as hed crept from one crossbeam to the next the overall silence was uncomfortable he couldnt help but think that each might be listening for the other now the silence was broken by a tapping sound coming from the study it continued until provoking a response from the hijacker whatever youre doing in there stop it a man shouted it wasnt the copilots voice maybe the guy whod grabbed up summer any more of that noise and i put a couple rounds through the door so he had a gun kevin used the noise of the man talking to cover the sound of his own lifting of the hatch it came up easily issuing a pale light into the attic he found himself looking down into a pantry closet its shelves loaded with cans and dry goods just inside the closets louvered doors he spotted a bucket filled with cleaning supplies and next to it a broom a mop and a canister vacuum cleaner there were boxes of lightbulbs and boxes of tape extension cords a stepladder and a toolbox on the opposite wall was a soapstone sink and a clothes washer tap tap tap last warning shouted matt the cowboy was the one doing the tapping meaning hed managed to use the knife to free himself it was either an intentional distraction trying to buy kevin time by keeping the sentrys attention or it was an effort at escape kevin had to take advantage of it he lowered himself down through the hatch swinging from the opening and catching the toes of his shoes on the lip of the sink hands on the walls he quickly lowered himself he eased the louvered doors open just as the sentry shouted again i said back off he cocked his shotgun kevin grabbed a spray cleaner from the bucket he slipped out into the hallway crept down it and looked around the corner and saw the sentry by the smoldering fireplace with his shotgun aimed at the door to the study the ensuing seconds stretched out uncomfortably as kevin was knotted by a dozen whatifs tortured by not having a clue what to do finally his mind made up he backtracked to the pantry and found a bottle of cooking sherry he snuck back down the hall took two steps into the room and launched the bottle at the fireplace now kevin shouted the shotgun misfired kevin dove back into the hallway scrambled to his feet and ran like hell for the garage he saw a flash of orange light on the walls that signaled the sherry igniting in the fireplace the shotgun fired a second time he heard wood peppered right behind him some of the shot rolled past his feet tiny balls no bigger than bbs salvo narrowly missed being set on fire when the fireplace erupted he jumped out of the way as flames spit out of the hearth the rug caught fire at his feet and he discharged the shotgun wildly in the direction of the kitchen but then the fire died out as quickly as it had exploded salvo reacted a split second too late to a noise coming from behind him and as he turned around he saw the study door openimpossibleand a coffee table coming at him at full speed in an instant he understood that the tapping sound had been the cowboy pulling out the doors hinge pins salvo hoisted his shotgun while backing away from the table coming at him he fell over an ottoman and the shotgun discharged a second time dropping it he then was able to deflect the table to the right and toward the fire and he rolled that same direction whoosh a wroughtiron fire poker missed salvos head by inches he sprang to his feet and grabbed a nearby lamp another swing of the poker demolished the lamp and broke the index and middle fingers of his right hand he screamed jumping back out of the way of a third blow retreat was his only option he turned a wet mist struck his face rendering him blind and in even more pain screaming again he fell to his knees he wiped his face with his sleeve but it was no use he heard the cocking of the shotgun you so much as twitch and im taking the side of your face off said the cowboy in a low rumbled twang my eyes salvo wailed help me what was that stuff the cowboy asked how the hell would i know salvo shouted fuckin help me toiletbowl cleaner said a second voice it was the kid but salvo couldnt see him couldnt see anything hands out said the cowboy to salvo flat on the floor salvo sagged forward get a wet towel the cowboy said to kevin theres some rope in the shop not the climbing rope bring it here a few minutes later salvo was gagged and tied on the study floor the cowboy tied the last knot and led kevin into the living room he extended his hand and kevin took it kevin he supplied john said the cowboy your friend gone kevin said he yanked back the tarp in the shed only to find her missing i know the season son her name is summer we were on the plane together its complicated gone where dunno just gone its her jet her fathers she was supposed to wait here for me mistake number one dont ever expect a woman to do what you think shes going to do mistake number two dont ever tell her what to do because thats a surefire way of making sure she doesnt youre making jokes shes out there they could have her if they had her then who lit that fire ever shot a rifle son yes sir follow me five minutes later kevin and john were armed with the shotgun and the rifle respectively john got them flashlights twoway radios and a large handgun for the small of his back pulling the door like that you could have gotten yourself killed kevin said they had gone out a back window of the lodge and up the rocks a route john knew from repairing the roof they had a birdseye view of the dying fire and the flickering orange woods beyond they tucked in behind a stone chimney that kevin immediately recognized as an elevated wellfortified defensible position something that obviously hadnt just occurred to john on the spur of the moment you ever play poker son john asked no sir not so it counts when they showed up they were unarmed if there was any time to produce a weapon it was then and they didnt so by the time that one was in the living room and i heard him cock the shotgun i figured it had to be my twelvegauge pump and i knew something he didnt because wed had some guests up to the ranch not two weeks ago with three kids under nine none of them three rifles was loaded id emptied em all myself we keep the ammo in the study so i had it in there with me they had the big guns leaving the two pellet pushers the overunder twenty and the twelvegauge pump both were loaded with bird shot did that myself we had a murder of crows waking up guests at five in the morning with their damn squawking flying garbage men is what they are been using the bird shot to discourage them not that id shoot a crow because thats illegal but bird shot would sting a bit but wasnt going to kill me but if it didnt turn out to be your shotgun but it was thats where gambling comes in son chance is nothing but a balance of risk to reward in the silence that followed they both heard voices filtering faintly through the trees thats coming from down below john whispered the jet they wouldnt be shouting at each other not unless theyre short a few cells summer yeah im going but john had him by the arm his grip was like a vise number one this is my ranch in a manner of speaking so lets get straight right off the bat that im calling the shots number two i served my country served it well so experience is on our side i promise you the only war these guys have seen is in movies number three they got my sat phone and busted up my radio they busted up more than that kevin said they took most of a wing off that little cessna down there hearing that john seemed all the more mad theyre guarding the jet which is smart he said but ill bet good money that they havent thought much about the cessnas radios mind you they will before long but so far they havent had the luxury of time something we owe your girlfriend a debt of gratitude for shes not my girlfriend kevin blurted it out his patience running thin do you always have to talk so much the cowboy surprised him with a grin i go long stretches out here all by my lonesome kid how bout we do something like find summer you gotta learn to strike a balance between your pecker and your brain boy number one we dont know theyve got the girl number two i know this ranch well come daylight im going to find her at the moment we got one of em tied up and two of em on the loose they took two of the rifles but theyre not loaded they heard that shotgun go off you can count on that they know their boy up here has got problems ive got a loaded thirtyaught with a night scope and youve got a twelvegauge pump with seven shells holding twelve thirty caliber balls each and another seven in your pockets thats enough round ball to stop a bear in its tracks those boys are outgunned and on unfamiliar ground and i imagine the silence is killing them at some point theyve got to come to us theyve got to find out what happened thats just human curiosity the best weapon weve got right now is patience we put our curiosity on hold so do exactly as i say and itll all work out start improvising and you put me the girl and yourself at risk got that we cant just sit here not exactly but nobodys ever going to find you up here youve got a rock cliff behind you and a rock chimney in front of you and fourteen shells to stop anyone from trying to pay you a visit what do you mean by find me you going somewhere you catch on real quick no way kevin said i got you out of there you need me exactly in case something goes wrong youre my backup im going down to the cessna and make a call out before they figure out that the radios still work and im supposed to just sit here he set the volume control on both radios slipped kevins radio into the neck of his tshirt and explained how to keep from announcing themselves to the others theyd use two different signals one to talk the other to announce that kevin had spotted either of the men headed for the lodge theres no way theyre going to find you up here john said but if they should youre going to have to shoot them and youre going to find out that its just about impossible to pull that trigger so what i want you to do is aim low for their feet the gun will kick when you shoot and likely youll hit them closer to the knees but you wont kill them you understand me you will not kill them dont think that way dont think at all just hold the gun tight to your shoulder aim at their feet and squeeze im a wicked shot kevin boasted my uncle hes like the best there is and he taught me theres a big difference between a rifle and a shotgun son yeah okay john asked kevin to repeat the instructions for the radio which he did flawlessly i could give you a pep talk the cowboy said but the fact is were looking up the wrong end of the horse here as long as we dont do anything stupid maybe well get through this you want to do right by this girl then do as ive told you i got it kevin said testily john gave him a look in the dim yellow from the slowly dwindling fire kevin nodded john laid his hand on kevins shoulder then worked his way down the rocks a moment later he disappeared john cumberland had his pride three men had taken over the ranch where he was caretaker wrecked his cessna lied to him smashed his skull tied him up threatened the lives of others his own life had been defined by a failed war a failed marriage a brush with the law then the successful stewardship of the ranch now he had failed in that as well a mans handshake means more than his signature and his word more than that john had offered these people a helping hand and look how they had answered he would put an end to it had the boy and girl not been in the picture he would have gone on a shooting spree instead he would approach things in a slightly more civil manner he silently worked his way down the wooded slope his body pumping with adrenaline breaking a keen sweat despite the chill in the air he followed a familiar game trail that switched back repeatedly until reaching the airstrip he moved slowly and carefully among the trees as he approached two hulking shapeshis cessna and the learjet there were lights on inside the lear the aft door open he couldnt see the other side but light on the ground suggested that the main door was open as well drawing closer john saw two shapes in a window he wondered if one was the girl if he could account for her and confirm she was safe he would be free to deal with the others as he saw fit he considered a surprise attack he could catch them unawares wound them and greatly improve his odds but if they had the girl his advantage was compromised smarter to make the radio call first to get help on the way timing the call was important given the narrowness of the valley the cessnas radio would likely reach only planes flying directly overhead plus it was late approaching eleven pm no small aircraft would be flying now his only chance was a commercial flight and few flew over at this hour he made his way to the cessna keeping his eyes on the lear always account for the enemy reaching the cessna he quietly popped open the passenger door and leaned across the pilots seat he activated the battery set the radio to an emergency frequency monitored by all commercial aircraft and put the headphones to one ear while it was possible that the hijackers were monitoring the jets radio john felt making the call was worth the risk nonetheless he stealthily aimed the barrel of his rifle through the cessnas partially open door at the jet he pushed the talk button mayday mayday he said in a husky whisper aircraft down hostage situation request immediate law enforcement at mitchums ranch on the middle fork of the snake river repeat mayday mitchums ranch on the snake he released the talk button and listened if anybody was out there the response would be immediate the crackling static in his ear suggested hed not been heard he repeated the call listened anxiously for a response again nothing he waited several minutes and tried yet again this time the headphone popped with a male voice breaking through the static its summertime i know you can hear me cowboy summer time no more prank calls get off this frequency now summer time two silhouettes appeared in the jets aft door one unmistakably female it appeared the girl had a knife held to her throat john sighted the mans head through the scope and considered the tight shot the man changed angle putting the girl between him and the cessna john lowered his rifle and put it on the ground three to four hours to go brandon said to the other two men slipping his gps device back in his pocket he was riding a chestnut filly with a blond mane a showcase quarter horse with a gait as smooth as a cadillacs all three riders wore headlamps a bluish glare illuminating the narrow trail ahead how long can the horses keep up this pace walt said he was not a regular in the saddle longer than you can brandon said they can trot for hours theyre fine but it wont be too much longer now before we have to walk them anyway terrains not getting any better well ride them til they drop jerry asserted no well walk them walt corrected and well hike the last half mile without them so they dont give us away theyre our way in they may be kevins only way out jerry was turning in his saddle to object but nodded instead yeah okay the sudden agreement silenced all three brandon consulted the gps looks to me like the trail runs out pretty soon he said first light jerry announced theyd agreed that their best odds of reaching mitchums creek ranch unseen was to cross the middle fork before sunrise before four am daylight diminished any element of surprise considerably walt thought unlikely theyd meet this worthy goal they had to hobble the horses inflate the raft and make the crossingall very timeconsuming this guy sumner brandon said he made mastermind right he produces movies walt said something sparked at the back of his tired brain a voice was shouting at him but whose was it you think if we get his daughter out safe and sound hell make it into a movie put a sock in it jerry said walt tried to focus on the voice in his head it wasnt fionas voice it wasnt his own it definitely was a mans voice something about movies what about mastermind walt said trying to stimulate whatever had prompted the mental itch it was soso brandon said fairly predictable it was a heist movie walt said flickers of an earlier conversation the voice belonged to arthur remy absolutely horse racing hitting up the track on the day of the biggest race of the year the bad guy stole the movie the mastermind guy he was the best thing about it but he had his fifteen minutes youre aware of that right walt had it he reined his horse to an abrupt stop brandon reined his horse but jerrys kept trotting the satellite phone rang as he was reaching for it his mind was elsewhere as he answered dad walt called out to jerry who still rode on stay with him walt said to brandon stop him if you can we ride together brandon passed walt the lead rope to the pack horse as walt spoke into the phone the bluish hue of brandons headlamp disappeared into the curtain of tree trunks its me steven garman answered back his voice just audible above the growl of an engine im at nine thousand feet directly over the river walt had heard a small plane not twenty minutes earlier hed switched on his phone and had caught a signal briefly the phone had buzzed repeatedly with incoming messages the connection was lost before he could check them ive got the repeater on board and up and running garman said damn if the thing didnt light up about five minutes ago i had reception about twenty minutes ago didnt last long im talking five minutes ago im well north of you didnt last for me either kevin could be one phone could be ten i had the hit only a few seconds i came around and headed upriver throttling back to limit engine noise im now a mile west of my earlier route id like to get closer and try again only one pass walt said as quietly as you can directly over the ranch see if the repeater gets a hit if it lights up then circle and try to hold the connection im going to start calling kevins cell from the sat phone and hope i get through copy that garman said turning for the ranch now walt was about to punch in kevins number when he realized that it would take garman a few minutes to get in position that gave walt time to make another call first he punched in the numbers and hit snd come down from there boy a mans deep voice called out kevin shuddered cold and scared and unsure what to do the cowboy had told him to shoot if he were discovered in his rooftop hiding place and yet by all appearances the cowboy had led them to him as if reading his thoughts the cowboy spoke forget what i said son theyve got summer i surrendered my weapon we need you to come down kevins back to the stone chimney he replayed the message focusing on weapon and need you was there a subtext to the cowboys message was kevin supposed to come down shooting was he supposed to hide the shotgun for later he was shaking so badly he couldnt keep his hands still were not going to hurt you or anyone he recognized the voice as the copilots were only interested in the plane the plane we know youve got a shotgun ive got summer in front of me lower the shotgun down to me and then well get you off of there this is no time for heroics kevin the voice continued no ones getting hurt unless you start something you hear me if the copilot had summer that left the two others with the cowboy they likely had his rifle and pistol can i get a shot off maybe two maybe even drop one of them with summer as their only bargaining chip would they dare hurt her do as he says boy said the cowboy with resignation in his voice they dont mean no harm to us he and summer had gone through too much to surrender now kevin they mean it summer called out he felt for the extra shotgun shells slipping one in each sock doing it made him feel like this wasnt surrendering okay he called back the copilot came around the side of the building his left arm slung over summers shoulder and tightly across her chest in his right hand was the cowboys handgun the shotgun first he said kevin wasnt about to provide them with another weapon he swung the gun against the chimney like a baseball bat busting it at the hinge that left the three men with the overunder shotgun loaded with bird shot and the cowboys rifle and handgun that was unnecessary the copilot hollered his voice brimming with anger kevin climbed down the small guy took kevin by the arm roughed him up as he took away the flashlight and knife easy the copilot chastised i owe this kid matt said as kevin was led away along with the others he glanced surreptitiously up at the chimney no one had thought to check up there if they had they would have found his cell phone tucked onto a high chimney rock its red no signal flashing high above a shining star flickered then disappeared in the black velvet backdrop of space a moving object had blotted it out farther along another star flickered disappeared then reappeared unseen by any human eye the phones led began blinking green just as it had done ever so briefly only minutes before the impenetrable coalblack sky bled to the color of a fresh bruise as it surrendered to the first photons from a faraway morning sun it held a luminescence not unlike the ocean depths where the last vestiges of sunlight mingle and fade soon the ashes of the milky way would shrink to a mere brushstroke leaving only named constellations and the planets battling for recognition at fourthirty am fiona should have been in bed savoring a final few hours of sleep instead she along with teddy sumner had hung around the sheriffs office awaiting word of walts rescue attempt her stomach in a knot when asked if she would fill in for the videographer she agreed solely because of the subject matter teddy sumner walt had requested an interview with the man the interview room directly across from walts office and one of three down a long hallway had a metal table bolted to the floor and metal chairs two fluorescent tubes lit the room too brightly fiona and her tripodmounted camera kept to the far corner a closeup of sumners tortured face on the screen deputy gloria stratum read from a card declaring the date time of day location and who was in the room it was noted that sumner was submitting to the interview voluntarily sumner was nodding fiona saw an acceptance on his face that she didnt understand you understand this interview is at the request of the sheriff stratum began reasserting what had just been said yes im aware that timing is critical you people have no idea what this is like for me fiona watched the closeup of his face as his pain intensified she braced herself realizing this was no simple q a stratum shifted uncomfortably in her chair you understand i know whats going on sumner said the sheriff i realize this is a bit unorthodox but the sheriff asked that i say just one word to you he wanted me to add that the best chance he has to rescue your daughter requires full disclosure sumner pursed his lips until bloodless white and nodded solemnly mastermind stratum said she then waited for some kind of response that was it she finally said the one word he wanted me to say mastermind sumner was flashfrozen by what he heard then his lips twisted and a wave of relief seemed to melt his agonized expression i he started then trailed off the point is no one knows what its like his eyes flashed at the camera angrily he was addressing it not stratum trying to hold this together without her mother trying to reinvent the wheel and get something going in this economy no less are you kidding me stratum said nothing but here we are right he continued i want to help her if i dont do something now and its later determined that if i had if it gives the sheriff an advantage it comes down to money right he continued love and money how fragile it all is how quickly it all changes all you ever want to do is protect her take care of her keep her out of trouble steer her away from the things that are only going to make it harder and push her toward the things that make it easier college good friends build her a solid foundation to stand on am i right he jerked back in his chair so abruptly that he went out of frame of the camera fiona widened the shot noticing in the process that her finger was trembling mastermind stratum repeated he looked up at stratum up at the camera and winced they say im a onehit wonder did you know that you know what its like to hear that said about yourself he closed his eyes slowly shook his head opened them managed another smug grin to stay in the game he continued theres a level of play that i dont expect you to understand but its critical if youre going to see the a scripts if youre going to have a chance at the big projects he leaned forward across the table the camera laboring to keep him in focus a bridge loan thats all he was shouting by now nothing to it he said sumner snorted nothing to it he exhaled and looked around the room anxiously hes a clever man your sheriff hes a keeper stratum said sumner put his hands behind his head and stretched his neck made a popping sound it wasnt fear in his eyes but anger a man pitting himself against the world fiona cowered into the corner okay he said pay attention again he was addressing the camera directly fiona pushed herself farther into the corner her back flat against the cool wall i first met christopher cantell when we were developing the script for mastermind he was brought in as a paid consultant fiona threw her head back and it hit the wall with a thud sumners eyes ticked in her direction but only briefly he looked back into the calm unresponsive face of deputy gloria stratum and said ransoming the lear that was my idea as the sky passed from faintly maroon to sapphire the forest interior remained dark as night kevin and john were being led down the log steps to the airstrip and river beyond kevin had never known such darkness his heart heavy with regret his limbs jangled with frustration he and the cowboy walked along in silence the rush of the river constant and growing louder like ringing in his ears he assumed the plan was to lock the two of them in the learjet he didnt know what they had in mind for summer but just the thought of that made him angry at the cowboy they should have put up more of a fight than they had they reached the flat graveled plain of the riverbed kevin spotted the pilot on the riverbank with a raft and some gear as they walked closer he could see it was an established putin upstream and down towering cliffs formed a gorge through which the river churned opening only briefly here at the ranch kevin saw it for what it was without an explanation from john whose body language was becoming increasingly agitated youd better provision us well john said the first takeout is four days downriver were well aware of that said the pilot he was holding johns handgun and a snakebite kit and a water filter enough youll have what we give you be happy were not leaving you tied up here to starve that option was seriously considered without sunblock and a tarp what youre offering will be worse than starving i said shut up the two hijackers exchanged a look that even in the dark kevin understood they dont care kevin said they just want us out of here theyd rather the river kill us that way maybe it wont be called murder shut your trap yall plan to scale the face of ol shady the cowboy said i saw the climbing gear all laid out none of your business the copilot said taking the girl the cowboy said youre not getting the point the copilot snarled he struck with lightningquick speed a single blow with the gun to the back of the cowboys head he was shorter than the cowboy and the blow connected just above the neck the cowboy lurched forward but remained conscious and retained his balance what i was trying to tell you the cowboy struggled to say is that you want to take the north route if youre going with the girl he caught a breath there are two routes up that face and although the south route appears easier from the ground its far more difficult at the top the girl wont make it unless shes an experienced climber in fact none of you would and watch out for the hawk nest on the north route half the time those damned birds are in that nest and will come after you like they mean business the other half of the time theyre in the air and will attack from behind this time of day theyre in the nest and you aint seen nothing angrier than a hawk when its nest is disturbed the copilot clearly wanted to stop him from speaking but was too taken by what was being said okay then the copilot said get into the raft our hands we wont make it around the first bend with our hands tied well come up against the widow maker and thatll be all she wrote youll have your hands free the raft was eased out into the current the copilot motioned the two into it and they waded out and climbed in awkwardly the pilot waded out with them and untied their hands while the copilot kept the gun on them kevin wondered if the copilot had the nerve to shoot them if he could aim well enough to hit them at fifteen feet the cowboy was probably thinking the same thing and then with a push they were off into the churning current into cooler air and a slight breeze not felt on shore they moved downstream quickly coming up even with the camouflaged jet sitting at the end of the airstrip the pilot and copilot watched them have you ever rafted the cowboy asked climbing past kevin immediately all business couple of times ill take the stern and steer you do as i say the minute i say it you got that yes sir stay on the right for now theyll be two commands paddle forward paddle back ill do the rest theres a number four ahead wont be so bad this time of year with the low water and all but its no picnic especially in this light we cant leave her kevin said well we have first real chance at getting out is two days downriver and that would mean a fortymile hike they were smart were stuck on this river for the next couple of days theres got to be a way back to the ranch then the cowboy barked some paddling instructions and kevin responded the last glimpse of the jet slipped past the rock wall rising quickly ill jump kevin said im not leaving her settle down kid this river is nothing to mess with what if i climb the wall as he said this he saw how quickly and steeply the wall rose were not doing anything with them watching us now paddle forward and when theyre not watching he said over his shoulder there is one possibility its called mitchums eddy but we call it the widow maker the river swings left up ahead mitchums creek dumps into it there at the maker theres a waterfall made by the spring creek running off the ranch but the eddy even in slack water is nothing to mess with you get a raft in there and youll get thrown into the wall as it makes that bend and the raftll wrap be pinned to the wall and thats that wed have to swim for it or drown so i can swim kevin said the currents boy are wicked a couple died there about ten years back its nothing to mess with but if we made it if we could do it we could follow them catch them they wont leave any climbing gear behind count on it he barked more instructions kevin saw the bend in the river looming before them maybe half a mile downstream white water foamed at the base of the rock wall where the eddy pounded into it what those fellas apparently dont know or didnt think about is that theres a zip linea chairthat crosses the river about threequarters of a mile upstream its how we provision the ranch we keep an atv hid on the east side to cover the twelve miles to the nearest road we could cross at the chair head upriver and cut back across at a similar line three miles up wed be back on their side of the river then wed have a shot at them at the girl weve got to do it the sheer rock face at the turn grew closer kevin realized there would be little time for more discussion or planning the river was dictating their moves we have the one chance the cowboy said and the currents are mean once were out of this raft thats it we make the shore or were thrown back into the river without the raft then we cant let it wrap kevin said if we miss the shore we have to have at least a chance of catching back up to the raft dump the cooler the cowboy said kevin did as he was told the cowboy maneuvered the raft expertly holding to the center of the river he simultaneously tied a line to the coolers handle and knotted it tightly the cooler floats the cowboy explained but it can also fill up with water and act as a kind of anchor maybe slowing the raft down and giving us a chance to catch it but i gotta tell you with no vests no helmets this is not to be taken lightly we cant leave her kevin said theres a fine line between nobility and insanity son dont let your balls speak for your brain this is no video game if the eddy wins we lose and that eddy has won more often than not i get it waters cold enough to steal your breath you gotta be ready for that you gotta swim harder than you know how got that the eddy curls counterclockwise toward the rock then back upstream you fight it you lose the trick is for us to start high to make it to the far current and let it carry us to the base of the falls you fight that current youll tire out youve got to work with it not against it understand he threw the cooler overboard the raft lurched and kevin nearly went over the side if were doing this its now or never said the cowboy pulling off his boots and slipping out of his jacket strip down boy you want to be as light as you can get kevin pulled off his sweatshirt but left his sneakers on if you end up in the river john said youll want your feet aiming downstream and your hands covering your head kevin completed in the glow coming from the sky he saw fear in the old guys face for the first time you dont have to do this kevin added i can do this by myself im in no mood for four days on the river john said working the paddle to steer the raft closer to a current okay you first go kevin hesitated judging the distance marking the location of the small waterfall in his minds eye go the cowboy repeated kevin swung his feet over the side of the raft and slid down the rubbery fabric into the cold river water the water was icy cold walt was in up to his knees wading across a small tributary that fed the middle fork leading his gelding by the reins the creek bottom too uneven to risk riding across how far he called ahead the ranch is onepointtwo miles due west brandon answered its closer to three miles if we turn south and head for the putin keep it down his father called out shut up walt called back to him were working this out his father had been acting the taciturn grumpy old man all night preferring to ride ahead and keep to himself believing no doubt that riding ahead meant he was the leader he hadnt been out in the field for nearly twenty years walt could understand it if his father were reliving the manhunt for d b cooper which had both defined him and limited his advancement at the bureau hed gone on to do great things was considered a leading expert on counterterrorism but bringing home cooper and the money would have turned him into a legend hed been churning inside over it for thirty years hed been taking it out on his family the whole time garman continued his overflights of the ranch at an altitude and in a flight pattern that kept him invisible from the ground but soon the rising sun would catch the plane there was time for only a few more passes walt had made several calls to kevins phone left three messages then garman had flown in a pattern that allowed kevins phone to be logged on to the repeater for a full fifteen minutes that in turn let the gps track the cell phone the coordinates placed it at mitchums ranch garman was continuing to make calls to kevins phone each time he flew over the ranch kevin had not answered any of the calls and he hadnt returned any of walts messages the good news was they had confirmation of the cell phones location the bad news was that information would be impossible to keep from the fbi mitchums ranch would be the target of an aerialandground assault by noon they had as few as three hours and maybe as many as six to locate and rescue kevin ahead of an fbi special forces intervention that jerry was convinced would result in a body count brandon had discovered an unnamed dotted line on the map crossing the river near mitchums creek that intrigued walt but would require a detour to investigate jerry openly objected to any delay he was currently trailing the pack horse and favored making for the upriver putin and floating down to mitchums ranch their arguing had continued for the past fortyfive minutes ever since brandons discovery a call to the office hadnt helped no one could find out what the line on the map indicated there are no power lines in a wilderness area jerry reasoned the dotted line could mean anything a dam a culvert whatever it is its not worth the delay to find out now on the far side of the creek jerry remounted his horse and taking the pack horses lead rope headed due west dad walt called out after him jerry spun around in his saddle theres no time to play hunches we know we can float in we go with the given its on the map for a reason walt said going onto the river will cost us an extra two hours no the waste of time is heading for a dotted line that doesnt mean anything doesnt get you anywhere kevin doesnt have time for this his father couldnt handle the raft alone and all three men knew it okay you and brandon will get the float gear to the putin we have radios ill ride ahead and see what i can see well stay in touch were not waiting for you jerry said he turned and rode off the river had appeared languid even tranquil from the raft like a single sheet of molten gray glass sliding past the dramatic landscape in the water it revealed its power and speed its cold paralyzing kevins lungs its unrelenting energy flinging him headlong downstream the river revealed his attempts at swimming as perilously slight and ineffective he pulled and kicked against the deceptively strong current while attempting to keep an eye on his destination some tumbled rocks at the base of a gap in the rock face oiled by a small silver waterfall kevin swam with all his strength there was no time to think he swam for his life taking a breath midcrawl kevin managed to lift his head above the coils of current the cowboy whod let kevin go first was caught in the rivers main current heading straight for the widow maker kevin put his head down and took several powerful strokes toward the waterfall he was in the slack water between the two opposing forces of the counterclockwise current if he could catch the current ahead of the waterfall which was where he was headed and swim strongly enough to punch through it it might deliver him exactly where he wanted hed swum hard and had chosen a good line a flicker of optimism charged him just another few yards ill be home free one last look back convinced him john was in serious trouble he was heading into the widow maker where hed be slammed up against the rock face and held there by the force of the current separated by a mere twenty yards and yet with entirely different circumstances he and john caught sight of each other go john hollered in that instant no more than a split second between strokes kevin changed direction he pulled himself through slack water at the eye of the eddy his strokes sure and confident heading for a point in front of the cowboy he arrived in a matter of seconds fool john bubbled the cowboys energy was spent kevin grabbed him and tried to kick but john was sodden deadweight the two of them picked up speed rushing headlong toward the boiling white water at the base of the cliff kevin steered for shore dragging john behind him but it was no use the river owned them the two opposing forces of the eddy one upstream one downstream met at the widow maker now only yards away kevin had started them out by swimming for shore only now did he see his mistake youve got to work with it not against it understand the cowboy had told him kevin lurched back kicking wildly away from shore what the hell asked the cowboy it was your idea shore john called out no hold on kevin pulled at the water with his one free hand and kicked his weary legs as hard as he could finally the cowboy feebly contributed to the effort together they managed to move to the left of the rock wall as the powerful push of the river drew them ever closer to it were going to hit kevin said hold your breath he felt the ferocious tug the phenomenal power of the current it was as if they were being sucked down a drain they were fully immersed in a wild boiling froth kevins lungs burned his chest felt like it might burst then he felt the change the current was no longer pushing them downstream but was briefly neutral for the moment they didnt have to fight it they could rest and then while fully submerged as if snagged by a hook they were wrenched farther to their left and jettisoned upriver their heads surfaced and they gasped for air kevin continued to swim hard the cowboy kicked finding renewed strength but the current was their friend now it moved them upriver nearly to where theyd jumped from the raft now long gone kevin changed course pulling john across the slack water and joining the downstream current with one final pull he delivered them to the broken rocks at the base of the waterfall here the current turned neutral again they clutched the rocks found their footing and staggered toward shallow water kevin now sat in kneedeep water john dragged himself up next to him his large callused hand reached out for kevin and slapped him on the cheek once twice three times the cowboy was nodding and smiling his false teeth having fallen out in the struggle leaving a hockey players mouth grinning back at kevin ill have the rope cut and well both be freeclimbing cantell called up to summer they were thirty or forty yards off the ground mcguiness in the lead then salvo with his wounded hand then summer with cantell last the route had started out quite easy the rope for safety only the physical act of climbing requiring little technical expertise but cantell soon realized theyd been lied to the route the cowboy had suggested grew increasingly technical the higher they climbed mcguiness a human fly had no problem with it it was childs play for him matt salvo overcame his lack of technical prowess and his broken finger with sheer guts and muscle it was summer who was slowing them down and it had taken cantell too long to realize it was intentional on her part well all be far better off once were at the top cantell called out if you want to escape why dont you try then now is not the time well haul you up if we have to but if you force us to do that well punish you well strip you naked and let the sun get you icy terror raced through summer the man knew which buttons to push the idea of being stripped drove her to reach for the next rock and pull herself up the little guy was above her and hed mentally undressed her every time hed eyed her ever since back at the plane even now he would glance down at her and seem to be leering those looks of his paralyzed her he was the reason she was in no hurry the copilot had it all wrong she wasnt scheming she just didnt want to be close to the little guy but she was terrified she was afraid of reaching the top of heading off into the wilderness as a hostage of these men wondering what they had in mind for her last warning the copilot called from below with the cowboy in stocking feet the going was slow kevin and john followed mitchums creek out of the gorge to the elevated plateau that included the grassy field surrounding the lodge nearly a mile to the north it was familiar territory for john after years of maintaining the property and he led the way through a dark forest the creek to their left he displayed a surprising amount of energy now moving as if his unprotected feet didnt bother him in the least within thirty minutes they crouched at the edge of the clearing around the lodge john pointed out the dangling ropes in the distance the sky now brighter the stars all gone kevin followed the ropes higher and could make out four tiny figures they looked like insects dangling on spiderweb threads they were very near the top thats all of them john said the relief in his voice palpable will we climb im not great when it comes to heights no as i said theyll have taken all the ropes with them if theyre any good and theyre good theyll pull them up behind them if were going to catch them weve got to get across the river and head upstream to that next zip line thatll get us across the gorge and i imagine just about even with them depending how fast we can travel he looked again at the top of the cliff they wont be running after all the energy theyve wasted climbing if we hurry weve got a fools chance at it is there any food in there kevin asked they could see us cross if we move now for the girls sake i dont think its worth it well sit here a minute and let them all get over the top then well provision in the lodge i have a hunting rifle up in my room they wont have found its a beautiful gun and will outshoot anything they brought with them kevin felt the hairs on his arms stand up there was a tone to the cowboys voice that said any possibility of forgiveness was gone whatever it took he was going to free summer hed kill them if necessary kevin understood he was now party to that they were going to hunt these men down john sensed kevins reluctance you dont have to come along he said youve more than earned your keep son youve done good i can handle this last part on my own theyre in my country this is my ranchor thats how i feel about itand theyre about to learn what it means to do what theyve done you saved my life i will get your friend back for you im coming kevin said the cowboy smiled how did i know that but you and me we have an understanding im in charge you do what i say exactly and if it comes to killing ill be the one doing it its not falling to you boy i want her back kevin said i know that but youre going to have a life after this im not leaving you with memories you can never shake you make it sound as if youve done this before john wouldnt meet his eyes some men he said live in isolation because they enjoy it others because they deserve it the cowboy leaned back against a tree trunk and closed his eyes ten minutes he said and theyll be over the top sometime laterit felt like half an hour or morethe cowboy was in dry clothes and wearing a pair of laceup boots army boots kevin thought both he and john wore backpacks and john carried a militarylooking rifle over his shoulder he offered kevin a nickelplated snubnosed revolver six shots in it and a box of rounds for his pocket john showed him how to reload it and he warned him not to use it unless his life depended on it not hers not mine just yours hed emphasized and kevin had agreed amid chirping squirrels and singing birds they jogged up the narrow path to the top of the canyon wall north of the airstrip here as the path continued there were amazing views to the right of the river sixty feet below and of the forest to the left the cowboy ran effortlessly in the highaltitude air unencumbered by incline or load kevin labored to keep up the older man had come alive either because kevin rescued him or he wanted to settle with the hijackers one thing was clear he wasnt going to wait for kevin he was on his own mission it was only a matter of minutes before they reached the zip line spanning the canyon walls it was antiquated with a galvanizedsteel tower on either side supporting a thick cable from which hung an improvised chair two ropes were attached to the chair one allowing the passenger to pull himself across the other allowing the chair to be pulled back to the other side as planned kevin went first the chair sagged feeling feeble and dangerous he tried not to look down as he pulled on the rope across the cowboy pulled the chair back and followed another ten minutes gone until that moment kevin hadnt realized how tired he was he felt like he couldnt move you said theres an atv right he said there is said the cowboy but theres no trail between here and morgan creek so its no use to us well go on foot dont drop behind if you do lose me just hold to the river as best as you can and youll eventually reach the zip line about three miles upstream kevin eyed the cowboy how dare the old man suggest he might actually fall so far behind that hed need directions just then john took off running and quickly disappeared into the woods ten minutes after they had separated walt heard a horse coming up behind him and knew who it was without looking the horses were lathered and exhaling steam by the time walt picked up the rarely used trail he climbed off his horse then and studied the condition of both the dry dusty soil and the nearby vegetation jerry had passed the packhorse off to brandon in order to catch up with his son walt hadnt yet told his father about the call about sumners confession he kept that in his back pocket jerry had seen his son work his tracking magic before for once he withheld the usual cynical comments that perhaps really concealed his pride walt had few equals if any on the trail its the same tire tracks we saw back at the creek walt said okay jerry clearly hadnt seen any tire tracks back at the creek three weeks maybe four the most recent tracks are headed for the river walt kneeling on one knee looked that direction they dont float in their supplies its too much work we should have thought of that excitement in his voice he added the dash on the map it is manmade its a cable crossing as they reached the zip line a quarter of a mile later jerry failed to acknowledge walts expertise thats mitchums ranch on the other side isnt it jerry said it like hed expected it he consulted the map theres two others south of here now heres what were going to do jerry said interrupting himself tell brandon to do an aboutface and get his butt over here he can leave the packhorse behind we wont be needing any of that river stuff and if we need food well get it at the ranch well go across first and establish the perimeter which means what walt was back down on one knee again shining a flashlight into the half inch of pale dust at the end of the zip line the chairs on this side walt said so let me see the soles of your boots jerry obliged balancing against a metal tower two people walt said training the flashlight toward the woods you see this pickling of the surface a rain shower these tracks are recent the past day or so ones big wearing combat boots the others a kid dad a running shoe size eight eight and a half any guesses who that might be if youre trying to stop me from going over there forget it the chair is on this side walt repeated he walked carefully to the nearby trees and studied the ground in the glare of the flashlight the bigger guy took off at a run he touched several spots these are fresh incredibly fresh why is it you dont want to cross dont want to get this thing over with are you holding out some kind of hope that the bureau takes this off your hands is that whats going on here yeah thats whats going on here thats why i turned off my phone abandoned my team why im looking at a recall vote if this all goes south he pointed to the tracks size eight and a half maybe nine its kevin thats why the chair is on this side of the river kevin crossed over with one of the hijackers not the girl theres only one set of runningshoe tracks the combat boots took off at a run kevins at a walk so maybe kevin escaped came across alone and was followed lets cross to the ranch look around find out what we can find out and we waste maybe an hour doing it walt said he pointed toward the woods kevin went that way a hunch thats all it is no an educated guess big difference we need to collect data follow the most promising lead and find the plane we are this close he pinched his fingers to half an inch apart well start at the crime scene not me walt said coming to his feet you go if you want were on comm you can call to tell me how wrong i was but wherever these two are headedand i think its morgan creek ranchwe can have them bookended i can move brandon back up that same trail we came in on well squeeze them and if youre wrong we know the girl called her father from the plane what walt nodded we won a confession from the father the idea was his the insurance scam hed met cantell while making a film he cut a deal with him to steal the learjet and ransom its location to the insurance company if his daughter hadnt been on the jet with your grandson if the pilot hadnt sucked in a couple geese over baldy it might have all worked out the girls father correct there was a long pause okay so im impressed of all times not to have a tape recorder according to her walt said no one was injured in the landing including kevin and you were going to tell me this when maybe theyre holding the girl at the ranch maybe only kevin escaped but this is kevin he said pointing down and im following him his fathers face hardened and his fists clenched another way to look at it walt proposed but you wont like this you keep it to yourself think about this for a second dad they dont need kevin what do they need him for theyve got the plane theyve got the girl they let kevin go itll be a day or two before he reaches people but its a lie of course they just want him far away from the ranch so no one ever finds his body shut your face the combat boots are running because he has a job to do maybe he enjoys the hunt i said shut up we have a decision to make here jerry looked across the abyss of the river canyon clearly seeing that the chair was on their side then something occurred to walt he climbed up the tower far enough to reach out and grab hold of the chairs pulley its not exactly warm he said but its nowhere near as cold as the rest of this metal feeling the surrounding frame thirty minutes maybe less youre talking yourself into this do you see that youre making it work nice and tidy like and nothings ever nice and tidy i cant play it the way you say jerry continued ground rules are you start at the scenethe ranchand work your way out from there walt saw his fathers rigidity his unwillingness to let the evidence dictate his next step and he wondered how much of this resistance stemmed from thirty years ago a river surrounded by forest much like this one only bigger by all estimates d b cooper had parachuted into the columbia and drowned there were never any tracks to follow jerrys task force never had a chance to find cooper yet jerry still shouldered it as a failure his failure surveillance only walt said you report back to me dont engage without some kind of backupme or brandon yeah yeah jerry said already working with the suspended chair i need you to agree to that no engagement we lost bobby i cant lose you too or kevin or kevin walt said okay so ill wait for backup keep your radio on no excuses no excuses agreed jerry said youre going to wish youd come father and son stared at each other dont go rogue on me walt said were burning daylight jerry said he climbed into the chair and secured the chain across it shit he said ive never liked carnival rides the cowboy moved with a speed and agility that stunned kevin in the past few minutes john had been transformed as if by donning combat boots and slinging a rifle over his shoulder hed dropped thirty years he was a dog trailing a scenta junkyard dog at that kevin struggled to keep up wait up kevin called out you fall behind you stay behind john called back to him his missing teeth causing a lisp that might have been comical had the reason behind it not been so chilling kevin got it then it was personal the cowboy wasnt doing this for summer he was doing it for himself they ran for fortyfive minutes nonstop reaching the second zip line and crossing back over the river without john ever saying a thing as if words cost energy they left the faint trail forsaking the easier terrain for a crosscountry route john knew where he was going and he had a clock ticking in his head he was constantly checking his watch he was going to ambush the hijackers twenty minutes later over an hour since theyd crossed the first zip line john finally stopped running he wasnt even breathing hard though his shirt was soaked through with sweat he offered kevin some water and kevin drank eagerly the cowboy reminded kevin of old westerns the way he checked the position of the sun in the sky then he led kevin out of the forest to the top of a pillar of rocks white with bird droppings they were twenty feet above a rarely used trail bordering a marsh full of kneehigh bog star beyond was a forest charred lifeless the trunks of fir and lodgepole pine standing sentinel a hundred thousand wit nesses to the destructive power of wildfire the deadness the blackened bark made it feel like a graveyard nothing good will ever come of this place kevin thought the cowboy used binoculars to scout the trail below and to their left no tracks we beat them he said proudly his lisp distracting how do you know theyll come this way its the trail to morgan creek what there is of it these guys want the quickest way out the trouble with having a plan is you usually stick to it and whats your plan kevin asked unable to contain his concern you cant just shoot them you think im going to negotiate in cold blood their bloods the same temperature as yours and mine thats the choice that has to be made but summer same temperature as hers too despite the rising sun the light breeze ran cold and kevin shivered she comes first he said we dont do anything until shes safe you cant put the cart before the horse son she comes first you listen to me they have no use for us and weve seen their faces we know their names were expendable to them and thatll soon include the girl right now shes valuable to them but it wont last we want to focus on what theyll do to her before they kill her they wont kill her of course they will then why didnt they kill us why put us onto the river were going to get one chance here john said not answering kevin not wanting to hear him youd better bone up son i need you summer needs you you go thinking theres some other way out of this and youll do this halfassed and thats unacceptable whered all the john wayne in you go who oh christ john surveyed the route again you know anything about human nature i suppose we go taking potshots at them whats the first thing theyre going to do shoot back whats the second thing seek cover you said earlier youre a policemans son my uncles the sheriff you see its rubbed off yes seek cover and if somebody is throwing shots from up here then what down there i suppose in the rocks the cowboy studied the boys face have you figured it out yet how were going to do this i cant shoot anybody i mean maybe i could but i dont know for sure the cowboys expression revealed his missing teeth i told you before its not coming down to you then what am i supposed to do the overunders only good at close range and its doubtful these guys are good enough to make the handgun count besides if they go for their guns they cant be holding the girl intelligence and preparation wins here you want me to be your scout is that it i can do that no the intelligence part is this that shotgun is loaded with bird shot but they dont know that itll sting like a mother could even blind a person i suppose but its not going to kill anybody and its certainly not going to kill me whats that supposed to mean kevin said sizing up the cowboy youre not planning on getting yourself shot this kind of thing you cant plan whats going to happen deputy stratum did not prevent fiona from entering the interview room as fiona had expected she would positioning herself behind the video camera fiona decided to record the second interview as a pretense for being in the room she wasnt going to miss this teddy sumner had aged in the past hour bags had formed under his eyesthe man had been cryingand a gray pallor had replaced the tanningbed bronze he reminded her of a piece of fruit ripened too long and left on the countertop she didnt want to feel sorry for him didnt understand how she could but his remorse had a contagious quality it begged to be shared as if others pity might lighten his load the insurance company received a call stratum told him and they gave them fortyeight hours to make a wire transfer of eight million dollars to a bank account in bishkek kyrgyzstan sumner nodded well at least theyre sticking with the plan not exactly stratum said at least not the plan you detailed for us you were right about the gps coordinates if the money arrives on time the coordinates will be sent but there was mention of a package stratum drew quotation marks in the air they said it will be returned when the deposit is confirmed summer it came out as a moan oh dear god can you reach him cantell i tried before remember he didnt pick up wed like you to try again ill do anything of course but i dont see what good if he answers the satellite phone well get a gps fix stratum explained sumners sagging head snapped to attention his eyes widened with hope wheres the phone he asked it has to be yours she said in case of caller id she slid his blackberry across to him wed like it on speakerphone please take the position that the ransom call has come in and youve been told its going to be paid sumner held the blackberry in his hand briefly looking at it as if hed never seen it before god what a mess he mumbled he looked up a number on the device this wasnt part of the agreement a call from me the idea was no contact youre concerned about your daughter plans have changed be strong with him remind him youre holding a card nearly as strong as his if you turn yourself in to the police therell be no money but why would i do that that puts summer in the middle shes already in the middle if you can negotiate her release ahead of the ransom maybe theyll take it its all weve got in fionas opinion sumner wasnt up to it but he punched in the number and hit the green button first came a radio call from his father hed located the camouflaged learjet ignored walt and entered the lodge without backup and found evidence of a fight some wet clothes and no people a radio had been destroyed and there were signs that a room and a closet had been sealed up given that we found only two sets of prints at the zip line jerry said they must have split up that means they went with the river as far as i can tell but ill scout the woods you were going to wait for backup dad there he said it woulda coulda shoulda hes my grandson jerry ended the call within minutes walts phone interrupted his chasing scuffs through the pine straw the call was the second from the office in the past fifteen minutes this time rehashing sumners contact with cantell a conversation that had gone poorly but which netted them cantells latlong coordinates putting him less than a mile due west and moving in the same direction as walt southsoutheast summer clearly was part of the ransom package cantell hadnt budged from his demands walt marked cantells position on the map being no pro when it came to the handheld gps in his backpack and determined he had a fighting chance of intercepting the hijackers cantells refusal to negotiate with the girls father his original partner in the learjet theft sent up a flare there would be no negotiating ever the position on the map seemed to imply that their destination was morgan creek ranch as walt had guessed the middle fork ranches were all accessible by plane and with the ranches being open during the summer there likely was a plane on the property given the remote location the plan no doubt was to scout morgan creek ranch and then escape by plane he couldnt rule out the possibility that they might try to cross the river at the next zip line in which case he was being handed an ideal setup for an ambush but then why hadnt more of them used the zip kevin had the contradiction confused him a possible explanation was that cantell had split up his team and hostages to circumvent capture two different teams each with a hostage each with a different route out was that it or was kevin being lured to his grave in the woods the only solution was to keep following the tracks kevins rescue came first sumners daughters would have to wait walt radioed brandon got his location you left a dirt trail half a mile back walt said consulting the map affirmative turn around and find that trail again follow it east to morgan creek ranch cross the river however you can incapacitate any aircraft or atvs then evacuate the ranch if there are any horses take them copy if youve got time change into civvies and head out on horseback northnortheast maybe theres a trail you can pick up you want to make a line for mitchums got it if you make contact play dumb and do your level best to stall them kevin will recognize you so signal him if possible buy me some time to come up behind them but dont overplay your hand im with you if we have to hit themand likely we willthen were going to hit them hard youll have to turn off and hide your radio once you are on the trail so this is our last contact hopefully ill see you on the trail somewhere if not we go back on air in two hours when walt popped out of the forest he was looking at another old zip line the tracks led to the edge of the gorge and the wobblylooking chair on the far side was empty walt glanced down at the roiling water some fifty feet below pulling on the rope he moved the chair toward him the morning sun was beginning to bake as kevin lay back in a crevice in the rock with only the most minimal of movement he lifted the binoculars for the umpteenth time and surveyed the lightly trod trail there sounds of the forest came from behind kevin pine boughs sighing magpies cawing obnoxious squirrels chatteringall underscored by the rivers timeless advance as the birds whitewash coating of the rocks warmed in the sun stench surrounded him overpowering the sweet smell of sage nearby and even the bitter trail dust at the back of his throat all around insects alighted wings abuzz up ahead blackbirds darted in and out of the boggy marsh across the trail the red chevron on their wings a designation of rank the cowboy lay on his belly hidden in the waisthigh grass at the edge of the marsh even though kevin knew where to look he couldnt see john with the naked eye he had to use the binoculars to work from one landmark to the next until he found the place when he did he saw johns binoculars trained back at him kevin held up three fingers and the cowboy nodded kevin held up his fingers again to make sure the message was clear three people he had signaled not the four they had expected the small guycrazy unpredictablewas nowhere to be seen the cowboy fashioned his hand into a gun and squeezed the trigger then nodded game on kevin was to go ahead with the plan kevin practically shit his pants his mind suddenly cluttered up with all the stuff the cowboy had told him all the stuff his uncle had told him all the stuff his mother had told himhalf a dozen voices competing for his attention where was matt had he been left behind following a climbing accident had he gone elsewhere or was he out there just waiting for him strange things happened to time when kevin was like this summer and her two abductors were a hundred yards off now they were just sixty adrenaline charging through his system would not allow him to focus forty yards his mind clouded he wasnt up to the challenge didnt deserve the trust the cowboy had placed in him it was just him after all just kevin he reached for the revolver the cowboy had warned that its nickel plating might spark in the sunlight so kevin wrapped it in a handkerchief with only the dark hole at the open end of the barrel showing yes now he had it it all came back to him not so hard not so much to remember the cowboy had kept it simple for him can you do this john had asked yes say it i want to hear it i can do it focus they were now within thirty yards of him close enough to hear scuffing of weary boots on the trail one of them coughed lightly the copilot was in the lead he carried the shotgun in both hands next came summer a twofoot length of climbing rope tied around both calf muscles like a horses hobble she could walk but not run the pilot was last three yards behind her carrying the handgun in his left hand and watching her ass kevin wondered if summer being hobbled like that affected the cowboys plans he lifted his binoculars john was watching the three his body flat and still a pair of magpies burst from the woods and swooped toward the marsh kevin followed them rotating his head very slowly and there was matt to kevins left at the edge of the woods he was paralleling the three on the trail playing scout slipping in and out of the shadows he also carried a handgun had john accounted for all the possible weapons an occasional snap of a twig gave him away but he was trying to be quiet kevin dared not move his head racking his eyes to the right he barely glimpsed the three below twenty yards away and still ten from reaching the cowboys mark a stick by the trail did salvos approaching change the plan with every step matt drew closer if kevin did as john asked hed be an easy target for matt wedged in the rocks like he was he was a sitting duck kevin caught another glimpse of summer he had a choice to make the same choice hed made in the river when john was being pushed toward the widow maker only this time it wasnt mother nature he was facing but a madman out to get him kevin understood the importance of the element of surprise he understood that this was the place for an ambush he understood that everything came together here saving summer came down to this one last chance if he failed summer would be lost and maybe john kevin had to change the timing he would do as the cowboy had instructed but he had to do it now before matt saw him he should try to get a shot off at matt but he knew there was no way he was going to shoot a human being john was right about that kevin had been the one who found his father he could never do that to another human being not for any reason not even for summer so if he did what the cowboy askedand he had only seconds to decidehe knew the shooting would be in one direction only his kevin began to shake his muscles locked up he felt impossibly cold the revolver slipped from his hand thudding six feet down in a dirtfilled cupshaped indentation in the rock ledge below him summer and her captors reached the stick then walked past it too late he glanced down at the gun there was no way to get it in time he couldnt fire the rounds to attract attention as john planned but matt had stopped when he heard the gun fall hed spotted kevin matt raised the pistol and took careful aim kevin realized his being shot would create the same diversion the cowboy wanted from him firing the revolver he didnt have to shoot all he had to do was make damn sure matt fired kevin stood up and held out his arms impossible to miss the crack of a gunshot echoed off the rocks in the confusion it sounded as if a second round had been fired then a third kevin summer screamed spotting him atop the rock face christlike arms outstretched kevin felt a searing jolt to his right shouldernot exactly pain but the presence of something foreign and frighteningthe impact of the bullet spinning him a quarter turn speckling his face with his own blood losing his footing he fell to the ledge below he opened his eyes he was still conscious the pilot and copilot had stopped dead in their tracks their weapons raised in kevins direction the cowboy came out of the bog at a sprint from behind the three their attention being on kevin reaching them in four or five long strides john hit the pilot in the ribs and sent him to the ground a gun discharged but kevin couldnt tell whose john then scooped summer off her feet cradling her in his arms angling himself in such a way so as to shield her anticipating the shotgun blast from the copilot he took the hit went down on one knee then somehow managed to stand back up still holding summer tight he continued toward the rocks the copilot tracked him with the shotgun took aim the revolvers nickel plating sparkled not five inches from kevins face on the ledge without thinking he reached for it his finger finding the trigger and extending his arm aimed it red spray erupted from the center of the copilots back directly behind his heart he didnt move still standing up he was already dead instead of falling he wilted to the ground like a marionette having its strings slowly released his knee struck his chin throwing his head back and the shotgun discharged a waft of gray smoke rose into the morning sky the pilot placed his hands on his head and spread his legs making a dusty angel in the soil deathly silence followed with not a bird or squirrel or even the wind announcing itself for kevin gun still in hand it was as if the whole world were holding its breath he hadnt even realized that hed pulled the trigger but there was blood and there was the man and he most certainly was dead kevin was mar veling at the accuracy of his shot when his stomach suddenly erupted and he vomited up bile recovering he couldnt see the cowboy or summer and didnt know if theyd made it to the rocks he released the revolver from his hand its barrel brushing his forearm as it tumbled to the dirt the barrel was cold not hot the gun hadnt been fired had the cowboy shot the man footfalls came running toward him in that instant kevin realized hed lost track of matt kevin grabbed the revolver sensing he was a fraction of a second too late already he rolled on his side and aimed where the rock horizon met the sky his finger finding the trigger the footfalls slowed then a silhouette appeared kevin closed his eyes and squeezed the trigger there was a pop followed by loud ringing in his ears the smell of cordite hung in the air he opened his eyes the silhouette was gone only rock and sky remained no matt put down the gun kevin kevin heard the voice of the man he wished were there instead of the man who wished to kill him he heard his uncles voice not matts were his ears playing tricks on him before leaving this earth kevin was determined to summon up the defining moment of his short life his finding his fathers body but he couldnt do it like he usually could instead he only saw peaceful blue sky and pristine white clouds kevin no mistaking it this time it was his uncle walt there was no way it could be but it was in his minds eye kevin replayed videolike the shots striking the copilots chest his uncle could hit a matchbook at a hundred yards kevin is the gun down put the gun down okay kevin muttered releasing the revolver its down it tumbled off the ledge and landed in the sage kevin heard something and stole a look at the pilot the man was now facedown his hands still over his head the cowboy five yards away his rifle trained on the man was missing his shirt his back was bloody walts face appeared cautiously over the edge of the rocks he reached out a hand and pulled kevin up matt lay awkwardly on the ground ten yards away his eyes blinking his legs twitching with two holes in his chest kevin had to look away good thing youre a lousy shot walt said i thought it was that arm okay its felt better kevin said then he shouted summer his uncle smiled down here came her voice for kevin it was all that mattered it was all hed wanted to hear but then purple orbs loomed at the periphery of his vision he felt faint morgan ranch walt said into his radio is he okay summer cried out in panic hes going to be fine walt answered just fine kevin felt his uncles arms around him he felt a sense of peace he had not known in a long time and then the world went dark using a firstaid kit walt cleaned kevins wound and wrapped his armthe through shot that was no longer bleeding too badlybefore boarding garmans fourseater garman had transferred the cell repeater which was about the size of a briefcase to the planes small cargo hold allowing summer to occupy the front passengers seat while walt sat with kevin in the back walt held kevins upper arm firmly keeping the compress on the wound despite the pain kevin didnt complain the fbi was reportedly on their way in a helicopter to morgan creek ranch to establish supervision a life flight chopper out of boise was coming for salvo while cantell was dead salvo was critically wounded and needed medical attention but who had decided the evacuation of kevin and summer took precedence over salvo summer now wearing a headset listened to radio traffic and communicated with garman she checked over her shoulder every few minutes to assure herself that kevin was still there she seemed to be in surprisingly good spirits what on earth possessed you to just stand up like that walt asked kevin raising his voice to be heard i dont know kevin answered you could have gotten yourself killed i guess john said the plan was for you to fire a couple shots create a distraction did he was that your idea of a distraction kevin shrugged then winced with pain he wouldnt be shrugging again anytime soon plans change he said you were lucky it was john not many like him do you know him kevin asked thinking it sounded like he did i know him professionally hes a good guy who got himself in a bad situation maybe eight or nine years ago two men dead in lemhi county not my case way i heard it it was selfdefense thats the way the judge saw it too trial was in hailey to get a fair jury john couldnt seem to get it right after that even though he was acquitted he took to drinking got himself in more trouble then there were these men in challis and salmon relatives and drinking buddies of the two who were killed and theyll never see it the way the law sees it itll never be safe up there for john so he just dried up went to work on mitchums ranch and has been a hermit ever since without him kevin started his throat constricting he hung his head not wanting walt to see walt tousled the boys hair with his free hand an intimate fatherly forgiving gesture that kevin couldnt remember anyone doing for years listen he said the same thing about you said how you saved his life back there at the river that gave kevin another reason to keep his head down he didnt want summer to see him after a minute he dragged his left arm across his eyes dont hold that stuff in walt said youve got to just let it out well get you and summer some help some counseling itll get better youll see grandpa was ticked he couldnt come with us in the plane grandpa walt said has issues kevin laughed out loud summer somehow heard him through her headset and turned to make connection once more walt wasnt about to wander farther into those waters and held his tongue he noticed that the wound had stopped bleeding he eased his grip on kevins arm but kevin immediately reached up and covered his uncles hand with his own reapplying his own pressure then the fingers of his bad arm twitched and they sought out and joined the fingers of walts free hand the two rode out the rest of the flight hand in hand nothing more was said and just before garman circled the hailey field to land kevins head slid onto walts shoulder and he fell into a deep sleep it was such a jerry thing to do organize a family dinner on the same night his grandson was rescued from the backcountry he was obsessed with the publics impression of his family walt believed jerrys neurosis could be traced back to roberts death jerry had to show everyone that the flemings were okay that they could rebound from adversity with the best of them if norman rockwell had been alive jerry would have commissioned a family portrait things were already getting back to normal jerrys bad timing was matched by his choice of bad location hed insisted on the pioneer all the way up in ketchum rather than any one of the good eateries in hailey but the pioneer was kevins favorite and kevin wasnt about to fight it not now anyway kevin was stitched up at st lukes and moved to a private room where he slept six hours before being discharged to his mothers care myra had been uncommonly quiet throughout the ordeal it had taken walt several hours to realize shed been praying for his part walt spent most of sunday on the telephone and in meetings dog tired he finally called a joint press conference with the fbi emphasizing the success resulting from cooperation between his office and their agency in a strange almost surreal twist the fbi fielded nearly all of the questions in the end according to the wording of the official statement it was a wellchoreographed jointly operated raid that had resulted in the safe recovery of assets by assets he meant the two teenagers the dinner itself was painful forced but enthusiastic conversation through the salad course when myra fueled by white wine with ice made a reference to bobby that had silenced the table i am so done with that kevin said walt didnt know if it was his nephew or the painkillers talking excuse me jerry said my dad the familys inability to get past his death and remember his life i dont want to remember that day i want to remember all the days that came before it i mean come on people kevin caught his grandpas startled expression and turned his attention to a baked potato the size of a football but then something happened that walt definitely attributed to the painkillers kevin lifted his head and bravely entered into a staring contest with the senior fleming the thing is kevin said i was the one that found him suicide or no suicide at this jerry rose several inches in his chair oh yeah i know all about that kevin said but i dont care how he died i care how he lived he was a good dad maybe not as smart as uncle walt or as brave as you but that only made him different not bad myra had buried her face in her napkin and her shoulders were shaking walt reached over and placed his hand on her back and she sagged toward him and im sick of no one ever talking about him you all act like he never existed and thats just not going to work for me he was there with me today he stabbed at the potato then set down the fork i dropped that gun because of him and i dont know if that was a good thing or a bad thing but im not pretending anymore that he never existed kevin looked around at each of them so all of you had better get used to it definitely it was the painkillers because his statement was followed by a devilish grin that he fought to conceal but couldnt and then inexplicably he began to laugha small laugh at first a chuckle but it grew inside him and then spread like a virus around the table until everyone including jerry was laughing the uncontrolled group laugh drew the attention of the crowded restaurant they were laughing about a dead man and everybody was watching them noticing them it was a laugh that made jerry proud before heading back down the valley to the nowopen bridge kevin asked if they could stop by work for a minute meaning the sun valley lodge walt knew damn well he had no intention of talking to the boss who wouldnt be there at eight oclock on a sunday night anyway but walt dropped kevin off while he and myra waited silently in the cherokee myra not knowing what to say and for once not trying to then her shoulders began shaking again and she reached into her purse and fished out a tissue cleaning herself up thank you she whispered hoarsely no problem walt said looking out the windshield at the hotels reddish façade thinking briefly of hemingway as he always did no matter how many times he visited the lodge he pushed his anger over teddy sumner back having no idea how or even if the law would ever catch up to him cantell was dead and quite possibly so was the connection between the two walt had a couple of interview tapes he needed to decide what to do with kevin came out of the lodge a few minutes later despite having his arm in a sling he seemed to be walking taller he had a confident almost smug expression on his face as he climbed into the back everything okay walt said were good kevin said were good said myra unable to control her tears mom get over it said kevin shes just a friend myras shoulders continued to shake but now with laughter she was laughing into her tissue and looking over at walt her teary eyes filled with utter amazement hwz it ging sme u wycm kevin responded to the will you call me by immediately dialing her number hey she said she sounded so close all of a sudden hey he said hows the tennis havent played you should you sound like my father how is he the same in big trouble i may have to live with my aunt or something it sucks a silence crossed the line she filled it no big deal i i think about you all the time yeah me too she said my shrink says thats part of it mine says im supposed to move on right not going to happen were coming up there here yeah some kind of hearing or something i dont think ill ever fly again he said thats what i dream about those flames my dad he cried like a baby she said apologizing as if thats going to change it said how he screwed it all up i said duh my uncle says people do weird stuff when theyre cornered dont go defending him she said youve got to forgive him kevin said no way way he said so he goes to jail so what maybe you could live up here or something maybe it all works out yeah like thats going to happen it might kevin said silence so will i see you when youre up here he asked if youre looking for me she said he tried to follow the shrinks advice and just say what came to his mind but it wasnt as easy as she made out and he heard himself whisper the thing is i think about you all the time i feel like shut up she said i love you too bff best friends forever kevin swallowed trying to regain his voice no not for me its more than that more than bff yeah i know she confessed he felt good all of a sudden incredibly good im going to see you when youre up here duh he thought he heard her crying only a few seconds later mumbling some excuse about needing to be somewhere she hung up kevin held the phone in his hand staring at it he remembered calling his uncle from the back of the jet as it took off he remembered leaving the phone by the chimney of the lodge and his uncle telling him how it had helped track him to the ranch he considered calling the cowboy and thanking him for everything hed done hed been invited to spend time at the lodge and to fish or whitewater raft and he thought maybe that would be a fun thing to do with his uncle but he wasnt going to fly in if they ever went back there they would have to hike it whats to become of her fiona asked the view from walts back porch included a dozen hummingbirds battling for control of the feeder shadows from the aspen trees slanted across grass that needed mowing it was almost nine pm hed made them a dinner of microwave lasagna peas and coleslaw from the deli he was sipping mexican beer she preferred red wine a whitecollar guy like sumner hell win multiple extensions hell push the trial back at least a year maybe two days before the court date hell cop a plea and get eighteen months in minimum where he can get home visitations and play volleyball shell be in college by then immune from a lot of it i feel bad for her yeah he worked on the beer and watched the hummingbirds duel with their long bills their wings going a million miles an hour he felt like that more often than not insanely busy but just hovering in the same place we caught the woman reno at the tables we have the phone records connecting her to cantell and our visual of her here shell do time along with the others but months not years thats what you said right way of the world shell do less time than either of the other two theyre in for kidnapping big difference kevin doing better i owe him a night of fishing maybe you could guide us on silver creek love to do it just name a date they took bea for a walk around the block the smell of barbecue lingering windows lit blue with the glow of televisions crickets buzzed loudly mixing with the sound of lawn sprinklers a jet flew overhead its wheels down for landing walt thought back to all the walks around the block hed taken with gail surprised and comforted that those memories didnt land in the center of his chest he looked over at fiona a couple of times and knew she was aware of him doing so but neither said anything for a long time you dont talk much about your life before coming here he said this wasisa place for me to start over she said the past is better left where it is you know im not sure i know but im learning yes kids playing in a tree fort cried out the tree fort had a stainedglass window and an asphalt roof walt wondered if this was the right place to bring up kids the private jets the tree houses its not the same place it was ten years ago he said this place youre tired you need a break the girls will be back from camp tomorrow you must be looking forward to that bigtime he said bea raced out ahead of them then circled back and came to heel on her own fiona reached down and rubbed her head and bea jerked up to lick her hand fiona laughed walt nearly said i could get used to this but held his tongue for fear how she might take it baby steps he thought we could go over to henrys fork she said its fishing really well with kevin i mean it would mean motel rooms three or four days at least meals together a fivehour drive each way that was the subtext and it wasnt lost on him i dont think im good enough to fish henrys fork he said but kevin would love it i can teach you she said its what i do remember with the girls getting home we couldnt do it right away but youll think about it she asked absolutely beatrice ran to the base of a tree and barked up at a pair of crows walt called her back to his side youre probably buried with work anyway she said giving him a way out of such planning i am but i always am i can get away its got to be coordinated with kevins schedule hes back at the lodge lisa would have to watch the girls they could come couldnt they we could take turns with them theyd love the park we could do a day trip they walked another half block too pushy no not at all its me and work thats all i love this job but it owns me i have to prepare for the hearings theres a ton of paperwork to get done there will be pleas i dont always see eye to eye with our prosecutors i dont want to be away and miss something if the kids hadnt been on the plane she said do you think they would have gotten away with it i suppose the insurance would have paid out if they hadnt then the plan was to go back months later and fly it out and sell it out of the country a jet can hide for a long time in the nevada desert so in a way kevin and the girl theyre the ones who stopped it and the bird strikethe plane going down but yeah they did its true young love she said chalk up another one bea licked her hand again causing walt to reach down and tug her collar i didnt mean to lessen your role in it she said i didnt take it that way but youre okay right with wounding a man and killing another is that the question being asked i shouldnt have said anything you have every right to he said i dont have an answer thats the truth i dont know what to say hed fired and hit john was aiming for a second shot you dont think at times like that you just do what you do and live with the consequences i didnt mean so here we are he said do i think about it yup can i do anything about it nope its past she said they looped around the block and headed back toward the house what was at first an uncomfortable silence settled away to the sound of beatrices paws on the asphalt and the rustle of their clothing a neighbor waved and called out to walt and walt called the man by name returning the greeting walts hand brushed fionas and for an instant he considered hooking her fingers with his and maybe she was having the same thought the way her eyes looked out straight ahead but nothing came of it beautiful night he said someday ill tell you she said surprising him no need youre right about the past i like what you said easier said than done like everything else looks like the dalai lamas coming to town are we changing the subject he chuckled what nothing well not nothing gail and brandon what about them just before the auction dinner she ripped him a new one made him heel like a bird dog he rubbed beatrices head because thats the beauty of it thats why i can laugh about it i have no idea if i had to guess it was that he missed some appointment with her she has this real thing about being stood up but it could have been him taking the wrong car or forgetting to fill the ice trays or not cleaning hair out of the shower drain but what got me was how sweet it was not to be on the receiving end of it how i wouldnt have traded with him for anything she reached down for beatrice as well and their hands touched or was that what shed meant to happen he wondered about ridley pearson ridley pearson is a new york times bestselling author he was the first american
