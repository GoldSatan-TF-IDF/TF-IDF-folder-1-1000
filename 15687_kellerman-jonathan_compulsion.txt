jonathan kellerman compulsion book in the alex delaware series to gina centrello chapter kat loved breaking the rules dont talk to strangers shed talked to plenty of them tonight danced with a few too if you could call the way those losers moved dancing the big scary consequence a stomped toe courtesy of a loser in a red shirt dont go crazy mixing your drinks then how did you account for long island iced tea which was basically everything tossed together and the best buzz in the world shed had three tonight plus the tequila shots and the raspberry beer and the weed the guy in the retro bowling shirt had offered her not to mention hard to remember whatever dont drink and drive yeah great plan what was she supposed to do tonight let one of those losers drive her mustang home the plan was rianna would limit herself to two drinks and be the designated wheelgirl so kat and bethie could party only bethie and rianna hooked up with a couple fakeo blond guys in fakeo brioni shirts brothers some kind of surfboard business in redondo were thinking maybe well go party with sean and matt giggle giggle if thats cool with you kat what was she supposed to say stay with me im the ultimate loser so here she was three four am staggering out of the light my fire looking for her car god it was so dark why the hell didnt they have outside lights or something she took three steps and one of her spikeheels caught on the asphalt and she stumbled nearly twisting her ankle fighting for balance she righted herself saved by quick reflexes supergirl also all those dancing lessons shed been forced into not that shed ever admit it to mother giving her fuel for more itoldyouso bullshit mother and her rules no white after labor day that made sense in la kat took two more steps and one of the spaghetti straps on her plum lam√© top fell off her shoulder she left it that way liking the kiss of the night air on her bare skin feeling a little bit sexy she flipped her hair then remembered shed had it cut not much to flip her vision blurred how many long islands had she polished off maybe four taking a deep cleansing breath she felt her head clear then it clouded again and cleared like shutters being opened and closed crazy maybe that weed was messed up where was the mustang she walked faster tripped again and supergirl reflexes werent enough and she had to grab out for something the side of a car not hers crappy little honda or something where was the mustang with only a few cars in the lot it shouldve been easy to spot but the darkness screwed everything up losers who owned the light my fire too damn cheap to invest in some spots like they werent making enough packing the bodies in the bouncers and velvet ropes a big joke cheap bastards like all men except royal would you believe that mother finally lucking out bigtime who knew the old girl had it in her kat laughed out loud at the image something in mother not likely royal was in the bathroom every ten minutes didnt that mean a screwedup prostrate she lurched across the inky lot the sky was so black she couldnt even see the chainlink fence surrounding the lot or the warehouses and storage lots that made up this crappy neighborhood the clubs web site said it was in brentwood more like the hairy stinky armpit of west la okay there it was her stupid mustang she hurried toward the car heels clacking against knobby asphalt each impact set off little echoes that reminded her of when she was seven and mother forced her to take tap when she finally got there she groped in her purse for her keys found them dropped them she heard the rattle as they landed but it was too dark to see where bending sharply she teetered braced herself with one hand to the ground and searched with the other nowhere squatting she smelled something chemical gasoline like when you fill up your car and no matter how many times you wash your hands afterward you cant get rid of the stink a fuel leak thats all she needed six thousand miles and the car was nothing but problems shed thought it was cool at first but decided it was lame and stopped making payments hello repo man again we took care of the down payment katrina all you had to do was remember on the fifteenth of each where were the goddamn keys she scraped her knuckles on the ground a fake nail popped off and that made her feel like crying ah got it struggling to her feet she flicked the remote dropped into the drivers seat started up the engine the car balked then kicked in and here we go supergirl she was driving straight into the black night oh yeah put on the headlights slowly with a drunks exaggerated care she coasted missed the exit backed up passed through turning south onto corinth avenue she made her way to pico the boulevard was totally empty and she turned onto it oversteered ended up on the wrong side of the road swerved and compensated finally got the stupid car in the lane at sepulveda she hit a red light no cars at the intersection no cops she ran it sailing north she felt free like the whole city the whole world was hers like someone had dropped a nuke and she was the last survivor wouldnt that be cool she could drive over to beverly hills run a gazillion red lights waltz into the tiffany store on rodeo and scoop up whatever she wanted a planet without people she laughed she crossed santa monica and wilshire and kept going until sepulveda turned into the pass off to her left was the just a scatter of taillights on the other side was hillside that bled into moonless sky no lights on in gazilliondollar hill houses full of sleeping rich people the same kind of idiots she had to deal with at la femme women like mother pretending they werent shriveling or fat as pigs thinking about work made kat tense up and she deepbreathed that made her burp real loud and she cracked up drove faster at this rate shed be over the hill and at her apartment real soon stupid little dump in van nuys but she told everyone it was sherman oaks because it was on the border and who cared all of a sudden her eyes began to close and she had to shake herself awake a hard shove down on the gas pedal and the car shot forward saaiiiling you go girl seconds later the mustang sputtered whined stopped she managed to steer to the right stop just off the road let the car sit for a sec and tried again nothing but a whiny noise two more attempts then five shit it took a while to find the switch for the interior lights and when she brightened the car her head hurt and she saw little yellow things dancing in front of her eyes when they cleared she looked at the gas gauge e shit shit shit how had that happened she could swear mothers voice nagged at her she put her hands over her ears and tried to think where was the nearest gas station nowhere nothing for miles she punched the dashboard so hard it hurt her hands cried sat back drained realizing she was exposed by the interior lights she switched them off now what call the triple a why hadnt she thought of that it took what seemed like a long time to find her cell phone in her purse even longer to locate her triple a card tapping out the tollfree number was hard because even with the phone light the numbers were teeny and her hands were shaky when the operator answered she read off her membership code had to do it twice because her eyes had blurred and it was hard to see what was a and what was an the operator put her on hold came back and said her membership had lapsed kat said no way sorry maam but you havent been active for eighteen months thats frickin impossible im sorry maam but like hell you are maam theres no reason to be like hell there isnt kat clicked off now what think think think okay plan b call bethies cell and if that interrupted something too frickin bad the phone rang five times before bethies voice mail kicked in kat hung up her phone went dead jabbing the power button did nothing that brought back a vague memory of something shed neglected charging up before she went out tonight how the hell had she forgotten now her whole body was shaking and her chest was tight and she was sweating she doublechecked to make sure the car was locked maybe a highway patrol dude would come by what if another car did dont talk to strangers what was her choice sleeping here all night she nearly fell asleep before the first car showed up speeding toward her headlights startling her big range rover good kat waved out the window bastard sped right by a couple of minutes later headlights brightened her rearview and enlarged this vehicle stopped right next to her crappy pickup stuff piled in the back under a tarp the passenger window rolled down young mexican guy another mexican sat at the wheel they looked at her funny the passenger got out small and scruffy kat slid down low in her seat and when the mexican came over and said something through the glass she pretended he wasnt there he stood there really freaking her out kat kept making believe she was invisible and the mexican finally returned to the pickup it took five minutes after the truck drove away before she was able to sit up and breathe normally shed wet her thong rolled it off her butt and down her legs and tossed it into the backseat soon as the undies made contact her luck turned a bentley screw you range rover big black and glossy that aggressive grille and slowing down oh shit what if it was clive even if it was clive she could handle it better than sleeping here all as the bentley rolled to a halt she opened the window tried to get a look at who was inside the big black car idled moved on damn you rich bastard she jumped out of the mustang waved frantically the bentley stopped backed up kat tried to make herself look safe by shrugging and smiling and pointing to her car the bentleys window lowered silently just a driver inside not clive a woman thank you god kat said maam in the syrupy voice she used at la femme thank you so much for stopping i ran out of gas and if you could just take me somewhere where i could maybe find a certainly dear said the woman throaty voice like that actress mother liked lauren lauren hutton no bacall lauren bacall had rescued her kat approached the bentley the woman smiled at her older than mother with silver hair huge pearl earrings classy makeup a tweed suit some sort of silk scarf purple looked expensive draped over her shoulders in that casual way that came easy to the classy ones what mother pretended to be maam i really appreciate this said kat suddenly wanting this woman to be her mother get in dear said the woman well find you some petrol petrol a brit a frickin aristocrat in a frickin bentley kat got in beaming what had started off as a shitty night was going to end up a cool story as the bentley glided away kat thanked the woman again the woman nodded and switched on the stereo something classical god what a sound system it was like being in a concert hall if theres any way i can repay you that wont be necessary dear bigframed woman sturdy bejeweled hands kat said your cars incredible the woman smiled and turned up the volume kat sat back and closed her eyes thought of rianna and bethie with the fakeo shirts telling this story was going to be delicious the bentley cruised silently up the pass cushy seats alcohol weed and the adrenaline drop plunged kat into sudden nearly comatose sleep she was snoring loudly when the car made a turn climbed smoothly into the hills headed for a dark cold place chapter i was having lunch with milo at the surf line caf√© in malibu when the call came in no reason for either of us to be here other than gorgeous weather the restaurants a clapboard bungalow with wallsized windows and a wide plank deck perched high on the west side of pch just south of kanan dume road at half a mile from the ocean with no view of the water it was misnamed but the foods fantastic and even at that distance you can smell the salt it was one pm and we were out on the deck eating barbecued yellowtail and drinking beer milo was back from a week in honolulu where hed managed to preserve a skimmilk pallor bad light brings out the worst of his complexion the lumps the acne pits the scowl lines gravity tugging at mastiff jowls todays light was glorious but the best it could do was obscure the rough spots despite that and the ugliest aloha shirt id ever seen he looked good none of the twitches and splitsecond winces that betray his attempt to hide the pain in his shoulder the shirt was a riot of puce elephants aqua camels and ocher monkeys on a sea of olivegreen rayon that clung to his kettledrum torso the hawaiian trip had followed a twentynineday stay in the hospital recuperating from a dozen shotgun pellets embedded in his left arm and shoulder the shooter an obsessive psychopath was dead sparing everyone the nuisance of a trial milo had dismissed his own injuries as a stupid goddamn flesh wound id seen the xrays some of the pellets had missed his heart and lung by millimeters one chunk of deer shot was too deep to remove without causing serious muscle injury hence the winces and twitches despite all that only a threeday hospitalization had been projected on the second day a staph infection set in and he ended up on antibiotic drips for nearly a month sequestered on the vip floor because he lived with dr rick silverman director of the er bigger rooms and better food didnt help where it counted his fever ran high and at one point his kidney function didnt look good eventually he pushed through and started griping about the accommodations and the twentyoneyearold actress in the corner suite up the hall her official diagnosis was exhaustion the hospitals detox director had virtually moved in two paparazzi had managed to breach security only to be tossed unceremoniously by one of the starlets private security guards i said they dont get her maybe theyll settle for you oh sure people and us cant survive a circulation war without closeups of the vast polar tundra that is my vip ass he worked his way out of the bed stomped out into the hall and glared at the rentacop hovering near his door the guy moved on intrusive asshole definitely on the mend after discharge he pretended everything was fine rick and robin and i and everyone else who knew him pretended not to notice the stiffness and the loss of energy the department physician insisted he take some downtime and his captain wouldnt debate the issue milo and rick had been talking about a tropical vacation for months but when the time came milo s mood suggested an impending prison sentence he sent me a single postcard gargantuan samoan sumo wrestlers tussling on white sand a having a great blah blah blah yawn yawn yawn these are the locals a few more luaus and there goes my modeling contract primitively yours m now he finished his second beer and said what are you smirking about didnt know i was im a trained observer you were i shrugged its the shirt right the shirts great lucky for you theres no polygraph around what you dont dig authentic island couture elephants in oahu dr literal he rolled rayon between sausage fingers ida found one with freud analyzing a mahimahi ida brought it back for you the macadamia nuts were fine yeah yeah he brushed black hair off his forehead called for another beer finished it fast bright green eyes took in the view of the highway below his eyelids half lowered you okay back to work tomorrow the leisure thing was driving me out of my mind problem is once i get to the office theres nothing to do no new cases period let alone an interesting one how do you know i emailed the captain yesterday i said quiet time in west la calm before the storm or worse what would be worse no storm he insisted on paying and was reaching for his billfold when his cell squawked i used the opportunity to hand the waiter my credit card sneaky he clicked in listened okay sean why not but if a real crime happens all bets are off as we left i said seans got a fake crime car theft in brentwood recovered car theft like many homicide detectives he considers anything less than the loss of human life on a par with jaywalking whyd he call you he thinks it might be more because theres blood on one of the seats that sounds like more not buckets alex maybe a spoonful whose thats the big hoohah mystery nervy kid wants my expertise no one told him im a free bird until tomorrow i kept my mouth shut when hes like that irony is wasted sean binchy was waiting in front of a vanillacolored house wearing his usual dark suit blue shirt and tie spitpolished doc martens hes a young gangly redheaded detective i a former skapunk bassist whod found jesus and the lapd simultaneously hed been mentored by milo whisked away by the brass and transferred to robbery then moved to auto theft rumor said all that movement had something to do with his lack of creativity the house behind him was one of those imposing bland grand dreamprojects starting to dominate la s luxury districts this was a highend part of brentwood west of bundy north of sunset where the streets narrow and sidewalks are replaced by grass shaggy eucalyptus hovered above much of the street the vanilla houses immediate neighbors were onestory ranches sitting on residential death row as they awaited the wrecking ball sean pointed to a wide stone driveway leading to twin garages a black bentley arnage sedan sat in front of one of the doors vip wheels said milo just what i need hi loot hi dr delaware the conventional department contraction for milo s rank is loo milo is not one to deal with the small stuff how was hawaii milo said i got you some macadamia nuts thanks great shirt milo s eyes shifted to the bentley someone stole that and had the nerve to leave blood or something that looks a whole lot like blood as opposed to im pretty sure its blood loot havent called for analysis because i wanted to see what you thought who recovered it the owner binchy thumbed his pad nicholas heubel solid citizen didnt have to call us in the first place milo walked over to the bentley unfettered sunlight bore down on a paint job so shiny it looked like molten tar howd he find it drove around and spotted it three blocks away not much of a joyride if you think i should forget it i will i just want to make sure i wasnt missing something car unlocked yup give me some gloves and show me this alleged blood chapter several cows worth of premium hides a tree or two of burl veneer all of it smelling like a private club in mayfair the bentleys interior was offwhite piped with black missing the stain was impossible the blemish in question was a smear about an inch square on the right side of the drivers seat sloping down toward the welting at its lowest point more diluted rundown or someone had wiped it that way i supposed it could have been old ketchup but my bet was on hemoglobin milo said not too impressive sean said there could be more but with the carpet black its hard to spot anything without an up close and personal check the trunk i popped it and did a visual scan looks like nothings ever been in there i mean literally theres a couple umbrellas still rolled up and belted to the firewall owner says they were an option cost eight hundred bucks and he hasnt used them once milo stretched latex over his paws leaned in stuck his head close to the smear but didnt touch it studying and sniffing he checked out the carpet the door panels an array of glass gauges opening a rear door he said car smells new its a year old three thousand miles on the odometer looks like its not just the umbrellas the owner doesnt use he has a lexus said sean says its less showy and more reliable milo examined the smear again looks like blood but im seeing no impact high or low velocity some asshole probably a neighbor kid took a joyride and cut himself on a chipped bong was the car taken from the garage from the driveway wheels like that owner doesnt lock up guess not keys left in the ignition owner claims no i was going to ask him more but he had to go inside and take a call milo said they probably were left in no one wants to look stupid boosting something this conspicuous says immaturity and impulsivity which fits with a neighborhood punk so does dumping it close by what do you think alex makes sense he turned back to sean if this was a serious case id canvass the area starting with the dump site find out who has teenagers with behavior problems but thats a big if so i shouldnt pursue it said sean owner pushing you to pursue it hes rattled by the blood but says he doesnt want to make a big deal cause theres no damage it was me sean id tell him to get out the meguiars and forget about it whats that premium leather cleaner okay im good with that said sean have a nice day as we headed for the seville the door to the vanilla house opened and a man hurried out late thirties to early forties six feet tall with long loose limbs closecropped brown hair graying at the temples and tiny ovallens eyeglasses he wore a gray tshirt blue velvet sweatpants brown boat shoes without socks the glasses perched atop a narrow straight nose his lips were tight and bunched as if someone were squeezing his cheeks lieutenant bypassing sean he headed for us took in milo s elephant riot shirt then my black polo and jeans squinted through his glasses trying to figure out who was in charge milo sturgis a longfingered hand shot out nick heubel pleased to meet you sir heubel hooked a thumb at his bentley bizarre huh i told detective binchy i didnt want to make a production out of it but now im having second thoughts what if the bad guy was someone in the neighborhood and theyre after more than just cheap thrills more like expensive thrills said milo heubel smiled buying it was one of those whatwasithinking moments drive it for a week and you realize its just a car and you got sucked into the whole illusion anyway what i was getting at is what if some local delinquent with serious antisocial tendencies is running around and the theft was a symptom of what mr heubel taking whatever he wants heubels eyes behind his glasses were light brown and active milo said youre worried he may come back and try something else i wouldnt call it worry said heubel more like i guess i am worried it was so blatant just swooping in and driving away do you have any idea when it happened i told detective binchy it couldve been anywhere between eleven pm which is when i got home and this morning when i stepped out of the house and found it gone i was headed for the country mart to get some breakfast for a second i wondered if id parked it in the garage then i knew i couldnt have because my other cars there and the rest is taken up by storage his eyes rolled gone i couldnt believe it what time this morning did you step out sir seven fortyfive if you want me to narrow it down i doubt it happened after five am because by then i was up and in my office which is in the front of the house so i think i wouldve heard something though i cant be sure one thing you can say about the darn thing the engines quiet five am said milo early riser i like to be well prepared for the markets when they open in new york sometimes when im looking at the international bourses im up even earlier than that stock trader dabble in commodities this morning nothing enticed me so i figured id get some breakfast make some calls must be successful dabbling heubel shrugged and scratched his head beats honest labor anyway i reported it by the time i heard back from detective binchy id found it right in the neighborhood said milo three blocks west on villa entrada any particular reason you went there heubel looked puzzled milo said are you aware of some delinquent living on villa entrada who might do something like this oh said heubel no not at all i just drove up and down cant even tell you why i did it because i wasnt really hopeful probably just to do something you know trying to take back control absolutely sir if youd asked me to bet id have said it was in east la or watts or on a flatbed to tijuana you can imagine how surprised i was when i spotted it parked right at the curb keys in the ignition speaking of the keys said milo how did i know i know stupid said heubel the main ones in my desk drawer but who figured someone would find the other spare set one of those magnetic dealies i keep it in a wheel well in case the main one gets lost heubel colored dumb huh who knew it was there thats the thing said heubel no one im so careful that when i go to the car wash i remove it guess i wasnt careful enough maybe someone drove by and saw me removing it believe me ive learned my lesson alls well that ends well said milo absolutely but the bloods troublesome isnt it lieutenant it wasnt until i got home that i noticed it blinking thats what it is right its possible sir but even if that turns out to be the case theres no evidence of violence what do you mean it really isnt that much blood and with violence you generally see what we call impact spatter dripping or spray or sizable splotches this looks more like someone wiped a cut on the leather i see said heubel but still someone bled in there and it wasnt me youre sure about that sir hundred percent positive the first thing i did was to go inside and check my legs maybe i got a mosquito bite and didnt feel it not that it would bleed through my pants i was wearing heavy jeans my winter diesels theyre darn sturdy patting his thigh i checked the front and the back of my legs even used a mirror nothing thats a lot of effort said milo i was a bit shaken up lieutenant first the car gets taken right out of my driveway then i find it then theres blood i guess when you do the dna and it doesnt match to any crime victims ill be able to put it to rest theres no reason to do dna sir no said heubel i heard the technologys much better than back in the oj days all these new tests you can get results quickly milo glanced at sean sean said quicker but it still takes time sir and dnas a real expensive process ah said heubel this is low priority for you guys its not like we dont appreciate your situation sir the shock said milo the feeling of violation youve got that right said heubel but the main issue is whats to say hes not still out there plotting something milo gave him what he calls the forensics damage control lecture an increasing necessity due to week after week of televised fairy tales the main points were forensic wizardry made for good entertainment but crime scene minutiae were relevant in less than percent of crimes the dna logjam at the department of justice was so severe the department contracted with a lab in new jersey for the overflow and the backup was so bad only homicides and violent sexual assaults merited analysis even with a serious felony mr heubel it can take months wow how in the world do you ever solve any crimes lieutenant milo smiled we bumble around and sometimes we get lucky im sorry i didnt mean to ten percent thats all at best okay i hear you its just that one lives in a specific neighborhood in the belief that one can be relatively insulated from i suppose thats also a fantasy this is a safe neighborhood sir one of the safest in our division holding back the nasty little westside secret violence in the highpriced zip codes is rare but burglaries including grand theft auto arent because as one captured burglar put it thats where the cool stuff is nicholas heubel said so i should just calm down and forget it ever happened ill tell you what sir if detective binchy has time he can call for technical assistance and get a scraping at least verify that it is blood if the crime scene specialists have time they can also inspect the rest of the car if thats your desire what would they be looking for more blood anything out of the ordinary it might take some time so id lose the car for a few days could happen well said heubel i didnt see anything anywhere else he flashed a sick smile i looked around with a flashlight guess i messed up forensically have you vacuumed the car sir no but my fingerprints your prints are going to be all over the vehicle because youre the driver if you havent vacuumed and some sort of notable stain or fiber was transferred it can be found heubel poked a finger under an eyeglass lens ten percent huh id have bet ninety guess im really out of my element thats why were here sir would you like detective binchy to call for tech support would they need to take off the door panels no sir theyll use swabs maybe do some superficial scraping wet whatever they get in saline solution toss in various reagents chemicals that react with body fluids they can do an onspot analysis for human protein and if it is blood obtain an abo typing were talking a few minutes but waiting for the techs could take a whole lot longer maybe days so it would be best if you didnt drive the car in the meantime detective binchy can take all your information and write a comprehensive report for our files sean kicked one shoe with the other heubel said i do have another car to drive let me think about it your choice sir nice to have choices said heubel or the illusion of such as we drove away i said comprehensive report whats that seans punishment for wasting your time i acknowledge no such vindictiveness planning to follow up by grounding him and taking away his game boy he laughed what i will cop to is buttcovering guy like heubel just might know the mayor last thing i need last thing sean needs is cocktail chatter about how the police dont give a crap ah i said you were protecting the kid thats what uncle milo do and who knows i said the stain could lead somewhere he swiveled his head toward me appeasing the rich is one thing alex conjuring up retrogothneomansonite vampires roaming the streets of brentwood to butcher commodity traders is another the original mansonites roamed beverly hills and los feliz and butchered all kinds of rich people this is a nodamage car theft perpetrated by a joyrider considerate enough to park where the owner was likely to find the damn thing okay i said he said dont use that tone of voice with me young man chapter if sean called in the crime scene techs to scour the bentley he never notified milo for one week no new murders were reported in west la cursing whatever psychoeconomicsocial factors were causing a peaceful autumn milo got to work on some old unsolveds the murder books he looked for were missing or sketchy to the point of uselessness and he deadended on his eighth day back on the job i phoned to see how he was doing his captain had just relayed a directive from the police chiefs office a rapistkiller named cozman cuz jackson awaiting execution in texas was scrambling to avoid the needle by confessing murders all over the country and promising to pinpoint the graves before texas agreed to investigate they wanted local cops to produce some facts cuz jacksons claimed victim in california was antoine beverly a fifteenyearold boy from south la whod vanished in culver city sixteen years ago while selling magazine subscriptions doortodoor jackson had been living nearby at the time in venice and had worked ten miles from antoines magazine route as a handyman at a westchester animal shelter no sign of the beverly file in central records either downtown wanted milo to search for it in west la and if he found it recontact witnesses no success so far he said time to put a fatwa on the great bureaucratic satan let me tell you how this went down normally this would go to the homicide special boys but they love highprofile guts and glory and this aint either so they lobbed a pass to west la captain figures at this point ill be happy with anything and tosses it to me well i said at least theres the novelty factor which is a captain who takes pity gotta go alex the gray cloud hovering over him hadnt cleared a bit maybe it was lead in his arm and residual pain or spiritual erosion after two decades as a gay detective in lapd that whole concept had changed perhaps at a rate so slow it never registered in his head as progress as a rookie he took pains to hide his orientation the truth emerged anyway leading to smirks whispers bursts of outright hostility he stopped hiding but didnt flaunt opened his locker more than once to find hate mail the teamwork that forms the core of homicide work eluded him as a succession of partners heeded the whispers and requested transfers making the best of the isolation he piled up overtime and racked up one of the highest solve rates in the department unsure what to do with him the department dithered to the point where civil rights advances and a jacketful of grateful letters from victims families made him tough to persecute then an old murder brought him back to his rookie days digging up indiscretions by the police chief and earning him a deal in return for not going public hed be promoted to lieutenant allowed to avoid that ranks desk duties and continue to work murders shuffled out of the detectives room he was stashed in a closetsized office that had once been a storage closet given a balky computer the occasional assistance of untested d is if no one else needed them and told to pick his cases translation stay out of our way and well return the favor another man mightve withered milo took well to the arrangement establishing a second office at a nearby indian restaurant and closing cases with dyspeptic reliability all the while indulging his only hobby complaining his solve rate caught the eye of the new chief a man obsessed with crime stats a new captain named raymonda grant didnt care who anyone slept with milo got a better computer more access to backup and continuing job flexibility invitations to division barbecues never showed up in his box but hed never been one for socializing and it was all he could do to find time for rick if life had gotten easier he wasnt showing it no doubt antoine beverlys family considered their sons case as vital as the day the boy had disappeared but milos pessimism was well founded sixteen years is long enough to obscure any evidence and confessioncrammings a common death row ploy that usually leads nowhere still he shouldve been happy to work or could be i was projecting because my own work this year was proving satisfying several child custody cases had actually turned out the way they should with parents making honest attempts not to eat their young and attorneys restraining the impulse to destroy sometimes my reports even ended up on the desks of intelligent judges who took the time to read them i fantasized about a kinder gentler world maybe in reaction to all the brutality on the front page when i raised the possibility with robin she smiled and stroked the dog and said could be one of the positive side effects of global warming we blame it for everything bad she and i were back together after our second breakup in ten years living in the house above beverly glen that shed designed and id found tomblike in her absence shed received a sixfigure commission from a dotcom mogul to build a quartet of handcarved instruments guitar mandolin mandola mandocello a project that would occupy her for the best part of the year dream gig when she didnt think about the mogul being tonedeaf and unable to play a note the koi in our pond had spawned a dozen baby fish ample rain had juiced up the plants in the garden and we had the dog who smiled and meant it a oneyearold french bulldog named blanche a warm soft little blond thing so bright amiable and mellow that id considered donating her chromosomes for research on the biology of nice not that anyone was studying the topic dog doesnt bite man is no story at all milos ninth day back on the job someone got bit it took place on one of those streets where that kind of thing doesnt happen at six thirtytwo am on a quiet sunday in a south westwood neighborhood where small tidy houses are dominated by the spire of the mormon temple on santa monica boulevard a seventythreeyearold retired schoolteacher named ella mancusi opened the door to her mintgreen stucco bungalow walked ten feet to pick up her newspaper and came facetoface with a man and a knife the sole witness an insomniac advertising copywriter named edward moskow was drinking coffee and reading his own paper in his living room two houses south by chance he looked out the window saw what he thought was a man punching ella mancusi watched in horror as the old woman crumpled into a pool of blood by the time moskow reached ella she was dead and her murderer was fleeing the scene the coroners investigator counted nine stab wounds four of them fatal from the depth and width of the cuts the onthescene guess was a hefty nonserrated singleedged blade consistent with some kind of hunting knife most remarkable was moskows description of the killer a tall heavyset whitehaired man wearing dark baggy clothes and a blue plaid cap one of those oldguy caps he was a geezer when he walked to his car he moved stiffly like old guys do the car had been left idling at the curb drivers door open as the man in the cap butchered his victim once finished he wiped the blade on a trouser leg got back behind the wheel and drove off at a moderate rate of speed moskows eagle eye extended to the vehicle latemodel mercedes s black shiny and clean its their topoftheline fourdoor if you dont count the maybach im sure of it because im a car freak were talking a bill and a half i only caught part of the license plate one letter three digits milo put a trace on the vehicle before he went out to inspect the scene by the time he called me a hit had come through lifted from the prestige rentacar lot in beverly hills returned before they opened at nine company didnt even know it was missing till i called odometer says fortythree miles were put on was the lot locked supposedly theres a chain six thirty homicide back in place two and a half hours later i said talk about gall big black luxury car boosted and returned i said he frowned that too sean follow through on the bentley all heubel authorized was a swab of the stain no fancy tech stuff sean got a kit and did it himself human blood type opositive but were a long way from tying the bentley into this mess and no cracks about thousandtoone odds god forbid i do the forbidding when hes busy want to have a look at this scene sure see you in twenty ella mancusis body had been taken to the crypt what remained was blooddrenched brick and syrupy lawn harder to make out patterns on the uneven surface and im no expert but id seen enough over the years to guess at arterial spatter and slow leakage the old womans body shutting down as blood volume dropped and her heart stopped and her soul washed away milo standing straighter than id seen in a long time was talking to sean binchy black strands of hair blew into his face and he slapped them away without success a hurricane wouldve been required to budge seans cropped gelled do i left the blood and walked over to them sean looked pale an old lady a teacher milo said the benz is on its way to the auto lab sean will talk to mr heubel about voluntarily relinquishing the bentley for further analysis if heubel doesnt agree were out of luck according to the hardestass ada i know sean said maybe if i tell him about this hell be cool he seemed like a nice guy or just the opposite what do you mean rich folk avoid messes milo started to walk away um loot im still officially on gta want me to talk to someone sean chewed his lip im not sure lieutenant escudo would be thrilled and ill need him for my performance rating milos eyes narrowed what are you saying sean sean looked back at the blood whatever i can do to help i will i waited for milo to bark at him but he said see how far you can get with heubel then well talk sean saluted and marched away i said when does he get his bedtime extended when his grades improve milo turned and faced the little green house any spontaneous insights elderly victim same for the murderer all that overkill its probably personal id check out boyfriends exhusbands romantic entanglements gone bad geritol lovers spat my witness says she was a widow and the only visitor he ever saw is a guy in his forties he assumed was her son techies are inside when theyre finished ill start digging through her personal effects a man came out of a spanish bungalow two doors up rubbing his eyes he looked away from the blood thats him said milo why dont you have a chat while i see how the housetoss is going edward moskow was in his midto late fifties bald with a frizzy gray beard his swarthmore sweatshirt was frayed at the cuffs and a size too large khaki pants had faded to offwhite nearly as pallid as his bare feet i introduced myself leaving out the title moskow nodded i said terrible thing to see ill never forget it he touched his forehead etched right here if theres anything else you remember old bastard his voice was soft and hoarse unbelievable youd think by that age theyd lose the urge often they do he looked at me as if hed just realized we were having a conversation i said its called criminal burnout otherwise known as too pooped to pop small nod mr moskow how old would you say this man was only saw him for a few seconds moskows face screwed up and his beard bristled mostly i was looking at his arm he raised his own limb mimed a downward thrust i thought he was hitting her with his hand ran out to confront him by the time i got there he was walking back to his car and i saw the blood under mrs mancusi spreading a flood ive never seen anything like it he shuddered in terms of his age oh yeah sorry seventy sixtyfive seventyfive i really cant say all i know is he moved like an old guy no limp or anything like that just stiff like his body was all bound up slow he thought he didnt run but he wasnt halting all i really saw was his back heading for his car i guess id call it a medium pace normal walking like hed just delivered a package or something and he didnt look back im screaming at him and its like im not there bastard doesnt even bother to turn just keeps going gets in the car drives off thats what gets me how normal he acted business as usual he played with a loose thread at the sweatshirts neckline i said so you never saw his face nope it was crazy im screaming at the top of my lungs hoping someone will come out but no one did he looked up the block ghost town pure la what did you scream at him who remembers probably something like stop you asshole moskow plinked the hem of his sweatshirt with a thumbnail mrs mancusis lying there covered in blood and this bastard is sauntering away like nothing happened i started after him which in retrospect was idiotic but you dont think then i saw the knife and stopped in my tracks moisture collected at the bottom of his eyes howd you see the knife he wiped it on the front of his pants above the knee casually like it was a natural thing to do then what i said then he pocketed it and got into his car and drove off the whole thing took seconds the car was idling i dont remember him starting it up so probably dont remember any engine noise at all but maybe i was blocking it out that particular models pretty quiet which way did he drive he pointed south right past my house i knew the neighborhood from my grad student days at the u had roamed these same streets searching for shortcuts home to my dismal little single on overland its a bit of a maze all those dead ends moskow stiffened youre thinking hes from around here no but he may have planned his escape route well ive never seen him in the neighborhood same for the car this isnt exactly s territory not a lot of benzes plenty of benzes but not s youre into cars ive owned a few junkers that i fixed up he managed a half smile owned a delorean that was an experience so what are we talking about some old mafioso what makes you say that big black car executionstyle killing guy that age what came to mind is maybe hes an old goombah hit man who didnt burn out he pulled the thread loose rubbed it between forefinger and thumb that stupid cap would there be any reason for mrs mancusi to be involved with an old mafioso wouldnt have thought so then again whod imagine this how well did you know her not well at all she was quiet seemed nice enough wed say hi goodbye thats about it any social life just that guy i told the lieutenant about how often was he here maybe every month that why i assumed he was her son couldve been more often its not like i kept my eyes fixed on her house anything more you can say about him forties blond sloppylooking now that i think about it i never actually saw them together hed knock on the door and shed let him in when he left she never walked him out was walking hard for her on the contrary hale and healthy anything else you can tell me about the blond guy kind of thickset when i say sloppy i mean he didnt seem to care about his appearance any idea what his name is never heard her call him anything like i said never saw them actually together he never looked happy to be here so maybe there was tension between them and the last time he visited a month or so ago he stayed outside talking to mrs mancusi through the open door i assume it was her because no one else lives there i couldnt hear what they were saying but from the looks of it they couldve been arguing then he did this slapping a hand on one hip he bent one leg and grimaced it was a little theatrical know what i mean it seemed funny a grown man who wasnt particularly gay looking vamping like that it struck me as an odd thing to do especially when youre talking to your mother if she is his mother you think they couldve been arguing look im not trying to get anyone in trouble said moskow and its nothing id swear to just my impression because of his body language the way he positioned himself he looked a little aggressive more like defensive said moskow like mrs mancusi told him something he didnt want to hear chapter mafia hit because her name was mancusi said milo we were in caf√© moghul around the corner from the station the restaurants owners view him as a human rottweiler and are all too happy to create personal buffets i watched him make his way through plates of lamb curry tandoori lobster spicy okra lentils and rice a pitcher of iced clove tea sat at his elbow after all that blood in ella mancusis driveway the mental pictures id drawn of the murder it was all i could do to pour myself a glass i said moskow didnt say so but that was probably part of it but maybe hes on to something the setup knowing when she came out to get her paper leaving the car idling planning the escape route smells of pro so does the killers demeanor brutally methodical no hurried escape grampa bad guy he said doing her in broad daylight and giving himself less than three hours to get the car cleaned up and back in place is professional not to mention driving it back to beverly hills in full view wheres the rentacar lot alden drive near foothill bh industrial zone i said pretty quiet on sunday morning its also five minutes from the bh police department but a black mercedes wouldnt attract anyones attention neither would a car entering the lot any blood in the benz at first glance no lets see what the lab turns up he wiped the knife on the front of his pants careful not to make a mess two and a half hours was enough time to clean the car before he returned it maybe hes got a safe place somewhere between the crime scene and the dropoff thats half the westside he said think im gonna get some media coverage on this one geriatric knife man how many of those can there be forking lobster chewing swallowing nervy knife man doing it in broad daylight maybe in his mind a daytime hit was safer because a nightprowl wouldve meant breaking into her house did she have an alarm system dinky front and back doors no windows for an old guy climbing through windows could be a problem i said he figured that early on sunday most people are sleeping were also talking a victim unlikely to put up serious resistance and a silent weapon he blitzed her so fast she never had time to scream if moskow hadnt forgotten to take his ambien last night the whole thing mightve gone unnoticed any other neighbors have information he covered his ears with his hands repeated the gesture with his eyes and mouth moskow come up clean spotless he pushed his plate away wiping the blade on his pants whats that all about could be an expression of contempt i said those arterial wounds no way hed avoid leaving some trace in the car he cleans up the obvious the benz gets steamed by the company hes home free im definitely buying contempt he said lotta rage here the question is what did a seventythreeyearold retired schoolteacher do to incite that people have secrets well none of hers have turned up so far the house was neat clean real grandmotherly he drew his plate closer began bolting his food i said hot rage but cool planning maybe he wasnt quite so careful last time what do you mean the stain in the bentley no body associated with the bentley alex im not ready to connect the two i kept quiet yeah yeah there are parallels he said now give me another homicide that ties it together and explain to me how such a careful guy could leave a stain in full view it was dark when he brought the bentley back and he missed it or something made him nervous and he left quickly thats weak doctor another possibility is he left it there on purpose another contempt message look what i got away with maybe the bentley was a rehearsal for today a seniorcitizen psychopath who likes to play games he drummed the table with his fork or the bentley has nothing to do with ella or that you dont believe it do you he sighed ive got records checking violent crime reports during the hours the bentley was missing nothing so far spooning lentils into his mouth he said someone that old weird you know what they say seventys the new fifty he reached for a lobster claw and up is down and low is high i said if we are talking some kind of organized crime link that could mean teamwork one person steals the car passes it along to the killer and is available to help scrub it down afterward maybe drive it back combine all that with the killer making sure to limit his contact to the front seats and the time pressure would reduce homicidal pit crew he said cracking the claw along the joint he sat motionless as if taking in the sound the goodfellas havent been a major factor since mickey cohen but there are some loan sharks floating around the valley and over in that arcade on canon drive in beverly hills canons also close to the rental lot so it is he pulled a tube of meat from the claw ate repeated the process with another leg so what our nice little retired schoolteacher has a dark past as a moll or a hidden vice like gambling she managed to rack up a big enough debt on her pension to get sliced and diced make no sense alex the last thing a shark wants to do is snuff the minnow and end any hope of getting paid unless the shark has given up on collecting i said or she wasnt the gambler someone else was and they used her as an example i described the unhappy exchange moskow had witnessed between ella and the blond man he assumed was her son arguing he said nothing causes conflict like money maybe junior asked mom for money and she turned him down what i dont see is even a bigtime shark butchering an old lady just to strike terror into her mope kids heart youre probably right i said but it is a new cruel age meaning turn on the news at random he dove back into his food i said heres another way to spin it the blond mans not her son hes the collector removing a blue plastic binder from his attach√© he handed it over inside was a prelim crime report form yet to be filled out a few of what looked to be ella mancusis personal papers and an envelope that held a threebyfive color photo in the snapshot a tiny whitehaired woman in a belted floral dress and high heels stood next to a flabbylooking fairhaired man in his forties behind them was mintgreen stucco ella mancusi had a birdface and sparkling dark eyes her lips were rouged and her nails were polished smiling but something was missing from the upturn of lip the blond man stood with his arms at his sides tight around the shoulders as if posing for the picture had been an imposition i said fits the guy moskow described read the back i flipped the photo anthony and me my birthday i baked a chocolate cake the writing was elegant cursive the date was december two years ago devoted son lets her bake her own birthday cake i said i studied ella mancusis smile some more and realized what was missing maternal pride milo said im figuring hes an only child because the few photos in the house were all of him mostly when he was a kid all the way back to grade school she held on to his birth certificate and twelve years of report cards c minus student when he applied himself theres one anthony mancusi in the county and the only thing on his record is a dui six years ago pled down to misdemeanor if hes got a drinking problem doesnt look to be genetic the only booze ella had was a bottle of sherry unopened dust all over it he rubbed his face she didnt own much alex all her important papers were in three cigar boxes near her bed eighteen years ago she retired from la unified her last job was teaching social studies at louis pasteur junior high they wrote her a nice letter she was widowed way before that when anthony was a teenager husband was anthony senior supervisor at a dairy in santa fe springs died on the job of a heart attack the house has been paid off for eleven years between her pension and seniors she did okay your basic upstanding middleclass lady living out her days in a lowcrime neighborhood why the hell would she end up this way i took another look at the photo its his mothers birthday but he wants to be anywhere else toss in moskows account of the irate conversation and theres some kind of issue here was there a will in the box he thought no junior bumps her off to inherit its been known to happen sure it has but what kind of beast would have his mother carved like a holiday roast he motioned for the check the smiling bespectacled woman who always serves him hurried over and asked how the meal was everything was delicious he said slipping her some bills keep the change this is far too much lieutenant dont worry about it i give you credit she said for next time dont bother i bother outside the restaurant he hitched up his trousers and looked at his watch time to talk to tony mancusi junior our misdemeanor drunk the lack of a serious record says nothing about a gambling problem i said yeah but why get involved with living breathing sharks when you can boot up and use paypal why would a movie star staying at the four seasons go trolling for thirtydollar streetwalkers on sunset when hed have access to call girls who look better than his leading ladies sometimes dirty and dangerous is part of the thrill games he said all right lets talk to this joker at the very least ill be the bearer of really bad news anthony james mancusi jrs phone was disconnected which made milo more intent on finding him the papers on his eightyearold toyota listed a residence on olympic four blocks east of fairfax the address matched a pink neoregency sixplex built around a compact green courtyard vintage charm blooming flowers spotless pathways if you discounted the brainsapping traffic roar not bad at all the landlord a sixtyish asian man named william park lived in one of the groundfloor units he came to the door holding a copy of smithsonian magazine tony he said he moved out three months ago how come said milo his lease was up and he wanted something less expensive money problems william park said the units are twobedrooms maybe tony felt he didnt need so much in other words money problems park smiled milo said how long did he live here sir he was already here when i bought the building that was three years ago before that i dont know easy tenant mostly said park is he in trouble his mother just passed away and we need to find him passed away oh park studied us something unnatural afraid so mr park thats terrible hold on ive got tonys forwarding address sometimes i still get mail for him have any of his mail now no i mark it forward and the mailman takes it away park disappeared into his apartment leaving an open view of a neat white room milo said the observant mr moskow now him law enforcement and the citizenry working hand in hand maybe the world aint so mean after all strange thing to say after viewing ella mancusi lying in a quart of her own blood still it was nice to hear him positive i said global warming huh nothing park returned and handed milo a scrap of paper post office box la east hollywood good chance it was a mail drop milo smiled through his disappointment and thanked park anything i can do to help poor tony so he was a good tenant said milo mostly park said sometimes he was late with the rent but he always paid the extra fee without griping what does he do for a living he told me he used to work for the studios a grip moving scenery a few years ago he hurt his back and had to live on disability his mother helped him out sometimes the rent check was hers someone killed her how well did you know her mr park me i didnt know her at all just cashed her check did tony talk about her never tony didnt talk much quiet guy really quiet said park how often did his mother pay his rent hmm id say about half the time maybe more the last few months how much more i believe out of the last six months she paid four did she mail you the checks no tony gave them to me what was the nature of tonys disability you mean was he crippled or something like that no he looked normal but that doesnt mean anything a few years ago i had a ruptured disk it was painful but i kept it to myself tony suffered in silence you dont suspect him do you said park he was never violent uncomfortable with the notion that he mightve rented to a killer milo said these are just basic questions sir i hope so he was really no trouble at all the mail drop was in a litterstrewn strip mall on vermont just above sunset one of those metallicsmelling minivaults lined with brass boxes where the renters get keys and twentyfourhour access a sign in the window said in case of problems check with avakian dry cleaners next door at the cleaners a man unraveled a pile of crumpled shirts and said yes without looking up william saroyan mustache quick hands police were looking for one of your box holders anthony mancusi time to look up tony he brings his bulk laundry here with the price of water and soap we can do it just as cheap and you dont need your own machine whats up with tony his mother died mr bedros avakian tongue click died huh too bad so how come the police are here it wasnt a natural death oh thats real bad could we have that address please yah yeah hold on i get it for you avakian walked to a small desk and clicked a laptop got a pen give tony my condolences anthony mancusi jrs new digs were in a grubby threestory box on rodney drive not far from the strip mall no landscaping no charm inquiries to be directed to a real estate firm in downey the front door was keylocked the directory listed eighteen tenants each with a mail slot no one answered at a mancusis unit i said bit of a stepdown from his last place that and his mother taking on more of his rent says money issues milo tried the button again pulled out a business card and dropped it into mancusis mail slot lets get over to the rental lot as we headed for the car movement up the block caught my eye a man in a shortsleeved white shirt and brown pants shambled toward us less hair than two years ago the blond tint was peroxide and hed put on weight in all the predictable places but this was the man not thrilled to pose with his mother milo told me to wait there and went up to greet him the glint of the gold shield caused tony mancusis head to retract as if hed been slapped milo said something mancusi clapped both sides of his own head his mouth opened and the mewling that emerged filled my head with an image animals shackled in the slaughterhouse the end of hope chapter tony mancusis hands shook as he fought to get his key into the lock when he dropped it the second time i took over once we were inside the grimy little room he called home he braced himself against a wall and wailed milo watched him impassive as a garden gnome some detectives put a lot of stock in peoples initial reactions to bad news suspecting the toostoic loved one as well as the scenerychewing hysteric i reserve judgment because ive seen rape victims blas√© to the point of flippancy innocent bystanders twitching with what had to be guilt psychopaths offering renditions of shock and grief so convincing you wanted to cuddle them and feed them soup but it was hard not to be impressed with the heaving of mancusis rounded shoulders and the racking squalls that nearly lifted him off a threadbare ottoman behind him was a wall fitted with a murphy bed ella mancusi had baked her own birthday cake maybe her son was remembering when he stopped for breath milo said were sorry for your loss sir mancusi worked himself to his feet the change in his complexion was sudden and convincing from indoor pallor to green around the edges he hurtled six feet to a shabby kitchenette and vomited into the sink when the heaves stopped he splashed water onto his face returned to the ottoman with raw eyes and strands of pale hair plastered to a greasy forehead a fleck of vomit had landed on his shirt just beneath a wrinkled collar milo said i know this is a hard time to talk but if theres anything you can tell us what could i tell you is there anyone anyone at all whod want to hurt your mother who thats what were she was a teacher said mancusi she retired they gave her an award she was tough but fair everyone loved her he wagged a finger want the grade do your work that was her motto i wondered how that had meshed with a son who lived on disability and borrowed rent money c student if he applied himself milo said so theres no one you can think of no this is this is insane the vomit fleck fell to the carpet inches from milos desert boot insane nightmare mancusi lowered his head gasped you okay sir little short of breath he sat up breathed slowly i get that way when im stressed milo said if you dont mind weve got a few more questions mancusi said what after your father passed did your mother have any romantic relationships romantic she liked books watched a few soap operas that was her romantic he flipped his hair cocked his head smoothed a peroxide strand from a sweatsoaked brow effete symphony of movements that recalled the posturing ed moskow had observed any close friends male or female mancusi shook his head noticed the vomit fleck on the floor and raised his eyebrows the carpet was greasestained fuzzed by crumbs and dust bunnies some sort of beige darkened to the hue of a smokers teeth no social life at all said milo nothing after she retired mom liked to be by herself all the la unified bullshit she put up with it for thirty years so she became a private person she was always a private person now she could be herself mancusi stifled a sob oh mom its a tough thing to deal with said milo silence did your mother have any hobbies what milo repeated the question why im trying to know her hobbies said mancusi she liked puzzles crosswords sudoku sudoku was her favorite she liked numbers she had a math certificate but they had her teaching social studies any other games what do you mean she was a teacher she didnt get this didnt happen because of her hobbies this was a a a lunatic so no hobbies or interests that might have gotten her into debt mancusis watery brown eyes drifted to milos face what are you talking about these are questions we need to ask mr mancusi did your mom buy lottery tickets do online poker anything of that nature she didnt even own a computer neither do i not into the internet why are you asking this you said she wasnt robbed sorry said milo we need to be thorough my mother did not gamble was she a person of regular habits what do you mean did she have routines like coming out the same time each morning to collect the paper mancusi sat there eyes glazed not moving sir she got up early he clutched his belly ohh here we go again another rush to the sink this time dry heaves left him coughing and panting he opened a spacesaver fridge took out a bottle of something clear that he uncapped and swigged returned with the liquid still in hand diet tonic water grabbing a section of his own gut he squeezed hard rolled the adipose too fat used to drink g and ts now its just sugarless t he drank from the bottle failed to suppress a belch mom never gained a pound from the day she was married she watched her diet said milo mancusi smiled never had to she could eat pasta sugar anything i get it from dad he died of a heart attack i need to watch myself the old cholesterol mancusi shook his head mom did they hurt her they whoever was it bad did she suffer tell me she didnt it was quick said milo oh god more tears milo handed him a tissue from the minipack he always brings to notifications mr mancusi the reason i asked about your mothers social life is we do have an eyewitness who describes the assailant as around her age mancusis fingers flexed the tissue dropped what milo repeated edward moskows description of the killer including the blue plaid cap mancusi said thats nuts doesnt ring a bell mancusi flipped his hair again of course not dad had a bunch of caps like that after he went bald and didnt want sun on his head this is totally insane milo said what about a black mercedes s that ring any bells dont know anything about cars said mancusi its a big fourdoor sedan said milo topoftheline model mom wouldnt know anyone with a car like that she was a teacher for gods sake please dont be offended by this next question mr mancusi but did your mother know anyone associated even remotely with organized crime mancusi laughed kicked the vomit fleck because were italian its something we need to look into well guess what lieutenant mom wasnt italian she was german her maiden name was hochswelder italian was dads side he grew up in new york claimed when he was a kid he knew all kinds of mafia guys had all these stories what kind of stories bodies tossed out of cars guys getting shot in barber chairs but no way no thats nuts those were just stories and mom hated them called them coarse her idea of suspense was murder she wrote not the sopranos he returned to the kitchen placed the tonic water bottle on a counter gambling gangsters this is ridiculous im sure it seems that way but theres no reason for her to be dead okay no reason no fucking reason its stupid insane shouldnt have happened could you stand up pardon stand up said mancusi please after milo obliged mancusi slipped behind him and yanked down on the murphy bed halfway through he breathed in sharply slammed a palm into the small of his back and straightened disk milo finished the job revealing a waferthin mattress gray sheets once white mancusi began easing himself down toward the bed sweat rolled down his cheeks milo reached out to help him no no im fine we watched as he lowered himself in stages he ended up curled on the bed knees drawn to his chest still breathing hard i cant tell you anything i dont know anything milo asked him about other family members mancusis rapid head shake rocked the flimsy mattress mom had a miscarriage after me and that was it what about aunts uncles no one shes close to milo waited mancusi said nobody no one to help you with what getting through this g and t used to be a big help maybe ill get back into that think thats okay harsh laughter milo didnt answer mancusi said maybe fuck everything i should eat and drink what i want maybe i should stop trying to impress anyone tears flowed down his cheeks whos to impress he turned onto his back could you get me some aleve its in the cabinet by the stove i found the bottle shook out a pill filled a water glass from the tap mancusi said i need two when i returned he snatched both tablets from my hand waved away the water i swallow dry he demonstrated my big talent i need to rest he rolled away from us milo said so sorry for your loss if you think of anything call no answer as we made it to the door mancusi said mom always hated those caps outside the building milo said think that was a performance moskow described him as theatrical but who knows theatrical how i recounted the handonhip hair toss he frowned did a bit of that just now but he did barf righteously people get sick for all sorts of reasons i said including guilt symbolic catharsis or whatever you guys call it i call it throwing up hes an only child with no close relatives id really like to know if there was a will agreed he said the question is how to find it maybe those relatives she wasnt close to can tell you tony minimizing the relationships because he didnt want me talking to them family values i said its where it all starts he drove three blocks popped the unmarkeds trunk gloved up and rifled through the box of personal effects hed taken from ella mancusis bedroom no mention of any relatives other than tony but an attorneys card in a rubberbound stack elicited a handpump jean barone esq wilshire boulevard santa monica the other cards were for plumbers electricians ac and heating repair a grocery delivery service men coming in and out of the house maybe getting to know ella mancusis routine if no other leads surfaced soon theyd all need to be checked out milo phoned jean barone and after she got over the shock she said yes shed drawn up mrs mancusis will preferred not to discuss client matters over the phone as we headed for santa monica milo said maybe its me but she sounded eager jean barone met us in the cramped empty lobby of her building a twostory structure just west of yale the space needed freshening she looked as if shed just renewed her makeup she was a middleaged wavyhaired brunette packed tightly into a peacockblue knockoff chanel suit after checking milos id she took us up in the elevator to her tworoom suite no name on the plain white door but hers below her degree supplementary credentials as a notary public and certified tax preparer her office smelled of shalimar she took a seat behind a dark woodlike desk so horrible about mrs mancusi any idea who did this not yet is there anything you can tell us about her maam not really the only thing i did for her was draw up the will and that was five years ago who referred her to you the yellow pages id just graduated had no referral base yet she was one of my only clients in six months it was easy basically boilerplate she opened a drawer and drew out a single sheet of paper heres your copy no confidentiality for deceased individuals there was no copy in mrs mancusis house she didnt want one said barone said i should keep it how come barone shrugged maybe she didnt want anyone finding it milo scanned the will this is all of it given her situation there was no need to get fancy the estate was her house plus a pension a little cash in the bank no liens no encumbrances no attachments only one heir listed her son said barone i did suggest there were steps she could take to reduce the estate tax burden on him like putting the house into a joint trust with a lifetime usage clause for her she wasnt interested why not she wouldnt tell me and i didnt pry she was more interested in my hourly rate clearly didnt want to spend an extra dime milo handed me the will in the event of anthony mancusi jrs predeceasing his mother everything was willed to the salvation army milo said she talk at all about the son is he a suspect were looking into everyone close to her bet thats not a huge crowd why do you say that she was polite said jean barone but a little i got the feeling she wasnt too sociable no interest in small talk cut to the chase or maybe she was just minimizing the billable hours you know that generation careful with a buck unlike todays generation said milo my two kids have great jobs but theyre overdrawn on their credit cards maybe mrs mancusi thought her son was irresponsible and thats why she didnt want to give him the house she wouldnt have actually been giving it to him just barone smiled functionally its the same thing so maybe youve got a point but if she didnt trust him she didnt tell me i cant overemphasize how reserved she was but polite ladylike its so strange to think of her being murdered was it a robbery doesnt seem to be youre thinking the son wanted to push things along were not thinking anything yet whatever you say barone batted her lashes milo got up thanks for the copy and for the nonbillable time sure she said touching his hand youre the most interesting thing thats happened all week during the ride down i said must be the uniform oops youre not wearing one he said nah my cologne eau de schmo it was four pm by the time we headed for the prestige rentacar lot in beverly hills during the drive milo called the motor lab a couple of errant hairs and various wool cotton and linen fibers had showed up in the mercedes but no blood or body fluids the car had been vacuumed recently by someone whod taken care not to leave prints the lab would be removing the door panels tomorrow but the tech cautioned milo not to expect too much he said story of my life and drove faster ellas estate was mostly her house what do you think its worth i said that part of westwood million three minimum thats what i was thinking nice windfall for a loser like tony i said ella wasnt interested in reducing his tax burden and she stood by as he lost the apartment on olympic and ended up in that dive mommy thinks hes a loser and he knows it nothing like selfloathing to stoke rage i said and this was a healthy youthful seventythreeyearold who planned to be around for a while meaning extended poverty for tony the unmarkeds radio kicked in with a message to call the station sturgis im on my way to a who okay tell them tomorrow afternoon ill call them in the morning to set up a time handle them with care click antoine beverlys parents dropped by the station downtown told them im on the case they want to meet me feel like sitting in it could turn out to be a situation where psychological sensitivity is called for sure just give me a couple hours notice he said thanks oh man look at all that chrome prestige automotive executive services amounted to a cracked concrete lot covered by a canvas awning smallprint signage two dozen vehicles crowded nosetobumper and a shedlike office to one side all that chrome was a mass of porsches ferraris lamborghinis a mammoth rollsroyce phantom a pair of bentley gt coupes smaller cousins to nicholas heubels stately sedan up in front three mercedes ss two silver one black a vacant slot next to the black car iron posts marked both edges of the driveway between them a limp length of chain snaked across the cement a key lock was looped to a ring that passed through the righthand post shiny but cheap milos laughter lacked amusement a gazillion worth of wheels and they use drugstore crap i could pick this under the influence of any number of mindaltering substances in the office a small man around thirty sat next to a folding card table and listened to reggaeton the tag on his blue shirt said gil the tattoos brocading his neck and arms said his pain threshold was high his black hair was perfectly combed his soul patch squared to the size of a scrabble tile on the wall were a toolcompany calendar and playboy centerfolds that made me feel like a tenyearold kid milo flashed the badge the man switched off the radio yeah they told me you were coming milo said youre off the beaten path mr gilbert chacon how do customers find you mr chacon we dont rent to no customers the rental lots on la cienega this is the ultraluxury lot we do calls from hotels its all delivery guest wants a car you bring it to them yeah said chacon but we dont deal with no guests just the hotels everything goes on the hotel bill so not much traffic here nobody comes here someone came here last night chacons mouth screwed up never happened before whats your security setup chain and a lock said chacon thats it chacon shrugged the police is what a minute away beverly hills you got cops all over the place is there a night watchman nope alarm system nope all those fancy wheels said milo chacon reached back his fingers grazed a clapboard wall he mustve liked the feel because he began stroking the wood the cars got alarms including the mercedes that got lifted it come with a system said chacon they all do was the system

place when you got here it was what time was that like i said they want me here at nine chacons eyes rose to the ceiling again maybe you were a little late that would be stupid so you arrived on time

over at the shack a guy with chacons past is wise to the drill hes got no motivation to give anything up i get closer to the bad guy i can come back with leverage offer him a break on aiding and abetting once not if nice to see him thinking about the future chapter the meeting with antoine beverlys parents was set for noon the following day when i got to milos office a note on the door said a rm largest room at the end of the corridor an interview in progress do not disturb sign dangled from the doorknob i knocked once and went in a middleaged black couple sat across the table from milo a walletsized photo of a boy was placed in front of the woman and after she appraised me her attention returned to the image the man next to her wore a stiff brown suit a white shirt and a gold tie secured by a silver clip an american flag pin rode his lapel his gray hair was tight in front it faded to skin under a white thread of a mustache his smile was obligatory the woman had on a charcoal pantsuit high waved hair was one shade darker than her clothes she drew away from the photo with reluctance and placed her hands flat on the table milo said mr and mrs beverly this is our psychologist dr delaware doctor gordon and sharna beverly gordon beverly half stood and sat back down his wife said pleased to meet you doctor the pressing of cool dry flesh i sat next to milo he said mr and mrs beverly brought me this picture of antoine i studied the picture maybe longer than i needed to smiling cleareyed boy with a space between his incisors short hair blue shirt plaid tie doctor i was just explaining that you were involved because of the complexities sharna beverly said we could use a psychiatrist because if it wasnt that maniac in texas it was some kind of maniac i knew it from the beginning kept telling those other detectives a silvernailed finger touched the edge of the photo its been so long no one did anything they tried said her husband but there were no leads sharna beverlys stare said hed blasphemed she turned to me im here to tell you what antoine was like so youll understand he didnt run away milo said no one suspects that maam they sure did sixteen years ago kept telling me hed run away run away antoine liked his practical jokes but he was a good boy our other boys went to college and that was antoines plan he especially looked up to his biggest brother brent brent has a degree in sound engineering and works on motion pictures gordon junior is an accountant at the water and power gordon beverly said antoine wanted to be a doctor you probably heard this a million times said his wife but not knowing is the worst doctor be honest with me knowing what you know about maniacs what chance is there this devil in texas is telling the truth i said i wish i could give you a solid answer mrs beverly but theres no way to know his storys certainly worth pursuing every angle is there you go she said every angle thats what i told those detectives sixteen years ago they said there was nothing more to do i glanced at the picture a boy frozen in time sharna beverly said they shouldve had the courtesy to answer our phone calls gordon said they answered them at first then they stopped they stopped pretty quickly daring her husband to argue milo said im really sorry no need to be sorry lieutenant lets do something now milo said getting back to what we were talking about maam how exactly did antoine get that magazine job magazine subscriptions said gordon beverly nice white neighborhood supposed to be safe his wife said hes not asking what hes asking how antoine found out at school someone put a flyer up on the bulletin board just before summer break antoine loved to work antoine had ambitions said her husband talked about being a surgical doctor he liked anything scientific sharna beverly said the flyer made it sound like easy money magazines selling themselves just jumping into peoples hands i told antoine that was foolish but he couldnt be convinced he copied down the number and went to a meeting on a saturday took two friends all of them agreed to do it they got sent to culver city which in those days was all white they worked five days steady and antoine sold the most subscriptions the following monday is when antoine never came home i said did antoine or the other boys have any unpleasant experiences on the job sharna said antoine said a couple of people called him nasty names and slammed the door in his face gordon said the n word other things along those lines why they sent those boys into a white neighborhood said sharna ill never understand people in crenshaw read magazines too supposed to be safer said her husband apparently it wasnt she snapped he touched her elbow she shifted away from contact ran a hand over the snapshot they threw those children in with strangers milo said did the detectives sixteen years ago canvass the neighborhood where antoine delivered they claimed they talked to everyone said sharna if they didnt are they going to admit it she folded her arms across her chest milo said what was the name of the company that hired antoine sharna said youth in action they closed down after antoine disappeared at least in la because of antoines disappearance after antoine the schools wouldnt let them advertise i went to the library used a computer to look them up couldnt find any mention of them did that yesterday when i found out we were coming here the only person i remember was a mr zint called to tell me how sorry he was sounded to me like he was worried we were going to sue him didnt know anything helpful i said antoine worked with two friends will and bradley she said wilson good and bradley maisonette friends since kindergarten they helped carry the coffin and cried like babies said antoine was selling the most reluctant smile antoine had a way of talking you into anything milo wrote down the names sharna beverly picked up the photo and held it to her breast her fingers covered the top of antoines face his eternal smile made my eyes ache i said did brad or will report anything unusual those five days she said no and i asked them the van dropped them off one by one in culver city antoine got off first and was supposed to be picked up last when the time came he wasnt there the van waited an hour then drove around looking for antoine then mr zint took bradley and will back to the school which is where he always picked them up then he called the police bradley and will were shook up bradley especially he already lived through a driveby gordon said not in our neighborhood visiting a cousin in compton sharna said it was me id go straight to texas put hot pokers on that devil run one of those electrocuting lie detectors they use on the alqaidas at guant√°namo thatd clear it up soon enough she glared at her husband he fingered his flag pin lieutenant she said do you have any feeling about that story that devils telling milo said i wish i did mrs beverly the sad truth is these lowlifes lie as easily as they breathe and theyll do anything to get out of dying so whats the plan this is gonna sound frustrating maam but im really starting at the beginning seeing as bradley masionette and will good were close to antoine and the last people to see him lets start with them any idea where i can locate them its not in the file the file maam is rather incomplete hmm well will coaches football at a catholic school dont know which one gordon beverly said st xavier she stared at him it was in the sentinel shar few years back he was coaching down in riverside moved here i called him up asked if he remembered anything more about antoine he said no well look at that she said what else dont you tell me about no sense telling when theres nothing to tell sharna beverly said bradley maisonette did not turn out well from what i hear hes spent most of his life in prison never did have a good family life gordon said were a tightknit family antoine comes home all excited about all the big money hes going to make i was happy for him sharna said magazines sell themselves people love magazines more than life itself i told him antoine what sounds too good to be true is i told him i needed to meet the people involved make sure they werent taking advantage antoine threw a fit jumping up and down begging pleading trust me mom dont embarrass me mom no one elses parents are putting their noses in i said everyone else is stupid so i should be antoine begs some more turns on that smile of his sidelong peek at the photo she folded her lips inward i told antoine thats the trouble today no one gets involved but the boy kept working at me saying if i showed up will and brad and everyone else would be dissing him all summer then he brings out his report card half as half bs perfect in conduct claiming that proved he was smart could be trusted she slumped so i gave in biggest mistake i ever made and ive been paying for it for sixteen years gordon said honey i keep telling you theres no reason to her eyes blazed you keep telling me and you keep telling me she got up walked to the door took care to close it silently projecting more rage than if shed slammed it gordon beverly said sorry nothing to be sorry for sir said milo shes a good wife and mother she didnt deserve what she got what both of you got gordon beverlys face trembled maybe its worse for a mother well that was fun said milo when we were alone in his office now i got little fishhooks sticking into my heart and decent people tugging on them time to check out this youth in action on the off chance theyre still in business and mrs b missed it she hadnt he got to work locating antoines friends wilson goods name pulled up several references to varsity football games at st xavier preparatory high in south la in addition to coaching good was head of the physical education department bradley maisonettes criminal record was extensive over a dozen narcotics convictions plus the predictable larcenies that fed a life of addiction maisonettes last parole was eleven months ago his downtown address was a governmentfinanced sro milo phoned his probation officer got voice mail left a message pulling a panatela out of a shirt pocket he peeled off the plastic and wet the tip but kept the cigar in his hand something else you think i should do why doesnt texas just send jackson out here and dare him to point out the graves because hes a serious escape risk tried four times nearly succeeded once and injured a guard in the process no way are they gonna let him out of their custody until some local department comes up with serious corroboration so far three of jacksons claims have turned out to be bogus crimes he didnt know were already solved bastard probably scans the internet searching for open horrors he can cop to unfortunately he cant be written off yet because the stakes are high if i could find antoines damn file it might lead me somewhere where are the detectives who worked it originally ones dead the others living somewhere in idaho at least thats where his pension check goes but he hasnt answered my calls meanwhile theres ella mancusi with a body barely cold why do i think im gonna break the beverlys hearts he placed the beginnings of antoines new murder book in a drawer changed his mind and laid it next to his computer ive started surveillance on tony mancusi got three brandnew uniforms who think they like plainclothes still no violent crime reports the night the bentley got boosted and mr heubel had the car washed and detailed the day sean scraped it so the chance of finding anything new is subnil im putting that at the bottom of the drawer any luck getting ella some media exposure you know the times maybe yes maybe no public affairs say there should be something on the six oclock news tonight his phone rang he listened wrote something down clicked off that was a message from one of ellas allegedly noninvolved cousins wants to talk to me hes close works at a lamp store on olympic and barrington maybe the gods are smiling brilliant crystal and lighting was a thousand square feet of glare aaron hochswelder met us at the door and announced that he owned the place had sent his employees on a coffee break he walked us to the rear of his showroom heat from scores of chandeliers seared the back of my neck blinding light evoked a neardeath experience hochswelder was in his sixties but still darkhaired tall and gaunt with a horseface and foxeyes he wore a green shortsleeved shirt pleated khakis spitshined oxfords he said thanks for coming quickly i could be out of line here but i felt i should talk to you i still cant believe what happened to ella milo said she was your cousin first cousin her father was my fathers older brother she used to babysit me his attention was snagged by an unlit bulb in a venetian chandelier he reached up twisted brought forth a twinkle you have any idea who did it not yet anything you can tell us would be helpful sir aaron hochswelder chewed his cheek im not really sure i should be saying this but have you met her son tony we have what do you think about what his personality he seems to be down on his luck that assumes he ever had any luck tough life said milo selfimposed hochswelders bony forearms tightened i dont want to stir anything up but something about tony bothers you its hard to talk about family this way but you might want to look at him as the killer its a painful thought im not saying hed actually do anything like that but said milo he might know someone bad im not saying he does its just this is really tough i feel like a turncoat hochswelder inhaled through his nose breathed out through his mouth all im saying is tony is the only one i can think of in the family tony told us there wasnt much family period because he chooses to have nothing to do with anyone whos anyone me and my wife and our kids my brother len and his wife and their kids my brothers a dentist lives in palos verdes none of the kids are close to tony which frankly was okay bad influence hochswelder cracked his knuckles i dont want you to think ive got some kind of vendetta against tony its just he called me this morning to tell me about his mother thats how i found out first time ive heard from him in years he said he had no energy to call anyone else i should do it shunting responsibility he also hinted that he wanted me to take care of the funeral financially and otherwise what was his demeanor when he called not crying or weeping more like off off how off in space does tony have a drug history he did as a kid said hochswelder according to my kids i also think the family thinks he might be gay so theres all sorts of issues here why does the family think that he never dated any girls we ever heard about never got married and sometimes he hes not a sissy but he can get i dont know how to say it all of a sudden hell do something pansyish you know a mannerism we used to talk about it how one second tony would do one of those things throw his hair bat his eyelashes and then bam hed be just like a normal person whens the last time you saw him that would have to be thanksgiving four years ago my brother had a family gettogether and tony showed up with ella he looked like he didnt wash his clothes regularly put on quite a bit of weight maybe he ate before because he didnt eat much at lens table he got up before dessert went to the bathroom came back announcing hed called a cab was going to wait outside ella was so embarrassed we all pretended it never happened just went on normally with the meal any reason he left early thats the thing there was no conflict or anything boom he just gets up and announces like he was mad at something but for the life of me nothing happened to make him mad tony have a temper said milo hochswelder scratched a temple not really i couldnt say that no just the opposite hes always been kind of quiet no one understands him being effeminate and all that that and just being strange like getting up before dessert no warning and leaving like always keeping to himself his father was like that too but tony senior would at least go to family gatherings and pretend to be social though frankly most of the time hed sit outside and smoke big smoker thats what caused his heart attack he worked for a milk company they delivered to the studios and tony got tony junior a job at one of them paramount i think basically a janitor job moving stuff around but those people pay well lots of union pressure tony junior wouldve been set up financially but he claimed he hurt his back and quit and since then hes been doing nothing claimed im sure hes got some pain we all do lets talk about his drug use all i know is what the kids said your kids mine and my brother lens not that tony was a big topic of conversation it just came up we talk about everything in our family what did tonys cousins say he used it was never specific more like tony was stoned all the time thats why he bombed out in school which was hard for ella im sure education was important to her she ever mention being disappointed ella wasnt one to share her feelings but everyone had a sense tony was a big disappointment to her also i think he gambles in fact i know he does my boy arnold saw him at one of the indian casinos near palm springs arnold and his family were vacationing and he and rita arnolds wife were playing the slots just fooling around theyre not gamblers when they went to get the kids at the day care the casino has arnold spotted tony at the blackjack table arnold was going to say hi even though he and tony werent close just to be friendly but then tony played a hand and lost all his money and stomped away from the table cursing arnold didnt think it was a good time to be social do you have any other examples of tonys gambling no but arnold said from the way tony was sitting all hunched over hiding his cards it looked like he was used to it drugs and gambling said milo anything else and gay hoschswelder reminded him but im not accusing just passing the information along dont want you to think ive got something against tony i dont i feel sorry for him frankly tony senior couldnt have been easy to live with that one had a bad temper the italian hot blood but with what happened to ella i just thought i should talk to you milo said lets be theoretical mr hochswelder and assume tony does have some connection to ellas murder what motive would you say hed have oh no lieutenant i couldnt go that far theoretically said milo just between us right now with nothing on the record hochswelder gnawed his upper lip knowing ella she probably left everything to tony no reason she shouldnt he was her only child though in my opinion giving money to someone who doesnt work is like flushing it down the toilet you dont buy tonys injury who knows said hochswelder its between him and god how would you describe tonys relationship with his mother like i said ella didnt talk about her personal life ever see any animosity between them no i cant say that except for that time at thanksgiving ella got mad at him they both looked tense when they arrived ella wore kind of a frozen smile like she was pretending to be happy what about tony off in his own world any idea what wouldve made them tense none whatsoever milo said lets switch gears for a second who were ellas friends i never saw that she had any said hochswelder she and tony senior tended to keep to themselves every year we invited her to christmas told her to bring tony junior every year she showed up with a nice fruit basket he never showed up frankly we wondered if she even told him why wouldnt she she knew he was antisocial and after that scene at thanksgiving four years ago maybe she was embarrassed leaving before dessert hochswelder adjusted a bulb trust me lieutenant our desserts are worth sticking around for my wife bakes and so does my brothers wife that year we had six kinds of pies as well as bread pudding and compote from the way tony looked at the spread the girls put out youd think we were trying to serve him garbage chapter we left the lighting store and stepped out into a mild evening milo said place is dantes inferno charming fellow huh not that he wants to badmouth tony we got back in the unmarked and he began driving closeknit clan except when theyre not any ideas from what he said his description of the mancusis is interesting asocial father with a bad temper isolated family abusers are great at corralling the herd so tony may have had a rough childhood you see that as grounds for junior hating mom bad enough to have her carved abused kids can resent the parent who didnt save them moskow said when tony did visit ella never walked him out so there were issues he wasnt worth getting off her chair for but the morning paper was and thats when she got it i said interesting bit of a reach maybe not getting symbolic can lead to all sorts of dark places ol tonys sitting on a whole lot of primal anger and chronic pain doesnt improve his disposition i said as long as ella helped him financially he was able to keep his feelings under control she turns off the tap he views it as yet another abandonment comes to see her pleads his case she says no he argues she gets mad if she really lost her cool and threatened to change the will leave it all to the salvation army that couldve done it she told barone she didnt want a copy of the will at home maybe to shield it from tony a million three for that house i said more than tempting if he does have a gambling problem he could know bad guys whod take on the job he drove for a while its as logical as any scenario but hochswelder labeled tony a compulsive gambler based on a secondhand account of a single episode and he doesnt like tony so anything he says is suspect a block later a slovenly fat guy whos not a decorator or a florist or a choreographer being gay impossible i laughed you see his sexuality as relevant you dont what do you mean something else for mama to disapprove of he said parents can get picky that way back at the station he checked in with the plainclothes officer surveilling tony mancusi the subject had left his apartment once to get a burrito and a soda at a stand on sunset near hillhurst walking distance but mancusi had taken his car which hed used as his dining room munching in the parking lot officer ruiz also observed that subject tossed his junk out the car window onto the ground rather than use a trash basket ten feet away officer ruiz began a violation roster on the subject when i pointed out to officer ruiz that littering private property was bad behavior but nothing citable he was conspicuously disappointed eager i said twentyone years old six months out of the academy the other two are just as green i feel like im running a day care center but at least theyre motivated mancusi go anywhere after lunch right back home and hes still there id love to have grounds for his phone records shuffling through the message slips on his desk he tossed the first four read the fifth and said wonders never cease sean got creative binchy though still on auto theft had continued combing the crime reports for incidents coinciding with the time period the bentley had been missing coming up empty on homicides rapes and assaults just as milo had but the young detective had gone further and a missing person had surfaced milo phoned him grunted approval got the details katrina shonsky twentyeightyearold female caucasian blond and brown five four one hundred ten out partying that night with friends drove home alone hasnt been heard from since mother reported it three days later took this long to make it into the computer go sean i said you run a good day care papa sturgis mr and mrs royal hedges lived in a vast loftlike condo on the fourteenth floor of a luxury building on the wilshire corridor walls of glass opened to a southward view that avoided the ocean and stared down at inglewood baldwin hills lax flight paths altitude and a starless night transformed miles of tract housing into a light show royal and monica hedges sat on a low black rochebobois sofa smoking in unison the condos floors were black granite the walls white diamond plaster that threw off its own glints the artwork big and blotchy with an emphasis on gray monica hedges was somewhere between fifty and sixty tiny and blond and skinny to the point of desiccation she had heavily lined brown eyes a face stretched past the point of reason and great legs displayed by a little black dress royal hedges looked to be seventy minimum sported a redbrown toupee nearly good enough to pull off the illusion and a vandyke dyed to match he wore a red silk shirt white slacks pink suede loafers without socks hid his fourth yawn behind liverspotted hands and flicked ashes into a chrome tray monica said katrinas my only child from my second marriage her fathers long gone disappeared said milo dead her tone said no loss her third husbands body language said this was her ordeal she said im not panicking lieutenant but i am getting a little nervous katrinas done stupid things before but not like this a week and counting i cant help worrying because thats what a mother does though i fully expect her to walk right in with one of her stupid excuses royal said ill be back patted her knee left the room men and their plumbing said monica hedges hell be up and down the whole time weve been married two years he doesnt really know katrina milo said is there any friend or relative katrina mightve gone to visit you mean her fathers family never norm shonsky wasnt in her life and neither is his clan airy wave showing no curiosity about why someone of milos rank would be doing a house call on a missing person at her income level probably used to service besides she said katrina doesnt visit she picks up impulsively and leaves where does she go maam another wave wherever mexico europe once she even made it to tahiti thats what i meant by stupid shell find a cheap flight on the internet do no planning whatsoever and just fly off in gay abandon by herself silence mrs hedges there are men i suppose she said if she doesnt travel with them shes certainly capable of finding them along the way she makes a point of telling me when she comes back telling you what that she behaved in a way i wouldnt approve she does it purely to rile me the exceptions are those times when she neglects to take enough money for expenses and calls me in desperation when that happens shes like someone from the travel channel going on about the sights museums quaint old churches she smoked greedily i love my daughter lieutenant but she can be trying how long has it been since you last saw her hesitation a month give or take we werent fighting nothing like that but katrina had convinced herself she needed to be independent in other words no contact with mother until finances deem otherwise id never have known she was gone if her friend hadnt called to ask if katrina was with me which friend a girl named beth holloway never met her she was out with katrina at that club they split up she hasnt heard from katrina since he read off the van nuys address on katrina shonskys drivers license is that current maam it is does katrina live alone yes in a dump any current men in her life not that i know said monica hedges losing volume by the end of the sentence as if she doubted her own veracity katrina tends to guard her privacy how long has she been at this address fifteen months she stubbed out her cigarette watched the diminishing trail of smoke in terms of guarding she kept me out of her private life dont be offended maam but do you think she was hiding something could be lieutenant if she was dating someone highcaliber i have no doubt shed be showing him off just to show me im wrong wrong about what shes a gorgeous girl i keep telling her she needs to elevate herself run in a different circle royal and i are members of the riviera country club there are socials all the time when i call katrina to inform her of an event she laughs and then her mood turns ugly she prefers doing things her own way her eyes shifted toward the front door i just know shes going to run out of cash and come waltzing in any minute do you have a recent photo we could keep reaching for a new cigarette she marched across the living room turned a corner muffled voices filtered back inflections that suggested tension she returned alone carrying the cold cigarette in one hand a threebyfive glossy in the other this is about four years old but katrina hasnt aged appreciatively touching her own cheek good genes it was taken at a cousins wedding katrina served as a bridesmaid after much complaining about the dress pretty girl with a heartshaped face wearing a bigshouldered sateen gown the color of mortified flesh illfitting cap sleeves rode too high on smooth arms a high square bodice kept its promise to flatter no one katrina shonskys fair hair was upswept and tasseled by curls that resembled brass sausages her lips were shaped into something resembling a smile but the rest of her face radiated disdain so said milo youre pretty confident shes off on one of her trips but you reported her missing just to be safe i know she didnt travel far because she didnt take her passport youve been to her apartment talked my way past the landlord and went through the entire place straightened up while i was there lord knows the dump needed it her passport was right in a dresser drawer if she took clothes she didnt take many lieutenant but katrinas capable of hopping off with nothing but her purse and a credit card do you cosign for her card i do not no more of that katrina abused my credit limit she now has a visa with a onethousanddollaramonth maximum and is expected to pay her own bills and i have to say for the most part shes done so crossing her fingers no passport no clothes said milo doesnt sound like much of a vacation some of those places she goes to said monica hedges all you need is a bikini and a wineglass its also possible she used her employee discount for a wardrobe she works in fashion she sells clothing at la femme boutique in brentwood overpriced tacky if you ask me i told her i could probably get her a position at harari or one of the places on rodeo through royal he was in garment manufacturing owned a huge company that did contract work for some pretty big couture names she played with her unlit cigarette reached for a white onyx lighter milo got there first katrinas job she said between puffs is a deadend position like every other job shes held if you ask me down deep she thinks she deserves no better because she lacks formal education she dropped out of high school finally got her ged did a semester at santa monica community the plan was to finish two years and transfer to a uc instead she dropped out and worked selling shoes at fred segal they fired her for poor work habits i told her to make lemonade out of lemons and return to smc all she needed was one and a half more years no go i said sounds like katrinas a bit of a rebel a bit raspy laughter gentlemen i love my daughter dearly but i do believe that she thinks bucking me is the key to her identity she was always a difficult child colicky baby face cute as a button but screaming twentyfour hours a day when that finally ended she began walking early was into everything she always hated school even though shes smart she can sing but wouldnt go out for chorus has a lovely figure couldve gone out for cheerleading she sighed maybe eventually shell mature milo said lets go back to that night katrina went out clubbing with two friends beth holloway and rianna something foreign which club did they go to some dive in west la more like a barn than a bona fide nightclub youve been there i went over yesterday and talked to some monstrous men bouncers ugly industrial area off pico one of those side streets i also talked to the manager no one was helpful they said the place was packed they have no memory of katrina or any other specific individual and there are no security cameras on the premises isnt that stupid lieutenant not the way id run things said milo whats the name of the club the light my fire as in the song pardon do you have phone numbers for beth and rianna no but i can tell you where to find them both beth said she sells jewelry at a place near la femme and rianna works the cosmetics counter at barneys do you have the name of the jewelry store somewhere near katrinas work san vicente near barrington id be concerned if this was anyone but katrina even with it being katrina im getting a bit nervous what will you do for me lieutenant milo said whats the longest shes ever been gone ten days hawaii she visited all the islands never called once came back with the deepest tan ive ever seen youd think she was a mexican or something another time she spent nine days in cozumel some sort of discount special so this is within her usual pattern does that mean you wont do anything no ill look into it maam did beth holloway say how katrina happened to be separated from her friends she did after i asked twice the plan was for rianna to be the designated driver but they went in katrinas car because this rianna girls car was broken rianna and beth got picked up by two men and asked katrina if it was okay for them to go their separate ways they claim katrina was fine with that thats the last time they saw her you have doubts that katrina was fine with the change my daughter does not take well to disappointment lieutenant low frustration tolerance her teachers called it what concerns me is that she decided to do them one better by meeting a man herself then ran off to godknowswhere without her passport if youre out for fun you can find it anywhere said monica hedges relaxing her posture for a second as if reminiscing milo said rianna being the designated driver meant katrina was drinking that night and katrina loves her long island iced teas which is a hodgepodge cocktail just a kitchensink mess that does godknowswhat to your brain i always tell her stick with the classics they wont pollute your mind martini or manhattan never on the rocks that way you know how much youre getting but try telling katrina that to her anything with fruit liquor and a kick is a martini has she been known to overindulge monica hedges shifted her weight that has happened from time to time youre concerned she might have driven home intoxicated what if god forbid she had an accident but i called the highway patrol and they reported nothing on the freeway that night is the her customary route home i dont know she said easiest way to get to the valley isnt it frowning she used to have a place near the u that she shared with another girl some indian student who hit the books all the time which isnt katrinas style it didnt last long katrina complained that everyone in the building was a student and it made her feel old i suspect her own lack of education embarrassed her i was hoping that might motivate her but it didnt she wanted her own place said the rent this side of the hill was too steep i told her id help she never took me up on my offer just picked up and moved to van nuys though she keeps insisting its sherman oaks is that logical lieutenant turning down a sincere offer kids said milo monica hedges puffed manically you didnt answer my question what exactly are you going to do for me what would you like us to do mrs hedges that startled her ashes dropped to the granite floor id like you to detect where my daughter is use that computer youve got tracking airline tickets credit card receipts phone usage put out one of those apbs maam without evidence of a crime that would be an invasion of katrinas privacy oh puleeze said monica hedges sorry maam but thats the way it is if she were a minor it would be different psychologically shes about fourteen milo smiled youre telling me theres nothing you can do well do everything we can legally that means talking to her friends stopping by the club i already did all that sometimes repetition helps maam well also look for her car is she still driving the yellow mustang thats currently registered to her yes but not for long i just got a notice that shes missed the last two payments that loan i did cosign for the agreement was i made the down payment and the payments were to be her responsibility give me the financecompany data and ill see if its been picked up i did that myself and no it hasnt sounds like youve accomplished a lot want something done well do it yourself so thats all youre going to do it doesnt sound very promising lets start and see where it leads mrs hedges call me anytime if you think of something oh i will youd better believe i will she got to her feet hurried to the door held it open milo said im going to ask you one more question that might alarm you but its only routine in case we do come across accident reports monica hedges straightened and sucked on her cigarette what do you know katrinas blood type that is eerie just routine maam some routine you people have said monica hedges i certainly wouldnt want your job milo smiled most people dont and im one of them her type is the same as mine opositive its the most popular she smoked and watched us walk to the elevator as we stepped into the lift i heard her say there you are darling is everything working the door slammed chapter milo had asked the condo valet to keep the unmarked close when we got to the front of the building it was gone and the valet was poking a blackberry a highdecibel throat clear made the man look up the crown victoria had to move it too crowded no other cars in sight milo said could you get it adding a please that made the valet flinch the guy ambled off toward the subterranean parking lot milo said the shonsky girls been missing over a week mommie dearest sees it as playing hooky wants me to be her personal truant officer or shes in deep denial she says shes nervous but all i heard was anger anger can mask anxiety i said he looked at his timex whered the hell he park it chula vista first tony and his mom and hochswelder now this harmonious bunch any happy families left with our jobs were not going to meet them so what do you think of our missing girl with her history of cutting town on impulse how far do i take it opositive i said same as in the bentley didnt you hear mom its the most popular type like its a contest growing up with someone like that i can see needing to escape that kind of rivalry could also make katrina vulnerable to what bling mom marries rich but katrina works a lowpaying job if she left the club woozy and feeling abandoned by her pals two hundred grand worth of car rolling up wouldve seemed heavensent talk about something to oneup mommy if she was picked up i dont see it happening at the light my fire i was there last year chasing a dead lead on a drug murder the male clienteles acrylic shirts too much hair gel and dance moves worse than mine someone drives up in heubels bentley the bouncers and everyone else wouldve noticed and by the time the guy hit the floor fifty women woulda been all over him he phoned the club asked to speak to the manager looked at his watch again scowled the line clicked in a brief conversation followed guy laughed said what do you think this is the playboy mansion he also said nothing unusual happened at the club that night he already said so to the nosy mother if katrina was upset about being ditched by her friends she couldve hit another club tried to redeem the night or she drove home drunk had some sort of mechanical problem we just heard shes impulsive and shed stopped making payments on the mustang both of which raise the chance of poor maintenance for all we know she simply ran out of gas got stranded somewhere drunk girl alone late at night mr moneybags cruises by and says hop in or shes in hawaii she guarded her privacy with her mother i said but her friend worried enough to call mom breaking down on the even late someone wouldve seen her with several drinks in her she couldve been intimidated by the freeway chose an alternate route or she got totally lost and headed south alex which couldve put her in some seriously nasty territory why not start with the simplest assumption when im heading north and want to avoid the freeway i take the sepulveda pass late at night once you get north of sunset its a fast ride pretty much empty but that also means breaking down in an isolated area engine noise sounded from the mouth of the sublot the same valet rolled up in a babyblue jaguar sedan got out and stood by the drivers door milo walked over to him if you insist the valet said huh ill take it in trade if you throw in the extended warranty the valet gaped milo got an inch from his face wheres the crown vic friend i got a call from a resident milo took out his cell phone want me to call you too whats your number pal and while youre at it show me some id for an official police investigation the valet didnt answer milo flashed his shield get it now mr and mrs lazarus are coming out in a ill help em go the valet hazarded eye contact whatever he saw made him scurry off milo eyed the jaguar budget wheels pshaw if katrina did break down and got picked up think mr bentley thief was stalking her or cruising for a victim and she fit his appetite sexual psychopath he said whats the link with ella mancusi i said thrill of the hunt guess so normally id kiss katrina off as not worth my time but with two big black cars boosted and blood in the damn bentley he shook his head lets try to find the mustang an elderly couple exited the condo saw him standing next to the jag stopped he grinned evening mr and mrs lazarus opening both doors with a flourish he said have a great time the couple approached the car nervously got in sped off seconds later the valet roared up in the unmarked and screeched to a stop milo took his hand opened it and slapped a five in his palm not necessary said the valet nor deserved have a nice life we drove the sepulveda pass north all the way to the valleys southern border just shy of ventura boulevard continued a few miles beyond north of wilshire was the low flat stretch of veterans cemetery then small businesses and apartments after that rolling hillside topped by lights traffic was thin no sign of katrina shonskys car as we returned to the city milo said oh well if i liked the simple life id be a farmer theres always south i said a hundred and fifty miles worth to mexico i looked up at the foothills to the east plenty of side streets to explore what a fun guy he growled turning right and cruising several dark winding roads an hour later ill have patrol follow up tomorrow try to get hold of katrinas girlfriends for all we know theyll tell us a whole different story like shes with some bum mommy wouldnt approve of and dont bring up opositive anymore im not feeling popular light butterscotched the windows of robins studio out back i walked past the pond stopped to check out the baby koi the antique iron pagoda lights reached down to the floor giving an easy view of the fish three four inches long now bobbing merrily in the current set off by the waterfall id first spotted them as larvasized hatchlings a dozen little scraps of fishy filament swimming fearlessly among twofootlong adults koi will eat their own eggs but once the young are born theyll never inflict harm unlike other fish they dont harass sick or dying cohorts maybe thats why they can live over a century i continued to the studio rapped the window robin looked up from her bench and smiled placed a white rectangle of alpine spruce to her ear and tapped searching for the tones that told her the wood might be suitable as a soundboard from the size of the plank a mandolin board her expression as she placed it to the side said no such luck by the time i entered she had another piece in hand blanche nestled in her lap serene as ever robin said hi blanche let out a wheezy bulldog welcome when robin kissed me blanche turned her head sideways in that bulldog way and nuzzled my hand i said a blonde and a redhead arent you the lucky one i eyed the discarded spruce no music in there even though hed never know the difference she eyed a fedex box in the corner learn anything about that poor old woman the working assumption is the son had something to do with it but theres nothing even close to proof a son doing that to his mother she said beyond belief she eyed the box in the corner again i said new tools collection of dvds from dotcom ten audrey hepburn movies and a note that said i remind him of her hepburn had been five seven and built like a human clothes hanger robins five

all the time what do you mean men are always looking at you youve got the x factor pheromones whatever oh sure its true you never notice because youre not a flirt because im a space cadet sometimes that too alex she said ive never come close to dropping a hint that this was anything other than business it neednt have anything to do with you great hey i said whats the worst that can happen he makes a move and you gently deter him meanwhile you can email him a friendly but formal thankyou note for the movies and tell him you and i are going to enjoy watching them she stroked blanche youre right im being silly as they used to say in seventh grade conceited she touched a hoop earring tossed her hair much better from her than from tony mancusi i played with the top button of her shirt she said factor x huh does that make you mr y we picked out two movies and watched from bed roman holiday had held up beautifully over half a century breakfast at tiffanys hadnt and when the end finally arrived we were half asleep cutting the lights we touched fingertips i murmured something im pretty sure was affectionate robin said audrey hepburn was beautiful but im nothing like her and was out at

ijanovic tall narrow brunette one station down she smiled at us through a fragrant cloud an array of sample atomizers adorned the counter shoppers and shopgirls chattered everyone chasing the next big

westside omalley premium motors was on the east end of beverly hills but the service facility was on pico in santa monica minutes from the light my fire milo called asked for clyde said yeah thats him

only area sat a few million bucks worth of status symbol milo said pull in next to that blue rolls dont i need to be preapproved he slapped the sevilles vinyl dash how many miles on this masterpiece sixty thou on the second engine endurance beats flash anytime son you are officially a classic the waiting area was a sliver of space facing an empty coffeemaker no chairs no reading material no one waiting behind a glass partition a black woman wearing reading glasses moved columns of numbers around a computer screen milo rapped on the glass the partition slid open how can i help you he introduced himself and asked for clive clive hatfield why wed just like to talk to him she pushed a button on an intercom clive to front desk front desk for clive milo said not too many customers today we call them clients she said they rarely come here pickup and delivery those people expect it we used to do it free now we charge a hundred dollars a trip and no one complains the age of lowered expectations pardon the cost of gas huh thats what the bosses say who does the pickup and delivery the same guys who detail the cars not the mechanics with what they get paid i dont think so skilled job thats what they say how longs clive been working here she edged closer to the glass you suspect him of something not at all routine questions she said like on tv you got it if you say so she returned to her computer we waited five minutes before milo asked her to page hatfield again she said maybe hes doing something noisy and didnt hear we can go back and look for him no thats okay she repeated the page before the announcement faded the door opened behind us and a reedy voice said i heard you the first time esther definite accent but not chips and ale maybe sweet home alabama esther muttered hes all yours clive hatfield wiped blackened hands on a rag not much cleaner than his skin early thirties tall and bowlegged in gray pinstriped coveralls he had long lank brown hair tinted brass at the tips bushy sideburns a tiny crushed nose squinty eyes looked us over while he worked at the grease as some of the grime relented i noticed a pallid band of flesh circling his left ring finger yeah esther said these are the police here to see you the police what the this is for real milo said lets talk outside hatfield hesitated then followed we passed near a bright red continental gt coupe that hatfield regarded with distaste milo said kind of garish shrug its their money where are yall taking me here said milo stopping at the seville hatfields face tightened as he checked out my car this is a cop drive what some sort of undercover thing he ran a finger along the top of the sevilles hood left a gray trail gm used a chevy two chassis on these gussied it up and

lit up another cigarette yall find kat tell her she can call me if she wants ill even pretend she aint faking it been married most of my life so i know about faking he moved to leave but milo held him back asked the kind of loose followup questions designed to relax hatfield got a bit more amiable told a filthy joke about a woman a raccoon and an exhaust pipe but he had nothing more to say about kat shonsky when milo asked him where hed been the night she disappeared he said usually i couldnt tell yall shit about where i am but lucky for me this one i know i was back in columbus my older

we returned to the front office and showed a picture of kat shonsky to esther she studied it for a while cant swear to it but she could be one of them who comes by to see him holding the photo closer not bad better than some of the others clives popular you wouldnt believe she said they bring him lunch guy must have something going on but i dont see it i said doesnt appear to be charm clean hands either i said this kind of work be hard to stay clean exactly thats why im dating a teacher milo said clive ever ask you out youve got to be kidding she returned the photo you think he did something to her milo said you see him as capable of that to me hes an oaf with a sour personality but hes never lost his temper or done anything aggressive but i guess anyones capable of anything so you do suspect him were nowhere near that maam it would be best to keep this conversation under the hat she removed her glasses i wasnt planning on spreading rumors of course not so clive clives fine she said everyone here is fine im really busy the glass partition slid shut chapter as i backed out of the lot a bentley turned in and blocked my way another black one red interior i rolled forward the bentley didnt budge milo stuck his head out and said give us some space the drivers window opened and a blueshirted man stuck his head out and shouted cant you read customers only dude milo said ah the travails of the alpha male got out had a thirtysecond chat with the shouter by the time he was back in the seville the stunned driver had given me plenty of room i said making friends and influencing people and turned onto pico if i had clives natural charm i couldve gotten a free lunch how do you figure i guess there could be a certain rough appeal rough enough for him to hurt kat shonsky he doesnt like women i said and this particular woman dumped him with his wife and kids gone hes lonely maybe gets horny and remembers how driving around in fancy wheels was a big thrill for kat why not try it again i said he claims he doesnt know the customers but all hed have to do is read a work order to learn heubels address and if he actually tinkered with heubels car he couldve known about the spare key in the wheel well hell he said he could have a master key so you like him on the negative side he bears no resemblance to ella mancusis killer and there is the matter of that alibi he found brittany hatfields number in mississippi and punched it hi is your mom there a friend from california yes cali mrs hatfield this is lieutenant sturgis of the los angeles police department no im sorry its not about that i see ill do what i can but first off could you tell me he did a lot of listening ended up holding the phone away from his ear clive was right about her being surround sound and shes got reason to yell seems the prince has a badcheck problem as in three straight months of child support bouncing she put in for a wage garnish thats what she thought i was

starting to feel like a family counselor at least kats mother hasnt gotten past her denial yet she might if you asked her for a blood sample mitochondrial match to the blood in the bentley lets see

said i still dont understand why texas doesnt pressure jackson to be specific before you waste all this time because its not about logical or ethical alex its politics he swung a big foot onto the desk papers scattered and fell to the floor he made no attempt to pick them up unwrapped a cigarillo and bit down hard wood splintered he inspected the shattered tip tossed the whole thing into the

touch is clearly called for also the chief likes you so hed approve when did that come up last time he summoned me seems he read that paper you published last spring agrees that most profiling is bullshit the chief reads psych journals the chief has a masters in psych he suggested you should be on the payroll i told him the department wasnt economically competitive he quoted the pay scale i said thank you sir always looking out for your interests say hi to coach good maybe you can get tips on passing and rushing i played baseball in high school what position utility outfielder i said wherever they needed me wilson goods house was one of five crisp onestories edging a deadend street above the hollywood bowls cheap seats what brokers call midcentury architectural as if the fifties is a leper decade close enough to the amphitheater to hear music on warm summer nights the rest of the view was trees and brush and ozonedepleted sky goods house was peach stucco where it wasnt redwood siding the gray explorer and a green vw passat sat on a pebblegrain slab behind a fullwidth electric mesh gate i pushed the button on the call box listened to the doorbell chime the first few notes of pachelbels canon a mockingbird hopped from a bottlebrush tree onto a honeysuckle hedge off in the distance ravens played politics and always the auto hum the freeway was the real la philharmonic before setting out id found a picture of wilson good on the web victory party after a title game thicknecked goodlooking man with sad eyes that seemed at odds with the celebration maybe a sensitive guy maybe he wouldnt mind my waking him from a sickbed i rang again was contemplating a third attempt when a woman came walking up broadmoor trailing something tiny and brown the animal tugged and leaped and strained a spaghettistrap leash the woman trotted to catch up i guessed chihuahua and i was wrong this was the smallest dachshund id ever seen surging and charging headdown like a bratwurst on a mission the woman was brownhaired and freckled wore a green top the same color as the passat skinny black pants black shoes thirties five five with long legs and commodious hips the dog surged to the end of a long leash developed an instant lust for my left shoe the woman said stop indy without much conviction got her wrist yanked fought to hold her ground i said indy as in the big race his engine never turns off she scooped the dog into her arms wrestled with the squirming bundle when indy finally calmed the woman looked at wilson goods house mossgreen eyes soft color hard appraisal she said anything i can help you with i brought out my lapd consultants badge long expired and pretty dinky but few people bother to check the freckled woman remained too far back to read the details though indy was itching for a try im looking for mr good im andrea his wife as if she wasnt sure what do you need with will fifteen years ago he had a friend named antoine beverly who of course antoine indy began making gremlin noises renewed his battle against confinement andrea good gave up and lowered him to the ground will and antoine were friends since preschool what happened to antoine is the saddest thing wills ever experienced but he doesnt know anything that would help the police youre sure of that of course i am have the police finally learned something the case has just been reopened could you ask your husband if he can spare me a few minutes the police send psychologists out on old cases on specific cases if i im sure will would love to help she said but its not a good time hes got a nasty flu and a couple of big games coming up leave me your number the detective on the case has already called has he ill have to check the machine wills been pretty out of it high fever not like him at all but theres stuff going around the school choking protest from below caught our attention indy reared on his hind legs forelegs pumping air eyes bulging semisuspended with the leash pulling up on his throat andrea goods hand had drawn up on the cord she said oh no and relaxed her grip indy dropped down panting she kneeled im so sorry baby indy gave out one last yelp of protest and kissed her face unconditional faith and love maybe one day the vatican will start canonizing canines anyway said andrea good rising to her feet i said wed appreciate hearing from your husband hope he heals up quickly oh he will hes a tough guy chapter ella mancusis murder didnt make the six oclock news but it was the final segment at eleven pm complete with pompous baritone narration and closeups of a bloodsoaked knife blade taken from stock footage the tollfree tip line flashed for a second but that was enough when i called milo s office the next morning i got a brandnew message this is lieutenant sturgis if youre calling about the mancusi homicide please leave your name and phone number talk slowly and clearly thank you i phoned wilson good hoping a chat with his wife bed rest and civic duty might have loosened his tongue no one answered blanche was up for a walk and bounced along happily as we headed down the glen squirrels birds and cars amused her trees amused her rocks were hilarious a sinewy woman jogger paused to pet her thats the prettiest dog ive ever seen blanche agreed at one pm robin and i drove to sherman oaks and ate spaghetti at antonios afterward i asked if she could spare some time and we headed over to katrina shonskys address in van nuys bigbox complex on a treeless block the air smelled of construction dust though no projects were in sight all the charm of a heat rash robin said i can see why shed want to get away from this not that living in thirty rooms on twenty acres helps if youre lonely thinking of someone in particular she nodded hes coming to town on business in a week or so in between appointments he intends to drop by to visit my commission its not that big of a deal but if you could be there i wouldnt mind he was inappropriate no but when he talks to me he sounds so needy like he wants to get close know what i mean an agenda behind the commission maybe its silly she said conceited girl she smiled so youll be there she returned to her studio and i thought awhile about ella mancusi and kat shonsky could see no solid link beyond big black stolen cars i played with search engines pairing variants of homicide and luxury car when that came up empty i substituted murder still zero i began combining murder with specific automobile marques went through jaguar rollsroyce ferrari and bmw with no luck lamborghini and cadillac pulled up a pair of shootings one in la the other in new york two gangsta rappers gunned down leaving latenight recording sessions one alone in his murci√©lago the other caravanning with an entourage in a trickedout escalade officially both cases were unsolved but everyone in the hiphop world knew whodunit bentley and aston martin came up empty mercedes elicited nothing about ella mancusi probably because of the lack of media coverage and that made me question the value of the search benz produced photos of hitler in both of his massive ks and a rant from a qatarbased blogger who believed der fuhrer had been a misunderstood cool guy everyone thinks is a murder i typed in lincoln not expecting much so much for my powers of prediction double homicide nine years ago in ojo negro a struggling agricultural hamlet north and inland of santa barbara the case had been logged on darkvisionsnet a borderlineliterate web site that delighted in listing gruesome unsolved killings and posted crude cartoons and grainy photos cribbed from truecrime books the facts as recounted by the sites soal author and webmaster dv zapper were spare and brutal leonora bright owner of the only beauty parlor in ojo negro and vicki tranh her resident manicurist had been murdered sometime after closing the shop their bodies found the following morning multipally stabbed and maybe disamenbered a black lincoln town car had been parked near the shop just before dusk a tall man in a floorlength canvas duster and tengallon hat had been seen earlier in the day exiting the car walking past the salon driving off the car was later identified as a rental stolen from a hotel parking lot in santa barbara cowboys were no novelty in ojo negro several nearby cattle ranches struggled against big agribusiness but the strangers swagger and the costumelike getup attracted glances pale rider the site tagged him and in wilde west days the detroit beast could probably a been a coleblack stalleon the morning after the sighting a parcelservice driver delivering nail polish and other cosmetic items made a stomach chorning discovery what i wonder mused dv zapper is was leona was marriedand maybe vicki also and if yeah why didnt there husbands go looking for them the hole time i ran a search using the victims names only one story printed in the santa barbara express a week after the murder two new facts the car had been stolen at the wharf inn and sheriff wendell salmey is currently talking to santa barbara detectives googling salmey evoked zero hits and the computers suggestion that i really meant wendell salmon just to be safe i said i did and got connected to the web site of a washington state fish and game booklet for children i printed the newspaper text returned to darkvisions clicked the bloody knife contact icon and inquired if anything new had come up on the case within seconds i had a reply hey alex jason blasco here aka dv zapper aka the mannnn no there is shit the cops dont wanna talk maybe its prejustice or something tranh was veetnamise you know if you hear something you can post with me googling jason blasco brought

better with good i described my meeting with andrea and indy he said gets rattled and nearly strangles the dog interesting i thought so so now we have to look at respectable mr good more closely he

pursue mr good once i make some headway on mancusi want me to go back to goods house tonight no big game coming up guys not going anywhere let him simmer for a while even if i wanted to bug him my nights spoken for one of my rookies was pulled off surveillance ill be the one eyeballing tony mancusi in an hour time for strong coffee strong and bitter like moi talk to you tomorrow alex one more thing is this gonna make me smile or cringe could go either way i told him about the ojo negro murders and the darkvisions web site he said fourteenyearold gore freak and a child shall lead maybe this child led us to something serious stolen black luxury wheels lifted from a rental lot a suspect in cowboy gear which is all anyone noticed about him dusting your hair with white powder wearing a garish plaid cap and shuffling would accomplish the same thing so would driving a flashy car for that matter costumes he said art of the misdirect ojo negro huh never heard of the place nine years ago talk about your extended run you know what im thinking if its connected there could be more in between no other blackcar murders came up but ellas not logged in so the webs far from perfect true im not sure what this does for my mood okay first things first gotta pack my mule get over to eleven stock up on grub and caffeine you up for some bucolic travel with time and mileage reimbursed as granted by the supreme being god wants to pay me the chief he said same difference howd your meeting go steely eyes firm grip he pumped me for progress pretended not to be pissed when i told him there was none but that irish face of his gets all rosy around the edges then out of the blue he asks me if youre consulting to any of it i say all of it when youve got time he says what does that mean i say given what the department pays youve got other fish to fry he goes real rosy embarks on a tirade about how the departments stuck somewhere between mesozoic and jurassic its time to modernize we need serious psychological input not whoreshrinks out to stigmatize officers i try to get a word in edgewise about the financial end but when he gets like that theres no interrupting so basically the meeting ended up being about you gee i said better soak my head in ice before it swells out of control for that all you need is to see the salary scale he proposed thirty percent additional allowance for gas and mileage but the hourlys still penury im supposed to set up a billing account youre supposed to keep meticulous records neither of which will be done because weve got real work but can you see clear to hit the road anyway hmm i said thanks and dont forget to eat thirty percent more gets you to prices twinkies and flavostraws it is there you go he said brain food chapter the santa ynez valley lolls between two mountain ranges soaking up sun and grace blessed with shirtsleeve temperatures and vinecoated slopes the regions been mistaken for eden where grapes dont grow apples flourish hills are softfocus and gentle and so is the ocean breeze that tempers the morning tourists flock to the valley for wine food antiques horses and fantasies of what could be if only most of the towns that dot the region solvang buellton ballard los olivos flourish under the attention then theres ojo negro named after a raggededged black eye of abandoned lime quarry set on an inhospitable triangle of aquiferneglected dirt just south of where the aims for los alamos ojo negro once served as a highway rest stop prosperity had its drawbacks pedestrians pulverized by semis the kind of mischief inspired by transience but people made a living when the highway was rerouted a few miles north ojo negro died so had wendell salmey the sheriff whod investigated the brighttranh murders nine years ago milo had found out by checking a law enforcement database hed also set up an eleven am appointment for me with george cardenas the new sheriff dont expect too much alex guys been on the job eighteen months if you can nose around great maybe youll find some lonely soul who craves conversation ojo negro didnt show up on any of my road maps so i turned to an online service the route summary warned of an unmarked exit miles past baca station road at ten pm milo called again sitting in his car three hours into surveillance watching nothing happen at tony mancusis apartment i said craving conversation craving my own pulse i just got hold of the santa barbara sheriffs detective who worked brighttranh with salmey he told me the case was an unclosable whodunit from day one but hes retired and bored so hell do you a favor and meet with you donald bragen lives in buellton used to be a sergeant sounds like a guy who still digs the title hes flying up this afternoon to seattle catching a puddlejumper to alaska for a fishing trip if you get to santa barbara by nine hell have breakfast with you at moby dick on stearns wharf ill bring my harpoon ciao back to my red bull and burrito you and tony dig the same cuisine not only that the same greasy spoon he said empathy cultured palates i set out the following morning at seven am endured the commuter crush from encino to thousand oaks got a little careless with speed limits when i cleared camarillo and was nearing santa barbara by eight forty a few miles before the cabrillo exit milo phoned to let me know donald bragen had caught an earlier flight and canceled breakfast i said no desire to talk about old failures or the salmon decided to show up early selfdeluded bastards the fish leaping upstream as if someones gonna be impressed now i was thirty miles beyond the beach towns city limits past where the hooks inland and north and any notion of blue water vanishes the baca station road exit wasnt much of anything the unmarked turnoff was closer to six miles up a bloodhound couldve missed it bumping along a carelessly maintained road i sped through a cottonwood grove that ended as abruptly as a hollywood marriage the view on both sides was strawcolored waisthigh wild grass and a scattering of gray twisted tree trunks to the north the santa ynez range showed a bit of skin but kept its distance like an ambivalent starlet the old lime pit came into view and i slowed to have a look chain link hung with warped panels of corrugated plastic concealed most of the excavation but through gaps in the plastic i could see a dark maw skullandcrossbones warning signs established a friendly ambience as i started to drive away movement caught my eye a mangy coyote slinked off into the grass ruffling the blades then disappearing it took a few cottonwood clumps and a lot more nothing before the grass gave way to an unattended junkyard and a birdspecked green sign proclaiming ojo negro to be alt ft pop half a mile later i spotted a thin blackhaired woman walking along the side of the road carrying a large metal cage using both hands to lug and keeping her back to me the wrong way to do it the sound of my engine made her turn but she kept going toward an old brown jeep parked ten yards up i rolled to a stop and lowered the passenger window she turned sharply held the cage in front of her springlatched animal trap heavy enough to drag at her shoulders brown stains coated the bottom grid you need something early twenties latina wearing a white western shirt jeans boots thick shiny hair was tied back tight from a wide smooth brow she had goldbrown eyes a strong nose thin lips exceptionally pretty woman all angles like a raptor im looking for sheriff cardenas the trap lowered a bit just keep going hes in town how fars town right around the first turn thanks are you that doctor from la alex delaware she said hes expecting you you work for him she smiled im his sister ricki i held out my hand you dont want to touch me after i touched this whatd you catch another cayote one of the senior citizens george looks after has them messing with her garbage but she still wont get cans that shut tight shes eightynine so when she hears noise or finds scat she calls george its animal regs job but try getting them out here you volunteer im visiting for a week nothing much else to do she hefted the trap it was a little baby cayote real scared made pathetic noises i just saw a larger one near the lime pit theyre all over the place we get em in la i said clever little rascals not so clever they wont walk into a trap full of cat food george gets everything here bobcats raccoons rattlesnakes hes had reports of mountain lions but hasnt seen one yet anyway i need to clean up george is in his office you can follow me stashing the trap in the jeep she drove off the turn was half a mile up rounding it revealed a main drag named ojo negro avenue fishboned by diagonal parking spaces four vehicles for two dozen slots three pickups and a white bronco with a cherry on top ricki pointed to the left and kept driving the road swooped upward toward a hill of dirt and a couple of struggling sycamores i pulled in next to the bronco the sidewalks were cracked and sunken weeds taking advantage of loose seams most of the storefronts were dark some were boarded the active businesses were a white cinderblock cube painted with ojo negro sheriff in block lettering that tried too hard a parrotgreen stucco bar tagged the limelite a drygoodsgrocery store doing additional duty as an insurance broker and a us post office a beauty salonbarbershop with faded headshots in the window and the on feed bin graced by a support our troops banner the weekly specials at the bin were oats and hay and live breeder rabbits from belgium europe in the sheriffs office a young completely bald man in khakis sat at a pc keyboard behind him was a oneroom jail as clean as his head the walls were papered with the usual wanted posters bulletins and safety pitches cinderblock made an inhospitable bed for tape and some of the papers had curled loose dr delaware george cardenas morning sheriff this sibling shook heartily and smiled without reservation his skin was clear like his sisters his eyes the same goldbrown but his face was round and soft with none of that falconalertness babyface the lack of head hair did little to age him coffee black thanks cardenas poured both of us styrofoam cups dosed his with coffeemate and motioned me to sit youre a little early my previous appointment canceled detective bragen changed his mind huh you know him talked to him for the first time this morning i figured he might do that whys that talking about the case made him kind of annoyed he called it a loser from the gitgo like he didnt want to churn it up beside his computer was a short stack of paper he peeled off the top sheet and handed it over sheriff wendell salmeys summary of the brighttranh murders i learned a few facts dv zapper hadnt reported the name of leonora brights salon had been stylish lady shed been thirtythree at the time of her death vicki tranh a recent arrival from anaheim had been only nineteen no disruption of the store other than two dead bodies and lots of blood both women were left with jewelry on their persons and a days worth of cash remained in the register ruling out robbery salmeys spelling was better than the kids but not by much george cardenas said thats all there is he brushed imaginary dust from his trousers when i took the job all of sheriff salmeys files were in boxes in a storage facility in los alamos i started going through them trying to get a feel for the town mostly he dealt with small stuff apples stripped from a tree lost dog once in a while a domestic he was in favor of diplomacy rather than enforcement going easy on the locals cardenass thumb hooked at the jail cell folks tell me about the only time that got used was if a transient needed to sleep off a drunk sheriffs wife died eleven years ago then his son a year after traffic accident on the near buellton sheriff pretty much curled up after that ten years ago is right before the murders i said youre thinking he wasnt in high gear cardenas sat back and crossed his legs i dont want to talk ill of the dead everyone says sheriff was a great guy but ojo negro since the highway moved is pretty much an oil painting i dont mind but its not for everyone you like the quiet sometimes i do get a little antsy and call my sister ask her to drop in for a spell were twins shes a nurse at cottage hospital in sb gets good vacation time but mostly im working so the quiets perfect working on cases he eyed his computer this is gonna sound stupid but i write or at least try to fiction averting his face he talked to a fire alert poster started with short stories then i read in some writers magazine that theres no market for them so im trying a novel havent started yet still working on finding what they call my point of view police novel depends what comes out once i get the story set in my head he said i was a double major at u new mexico english and criminal justice couldnt figure out what i liked more so i decided to get some police experience maybe id have something to say in a book did a couple years with the state police then ojo negro came up they hadnt had a sheriff in five years got a twoyear state grant to fund one my sister and her kids arent too far and shes divorced and her ex is out of the picture i figured maybe i could be a good influence shrug seemed like a good opportunity ive talked to a couple of detectives at santa fe pd steve katz and darrell two moons know em by sight but never worked with em mostly i was in albuquerque doing gang suppression that got me close to a couple of homicides i watched the pros learned its not my cup of tea unfortunately im not going to be able to help you much on this one that one sheets all i found is there anyone i could speak to who was here nine years ago just about everyone still living in ojo negro was here nine years ago most of my people are seniors who dont want to or cant afford to leave the grocery store brews fresh soup when theres enough demand and the big day is when the social security checks come in anyone youd recommend to start with his legs uncrossed lieutenant sturgis really thinks this could be related to an la case hard to say the main link is a stolen black car mercedes and bentley yeah he told me the original gta filing on the lincoln is under santa barbaras jurisdiction cause the car was taken there i checked and its archived all i could find is a basic theftrecovery report by the time the tags were linked to that clint eastwoodtype loiterer the vehicle had been cleaned and rerented had over a hundred new miles on it no probable cause to examine it so that was that in terms of people who might remember i asked around and sure anyone with a working memory recalls the case this was the first homicide in forty years but no one has any details about the loiterer beyond tall white male long coat cowboy hat and i cant find anyone who actually saw him mysterious stranger we dont get too many visitors and i doubt nine years ago was any different cause thats still after the highway reroute theres nothing really connecting this individual to the crime other than his hanging around and no one knowing him the coat and the hat couldve been a disguise i said i guess any way he couldve been a local no way doctor this is a real small town he sipped his coffee hate to say it but the whole thing sounds pretty frozen to me maybe ill make up an ending and put it in my book beats reality i said he tapped his keyboard what you do sounds interesting maybe i could pick your brain sometime sure i noticed a salon on this side of the street was that originally leonora brights place nope cozy coiffure replaced something else restaurant i think the ramirez family runs that place estella and ramon no kids they moved here from ventura three years after leonora got murdered took that long for the town to get anyone running ads in other towns papers before that folks had to drive to los alamos to get trimmed the crime scene was the last store as you leave town want to have a look i could use a stretch we left the office and crossed the street i asked him about ojo negro local government he said no mayor no city council we just rely on the county basically our issues are county issues were kind of a stepchild to los alamos or anyone else wholl have us how many residents sign says a thousand but its much less id guess two hundred tops the way were going soon therell be nothing left okay here we are hed stopped in front of one of the boarded storefronts original pink stucco peeked through the flaking cocoabrown repaint patchy and florid like a skin disease who owns it condemned by the county county never got around to auctioning it no one seems to want it a key lock slotted the doorknob cardenas turned the knob and the door swung open i said its never locked sure it is he said but its not much of a lock i got it open this morning with a nail file go ahead in what remained of stylish lady was vacant space walled in warped panels of fake rosewood tongueandgroove darkened by the plywood window and filthy oilcloth shades concealing a high rear window cardenas stayed in front propping the door open with his body otherwise it shuts and youre in a cave i thanked him and explored below the high window the back door was hollow and flimsy my footsteps were soft pads concrete floors created a great sound baffle i thought of two woman savaged their cries unheard in bad movies detective savants learn volumes revisiting longdormant crime scenes this was dim dead space and i wasnt producing a single syllable where does the back door lead kind of an alley go look behind the shop was a ribbon of rocky dirt that paralleled ojo negro avenue barely wide enough for one car dead end to the south exit to the north i went back inside and returned to cardenas the assumption was that leonora had closed for the day was cleaning up makes sense he said with the town being so quiet shed have no reason to lock up until she left people still dont lock up doctor last year right after i got here a bobcat waltzed right into mrs wembleys house managed to get in her fridge and ate a whole bunch of tuna salad shes eightynine try changing her she the lady with the coyote how do you know about that met your sister driving in shed just released a coyote trapped on an eightynineyearold womans property whered ricki release the darn thing couple of miles out of town meaning itll come right back he shrugged up to me id shoot it rickis one of those animal rights activists yeah thats mrs wembley critters like her cause shes always got open food around is she one of the people you talked to this morning nope she was napping on her porch when i came by to get the trap and that woman can sleep we can go over to her place if you like ladys got opinions on just about everything my kind of gal my ex was like that he said first you think its challenging then you get tired of being challenged i laughed he said ricki and i got divorced three months apart our parents split up when we were nine and now our younger brothers making sounds like hes about had it guess marryings not our talent if theres nothing else im gonna close up doctor we got into his bronco he uturned and headed up the road his sister had taken past the towns center we came to a scatter of residences mostly prefabs and trailers set on blocks no one in sight but cardenas drove slowly looking everywhere the way cops do so he said any ideas from seeing the scene just how easy it wouldve been especially after dark how so the killer couldve come in through either door and gone out the back anyone develop a theory about who the main target was you mean bright versus tranh not that i heard ive been assuming it was bright because the stranger was white not asian and most nuts kill within their race but maybe thats limited thinking any idea why vicki moved here he smiled you mean of all the godforsaken places howd she find ojo negro i couldnt tell you we do get immigrants from time to time mostly spanish with all the surrounding ranches and vineyards its kind of perfect for someone who wants to work hard and doesnt want to be looked at too closely by who the ins for one take the ramirezes when they got here they barely spoke english but is anyone checking their el salvador visas or whichever they cut hair real well everyones happy theyre here cupping smooth bronze cranial skin not that im an expert he turned the wheel easily drove up a packedearth driveway pointed to a doublewide set well back from the road and preceded by an acre of weeds this is mrs wembleys place and there she is looking brighteyed and bushytailed chapter the trailer was shaded by an aluminum awning as we rolled forward a rotund pink form in an armchair looked up at ten feet away a mouth opened in a strawberrypudding face and a magazine waved put some speed on george youre the law no ones going to cite you cardenas said dont want to churn up your dirt mrs wembley churn away she said maybe somethingll grow we parked made our way through dead brush mrs wembley remained in her chair a pink las vegas fun fun fun sweatshirt matched her complexion gray sweatpants strained to package her thighs her feet dangled an inch above the porch boards the rest of her body overflowed the confines of the chair as cardenas began the introductions she broke in flashing a denture grin im mavis missus was my motherinlaw and we dont want to remember her with anything but unpleasantness pudgy fingers gripped mine and squeezed hard she said youre a cute one thank you maam george is cute too thats why i make sure critters visit so i get to see my knight in khaki armor this time you sent your sister george is it my breath ricki had some time just kidding galahad so serious so tell me that cayote was something huh vicious teeth whered she let it go far enough i think she resents me for calling you all the time she smoothed pleated white hair tweaked a bulbous nose her cheeks glowed smooth as a childs fats a great wrinkle filler cardenas said of course she doesnt mavis wembley said she most certainly does and massaged an arm of her throne the chair was slipcovered in blueandwhite duck cloth like something from a hamptons pictorial everything else on the porch was tubular aluminum and plastic straps new upholstery said cardenas mavis wembley slapped her magazine against a dimpled knee like it very pretty pottery barn george love those catalogs the whole world opens up to you especially suited for living in a metropolis like this one another slap of the magazine the new yorker cardenas said didnt know you subscribe i dont she said they sent me one of those special offers four free months and then you can cancel no charge i figured to cancel but now im not sure they tend to go on too long dont you be like that when you write your book george the key is to communicate not to pontificate but they do have some interesting tidbits this one has a story about a new york jew who sews fur coats for those negro rappers all those agitators screaming about cruelty to critters but this jew keeps making ermine sweatshirts and the like a man with backbone cardenas said keep leaving food out mavis and we can send him a bunch of skins nice little cayote coat for the rappers she cackled wouldnt that be cute whos your cute friend another policeman or another writer hes a psychologist mavis she gazed up at me ive known some people who could use one of those as in motherinlaws what brings you here im looking into the murders of leonora bright and vicki tranh well you came to the right place because i know who did it cardenas hitched his trousers his holstered gun wobbled really really george and i told that to wendell salmey right in the beginning not that he did a darn thing about it to me chronic depression that one and lazier than a welfare cheat always in a low mood walking with his eyes down like anything worth discovering was on the ground she fanned herself with the magazine after that son of his got drunk and smashed himself up on the highway he got even worse just sat around all day doing nothing before i got married i did some teaching and wendell was one of my students one of those whod rather coast than drive only reason he took the sheriff job was he figured thered be nothing to do no offense george more denture display one advantage to being ninety is you say what you want and get away with it didnt know you had a birthday mavis so im pushing it a little the big days next month on the sixteenth in case you intend to send me flowers george wendell salmey died young bleeding ulcer at fiftynine by the way whats a psychologist got to do with leonora and the oriental girl their murders might be related to a current case in la doesnt answer my question i sometimes consult to the police one of those mind readers like on tv not really im kidding i know what a psychologist does geez everyone in this generations so doggone serious so he killed someone else huh who leonoras brother half brother thats who killed her and the nail girl george would you be real nice and get me a fresca and a slice of american cheese from the kitchen make it two slices got the packet laid out on the counter along with a cute little cutting tool from the sharper image cardenas went to fill the order i pulled up a chair mavis wembley nibbled her cheese and swigged from the can of soda handing the empty to cardenas she wiped her mouth and looked out at her weedy plot with satisfaction i know the brother did it because leonora confided in me a few weeks before that she was deathly afraid of him they had different mothers but the same father and it was the father who had money and he died a few months before she confided in me that she was scared i said worried about an inheritance conflict not worried scared thats the word she used whats the brothers name said cardenas dont know she never mentioned it always referred to him as my half brother emphasis on half making it clear there was no closeness there i said howd the topic come up she was colorrinsing me and kept dropping stuff real butterfingered which wasnt like leonora shed always been a real coordinated girl magic hands i used to call her sometimes shed toss in a neckandscalp massage and that was better than anyway when she moved here from frisco all the gals were happy because of her skills before that we had sarah burkhardt who grew up here borderline retarded if you ask me taught herself from books about as stylish as roadkill we put up with her because she was all we had thank god she married a truck driver and moved away and we got leonora who learned her trade in frisco from a top homosexual stylist magic hands i said but not that day fumbly fingers i asked her what was wrong she said nothing i said come on dont be holding back theres no one else here which there wasnt just me and leonora in the salon she was good but there wasnt that much call for her services our local females believing they could do just as well with a box of toni if you saw them youd find that laughable she asked cardenas for another soda when he returned to the house she said well wait for george so i dont have to repeat myself sure i appreciate this so you think its a good clue the brother best weve got so far cardenas came back and popped the top thank you george back to leonora that day i could tell she really wanted to talk so i pushed her until she did she said her father had left a sizable estate her mother was already dead and her stepmother was sick so the money was going to be split two ways between her and her half brother which was fine with her there was enough for everyone but she knew he wouldnt be satisfied with just half i said what hes a selfish type thats when she broke down and cried said oh mavis if you only knew he comes across the nicest person always wanting to do favors for people feeds the homeless smiles at little kids and gives em candy but its a fa√ßade down deep its all about him always was i just know hes going to cause me serious troubles over that money and it scares me she sipped soda dribbled onto her chin and she wiped it quickly i said what kind of serious troubles she said i dont know thats what scares me you dont know what hes capable of i told her if she was scared to call the police she said theyd laugh at her because she had no evidence just feelings i said at least talk to a lawyer you pay them upfront they wont laugh but it was like she wasnt hearing me just kept going on about how this half brother was going to start troubles no one knew what he was really like finally i said if youre going to accuse at least tell me what you mean she said you dont want to know mavis i said if i didnt i wouldnt ask she handed cardenas the second soda can now im full you can spill that out george or finish it yourself merriment tugged at her eyes dont worry i dont have cooties cardenas said im not leaving again mavis this storys too good its not a story george its a factual account even better its going to get way better once i tell you what she said she said he taught himself to pick locks she just knew it was to break in somewhere top of that he tortured and killed animals first bugs then little critters then whoknowswhat had been doing that kind of nastiness since he was little leonora loved animals had two little bichon freezes or whatever you call them would do anything for those dogs after she was killed they disappeared so you tell me i said did she keep them in the shop with her sometimes she brought them sometimes she left them at home but the point is no one saw them again i brought that up with wendell when it was clear he wasnt taking me seriously thats what i mean by lazy woman gets butchered up and shes got dogs and theyre not in the house wouldnt that make you curious george absolutely wendell lacked a shred of curiosity depression does that right doctor i nodded she said i know curiosity can kill cats maybe even dogs but satisfaction can also bring em all back wendell just didnt care and neither did that santa barbara detective they sent down donald bragen i said him she said all macho like broderick crawford on highway patrol before both your times yes maam thank you maam writing everything down in a little notebook but broderick listened bragen was an idiot didnt have time for anyone you tell me a prime suspect with a money motive who tortures animals and two dogs go missing what would you think what indeed i said mavis wembley placed a hand on my knee i like your style cardenas and i stayed with her for another half an hour and i did most of the talking trying to tease out additional details about leonora brights dreaded half brother what i got was thin soup either older or younger than leonora and probably from san francisco because thats where leonora hailed from and she never said he didnt i thanked her and got up to leave she said nice meeting you and took hold of cardenass sleeve george last night i heard raccoons scratching out back near the garbage lets set out some traps for them as well shes something no said cardenas backing out the dirt driveway shuffling cards is her idea of aerobics but shes never sick claims her mother lived to a hundred and four good dna i said the rest of us jog and pretend youve got that right think the brother angles worth pursuing its all weve got what she said about wendell does conform to what other people have told me didnt want to get into that out of respect for the dead no reason hes not the issue so where are you heading now back to la unless youve got a suggestion sorry no want me to do anything if youve got the time to run background on leonoras addresses in san francisco that would be great sure he said i was also thinking we should try to find the fathers death certificate see if the brothers name appears anywhere leonora being scared of an inheritance mess right before she died probably narrows the time frame on his passing good point an obituary search might be the easiest way to go was bright her maiden name think so he sat up straighter and pressed down on the gas this is different how so im working chapter i stopped in santa barbara for a late lunch on stearns wharf the site of my aborted meeting with donald bragen the tourist stream was skimpy but enthusiasticsmiling gorging people believing in immortality ducks and seagulls followed the food stream content with the leavings out in the harbor big gray pelicans floated biding their time as they scanned the surface for prey their smaller brown cousins swooped and dove and sometimes came up with wriggle all kinds of ways to hunt i finished and continued up the pier passing the breakfast place where bragen said hed meet me maybe hed paid closer attention to mavis wembleys lead than she believed but had come up empty or she was right and he had ignored her either way flashbacks wouldnt be as much fun as fishing leaning over the railing and sucking in salt air i phoned milos cell rick answered hey alex his phone ran out of charge so we exchanged he told me if you called to tell you hell be tied up until ten or so maybe later any idea where out on the job is all he said i had the day off so we managed to schedule lunch soon as we ordered he got a call and left something about finding a car made him grumpy missing a meal does that he doggiebagged no one answered ricks cell milo sometimes switches off when hes concentrating i got back on the highway tried a few miles later this time his bellow rattled the little bones in my ear found kat shonskys goddamn mustang yet you are not happy guess where the hell its been all this time department contract tow yard called in as an abandoned vehicle at five am the same damn night she disappeared found midway up the pass just like you guessed i said any idea who called it in no record he growled they treated it as a routine nuisance call sent a tow driver genius shows up theres no reg or insurance in the car and the plates are gone he hooks it up anyway and dumps it in the yard where its been sitting what about the vin i said they got around to logging the vin a few days later filed and forgot all this time im checking bulletins wasting my time on the phone and the damn things in plain sight blocks from my office accumulating birdshit and storage fees if i hadnt been nagging every yard the department does business with it probably wouldve ended up at a police auction as is i just spent an hour untangling the paperwork to get it to the motor lab eyeballed it first no obvious blood or sign of mischief and heres another good guess for you professor gas tank was bonedry talk about wrong place wrong time or someone siphoned it in the club parking lot and followed her until she shut down there you go he said thats why were buddies i have a suspicious mind you know how to think like a really evil person lets see what the motorheads turn up but with the tow driver and lordknowswhoelse pawing it and a suspect careful enough to strip id im not expecting much im on my way back to where it was found right now after that ill be driving the hillside roads again narrowing it down to the immediate vicinity if i can get k to help well do a sniffathon tomorrow so whats up in toonerville i told him about mavis wembleys tip scary brother he said a lock picker couldve fooled with the chain at the rental lot freed the mercedes toss in mancusi and weve got two crimes featuring stolen black luxury cars bloody knifework and a possible inheritance motive unfortunately tonys a homebody leading us nowhere and the tips have dried up in terms of his being kinky i wouldnt be surprised if that was lamp guy hochswelder or one of the other loving relatives finking on him for being gay just in case we didnt get it the first time with the mustang showing up im gonna concentrate on shonsky as a possible corollary homicide and that gives me cause for a warrant on her apartment judge feldmans at a fundraiser said if i meet him at his house at ten hell sign the papers hopefully kats mother didnt straighten up too much speaking of which if i have time i am gonna ask her for that cheek scrape cause if the chief meant what he said hell get the mitochondrial prioritized but even if we get a match to the stain it just tells us what we know anyway kats dead i wouldnt sell her life insurance lord im busy not the time to remind him of his lament last week if the chief meant what he said maybe you can get more help watching tony hard to see tony having anything to do with shonsky i said the link doesnt need to be direct if tony contracted his mothers murder someone couldve hired the same killer to do kat and the women in ojo negro traveling pro with a taste for stolen wheels he said what kind of money motive could there be for kat she wasnt exactly an heiress from what weve heard she could be abrasive maybe that one was personal she blew the wrong guy off so he pays for an elaborate scheme to do her or she blew the killer himself off i said clive picked her up in a bar and theres no reason to believe he was the only one even really bad guys have feelings everyone has feelings depends what you do with them bigrig mishaps and the usual cal trans idiocy stretched the drive back to la and it was dark when i got home i drank chivas out by the pond put blanche in my lap and tossed food to the fish she wanted to watch them eat so we kneeled by the rock rim the babies were almost big enough to swallow the pellets kept worrying the bobbing circles until they disintegrated the adults indulged their attempts and managed not to pull a jonah robin came out and joined us chopsticking leftovers and forgoing her glass of wine because she was thinking of working some more quieter than usual i said mr dotcom call again she shook her head theres a wolfnote somewhere on the mandolin fretboard if i dont fix it i wont sleep my soul mate i kissed her walked her to her studio carried a now sleeping blanche back to the house my email was the usual blather and one message that interested me sent a few minutes ago dr delaware found leonora brights brothers name in the obit on their father nothing criminal on him so far and it was too late to access sf property rolls to see if he owns a house there see what i can do tomorrow george cardenas i sent back a thanks and downloaded the email attachment san francisco chronicle obituary section someone important enough to merit a piece with a byline the late dr whittaker bright a new york native trained at cornell and columbia had been a professor of engineering at uc berkeley with an expertise in transformers and a patent for a now obsolete switching device that had paid him royalties for over a decade death had come after a protracted illness widowed and remarried whit bright was survived by his second wife bonnie a daughter leonora of ojo negro and a son ansell of san francisco in lieu of flowers donations were to be sent to the american heart society what caught my eye was the date of death eight days before the butchery in ojo negro mavis wembleys story was looking better and better just as i prepared to run a search on ansell bright my phone rang doctor this is amber from your service i had a mr bragen calling from alaska he didnt want to hold said you can call him if you want didnt sound like he cared one way or the other bragens number had an prefix fishing up north but using a cell phone with a venturasanta barbara code a gruff voice said yeah sergeant bragen alex delaware the psychologist he said as if the title amused him an earlier flight came up weather changes are quick up here the connectors get iffy ive spent too many days in the airport waiting for storms to pass makes sense you want to know about bright and tranh theres not much to know big loser whodunit from day one and if there was anything forensically worthwhile the moron they hired as sheriff screwed it up we had one suspect but he didnt pan out whos that brights exhusband he said ironclad alibi and he passed a poly whyd you suspect him cause he was the ex but forget it its not him could i have his name just for the record jose something mexican probably illegal in those days we werent allowed to ask he worked at the feed store unloading hay and whatnot claimed he was a bigtime chef back in guadalajara or wherever but they all claim that immigrants if everyone was so better off why do they come here anyway hes not your guy that woulda been nice he and bright were married six months got divorced he moved to oxnard got a job cooking at one of the hotels which is where twenty people saw him during the entire time frame of the murders we also had witnesses eyeballing before and after at his apartment complex then at a bar that night dancing with his new girlfriend so no way i asked him to take a poly anyway he agreed passed with flying colors claimed he and leonora parted friendly had a christmas card from her to prove it also he seemed real broken up about her dying and for all i know bright wasnt even the target maybe tranh was not that i ever found anyone whod talk about her took the time to visit her family big clan down in anaheim everyone crying and weeping and lighting candles to buddha listening to them vicki was a nun had no enemies you had reason to doubt that no he said but im not a trusting guy by nature you get up there today sure did still a onehorse town maybe half a horse place that rinkydink youd think someone wouldve known something but all those hicks could say was how nice they both were harsh laughter nice people is the bane of a detectives existence while i was there i met a woman named mavis wembley oh that one said bragen old fatso stuck her nose into everything couldnt shut her up but she had nothing to say either you dont buy her story about leonoras brother yeah right you want to work that good luck pal cant believe shes still alive big as a cow like that alien in star wars jabba the whatever she used to summon me her word detective bragen may i summon you for a little talk youre working a case you cant close off anything so id get over to her place and shed sit in her chair and try to pump me for information but like i said youve got to follow up on everything so i talked to the brother he also had an alibi working some gay job were talking featherlight here even more emotional than jose castro thats what it was jose castro like fidel so much for ansell i said ansell thats his name according to the fathers obituary guy i spoke to called himself dale and thats what his mother called him too and id expect shed know shes the one i got his number from in the first place and dont waste your time with her she died a few months after leonora cancer the father was heart problems i think badluck family dale was taking care of her he was at her place when i called maybe dales his nickname i said whatever guy fluttered over the phone it was like talking to a girl this is not the caliber person who could overpower two healthy women and do what was done to them you want to lose your lunch get hold of those autopsy photos over the phone hed never met ansell dale bright in person had no inkling of the mans size and strength i said i see what you mean i put it all in the file doctor where is the file probably storage he said they moved everything a few years ago lots of stuff managed to fall off the truck not my problem shouldnt be yours either this is a dead one mavis wembley hadnt mentioned jose castro i found her number in my notes it was nearly ten pm i bet on her being a night owl she picked up on the first ring cutie have you solved anything far from it but i have learned that leonora was married to jose you talked to bragen right that fool fixed on jose even before setting eyes on him because youknowwhy why jose was a mexican there was lots of loose talk about it being a mexican murder all this gossip about drugs gangs any reason for that back then we were a downright racist town most of the people are mexican now so no one opens a mouth except some of the older cowboys when they come into town and have a few too many my second husband was half mexican and you shouldve seen the looks i got jose was a nice young fellow younger than leonora in his twenties handsome too you never thought he was responsible nicest young man youd ever meet doctor muscles out to here after they broke up leonora said she still liked him as a friend it just didnt work out as a marriage you want to know my opinion they were never more than friends the whole marriage was a putup so he could get immigration status leonora would do that for a friend thats the kind of person she was and jose did get his papers leonora told me she was all thrilled about it shortly after that they broke up and jose moved down south somewhere and it didnt seem to trouble her besides what motive would jose have to hurt her neither of them had any money to speak of unlike leonoras family who had plenty im telling you the brothers where to look bragen probably said i was a meddling old nut but anytime he wants to have an iq contest im ready i laughed she said you think im kidding chapter at noon the following day i met milo up in the hills above the sepulveda pass vacant lot a mile or so above the spot where kat shonskys car had been found two k handlers worked the brush between a pair of sleek contemporary stilthouses running a chocolate lab and a border collie sharpeyed dogs beautifully groomed both with a thing for dead flesh milo said in answer to your unasked question this is one of the few open unfenced spots around here which means nothing she could be in alhambra but early this morning we gave a pack of tracking dogs a whiff of her clothing and ran them all over the neighborhood zilch for the first hour then one of them raced up here and got somewhat excited somewhat he changed his mind and got distracted happens more than you think still better to be careful so now its the cadaver mutts who owns the property its shared by the two neighboring houses couple of sisters married to lawyers theyve got plans to build a joint swimming pool currently cruising together in south america for the last two weeks theres your happy family i said not so happy if lassie and rin tin tin find something with maggots in it his skin sagged and his clothes were distorted beyond wrinkles as if hed wrestled with an intruder i said allnighter comatime watching tonys place went over to kats apartment at seven am place looked like martha stewart had just filmed there moms artful hand i called for techies anyway no evidence of any violence or struggle but one thing mom didnt find was a baggie of weed at the bottom of a tampon box no credit card receipts which would fit with ol monica cutting her off no phone records or tax returns either but kat didnt keep paper around period not a single book in the place and the only magazines were old copies of us and elle she did hold on to a few travel souvenirs cheap crap from hawaii tahiti cozumel snapshots too her in bikinis toobig smiles no men friends like she got someone to take her picture to prove she was happy sounds like a lonely girl he yawned anyway i got the blouse we returned to watching the dogs the retriever was circling the lot with the intensity of a sprinter training for the big race it stopped resumed circling the border collie had lost interest and its handler led it back to the k car dogs life said milo if nothing happens soon im on my way to the boutique where kat worked someones got to know something about her personal life i said ive been thinking about the ojo negro killings leonora bright was murdered only eight days after her father died her stepmother was terminally ill making the sibs heirs sooner rather than later a boilerplate will would split everything fiftyfifty with reversion to the survivor leonora was in her thirties so theres a good chance she never wrote a will of her own scary brother gets rid of her to make sure she never sees a lawyer its a motive and not that different from the one weve suggested for tony mancusi kill mom before she changes her will theres a specialty hit man out there fixing inheritance problems and both ansell and tony just happened to find him i said i know it sounds remote but think about stolen black cars and costumes theatrical traveling hit man cant dismiss it but before i get historical i need to focus on the here and now if we can find some kind of link between tony and ansell i might start breathing hard donald bragen thought ansell was incapable of that level of violence because he sounded effeminate over the phone and tony vamps okay a theatrically gay specialty hit man bragen look into ansell beyond his vocal qualities he didnt even know ansells real name because ansell called himself dale and alibied himself for the time of the murder working bragen accepted it oh lord sheriff cardenas said hed look into ansells background i ran a basic search last night got no hits on that name the dale brights i found were a fourteenyearold girl who plays field hockey at a prep school in florida a sixtyyearold female insurance agent in ohio and a nebraska churchman and farmer who wrote a book about wheat and died in my bets on the girl okay lets make sure weve buttoned down everything he stopped midsentence the retriever sat down stayed the head showed first kat shonsky had been buried three feet deep stripped of her clothing stretched out on her back with her legs slightly parted her skin was greenish gray marbled slipping loose from its skeletal underpinning whiteblond hair served as a nest for worms where putrefaction hadnt taken over black hyphens were evident probable stab wounds i stopped counting at twentythree in the grave was a purple silk scarf placed diagonally across the abdomen and upper thighs removing it revealed katrina shonskys drivers license wedged between her labia theres a statement for you said diana ponce the ci kneeling above the body milo said look what i did and i want the whole world to know it ponce bagged the license and called for a large envelope for the scarf while she waited she inspected katrina shonskys neck no obvious ligature marks but there wasnt much neck left and the final say would be the coroners placing the scarf back on the body she cupped the remains of the head gently in one hand and probed with the other theres bone breakage at the back milo want to feel it milo got down next to her and she guided his gloved hand oh yeah he said like cracked eggshell someone bopped her good said ponce maybe to knock her out before he cut her she looked up at the twin houses this close to private property youd want to keep things quiet milo stood you should be a detective diana she grinned according to the tube i already am the envelope arrived setting the head down with reverence ponce removed the scarf and unfurled it diaphonous thing it waved in the breeze louis vuitton label milo said i thought they did luggage they do everything lieutenant ponce admired the silk the breeze blew harder and a few granules of dirt slid off the garment and spattered the body ponce handed the scarf off and used tweezers to recover them milo said costs a fortune but it was left here perfect opening for one of those jokes cops and techs sometimes tell to buffer the horror this time no one did crypt attendants wrapped the body in plastic and took it away moments later diana ponce left and the criminalists got to work milo said time to get over to monica hedges you can meet me there if you want sure i followed him to wilshire turned left at warner he pulled over motioned me to do the same aborted mission no answer at the hedges not exactly the time to leave a message lets check out the place where kat worked youre a fashionable guy not really too bad he said i was hoping you could interpret la femme boutique was on san vicente west of barrington squeezed between a coffee emporium specializing in indonesian brew and a hair salon crowded with beautiful heads the shop was high narrow and white hung with vintage absinthe posters and floored in weathered winecolored marble the few pieces of furniture were heavy and victorian the clothes in the window frothy and fitted to malnourished mannequins no shoppers in sight milo and i passed through a narrow aisle walled by doublehigh racks some of the dresses and tops were marked sale which put them into three figures edith piaf on the stereo made in france on the labels designers id never heard of but that meant nothing he said i didnt look that closely at the stuff in kats pad but it wasnt like this she didnt have any scarves either hey hows it going addressing a hollowcheeked brunette in a black lace top sitting behind the sales counter drinking evian and reading instyle behind her was a high shelf of bath toys fruitshaped candles pastes and gels that wouldnt get past airport security she got up and glided around the counter head back hips leading like a runway model thirty give or take with deeply shadowed dark eyes makeup thick as cake frosting worked at masking a complexion not much better than milos the black top was tucked tight into cream calfskin jeans hey guys someone buying a guilt gift or are we talking birthday milo tugged his lapel to one side and revealed his shield police katrina shonskys body was just found a few miles away she was murdered hollow cheeks puffed eyelids vibrated omigod omigod kat she bent at the knees i caught her elbow walked her to a puce velvet divan milo fetched her water bottle and dribbled some between her lips she gulped started to hyperventilate i returned to the counter and got a shopping bag printed with the stores name by the time i got back she was breathing normally and talking to milo her name was amy koutsakas but she called herself amelie had been working with kat shonsky for just over a year at first she sang the dead womans praises we sat that out and let the shock wear off and soon she was confiding that she and kat hadnt been close not that im badmouthing her god forbid milo said you guys just didnt hit it off we never fought but to be honest lieutenant we had different professional views of what this job kat could be tactless with you or the customers both said amelie im not saying she went out of her way to be mean it just i dont know what im really saying sorry i cant believe this i said kat was sharptongued she was sometimes it was what she didnt say to the customers not good at stroking egos she sat up straight to be honest guys this business is all about fear most of our clientele is mature who else can afford the prices were talking about usedtobe size eights who are now fourteens when you get older your body changes i know because my mom was a dancer and that happened to her stroking her own flatplane abdomen milo said kat didnt understand that we get lots of women coming in for special occasions wanting to look really fabulous and ready to pay for it sometimes its a challenge but you need to work with the customer you examine her assets and liabilities without being obvious guide her toward stuff thatll minimize her issues if she tries on something and it turns out horrible you say something nice and ease her toward something else applied psychology said milo i was a psych major in college and believe me it helps i said kat didnt take that approach kat thought her job was to help carry garments to the dressing room and stand around examining her nails during the tryon shed never volunteer an opinion never even when the client was obviously needy crying out for validation i tried to tell her we were more than attendants her answer was these are grownups they can make their own choices but thats not fair people need support right even if something looked good kat would just stand there and say nothing she gave no guidance and that led to customers bringing a lot of her sales back returns come straight off the commission milo said do you guys split commission thats the way it used to be but i told the owners no way would i split with someone like kat they value me so they agreed and i ended up making around three times as much as kat is commission a big part of your salary seventy percent so kat wasnt exactly raking it in and boy did she complain about that constantly it made no sense all she had to do was be nice she bit her lip i know it sounds like im putting her down but thats the way it was thats why after she stopped coming in and didnt return calls the owners figured shed flaked out after three days they fired her who are the owners said milo mr and mrs leibowitz she said they made money in the florist business and retired it started as a hobby for laura mrs l theyd travel to paris each year and shed bring back great stuff that her friends adored we talking absentee owners for the most part im the manager and kat is was the assistant manager past tense made her flinch do you have any idea who did it not yet said milo thats why were here i cant imagine who would do something like that kat ever get into an altercation with a customer or anyone else no no our clientele is sophisticated nice women what about the men in kats life never met any of them she said but from what she said shed been through plenty of losers and was swearing off men anyone in particular uhuh we never got to the name level shed just make remarks she was a big one for remarks about men men her job life in general her mother she talked about her mother a lot said there was all kinds of pressure to conform and she hated it from what i could tell she had an unhappy childhood basically she struck me as an unhappy person thats probably why she drank on the job silence amelie sometimes shed come in with way too much mint on her breath a couple of times she forgot the mint and i smelled the alcohol i started keeping mouthwash for her partying hard i guess she said you know who can answer these questions better than me her friend beth she works at a jewelry store up the block shes the one who told kat about the job opening thanks for the tip said milo anything i can do to help she walked us to the door straightening garments along the way before milos hand touched the knob she said this is probably nothing but maybe there is something i should tell you about a customer we stopped its not really an altercation but im sure its nothing everythings helpful amelie okay about a month ago maybe five six weeks i was off for the morning and came in after lunch and found kat was in a real goofy mood all giggly which wasnt like her i said whats up and she said the most hilarious thing had happened a customer a man had just come in and started pawing through the sale items kat assumed just like i did with you guys that he was looking for a gift kat ignored him like she always does the guy kept examining the goods concentrating on the larger sizes after a while it made kat nervous and she finally went over and asked if he needed help what made her nervous being alone with him how long he was taking were not some huge department store how much time does it take to go through the merchandise and most guys have no patience at all theyre in and out or asking for help anyway this guy said he was fine and kat returned to the counter but something gave her a funny feeling and she checked him out again couldnt see him but heard him behind one of the double racks and she went over and peeked the guy had taken out a dress and was holding it up against his own body stroking it like fitting it on himself kat said she couldnt control herself she just broke up and the guy heard it and nearly fell over himself putting the dress back but instead of apologizing kat just stood there and instead of rushing out the guy turned and stared at her being blatant like he needed to show he wasnt ashamed kat told me that really pissed her off she wasnt going to take shit from a weirdo so she stared back i guess you could call that conflict sounds like an assertive weirdo said milo kat thought it was hilarious said amelie i was appalled everyones got their secrets why make them feel stupid then what happened the guy stared some more finally gave in and left quickly kat said she made sure to laugh some more so he could hear her as he slunk away its probably nothing but you asked about problems did kat describe this guy blackrimmed eyes rounded you think it could be him oh no what if he comes back im sure theres no connection amelie we just need to collect as many facts as possible that would really freak me out she said the thought of being here with youll be fine amelie did kat describe him no no she just told the story and laughed it kept her giggly the whole rest of the day chapter a jewelry store named cachet was visible at the end of the block milo said being a bigtime hoohah detective im willing to guess thats where beth holloway works but first blood sugar therapy i followed him into the coffee store the place was nearly empty but it took a while to get the attention of the ipodwearing kid hiding behind the espresso machine milo bought two frisbeesized bagels smeared with cr√®me fra√Æche filled a small paper cup with free water brought his bounty to a corner stool one bagel down he wiped his chin been a while since i worked a case with overtones years ago hed reported to a captain whod made sure to assign him every homicide with unconventional overtones that came through the division meaning anything but male on female the more lurid the better kat shonskys body bore the signs of a lust homicide blitzattack head wound overkill knifework sexual positioning the contemptuous placement of the drivers license but nothing suggested it was anything but male on female im not sure i see overtones big guy he smiled whats funny wherever it leads glitter and temptation filled the jewelry stores windows a spadefaced young man in a dark suit studied us before buzzing us in once we entered he kept his hands beneath the counter milo identified himself and asked for beth holloway and the guy relaxed thats beth eyeing a petite honey blonde showing a gray velvet tray of cocktail rings to a stooped whitehaired man around eighty beth holloway had large pale eyes flawless skin smooth bronze arms a minicollection of bangles circled delicate wrists she wore a clingy lowcut taupe dress enjoyed frequent bends that flashed a freckled wealth of cleavage the customers attention kept shifting between all that skin and the toys on the tray she said pretty gorgeous mr wein no the old man sighed this is always difficult beth touched his wrist you always know what to do mr wein if you say so he held up a platinumandsapphire piece what do you think perfect shell love it wein held the ring to the light and turned it would you like a loupe sir like i know what im looking at beth laughed take it from me mr wein these are really great stones and those are teeny baguettes not chips a few more turns okay this is fine great ill have it sized and ready for mrs wein in two days would you like me to deliver it to your house no not this time im going to give it to her at dinner beth clapped her hands so romantic shes a lucky woman mr wein depends what day you ask her he left and she turned to us smoothing her dress hi milo introduced himself and told her why we were there she froze burst into tears covered her face with one hand and pressed the other against the countertop the man in the dark suit took the tray of rings locked it up and looked on curiously milo said sorry to have to tell you beth holloway ran toward the rear of the store threw a door open and disappeared the darksuited man said were talking kat from la femme you know her wow he said milo repeated the question i went in there a couple of times maybe get my wife something kat waited on you she was there but she didnt do much said the man its her huh weird what is knowing someone who got killed what can you tell us about her nothing im just saying saying what the mans lips screwed up i said she wasnt a helpful salesperson yeah but it didnt bother me said the man i like to do my own thing with jewelry youve got to guide them but clothes its whatever works for you beth holloway reemerged wearing a chocolatebrown sweater over her dress her eyes were puffy her lips looked bruised what happened to kat she asked milo said we dont know much yet can you spare some time you bet whatever it takes to find the animal who did this any candidates come to mind the man in the dark suit had sidled closer beth holloway said i wish but no milo said lets take a walk when the three of us were outside he pointed to the coffee emporium beth holloway said id throw up lets just walk she took off arms swinging what i really need is a tenmile run milo said wed need the emt rescue van for me you should get into it its therapeutic kat into exercise not a lick and i tried she slowed down picked up speed again we hustled past storefronts dodged pedestrians beth holloway forged through the crowd like a woman with a plan milo let her dissipate energy for a block and a half anything you want to tell us before we start asking questions kat had a thing for losers but i cant imagine anyone that evil how about some names there was rory rory cline with a c works in the mailroom at the crp agency thinks hes going to be a bigshot agent must be forty but he tries to look younger kat met him at a club i dont know where she was attracted to him but he had no interest in sex just wanted to hold hands and listen to music that made her feel unattractive milo wrote down the name next next was michael what was his last name tapping her hair sorry its escaping me michael unlike rory he loved sex all the time kat said he was a stud but turned out he was married an accountant or something michael browning there you go did kat stop seeing him when she found out nope but she got bored with him and the sex all quantity no quality she said the third one was a real asshole some hick who worked on rollsroyces milo said clive hatfield her shoulders tightened you suspect him riana gave us his name so we went over to talk to him and no prince charming unfortunately hes got a tight alibi any others no she said rory michael and clive the loser brigade milo had her recount the last night of kat shonskys life she was forthcoming about her growing serious relationship with sean the surfboard sander its a real connection you know i mean im sorry kat had to drive home alone but thats not my fault right of course not she was pod did what happened to her relate to drunk driving or something doesnt seem that way thank god id feel terrible about that beth is there anyone besides rory cline and michael browning we should know about no one i can think of no one kat met at the club that night she didnt meet anyone that was what pod her we thought of inviting her but figured it would be uncomfortable she walked faster gritted her teeth cried silently beth did kat ever talk to you about problems with anyone just her mother they didnt get along what about people at work she hated her job thought the girl she worked with was a suckup that made me feel a little bad because i was the one who told her about it whatd she hate about the job lousy money boring you name it kat had a tough life her real dad died when she was young her mother was a slut had men coming and going all the time finally she found a rich guy howd kat get along with the rich guy she actually liked him better than her mother said he was more laidback didnt pressure her with her mother it was always criticism she sucked in breath took a long time to exhale kat was beautiful but didnt know it the truth is im realizing this now ive never seen her really happy howd she deal with her unhappiness what do you mean sometimes people escape oh she said her drinking yeah it could get out of hand but you just said dui had nothing to do with it it didnt so theres no one she had conflict with recently i cant think of anyone someone told us a strange story beth whats that he repeated the incident with the crossdresser she said oh that kat told you she thought it was hilarious a trace of a smile said beth had agreed she describe this guy omigod you think he could be were just collecting facts beth did she describe him just that he didnt look queery on the outside youd never know masculine i guess let me ask you something else beth would kat have been impressed by money isnt everyone how about a special attraction the pretty face went slack with confusion fancy houses expense accounts real nice cars any of that float her boat sure all of the above said beth holloway that just makes her normal chapter milo ran backgrounds on rory cline and michael browning cline was easy one motorist with that name in la county studio city apartment no criminal record wants or warrants elevenyearold audi sixteen michael brownings narrowing the search to the three who lived in the valley and crosschecking business listings turned up one accountant michael j browning office on lankershim near universal studios oneyearold saab another clean record a mailroom flunky and a number cruncher said milo no reason for either of them to have carboosting skills but lets talk to them anyway creative representation and promotion occupied a travertineandgreenglass fortress near the intersection of wilshire and santa monica inside was more of the same beige stone a mural of stiff people watching a movie dominated the threestory skylit lobby a milky skylight aimed for an indooroutdoor effect but missed mussolini loved travertine but got strung up before he could remodel rome a pair of male receptionists in gunmetal silk shirts hid themselves behind a high counter and whispered into tiny phones suspended from their ears a beefy black man in a bad suit stood to their side milo strode up to one of the grayshirts and held out his badge the security man smiled and remained in place the receptionist kept talking from the sound of it a personal chat milo waited slapped a hand on the counter the security guy smiled wider as the receptionist jumped hold on sudden smile as sincere as silicon are you here for a meeting were here to see rory cline who might that be he works in the mailroom the mailroom doesnt take calls its taking this one uhuhuh working hours are irrelevant call him grayshirt shrank back glanced at the security guard saw a broad back look i dont even know how to get anyone there milo said time to learn it took several calls delivered in a perplexed whisper and frantic repetition of the word police before grayshirt said hes on his way you can wait over there we hung by the brown chairs five minutes later an elevator slid open and a narrow roundshouldered darkhaired man strode toward us rory cline looked every minute of forty and then some with hollow cheeks and eyes to match his spiky do fit him like lipstick fits a goldfish his white shirt was wrinkled and limp as a used kleenex a skinny black tie dangled below the cinched belt line of gray pipestem trousers he pointed to the front doors hurried past us left the building we found him half a block down on linden drive hands jammed in his pockets pacing mr cline what are you doing to me now everyonell think im a felon milo said in your business maybe that could be careerenhancing clines eyes bugged funny funny funny i cant believe she sent you here i already gave you guys my version and they believed me that her story was total bullshit now youre back why because shes got beaucoup bucks thats the way you guys do it like that eddie murphy movie what im living a fucking beverly hills comedy herkyjerk movements ratatat speech constricted pupils she said milo her she whatever said rory cline let me cue you in the only reason shes pursuing this is she probably heard im due to move up and she wants to get in on the gravy train milo said congrats on the promotion yeah its happening or was going to until you guys showed up and maybe fucked everything up im being considered for an assistantship to ed lamoca get it bigtime guy as in said cline rattling off a list of movie stars everyone wants to work for him its taken me shitall years to get in position and now you show up and theyre going to think how could you do this just because those assholes tell you to theyre fucking lying the whole thing is a fucking putup the pace of his speech had ratcheted from frantic to nearly unintelligible i wondered if the building was vast enough to conceal a meth lab milo said who do you think called us mr cline who do i think them persian bitch and her fucking persian husband no matter how theyre spinning it she hit me fucked up my bumper fucked up my trunk fucked up a taillight i was in front she was behind me and theres no fucking way i rolled backward it wasnt even uphill i didnt call you guys because there were no injuries and she admitted it was her fault promised to pay asap then she goes home tells her rich fucking asshole rug merchant husband he starts spinning fine they wanna fight ill fight what i dont get is you wasting your time when i already gave a statement to her insurance and they said they believed me its obvious i didnt roll back into her the only reason i didnt have my own insurance was it lapsed after i moved here from icm and if you read the insurance reports youd know that he embarked on a tenstep march came back may i go back to work and try not to get fucked up milo said this isnt about your fenderbender then what im busy calm down sir dont tell me that you probably just ruined my life so dont stop you stop be quiet now something in milos voice killed the tirade cline wrung his hands lets start over what now oh man said cline i havent slept in i dont know then we have something in common mr cline im investigating a homicide homiwho someone got killed who kat shonsky clines posture loosened as if hed been shot up with valium youre kidding he smiled you think its funny no no its thats totally bizarre you really came at me from left fucking field who killed her thats what were trying to find out whats bizarre someone getting killed clines mouth got hard why are you talking to me about it were talking to everyone she dated count me out we never dated she picked me up in a club we had sex for a few months then we both realized we were faking and said why bother hard for a man to fake said milo youre being literal said cline dont tell me it hasnt happened to you im not talking losing it im talking being there without being there milo didnt answer fine said cline youre macho mellow can do it with a can of liver for me it got empty because she was never there we decided to be friends just hang out that didnt work either how come cause we didnt like each other cline drew back maybe realizing the implication listen the last time i saw her was maybe half a year ive had two girlfriends since then you want to talk to them be my guest theyll tell you im safe as milk cline fired off names milo wrote them down youre actually going to call them unreal fine do it why not could work for me with lori maybe shell get interested again why making me look dangerous and all that said cline being safe is my issue lori thought i was average to nothing mostly i feel like nothing dont eat dont sleep and now youve fucked up my career shrill laughter hell maybe ill cut my wrists rubbing his arms and itll be your fault milo said nothing rory cline said i know i know get some rest do yoga take my vitamins sorry charlie its like the ad for that gym ill rest when im dead milo said then i guess kats resting cline shut his mouth tried to stand still and settled for rocking on his heels unbelievable milo asked where hed been when kat shonsky left the club cline said here in la here said cline working down in the bowels eating shit working over the weekend whats a weekend you want to check with the security logs i cant stop you but please dont its only going to fuck me up further you do that a lot said milo do what work weekends fuck yeah sometimes i dont go home for days ed lamoca set the record twenty years ago ten days without bathing dominated the droobs with radioactive ambition and cosmic body odor they fade easily the droobs mostly ivy league brats thinking theyre gonna waltz from harvard to repping brad pitt i went to cal state northridge hunger gives me the edge milo said anything you can tell us about kat shonsky big faker said cline not just about that about everything like she wanted to live someone elses life whose life someone lazy and rich she had half of it down you didnt like her i already told you that we asked a few more questions slipping in cues about fancy cars and sexual kinks all of that went right past cline as he talked about himself when we turned to leave he stood there milo said you can go back to work cline didnt move listen if it does turn out to be a story let me know if its something brad or will or russell can use ill make sure youre in it in a way that pays off big gee thanks said milo excellent cline pumped air ran back inside as milo drove to the valley i reached one of rory clines past girlfriends a lawyer named lori bonhardt she described cline as a wimp and a dishrag denied ever witnessing a violent side whats he done he knows someone who got hurt knows someone she laughed if thats all it is forget it aggression would take effort and rorys hobbies are drinking and sleeping i used to tell him he should get on speed or something might give him some ambition my lhasa apso used to hump his leg and chi never does that to anyone else know what that means submissive personality i said beta male pure vice president michael brownings eyes got moist when he heard about kat he was a barrelchested rustbearded fireplug five six in thicksoled shoes with sturdy hirsute wrists and lumberjack hands he wore a yellowandblue windowpane shirt a bigknotted red tie of gleaming silk brocade leather knit suspenders the shoes were mocha suede wingtips maintained impeccably the stylish duds of a full partner at kaufler mandelbaum and schlesinger but brownings office was a cubicle on the ground floor one of two dozen in a fluorescent warren he spoke freely kat had stopped seeing him four months ago after learning he was married i wasnt cheating my wife and i were having problems debbie was doing her own thing and so was i i met kat at leonardos the one on ventura that closed down kat found out about debbie when debbie called my cell at kats place debbie was cool with the whole thing but kat told me she didnt want to be spacefiller and kicked me out i didnt blame her a curling thumb brushed a tear duct this is so incredibly sad she was a nice girl first time anyone had used that adjective to describe kat i said you parted on friendly terms of course said browning kat was right about not wanting to be used i told her i was sorry she said she forgave me but we both knew it could never be the same did you see her after that tucking bristly beard hairs into his mouth he chewed his eyes shifted to the left not often milo and i waited dont tell my wife okay said browning shes not cool with it anymore were back together expecting our first in two months congrats said milo how often did you and kat see each other after the breakup we didnt really see each other said browning not in the sense of a consistent relationship but browning flashed what he considered a charming smile there were a couple weekends retreats thrown by the firm he glanced around the warren the symphony of computer clicks hadnt slowed when we entered and no one was watching us now milo said where were the weekends and when did they take place palm springs and mission bay as for the when browning consulted his day planner read off dates nine weeks ago and less than a month ago did she drive down and meet you or did you travel together palm springs she drove herself san diego we went together please dont tell debbie were happy now it would be disruptive no doubt said milo look said michael browning im being totally open with you even if i had reason to lie i wouldnt because im no good at it debbie says im one big poker tell milo asked where hed been the night kat disappeared another page flip through the planner the color leached from brownings cheeks milo took the book says here meeting yearend deductions tl whats that stand for code said browning for what is it really important browning asked now it is said milo sir id never hurt kat nothing but affection ever passed between us until she booted you out when we were together it was always loving i swear even if i wanted to i couldnt lie and i have no reason to a part of me mightve loved kat i certainly wouldnt hurt her milo said tl browning leaned on his lowbacked swivel chair the seat creaked as long as debbie doesnt get involved another woman nothing serious said browning a fling do you really need the details you bet mr browning and well get them one way or the other okay okay tenecia lawrence she was an intern from valley college spent a summer working for me and came in for a recommendation letter to the business school at the u one thing led to another you wanted to review her qualifications it was mutual said browning if all she wanted was the letter she could have just called milo smiled first date for you and ms lawrence browning said strictly speaking no we hung out a bit when she interned touching the rim of his desk shes black the irrelevancy hung in the air browning said shes twenty gorgeous legs to infinity im not going to make excuses its the way im wired lets have her phone number said milo how about i just give you the facts tenecia and i spent that entire weekend together i can produce hotel receipts debbie was at her moms shes hormonal it leads to changes the number receipts arent enough if ms lawrence confirms your story they may be may sweat beaded brownings flat ruddy brow i have no anxiety about kat but debbie if you didnt kill kat debbie will never know we were here browning exhaled thanks thanks so much i really appreciate it dont call ms lawrence before we do said milo well know of course not that never entered my mind browning held out a hand for a shake milo pretended not to see it i said the last time you saw kat did she mention anything about an encounter with a customer a customer at her workplace oh that said browning if youre talking about what i think you are we waited browning said the freak right transvestite whatever tell us what kat told you a guy came into the store checked out the goods kat figured out it was for himself how she said he looked sneaky and nervous she thought it was hilarious kind of faced off with the guy like what do you think youre doing kat could be like that like what aggressive another shrug it had its benefits how did the man react to being confronted she said he got ticked off and left and she felt good about handling him howd she describe him um said browning she really didnt nothing at all she did say he was big looking at plus sizes that really cracked her up guy in a size sixteen cocktail dress what else did she tell you thats it said browning it wasnt like i wanted to continue the discussion why not we were having a good time last thing i wanted was to talk about perverted stuff put her out of the mood i said put me out of the mood said browning kat was always ready made a lot of noise sometimes it got so loud you could almost think she was faking it but she wasnt how could you tell no one fakes it with me no need to mr speedfreak and mr amoral cretin said milo she did know how to pick em he sped back to the city fighting the curves on coldwater canyon good thinking bringing up the crossdresser brownings her most recent lover i figured it might come up pillow talk sounds like she told everyone whod listen proud of herself i said for handling him aggressive with the wrong guy but putting that aside do either of these jokers bear further attention i said clines got the anger and the dopefed impulsiveness to do damage to kat if she caught him at the wrong time but hes got no obvious motive and he seems way too wired to pull off something so well planned my guess is the agency security logs will back up his alibi but id definitely try to get them browning comes across agreeable but to my mind hes scarier he lies easily and lives to manipulate and i have no doubt hed eliminate kat or anyone else who got in his way his alibis even simpler to verify tenecia lawrence milo said digging his notepad out of his pocket lets do it before browning preps her your turn i need two hands on the wheel i put my cell on speaker and called the number hed written down a female voice answered with a high chirpy this is neesh when i told her the reason for the call she dropped from soprano to alto am i in trouble i cited the date we need to know if you were with michael he told you her voice broke it was supposed to be totally secret it can stay that way i said please she said my parents true or not tenecia um how do i know youre the police if youd like we can drop by in person no no thats okay were you with michael silence tenecia a scared little girls voice said yes i was my dads a fire captain and that weekend he took my mom to a reunion at lake arrowhead all the battalions that had fought the big laguna fire michael wanted to come to the house but i wouldnt let him no way he wouldve stood out why we live in ladera heights she said prosperous black suburb i said where did you and michael go youll really keep this secret if youre truthful theres no reason for it to get out okay um michael picked me up at school and we drove to a hotel which one dayside inn where is that near the airport i dont know the street we stayed in all day watched movies the wedding planner and prime with uma thurman and meryl streep cause its one of my favorites michael was okay with it he likes chick flicks then what then the next day we went to long beach visited the aquarium id never been there silence its really pretty she said the aquarium what happened after that tenecia nothing you stayed in long beach i this is going to sound we were just having fun whered you go audible sigh another hotel best western near the aquarium the next day we came home i mean not right away first we went to dinner at sizzler then we drove through palos verdes to see the ocean then we went to michaels house in granada hills i was nervous to go there but it was dark and michael said it was okay the next morning he drove me back to school i didnt have a class until one pm so we had breakfast on campus hung out then he drove to work am i in trouble not if youve been truthful i have been i swear so you were definitely with mr browning the entire weekend i wont see him anymore she said hes too old for me is he in trouble nothing for you to worry about tenecia okay but im really not going to see him you wont have to call again will you sometimes my dad picks up my phone youre fine tenecia thank you so much thank you milo said poor kid we mighta scared her into celibacy if she keeps away from browning i said we did our good deed for the day lowlife too bad hes not our guy he called in for messages gordon beverly wanted to know if anything was new milo reached him spent a few tortured minutes trying to be therapeutic another try at bradley maisonettes parole officer produced a third burst of voice mail milo left an irate message and dialed wilson goods home number no answer screw his flu lets go bug the coach chapter no cars behind the mesh gate at wilson goods house no answer to the bell ring a call to st xavier confirmed that coach good was still out sick i said maybe he went to the doctor milo took in the sliver of view between the house and its northern neighbor guy made a nice life for himself okay back to the gristmill sean binchy waved the bentley key his presence in milos office meant no room to move and rapid oxygen depletion milo said heubel give it up easily had to work on him a little loot i figured telling him about shonsky might do the trick but he got pretty freaked out like dont tell me stuff like that he didnt like the idea of the car being messed with but i got him to see it was important wheres the car across the street in the lot said sean couple of uniforms saw me drive in had all sorts of fun its an experience everyone stares i said im sure it caught kat shonskys eye binchy said a lot of girls would trust someone with wheels like that milo said okay sean you get to be stared at all the way to the motor lab ill call and set up the paperwork binchy grinned and rotated an imaginary steering wheel anything else loot thats enough for the time being guess i opened a can of worms huh calling you in the first place it was obviously a can that needed to be opened sean when you put it that way said binchy weird huh without weird life would be boring sean speaking of which if i could possibly get in a position where i could return to homicide do you think that would be a good idea i think you should make yourself happy so youre not opposed to it why would i be binchy nodded and left maybe hes got a future i said what makes you say that opening worm cans all by himself i drove home walked blanche ate pizza with robin checked my email lots of urgent communication six bogus stock tips an offer to lengthen my penis ads for two different kinds of organic viagra and jason blasco at darkvisionsnet wanting to know if id learned anything more about the brighttranh murders and informing me hed found pictures of one of the heads jeffrey dahmer had kept in his fridge totally real dont ask me where i recieved it at the bottom was a message from sheriff george cardenas dr delaware doesnt look as if ansell bright ever owned property in california under that name or dale his last known car registration was the year his parents died and his address was their home in san francisco ill try to send you a jpg of his dmv photo tomorrow the house was sold for shortly after mrs bright died and has changed hands twice i managed to find the person who bought it the first time the transaction was handled by agents and the buyer never met ansell he did confirm that ansell was the seller so we can assume ansell got a nice chunk of money maybe he moved out of state to get more bang for his buck i havent been able to access social security records without a warrant but maybe lapd has more clout the only other thing i could think of is what mrs wembley said about leonora telling her ansell fed the homeless i looked up various groups in san francisco talked to a few people but no one remembers ansell or dale bright best george cardenas nine hundred eighty thousand was a serious motive well over a million if ansell brights parents had left stocks bonds cash or other real estate tony mancusi was set to become a millionaire as soon as his mothers will cleared that level of incentive paying a hit man would be a terrific investment if you put aside petty distractions like human decency how did kat shonskys murder fit i worked that every way i could think of concluded it didnt if the same killer had gotten her the motive had to be personal young woman with hostile tendencies confronts a crossdresser with a much darker secret than choice of wardrobe that brought me back to tony mancusis effeminate mannerisms donald bragens description of bright as fluttering over the phone dale an androgynous name a contract killer with a thing for chic french dresses meeting likeminded individuals and drumming up business overtones if tony led a secret life surveillance of his apartment might eventually bear fruit finding dale nine years after his sisters murder would be a lot tougher i got back on the computer searched for soup kitchens and missions in la fifteen minutes later id printed three pages nice to know the city wasnt all about ego and tax brackets i made a few calls most offices were closed until morning the people i spoke to had never heard of ansell or dale bright just as i was about to pack it in a new email arrived dr delaware george again i got back from a false raccoon call at maviss and that made me think about animal shelters leonora said dale was cruel to animals but faked like he wasnt so wouldnt that be a perfect split personality thing anyway i did find a group where he volunteered paws and claws the person in charge at the berkeley branch remembers bright because she used to work with him back when she was a volunteer she said one day he just stopped coming in and when she called him the number was dcd she recalls this clearly as nine years ago right after easter because someone dropped off abandoned bunnies and bright took good care of them then a few days later he went awol that makes it a month before leonora and vicki tranh were killed so maybe he left to plan the crime or mavis is wrong and hes just a normal guy who got tired of cleaning up animal crap if youre interested the informants name is shantee moloney her number is shantee moloney said whoa that mayberry cop said you might be calling but that was fast i said i appreciate your talking to me ive gotta be honest im not a big police person when i was a student at cal law enforcement was tear gas and billy clubs but i guess if dale did something that bad you really think he did cause part of me says thats impossible dale was so devoted and nonviolent but i said but what part of you oh said shantee moloney it was just strange the way he dropped out of sight without telling anyone what was dale like devoted like i said he said he was a vegan didnt even wear leather he said i really have no basis for doubting him but you doubt him anyway what are you a mind reader just a mere mortal trying to get some facts i said did dale do something that made you wonder about his credibility no nothing like that im not sure its even true i waited shantee moloney said im not a gossip sometimes its hard to know whats petty and whats important dead air ms moloney okay okay after dale stopped coming in i mentioned to another volunteer that id tried to call him got a disconnected number was worried if he was okay this other person said oh hes fine just saw him over at the tadich grill a couple of nights ago thats an old restaurant in san francisco i said well thats good at least i know hes okay but im still wondering why he suddenly stopped coming to the shelter and this other person laughs and says looked to me like dale had a sudden conversion i say what you mean and he tells me dale was in a booth by himself eating a ginormous meal huge platter of oysters crab cocktail then a honkin shoulder of lamb that floored me im a vegetarian but i eat eggs and dairy dale claimed to be total vegan used to go on about the ethical and health virtues of eliminating all animal matter and now hes stuffing his face with flesh faking it i said i guess he fooled me if its true one thing he didnt fake was his dedication to the strays no one couldve cared for those animals with more tenderness bunnies someones stupid idea of an easter gift im talking newborns like big as your thumb dale stayed up all night nursing them with an eyedropper when i left he was still there why would the other volunteer make up that story lets just say he and dale werent chummy could i have this persons name please brian leary but that wont help you hes gone aids six years ago is there anyone else at the shelter whod remember dale no she said it was just the three of us working the midnight shift im a freelance embroiderer my hours are flexible and brian was a nurse at ucsf did the three to eleven and didnt need much sleep so hed come in after work what about dale dale spent more time at the shelter than anyone he never mentioned any job at all i got the feeling there was family money whys that the way he dressed wrinkled clothes but good quality the way he carried himself im pretty tuned in to class distinctions what was the problem between him and brian i really couldnt tell you brian mostly worked with the cats he loved cats dale and i did anything else that needed to be done brian never said why he didnt like dale no i guess it was just bad chemistry i was in the middle i thought they were both good guys brian just happened to be at the tadich grill that night was he stalking dale not at all brian was out on a date some doctor hed been seeing do you recall a name youre kidding she said first of all brian never gave me a name second of all this was almost a decade ago i said cant fault a guy for trying i really cant imagine dale doing anything criminal anyway gotta go howd dale come to work at the shelter walked in one night and volunteered i was up to my elbows in abandoned puppies and it was a blessing he got right to work cleaning feeding checking for fleas he was great can you describe him for me big said shantee moloney tall or heavy both at least six feet probably taller he wasnt really fat more like padded what about his hair color light dirty blond but it was dyed he wore it long shaggy over his forehead but it always looked clean and shiny real shiny thats what i meant about carrying himself well he wore hemp shoes and belt but there was always a i guess what im saying is he managed to look polished did he ever talk about his family nope no personal details at all the other cop asked the same thing and that made me realize dales family never came up id call dale a private person but not cold just the opposite friendly and businesslike really into doing the job efficiently any other physical details you can remember his beard was darker than his hair medium brown first mention of facial hair full beard or goatee it totally covered his face reminded me of that guy used to be on tv that mountain man grizzly whatever adams but dale was no mountain man too polished she laughed you could say that gay a lot of us are so whered dale end up that was going to be my next question im supposed to know she said did he ever talk about traveling he did say he liked the great cities which ones paris rome london new york maybe madrid i dont recall the only reason i remember the conversation is he and brian kind of got into it brian saying if you really loved animals you couldnt love cities cities destroyed habitat and dale launched into this lecture about the cats of rome and how they adapted and thrived then brian said the whole urban thing was a clich√© april in paris et cetera and dale said some clich√©s persisted because they were valid the great cities were called that because they were and if brian thought san francisco was sophisticated he was naive it just kind of went on that way for a while then they returned to work did dale mention any other places he liked not that i remember no grizzly adams i said his nails were always clean and manicured and he wore aftershave couldnt tell you the brand but it was something nice and citrusey anything more thats not enough after all these years i thought i was being pretty darn encyclopedic you are thats why i keep turning pages so dale was good with all the animals better than good said shantee moloney tender especially the little ones not just babies anything small he really had a thing for puppies and toy dogs nastiest little critter he could calm it down i got a sense hed had experience with the teeny ones chapter ansell dennond brights dmv photo came through at ten am the following day thirteenyearold shot when bright was twentynine six feet two ten blond and brown needs corrective lenses relaxed expression nothing ominous in the eyes true to shantee moloneys description lank pale strands obscured brights brow draping his ears and fanning his shoulders the beard was a broad brown sheet pelting his face from adams apple to the bottoms of his eye sockets nothing to see but hair art of the misdirect did that explain brights lie about not eating animals manipulating shantee moloney but to what end bright had never received a penny for his work at the shelter love of the game or a need to feel virtuous or both all that hair natures costume i thought of high plains drifter duds plaid cap old mans shuffle conspicuous wheels it all added up to clever theater in kat shonskys situation the bentley wouldve been enough to lower her guard but i wondered if the killer had gone further angry man with a thing for alines and heels still seething at kats ridicule what sweeter revenge than to stalk her in drag i pictured the big black car gliding by as she fretted in her mustang passenger window sliding down revealing a driver in a bouffant wig designer dress maybe a discreet string of pearls that extra touch a pretty diaphanous scarf kats drivers license the symbol of her identity had been wedged in her private parts some killers take souvenirs other leave them its always about a message the message kats killer had delivered was youre not the woman you think you are mock me at your own peril kat an animal name too perfect to resist milo phoned just before two pm yawned a greeting followed by a bout of coughing i said rockandroll pneumonia or boogiewoogie flu oh man its way too early for humor its the afternoon feels like daybreak jesus youre right did a whole lot more nothing watching tony got home at six and crashed till an emergency call jolted me up at seven bradley maisonettes parole officer you sounded frantic lieutenant so i thought id catch you early im on two cylinders bastards gloating and whats the big news bradleys been persona non showuppa for seven weeks but not to worry hes got a history of dropping out for stretches always comes back addicts excursions i said doesnt sound like a guy who digs art museums and theeayter po considers him low priority because hes got a long list of more violent guys who dont show up says maisonette doesnt act out unless hes exhausted legal avenues of income he works panhandles sells his blood po diagnoses the basic problem as low selfesteem everyones a therapist i said i finally got the idiot to agree to pretend to search for him thanks for cardenass email you get a chance to talk to the animal lady i summarized the conversation with shantee moloney small dogs he said as in leonoras missing pooches if dale was behind the ojo negro murders i said it would be nice to think he took them as pets loves dogs hates sis wears hemp shoes and eats meat on the sly he sang the chorus of lou christies two faces have i i said hes also

warehouse that served as their domicile to condominiums the threestory structure in the stillindustrial hood had been subdivided years ago into sohostyle rental lofts and the safrans had lived there protected by rentcontrol provisions soon after the building changed hands the new owner an englewood njbased developer named roland korvutz announced plans for condoconversion under an agreement brokered between korvutz and a newly elected tenant board residents were offered compensated relocation or first dibs on the newly constructed units most tenants opted for the payoff but the safrans claiming the board was corrupt refused to budge and brought suit against korvutz in housing court for the past six months the safrans withheld rent and tried to rally other tenants to their cause in a breaking story three days ago the post reported the claims of paul safrans sister marjorie bell of elmhurst that shortly before the dueling duo vanished theyd expressed fears for their safety because of the conflict with korvutz bell also criticized the police for not investigating korvutz more thoroughly and alleged that korvutz an immigrant from belarus has a history of tenant intimidation when

woman behind the counter announced a refuel stop in salt lake city due to short runways at bob hope airport and wind issues we boarded ninety minutes later and for the next six and a half hours i sat with my knees bent at an interesting angle sharing a row with a young tattooed couple who made out audibly i tried to kill time by watching the satellite tv screen on my seat back during the intermittent periods it functioned shows about gardening competitive cooking and serial killers made me drowsy and i drifted in and out of sleep woke to loving murmurs and slurping tongues the final time i roused touchdown was half an hour away and the screen was fuzzy i took another look at the contents of the businesssized envelope single sheet of paper milos backslanted cursive safranbright

fashioned from a pinkblond mystery material a nineinch tv screwed to the wall fought for space with a snarl of wires completing the d√©cor were a bolteddown floor lamp and a soiled watercolor of the chrysler building the sole window was stationary and doublepaned the glass thick enough to mute the din of west fortyeighth and broadway to a persistent peevish grumble punctuated by random honks and clangs drawing the lintcolored drapes turned the room into a tomb but did nothing to lower the volume i stripped down got under the covers set the alarm on my watch for two hours hence closed my eyes an hour later i was still wide awake trying to synch my brain waves with the urban soundtrack down below somehow i managed to drop off only to be slapped awake at eleven by the alarm i called detective samuel polito ret got a canned female voice permitting me to leave a message during the time it took to shower and shave my phone registered a return call polito detective this is alex delaware the shrink how you doing i got an appointment before you where are you i told him he said that place we used to put witnesses up there characters you needed to stick around to testify but they wouldnt unless you babysat em used to give em a giant pizza payperview and a goodlooking female ada to chaperone i said zero out of three aint bad the executive he said takes me back listen i cant move up seeing you earlier than half past one you want a late breakfast by yourself go for it wouldve brought my jello and oatmeal on the plane but security thought they might ignite got a sense of humor huh youll need it okay meet me at this place le petit grenouille at half past seventyninth between lex and third french but friendly by noon i was out on the street the air was crisp and illogically fresh and the grumble had transformed to something rich and melodic ninety minutes remained until my lunch date i used a third of it walking to paul and dorothy safrans last known residence commercial neighborhood more trucks than cars the threestory brick structure housing lieber braid and trim was lined with rows of stingy square windows wireglass panes were crusted with grime wondering what had prompted roland korvutz to abandon his plans to condoconvert i turned around picked up my pace and headed for fifth avenue being alone in a big alien city sometimes tweaks my brain in a strange way setting off jolts of euphoria followed by a substrate of melancholy usually it takes time to develop this time it was instantaneous and as i racewalked new yorks bustling streets i felt weightless and anonymous at fifth and fortysecond i got sucked up into the crowd near the public library forged north dodging nascar pedestrians handbill hawkers windowgawkers lithe pickpockets crossing fiftyninth took me past the construction project that had once been the plaza hotel hansom drivers waited for fares the air was ripe with horseshit i walked parallel with central park the trees wore their fall colors with appropriate arrogance by one twentyeight i was sitting in a stiff wooden booth at le petit grenouille drinking water and red wine and eating acrid oilcured olives the place was set up with starched white linens vintage tobacco posters and rustcolored walls under a black tin ceiling half the booths were occupied by stylish people a giltlettered window faced the energy of the street getting here had taken me past the mayors graystone town house on seventyninth no different from any other billionaires digs except for flinteyed plainclothes cops guarding the front steps and fighting introspection a smiling waitress with chopped red hair and a sliver of torso brought a basket of rolls and a butter dish i worked on my blood sugar and looked at my watch at one fortyseven a blocky bluejawed man in his sixties entered the restaurant said something to the host flatfooted over sam polito alex delaware politos hand was hard and rough the little hair he had left was white and fine he wore a black windbreaker gray ribbed turtleneck charcoal slacks black loafers with gold gucci buckles that might have been real rosy cheeks contrasted with a lower face that would never looked shaved his right eye was clear and brown its mate was a sagging remnant with a milky iris polito said hey monique to the waitress salmon wild today oh yes ill have it with the white asparagus big glass of that m√©doc wine ch√¢teau whatever potatoes polito contemplated what the heck yeah easy on the oil bon msieur hanger steak medium rare salad fries polito watched her depart aiming his face so his good eye had maximum coverage red meat huh no cholesterol issues not so far i said the eye took me in me its just the opposite everyone in my family croaks by sixty i beat it by three years so far had a stent when i was fiftyeight doctor says lipitor watch what i eat drink the vino theres a good chance i can set a record good for you so he said you got some kind of pull with who deputy chief calls me at home im about to drive off to lake george with the wife he says sam i want you to meet with someone like im still obligated sorry for messing up your plans hey it was my choice he told me what it was im more than happy snatching a roll from the basket he broke it in two watched the crumbs rain even though were not talking one of my triumphs tough case jimmy hoffall be found before the safrans will maybe in the same place under some building i said or in the east river the former the river weda found em damn thing runs both ways all that agitation bodies come up i had more than my share of floaters he reached for an olive gnawed around the pit trust me the river theyda shown up his wine arrived he sniffed swirled sipped elixir of life that and the olive oil catching the waitresss eye he mouthed oil and mimicked pouring after hed sopped up half the golden puddle with his bread he said work this city long enough you get a taste for fine food so tell me about these la murders i summarized thats it unfortunately so this dale character only reason youre here is guilt by association maybe possibly couldbe yup fancy cars huh thats la aint it they actually put you on a plane for that lapd must be getting modern sending a shrink sorry a psychologist howd you get that kind of pull the midtown executive is pull you got a point the food came polito said seriously doc im curious the whole psych bit we got guys but what they do is therapize when the brass thinks a guys screwed up you do that i gave him a shortversion account of my history and my role doing your own thing he said if you can pull it off thats the way to go anyway the safrans suspicion fell right away on korvutz because he was the only one they were known to have serious conflict with plus he had a history of what id call sneaky moves like bringing a demo crew in the middle of the night and taking down a building so the neighbors cant complain then when everyones got their panties in an uproar his lawyers apologize oops sorry paperwork messup well compensate you for any inconvenience then it takes months to figure out what the inconvenience is then more delays then everyone forgets the newspaper account i read said hed been sued a lot price of doing business thats what his lawyer called it his lawyer was right doctor this city you sneeze upwind youre in court my sons finishing at brooklyn law did ten years in brooklyn robbery saw where the bread was buttered smiling oliveoiled his attention shifted to his plate and he began eating with obvious pleasure my steak was great but my mind was elsewhere i waited awhile before asking if thered been suspects other than korvutz nope and it never went anywhere with korvutz because we couldnt find any criminal connections despite the russian thing we got neighborhoods doctor brighton beach whatnot you hear more russian than english some of these guys came over in the first place to do nogood we got russianspeaking detectives keeping plenty busy none of them and none of their informants ever heard of korvutz he wasnt from moscow odessa the places most of them are from belarus used to be called white russia its its own country now said polito the point im making is no matter how deep we dug there was no dirt on korvutz sure hes in court a lot so is every other developer and each time he gets sued he settles any of his other tenants disappear polito shook his head and no one he litigated with would talk trash about him cause thats the condition of the settlements to be honest doc only reason he was even considered was there was no one else on the radar now youre telling me about this bright character you remember him i got a vague memory only because he was the head of that putup tenant board it was an obvious putup look said polito theres never any board before korvutz buys the building same goes for the first six months korvutz owns it then he files for permission to convert and all of a sudden theres an election no one remembers too clearly and a board of three people all of which are tenants who came on after korvutz bought the building i said bright plus two others a distant cousin of korvutz and the son of the plumber who services korvutzs new jersey buildings he produced a folded piece of lined paper same size as milos pad i remembered the names appreciate it hey he said dc calls whom i to say no slowly spreading smile even if he is my wifes brotherinlaw neat typing on the sheet w tenant board members dale bright sonia glusevitch lino mercurio i said korvutz knew the other two before he bought the building any indication of a prior relationship with bright nope and heres the thing doc even if the board was a puppet thing its no big deal legally landlords not obligated to have a board period and none of the tenants gave a crap except for the safrans they screamed corruption i pocketed the paper polito said truth is doc the safrans had no leg to stand on they were just making problems everyone else was happy with the deal korvutz offered because it was better than what they had in that dump were not talking big lofts like in soho this was a crappy place used to be a shoe factory that got divided into dinky units real cheap construction im talking singles and onebedrooms iffy plumbing and wiring not to mention your basic rodent issues because its a commercial neighborhood open garbage cans whatnot korvutz makes an offer they cant refuse no one refuses except the safrans i said polito put down his fork i dont like badmouthing my vics but from what i could tell those two were confrontative im talking hippie refugees from the sixties he was at city college back when radical sds type i was in uniform back then did crowd control for all i know he was one of those spoiled little bastards screaming at me what about dorothy same thing rebels without a cause i said dorothys sister said theyd felt threatened margie bell he said let me tell you about margie long history of depression and whatnot on all kinds of medication plus shed had two commitments to bellevue one year later she hung herself definite suicide her own kid found her in the bathroom with a note doc the safrans made a tempest out of a teapot you get to live cheap in this city because of rent control count your blessings and move on i went through their apartment tossed every inch trying to find a lead shaking his head wouldnt let my dog live like that they did though let their dog in one corner there was dirty newspapers spread out urine stains piles of dog dirt all dried up these people werent housekeepers sorry if i ruined your steak what im getting at is they were living like squatters shoulda taken korvutz up on his offer ever see the dog nope just what it left behind why i told him about leonora brights missing pets dale brights volunteering at paws and claws he twirled his wineglass this guy likes furry things but maybe hes not so nice to people its been known to happen you bet he said had one case back when i started out down on ludlow street lower east side crazy junkie carves up his old lady leaves her propped up sitting at the kitchen table for two weeks were talking middle of the summer tenement no airconditioning you can imagine meanwhile hes got a pit bull everyone says its a nice mutt but you wouldnt catch me petting one of those anyway this dog this maniac pampers it decides to up the protein in its diet by the time we get there sorry if that ruined your appetite no sweat i ate to demonstrate polito said you really like bright as your perp huh hes associated with two violent deaths one of which made him wealthy if he was paid to dispatch the safrans thats two more with a financial incentive and from what we can tell after the safrans vanished so did he into thin air he smiled that could mean something else doc he got disappeared too i said polito shrugged maybe i said but right now theres no one else on the screen anything you can tell me about him would be helpful there aint much even with my brotherinlaw linking me up with his official bigshot brotherinlaw computer he snapped his fingers just like you said guys nowhere once the building was vacated no other address shows up cant find any sign he ever lived in the five boroughs or the entire state of new york im talking no tax records real estate deeds drivers license the works all i can give you is a general physical description eight years ago and the fact that when i interviewed him he was cooperative and thats because if he wasnt cooperative ida recalled that i talked to the guy exactly once routine interview same for all the tenants whatd he look like goodsized guy beefy bald cleanshaven cue ball no hair period i fished out my copy of ansell brights california license politos good eye squinted all that fur you could make a coat guess it could be the same guy but i couldnt swear to it maybe thats the point i said a shapeshifter was he gay he wasnt swishy your guys like that some people say he is some people youre saying he fakes everything i told him about the cowboy getup the plaidcapped old man a possible crossdressing link stolen luxury cars black cars he said maybe like a symbol of death he pushed his plate away touched his chest you okay reflux this guy turns out to be the perp i had him right there and he moved on to more bad things not a nice thought i said he could turn out clean you thought he was clean you wouldnt be here he examined the photo some more handed it back nope couldnt say its him or not and the dale bright i talked to acted normal absolutely nothing hinky about him he finished his wine i gotta say doc talking to you is making me realize how much id rather be on the lake so let me give you the rest of what i got and be on my way first off i went by korvutzs apartment this morning that was the appointment i mentioned schmoozed with the doorman who happens to be expatrol dont you bother him it gets out hes talking about the residents hes screwed what he told me is korvutz is quiet no problems married with a little kid tips good at christmas has dinner by himself twice a week when the missus is out with her gal pals and lucky for you tonights one of those creature of habit goes to the same place likes italiano la bella i said its on my list polito smiled who do you think made up the list anyway korvutz eats early is likely to be there six six thirty the chance of him offering to share a plate of pasta is not a high probability but you can fly back to la say you tried does he use bodyguards were not talking trump or macklowe this guys smalltime relatively speaking i mean he still gets to live in a tenroom coop in a prewar on park bought in years ago what does he develop nowadays he doesnt collects rent checks retired how come maybe cause he wants to be or maybe cause he has to be what do you mean to play in the city nowadays you got to have bigtime dough starting with a b not an m gotcha i said what does he look like sorry no picture he said guy doesnt drive what i can tell you is that eight years ago he was fiftythree little guy glasses reddish brown hair your basic russian woody allen thanks i walked by the building on west thirtyfifth its back to being a factory strictly speaking its a warehouse doc the braids manufactured in queens they store it on thirtyfifth so how come after all that rigamarole korvutz never built his condos what i heard is he got caught in some kind of financial squeeze leveraged himself then the market dipped he had to sell a bunch of properties at a loss including that one its all about timing doc the markets crazy again crappy tenements getting gentrified in the lower east side hells kitchens full of yuppies got a new name clinton the boom hasnt hit west thirtyfifth those buildings are worth plenty he said right now it pays to keep em commercial but give it time one of these days the only people living on this island are gonna be the limousine bunch i waved the tenant board list any problem with me contacting glusevitch and mercurio not from my end said polito but youll have problems on both counts mercurios dead got into trouble over a woman five years ago exhusband beat him to death dumped the body in the bronx nothing to do with korvutz the ex had a history of beating up boyfriends only reason i found out is i noticed linos name on a vic list kid was a moron and a wiseass one of those hairgel guys wants to come across like a gangster i can see him ticking someone off real bad him i woulda liked as a suspect i could picture him thinking he could make his bones by taking on a contract job problem is he was alibied tight vacationing in aruba with a girlfriend the week the safrans disappeared convenient but righteous doc i checked hotel and airline records lino was definitely there maybe he paid for the trip with money korvutz gave him for being on the board korvutz bribed the members to serve cant prove it but why else would they want to bother and my second problem is sonia glusevitch is korvutzs distant cousin why should she cooperate he held up his palms i said just in case any idea where she is lets see if we can find out he pulled out his cell dialed information asked for listings for sonia glusevitch came up empty tried initial s one hand flashed a victory v three fortyfive east ninetythird you wanna try sonia first be my guest but i think it would be a mistake better to use the element of surprise with korvutz dont risk sonia alerting him i agree what was sonia like young goodlooking had a thick accent said polito bottle blonde but nice shaping generous imaginary breasts monique the waitress observed his pantomime and frowned polito waved her over delicious the salmon hell take the check she glanced at me left i was you doc said polito id leave monique a real generous tip i come here from time to time chapter when polito left at two fortyfive the restaurant had emptied monique drank coffee at the bar i paid the check and left a percent tip she thanked me with wide eyes and pretty teeth mind if i sit here for a few minutes i will bring you more wine i had over three hours before roland korvutz unfurled his napkin at la bella killed some of it drinking a better bordeaux than had come with lunch and thinking about my conversation with the old detective polito was troubled by the possibility that he mightve had his prime suspect right in front of him and missed something crucial but dales slipping under the radar was no discredit of politos skills if bright was a highfunctioning psychopath hed have come across supernormal shapeshifter if brights corpse wasnt embedded in the foundation of some manhattan highrise he was probably living under a new name and identity in la toying with the boundaries of gender identity getting off on the art of deception and worse i phoned in for messages had three robin milo and a lawyer chronically lax about paying his bills and deluded that id want to talk to him robin said i miss you but the big separation anxiety is blanche not a single smile and she keeps sniffing around your office then she insists on going down to the pond has to sit on the bench exactly where you do when that doesnt work she hops down and stares at the fish until i feed them if i dont toss in enough she lets out that girly little bark i keep telling her daddys coming back soon but the way she looks at me she aint buying it tell her ill bring back a souvenir shes no material girl but sure hows it going nothing much so far i checked the weather online sounds pretty gorgeous i said one day we should go definitely got a nice hotel i described the midtown executive she said one advantage wed be bumping into each other ill be back tomorrow plenty of bump opportunities hows work picked up a couple of new jobs easy repairs brief pause he called this morning wanting to make sure ill be in town when hes here he sounded different how so distant not brimming over with enthusiasm like he usually is he claims hes really into the project but the tone didnt match the words buyers remorse i said maybe he realized its an awful lot of money when you cant play a note worse comes to worst you sell them to someone else im just wondering if he caught on that any amorous intentions are not going to be reciprocated i have been avoiding small talk if he had ulterior motives and drops out youre lucky for sure she said her tone didnt match her words i said youve put a lot of work into this and now its complicated maybe just in my own mind youve got good instincts rob not always guess id better clear my head before turning on the band saw see you tomorrow love i told milo about my meeting with polito he said deputy commissioners brotherinlaw huh and this particular dc also happens to be his holinesss former driver takes a village to catch crooks i said and to breed em so bright didnt come across gay to polito combine that with dramatic changes in appearance pretending to be a vegan the jekyllhyde pattern his sister described and we cant be sure of anything about him all the worlds a stage bloody stage lets see what roland korvutz has to say about him youre going to approach korvutz directly wasnt that the point of giving me his home address and his favorite haunts yeah but i woke up this morning with second thoughts why would korvutz even talk to you if i can keep the emphasis on dale bright and off him maybe hell fancy himself a performer and let something interesting slip if he paid bright to do the safrans hell give you the boot or worse why settle for pessimism when you can have fatalism youve been reading my diary this guy could be big trouble amigo and i dont see any payoff in getting him nervous go back to your hotel put quarters in the massage bed get a good nights sleep aw thanks mom im serious howre things on the home front changing the subject doesnt alter reality ill watch my back anything new the home front is nada he said why settle for fatalism when i can have futility where were you planning to meet korvutz still am la bella the italian place upper east side were not talking hefty guys drinking espresso in some social club at best youre spinning your wheels alex why would korvutz blink at you at one time or another doesnt everyone want to be a star my neck tightened just thought of something if dales a wannabe olivier maybe thats what brought him to new york in the first place roar of the greasepaint he said the safrans were headed for the theater the night they disappeared offoffbroadway production downtown what if bright snared the safrans by offering an olive branch im doing a show have your name on the comp list would be honored if youd come watch me chew the scenery afterward we go out for drinks bury the hatchet on the condo thing and he brings a literal hatchet that would be cold problem is we already ran every search we could think of on bright and his name doesnt pop up in any productions or anywhere else the show couldve been too shortlived or obscure i said or he used a stage name on my way over from midtown i passed the main library maybe that was karma ive got time before i try korvutz lets see what the newspaper files have to offer good idea you find something forget mr korvutz and come home now youre obsessing i said pot and kettle i hurried back to fifth made my way through the afternoon crush ran up the stairs to the library the microfilm reading room was equipped with a dozen filmreading machines twice that many multiformat readers and a couple of microfiche viewers lots of studious researchers waiting for access including a homeless guy who made it to the front sat down spooled randomly i located the theater guides for the week preceding the safrans disappearance in the times post daily news and village voice waited for a free machine got to work an hour later id winnowed a long list down to nine downtown productions that seemed sufficiently obscure a fifteenminute wait got me a computer with internet hookup no mention of five of the shows of the remaining four i found cast lists for three anselldale bright didnt appear on any of them but i printed them and left the library the sky was blueblack fifth avenue flashed copper and bronze and silver in the reflected glory of store displays vehicle traffic was a bumblebee swarm of yellow cabs and black livery cars the pedestrian crowd had thickened to something purposeful and polymorphous and i felt like a tiny gear in a wonderful machine for variety i took madison north catching glimpses of moonglow haloing skyscratching towers development could be predatory but manmade new york was as beautiful as anything nature could conjure as i crossed from the sixties into the seventies megadesigner flagships gave way to boutiques and cozy eateries whose glass fronts showcased pretty people osteria la bella was different with a brick fa√ßade painted white and tiny beige letters whispering the restaurants name over a glass door so festooned with gilt flourishes it might as well have been opaque behind the glass darkness one of those places youd have to know about i looked up the street failed to spot anyone matching roland korvutzs description six twenty pm if he was in there already i wanted him settled into a culinary routine resuming my walk i continued all the way to east ninetieth picking up the pace to get some aerobic benefit from the gentle slope of carnegie hill by seven ten i was back at la bella with sweet lungs and a buzzing nervous system the glass panel opened to a glossy deep green vestibule backed by a second door of solid black walnut on the other side of the inner entrance a small landing was announced by an engraved bronze please watch your step sign three stairs down and a sharp left turn took me to a white marble ma√Ætre d stand a tall thick tuxedoed man studied his reservation book in the amber light of a seashell tiffany lamp lowvolume opera supplied the soundtrack some tenor moaning a sad story my nostrils filled with alternating ribbons of ripe cheese roasting meat garlic balsamic vinegar behind tuxedo a wine rack stretched to the handplastered ceiling obscuring the entire left side of the room the wall to the right was covered by a mural happy peasants bringing in the grape harvest the three tables in full view were round covered in red linen and unoccupied glass clink and the low murmur of conversation floated from behind the rack may i help you sir no reservation but if you could accommodate one for dinner one he said as if hed never heard the word before thought id be spontaneous we like spontaneous sir he ushered me to one of the empty tables handed me a wine list and a menu and told me about the osso buco special made with veal from serene vermont calves allowed to enjoy their brief lives unfettered by pens his bulk blocked visual access to my fellow diners as he described a medley of artisanal vegetables i feigned interest and glanced at the menu auctiongallery wines white truffles handnetted fish from lakes id never heard of the balsamic was older than most marriages prices to match drink sir bottled water bubbles very good he stepped aside revealing two parties on the other side of the windowless room the first was a gorgeously dressed couple in their thirties clenching wineglasses and tilting toward each other like pugilists tight jaws parted lips and rapt stares passion just short of coitus or a poorly camouflaged argument to their right a man sat with a child a chubby fairhaired girl her back was to me as she hunched over her plate from her size six or seven the man leaned low to maintain eye contact face melting into the shadows he touched her cheek she shook him off kept eating she had on a white sweater and a pink plaid skirt white socks red patent leather shoes except for the shoes maybe a school uniform his gray sport coat and brown shirt drabbed in comparison i could see enough of him to make out a small frame that fit politos description of roland korvutz so did his age sixty or so and having a child he broke a piece of bread and sat up to chew and i got a better look at his face high flat cheekbones bulbous nose narrow chin steelframed specs if this was my quarry the redbrown hair had faded to a sparse gray combover he reached for his fork curled pasta offered some to the little girl she shook her head emphatically he said something if the girl answered i couldnt hear it black serge filled my visual field again a large bottle of aqua minerale primo fiorentina and a chilled glass were set down gently ready to order sir still full from the late lunch i opted for the lightest offering a fortyfourdollar diver scallop salad before tuxedo took away the menu i checked the price of the water well over lapds daily food allowance all by itself maybe it had been handdrawn from artesian springs by highly educated medically verified vestal virgins i drank it tasted like water the little girl across the room said something that made the man in the gray sport coat raise his eyebrows again he spoke she shook her head got off her chair her skirt had ridden up and he reached out to smooth it her hand got there first she planted her feet fluffed her hair turned clearskinned blueeyed pugnosed the unmistakable visage of down syndrome older than id estimated ten or eleven she noticed me smiled waved said hello loud enough to override the opera hi im going to the bathroom the man said elena the girl wagged a scolding finger i talk to the man daddy darling if you have to go the girl stomped a foot i talk daddy i know that

especially that kind of kid lets book chapter elegant people walked refined dogs on park avenue roland korvutzs building on the west side of the street was ten stories of somber gray stone each level one apartment wide gleaming brass rods supported a spotless maroon awning a carpet of some weatherresistant material that looked good enough for my house led to deadbolted brassframed glass doors the all visitors must be announced sign was the same gleaming metal so was the call button inside the lobby a maroonclad doorman relaxed in a carved chair and watched me watch him hispanic mustachioed too young to be the retired cop polito had spoken to as i approached he stayed put light from a crystal chandelier ambered the blackandwhite marble checkerboard lobby floor dark wood panels glowed like melting chocolate the doorman didnt budge until i pushed the button even then his movements were languid he opened the door a couple of inches help you im here for mr korvutz he expecting you i sure hope so name dr delaware he closed the door got on a phone i cooled my heels under the awning braced for refusal maybe a warning to cease and desist felt guilty about cutting elenas dinner short then

sneakers cradling a tiny white pomeranian i prepared for rage his face was blank the doorman fulfilled his primary job description and korvutz walked through he pointed south kept moving still holding

korvutz gave no sign hed noticed as he crossed the lobby the doorman followed impassive as the dog licked his face chapter sonia glusevitch lived in a fortress of yellow brick that hogged a third of a block on east ninetythird the doors to this lobby were wide open mirrored walls alternated with panels of goldflocked velvet ailing palms yearned for something other than track lighting two hatless doormen in white shirts sat behind a formica counter ignoring a bank of closedcircuit tvs sonia glusevitchs name evoked a wavethrough as they continued to study an offtrack betting brochure which apartment laborious consultation of a black plasticbound book twentysix eleven a metalclad elevator griped all the way to the twentysixth floor the hallways were papered in shiny copper splotched to resemble patina rustcolored carpeting had long lost its bounce i knocked on sonia glusevitchs door the woman who opened wore a limeandorange kimono and gold highheeled sandals early forties fleshy and pretty with long tooblack hair tarantulous eyelashes and crimson lips her face was coated with a fresh application of powder vanillaladen perfume breezed out into the corridor ms glusevitch alex delaware sonia two soft hands clasped mine more vanilla as she kneaded my knuckles come in please her living room was boxy pale blue set up with black velvet seating white rugs baroque goldmirrored tables paris street scenes featuring too much pigment and not enough proportion hung on the walls a black japanned console bore a collection of freeform ceramic mounds she perched on the edge of a love seat pointed me to a chair that placed our knees inches apart undraped windows looked out to the east river and the nightglow of queens thanks for seeing me silk rustled as she crossed her legs a goldlink necklace circled a soft white neck additional glint was provided by oversized hoop earrings a cocktail ring set with a massive amethyst a goldanddiamond lady rolex ahlex she said thats a popular russian nyame you have russian blood not to my knowledge please she pointed to a coffee table set with crackers toothpicked cheese chunks an open bottle of riesling two cutglass goblets low lighting accentuated the river view and was kind to her complexion i poured wine for both of us her first sip didnt alter the fluid level i drank less both of us smiling and pretending to enjoy each others company like a bad blind date shed used the fifteen minutes it had taken me to walk from korvutzs place on park to put on her face and toss together a little spread i said did mr korvutz fill you in oh yes of course tinkly voice slavic overtones show of small white teeth as a crooked smile suggested a mischievous girlhood roland said you were very nyosy he didnt say very handsome she placed cheese on the cracker nibbled played with the toothpick you think maybe dyale killed someone its possible okay that doesnt shock you of course it shocks me cheese its good id paid for my fortydollar salad at la bella but had left before it arrived still i had no appetite for anything but information i reached for a cracker please tell me about dale whats to say what was he like sonia

actors completely shrouded by dark robes i said so the two of you became friends sonia glusevitch drank wine dyale was a real friendly guy you dont seem that surprised that hed be a murder suspect everything can be a surprise or nothing depends on what she cocked her head to one side if you trust people you get surprised you dont no more she said every day my husband told me he loved me every single day six thirty first thing he woke up even before the toothbrush i love you sonny covering his mouth so the bad breath didnt bother me the hand drifted to her abdomen continued to her knee he

rican nurses now he is married to one ah she recrossed her legs fabric shifted revealing the flank of a meaty white thigh a sandal bobbled i said you knew dale when you were married oh yes what kind

tomorrow morning or night earlymorning flight eye flicker have a good trip ahlex extending her hand i said if you dont mind just a few more questions she sighed and sat now you want to talk about the safrans right roland said you think dyale killed them would that surprise you those two she said who knows about people like that people like what always like this she made a sour face sloppy messy like they dont wash dyale said they were like roaches pests i said dirtying rolands property not being fair to roland the way they treat the dog they were cruel to their dog dyale said they never walked it the dog made mess inside dale was inside the safrans apartment her mouth slackened but her eyes got tight this is the fyirst time i think about that dale and the safrans didnt get along i said no reason for him to be there whatever she said roland nyever asked dyale to help him nyever roland wanted to make sure you told me that roland is not some gangster in belarus he was a hospital clerk helped old people get medicine the night the safrans disappeared they went to a play downtown was dark nose holiday still running running she giggled more like limping we had four days did the safrans attend slow nod i said dale invited them i say why he say why not be nyice did they enjoy the show dont know did you see dale with them after the show dont know she insisted i was taking off my makeup it takes time dale had already left yes ever see the safrans again long silence head shake my god dyale was dale in any other productions after that nyo howd he spend his time mostly i was in long island i use the apartment for when i dont want to drive back did dale have a job he said he was going to look for one but not now he had money from the parents just a little that was a lie too he inherited more than a little i said once he left rolands building theres no record of him working anywhere what kind of work did he say hed look for he didnt ah i think of something else he said he was going to travel where the world like it is one place i said dyale trust me the world is not one place it is little boxes of people who hate each other and kill each other and no one likes anyone different do you want to go to belarus and see why i left he said no sonny i mean the great cyities paris london rome i asked why he never went to the great cyities when he was cyaptain in germany he said the army kept him too busy but maybe he wasnt in germany eh that would be my guess i said all lies she said okay so what else is new do you have any pictures of him i dont kyeep souvenirs i asked for a physical description the picture she painted big hefty bald matched everything roland korbutz had said brown eyes she added soft eyes sometimes he wore glasses sometimes contacts this may sound strange but did he ever dress in womens clothing not on the street youre not surprised by the question at dark nose one of the gyirls she played systema was big size sixteen eighteen once in a while dyale would joke around about her size no no the clothes he put it on then a wig talked in a high voice very funny goofing around what he is weird that way i shrugged she said this is a weird sexy murder hard to say what it is oh boy i guess i am lucky dyale was always nice to me but who knows eh i am tired now ahlex too much talk she walked me to the door leaned in kissed my cheek in a cloud of vanilla i thanked her again why not she said maybe one day ill see california chapter did the chief get his moneys worth i asked milo ill let you know after i talk to him whens that when the palace beckons five pm gloomy skies heavy air in la we were in a coffee shop on santa monica boulevard renowned for omelets the size of manhole covers coffee for me coffee and a plate of cinnamon crullers for him two hours ago hed finished a late lunch at caf√© moghul an interesting mix of cumin and his digestive cigarillo lingered on his clothing before going to bed last night id left him a message summarizing what id learned in new york hadnt heard back because hed been surveilling tony mancusi until sunrise he rubbed his eyes dale did the safrans okay i got my moneys worth let me pay for your uneaten hundreddollar plate of lettuce forty bucks i said lettuce and scallops whoopy doo id been back since noon hed remained unreachable until four pm revisiting gilbert chacon at the prestige rental lot and getting chacon to admit that hed arrived late for work found the chain propped up but the lock missing rushed to rite aid on canon and bought the cheap drugstore version wed seen think theres more to it i said someone bribed him to leave it off dont think so he offered to take a poly cared more about losing his job than aiding and abetting however it happened whoever picked the lock kept it sentimental after leaving chacon hed participated in a conference call with texas authorities and detectives from six cities where cuz jackson claimed to have committed atrocities three dead ends one unlikely two possibles plus antoine beverly one big question mark the needleandgurney folk in the lone star state wanted to get things moving the chiefs office had asked milo to push on antoine but there was no lead to follow other than locating antoines boyhood friends no sign of either hollywood unmarkeds been cruising by wilson goods house for the last fortyeight hours definitely no one home and st xaviers starting to worry i said maybe he got really sick and ended up in the hospital we looked into that zip the coach has left the field i said funny thing bout that huh like i said all the fool had to do was cooperate wouldnt that be something antoine coming down to some creepy kidonkid thing thinking about that made me tired or maybe it was no sleep in the celllike hotel room followed by a bonefusing sixhour plane ride i swigged coffee milo tore open a packet of splenda but didnt use it good was antoines age at the time of the disappearance you see a fifteenyearold capable of something like that theyre not myelinated who what myelin i said its a substance that coats nerve cells and plays a role in logical processing teens dont have as much as adults some folks think thats a good reason not to execute young criminals at what age does it turn normal differs from person to person sometimes not till middle age bad living through chemistry he said but were not talking some lowimpulse stupid homicide babygangbangers pull that off all the time if goods dirty for antoine weve got a teenager stealthy enough to murder his best buddy smoothly cover it up and go on living as an upstanding citizen serving as a pallbearer and crying his little eyes out seeing yourself as moral and living with something that evil would be a hell of a burden but people pull it off or good could be one of those highly functioning psychopaths whos managed to avoid trouble and now trouble comes visiting he said so he freaks out and splits or antoines death wasnt a calculated crime couple of kids horsing around and something went horribly wrong good panicked and hid antoines body now hes terrified maybe three kids antoines other pal is a junkie and a career criminal that could be selfpunishment gordon beverly said maisonette had family problems lived through a driveby maybe his resources werent as strong as goods bradley sentences himself to a lousy life wilson gets the house in the hills maybe that makes good the really cold one hell it couldve been premeditated the goods told us antoine sold more subscriptions than anyone what if those little bastards wanted to pocket his dough and he wouldnt give it up the way those outfits generally operate the kids hand in the forms and get paid later okay but my nose is telling me something happened among those three boys gotta find mr good and start demolishing his illusions but i cant lose track of mancusi and shonsky speaking of which tony called jean barone yesterday wanting to know when mamas will was going to be processed whatd she tell him what i told her to say the wheels of justice grind slowly the tonester hung up without as much as goodbye maybe cranking up the pressure will lead him to do something stupid like meeting with whoever dale brights pretending to be snatching a cruller he bit down hard created a spray of crumbs thanks for taking the trip alex you believe korvutz about not setting up the safrans he had no incentive the building was going to be vacated with or without the safrans consent so what was brights motive killings fun when you can frame it as altruism sonia glusevitch said bright was the most helpful man shed ever met the galpal he said credible i think so able but not often willing he said but not gay this guy defies classification he finished the cruller took another frolicks in frocks good with makeup no record of him living in washington dc maryland or virginia same deal with military service in germany what a shock i said reinvent yourself pastime of the new millennium why didnt he just run for office and save us all this grief politics would be a poor fit i said he genuinely likes helping people he laughed so hard crumbs bounced off his belly i said dale and tony couldve met at some crossdresser gettogether tony complains about money problems how his mother lives in a nice westwood house while hes forced to move to a dump because shes turned off the tap dale decides to put in a fix maybe tony has no idea what hes initiated but maybe after he hears the details a killer in costume he suspects something the plaid cap he said he talked about his father wearing one just like it if that was one of dales little jokes howd he find out about tony seniors sartorial habits tony gabs dales a good listener if tony knows hes partially responsible for dale butchering his mother that would explain the emotion we saw barfing but he doesnt turn dale in because hes scared of being nabbed as an accessory what interests me is that dale acted with no worry about tony giving him up he understands tonys psyche or hes biding his time tonys in jeopardy i guess its possible either way if surveillance doesnt produce something soon id think about confronting him directly he made his way through the second cruller you really think this is evil altruism dale doesnt get paid for his hits if were right about the ojo negro killings he murdered his sister and vicky tranh and got rich but if money was his sole reason for eliminating leonora all he had to do was sit in the woods and pick her off with a rifle instead he dressed up in costume showed himself stole a car engaged in incredible savagery to me that says there was psychosexual payoff and that fits with what leonora told mavis wembley about dale secretly cruel as a child tortures animals volunteers at a shelter hes all about irony isnt he irony and theater i said think what it took to pull off kat shonskys murder stealing a conspicuous car stalking his prey then abducting her possibly in drag then returning the car to where its sure to be found and leaving token blood on the seat leaving the scarf where it would be seen immediately if kats grave was unearthed that grave wouldve definitely been unearthed he said the permits for the sisters swimming pool had just come through be interesting if dale was aware of that his eyebrows arched someone the sisters know wonder if theyre back from their cruise he motioned the waitress over handed her some bills thats way too much lieutenant caught me in a weak moment marissa honestly lieu he placed a big hand over hers take your kid to the movies youre so sweet she tiptoed to buss his cheek just about skipped away i said random acts of kindness me and dale chapter he brushed memos into the trash unread searched kat shonskys murder book for the names of the sisters who shared the burial lot susan appel and barbara bruno lets go alphabetically punching numbers so fast he hit the wrong button and had to try again mrs appel lieutenant sturgis im yes i know it was traumatic maam so sorry it was your no therell be no need to do any further digging thats not what im absolutely mrs appel and we do appreciate it but i need to ask you one more question he hung up rubbing his face doesnt know anyone named bright dale ansell or otherwise would never know anyone capable of something so terrible same goes for sis because they have exactly the same social group closeknit i said they share real estate and havent sued each other might as well be conjoined let me try bruno anyway nope voice mail no sense leaving a message appels bound to get to her first thanks for breakfast im off to buy my red bull and sustenance get ready for the wonders of rodney drive you paid for breakfast i was talking mental stimulation want company robins still busy on her project were catching dinner at seven then shes back to work so play with the dog thanks for the offer alex but doing that fortyeighthour ny turnaround is already beyond the call plus hanging with me when im braindead is not amusing and dont say youve already been there dinner was lamb chops salad beer by nine pm robin was back to carving and i was stretched on the sofa in my office reading the paper blanche curled next to me pretending to be interested in current affairs at ten thirty i snapped awake feeling itchy and too large for my skin blanche snored with gusto i put her to bed walked out back to the studio robin sat at her bench tapping and carving oh no poor you what you fell asleep and now youre wired its that obvious she put her chisel down touched my face the leather couch youve got marks from the seams sherlocka i said want me to go with you where one of your drives i wasnt planning on driving anywhere no she said okay ill stop and we can play scrabble the fiddlegrain maple back of the dotcom guys mandolin sat on the spotless bench neat pile of shavings on the floor i do not obstruct genius hardly she said what are you going to do maybe ill join milo hes watching tony mancusi may haul him in for questioning she smiled now i know its really you and not some alien clone give me a kiss and be off i phoned from the road he said your myelin will wither probably have too much anyway mr mature not by choice hed borrowed a dented brown camaro from the police lot was parked ten yards cars north of tony mancusis building positioned so streetlight glanced the rear of the car avoided the drivers seat he saw me unlocked the car the interior reeked of sweat tobacco and pork three cartons of short ribs gnawed to the bone shared the backseat with a tub specked with fried rice a collection of little plastic cups emptied of sweetandsour sauce greasespotted napkins used washn dris a pair of broken chopsticks three red bull cans had been crushed to disks in milo s lap was a tartanpatterned thermos his face and body fused into a single dark mass as my eyes adjusted i saw that hed changed into black velour sweats a nylon shoulder holster housing his mm and newlooking keds spiffy he removed the earpieces from his ipod clicked the machine off you say something just hi id offer you some

classy guy i said ricks ipod i took it by accident we sat for an hour hollywood patrol called in no sign of wilson good by one thirty am the tedium of surveillance started to hit me i figured id give it another hour return home to crash get my time zones back in order milo said long as youre here punch me if anything happens pushing the bucket seat as far back as it would go he lowered his head to the seat back twenty minutes later he awoke with a frighteningly guttural start and wild eyes what time is it ten to two wanna nap yourself no thanks wanna split maybe in a while tedious told you so he said nightynight must be nice to be right once in a while i said emphasis on once my oh my sleep deprivation brings out the vicious side something to his left made him turn sharply i followed his glance saw nothing then the front door to tony mancusis building opened as if milo had smelled it a man stepped out to the street slumped pudgy shuffling gait tony mancusi walked south to his toyota got in and drove toward sunset milo cranked down the drivers window and watched most of my view was obstructed by parked cars but i could see the twin dots of taillights twenty yards up mancusi covered a block and rolled through a stop sign first violation said milo starting up his engine hopefully therell be others the toyota headed west on sunset passing western pediatric medical center and continuing through hospital row at that hour the boulevard was deserted until vine where the nightscape was peppered with drifters addicts minimumwage workers waiting for buses sparse traffic meant milo had to stay well behind the toyota but it also turned mancusis taillights into beacons the signage of a bigbox office supplies barn lit up a redsauce stain blotching the corner of his mouth toss in the black hair and the gray skin and you had dracula with a penchant for trans fat mancusi caught a red light at highland backed up illegally switched into the leftturn lane milo muttered tony tony and stayed half a block behind the green arrow flashed mancusi turned into a darkened parking lot on the east side of the avenue headlights off as he rolled to a halt near a shuttered food stand milo doused the camaros lights and watched from across highland a huge painted sign on the roof of the stand starred an elated pig sporting a sombrero and a serape gorditos tacos mancusi stayed in his car ninety seconds later three women emerged from the shadows big hair microskirts stiltheels purses on chains loosehipped and sashaying as they strolled over to mancusis open drivers window huddled conversation heads thrown back in laughter two of the women left the one who remained had a teased platinum do a big shelf of bust skinny legs a red wifebeater exposed flat belly above a minuscule lipstickpink skirt no hot pants lets hear it for tradition the blonde wiggled her way to the toyota s passenger side fussed with her hair tugged at her top got in guess tonys not gay i said milo smiled mancusi drove faster taking highland south to sixth street turning left and speeding past hancock park and into windsor square with its ancient trees broad lawns and landmark mansions a sudden turn took him north to arden boulevard where he covered a block stopped parked in front of a minitara silent dark street wideopen landscaping and a gap where a street tree had succumbed the toyota s brake lights remained on ten seconds later it pulled away continued another block north and parked again this time facing a georgian masterpiece nearly obscured by three monumental deodar cedars an equally massive sycamore on the parkway umbrellaed the car the lights went off the toyota remained in place for ten minutes then started up again and returned to gorditos tacos mancusi idled at the curb as the blonde got out she fooled with the waistband of her hot pants leaned in said something through the passenger window whipped out a cigarette and smoked as the toyota drove away milo jogged across the street flashed the badge the blonde punched her thigh milo spoke the blonde laughed the way she had when approaching mancusi milo pointed to her cigarette she stubbed it out he patted her down took her purse holding her by the elbow he guided her across highland and straight to the camaro no expression on his face her eyes were wide with curiosity chapter milo pulled a steelhandled straight razor out of the hookers purse hands on the car thats for protection sir husky voice on the car pocketing the knife he stashed the purse in the trunk put the hooker in back of the car squeezed in next to her your turn to drive pard i slid behind the wheel the hooker said i love company next to milo she looked small and frail midto late thirties hair stiff and shagged platinum at the roots copper at the tips a hatchet face oatmealed by pimples gleamed through bronze pancake pert nose plump lips glitterflecked cleavage big hoop earrings cobalt eyes under gritty halfinch lashes struggled not to bounce below all that a muscular neck pronounced adams apple she saw me looking at oversized hands and slipped them out of view milo said this is tasha labelle hi tasha the pleasures all mine sir lets get moving said milo tasha said where we going nowhere in particular a few hours disneyland s gonna open fantasyland your thing said milo no answer i pulled onto highland hit a

name slip see how he reacts creative okay lets aim for a planning session at nine make it nine thirty once we finalize the script i phone tony ask him to drop by the station guy never leaves before three pm were ready by noon well have him by nine fifteen the next morning i was drinking strong coffee in milo s office as he shuffled a new pile of message slips the parole office hadnt been able to locate bradley maisonette and was activating an investigation wilson good was still nowhere to be found and st xavier high was extremely concerned goods assistant coach a man named pat crohan had tried to contact andrea good through her work number at a graphic design firm mrs good had abruptly resigned four days ago milo said hubby and wifey on a major rabbit they have a dog i said if theyre

beverly just checking in chiefs office wants a meet in three days on all pending matters he pulled out a panatela lets talk about tony the phone rang what im busy who do they have an appointment okay

canineboarding facilities in the hollywood area found eight pretending to be a veterinarian named dr dichter i began working my way through the list inquiring about the health of my patient indy good the acrobatic dachshund a pleasant woman at my fourth try critterland pet hotel said oh hes fine is andy concerned about something she called my office to verify his shots whatever that meant oh well

door lieutenants in five says you should join him i walked to the interview room milo had shoved the table out of the way and sat opposite two women ladies this is dr delaware our psychological consultant doctor ms appel and ms bruno one brunette one blonde nervous smiles from both each was in her forties and wore a cashmere crewneck tailored jeans largecarat ring tennis bracelet stud earrings all the jewelry set with clean white diamonds the brunette plucked at her plumcolored sweater she had a clear oval face a toned body blue eyes dark hair cut in a boyish cap her fairhaired companion was rounder a bit younger with painted eyebrows and sharp brown eyes pumpkin cashmere frosted locks she held out her hand first barb bruno susan appel said the brunette a few decibels softer were sisters milo said susan and barb own the property where kat shonsky was disaster said barb bruno we got the call on the cruise ship were still traumatized susan appel said we were planning on building an olympic pool for our families to think not that wed ever change our minds we cant let something hideous like this stop us from living for us its always been about family our parents raised us that way do either of you remember the circle f ranch market in brentwood that was our dad reuben fleisher id never heard of the place ah susan appel reached behind one ear twisted a wisp of short dark hair a look from her younger sister caused her hand to drop and i imagined a childs voice remonstrating stop picking at yourself barb bruno said were still not sure we did the right thing by coming in you called susan and she called me and we both agreed it was most probably nothing then we thought about it i thought about it and i called susan and we discussed it some more we came to the conclusion that no matter what happens it was our duty to call you milo said we really appreciate it now if you could tell us which isnt to say our husbands are happy with us they arent said susan appel twisting her hair again and avoiding her sisters eyes barb bruno said theyre both attorneys head their own firms corporate litigation said susan appel both hal and mike will be the first to tell you they have no experience in criminal law but they want to make sure were protected barb said alpha dogs out of a suede weave bag came a folded sheet of legalsized paper milo read put it down you want guaranteed confidentiality barb said doesnt seem too much to ask seeing as how weve come forth voluntarily susan said were not even sure we know anything useful frankly we hope we dont but just in case we could be in danger said barb if we have hit upon something knowing the perp said sue then ratting him out milo said ladies this kind of citizen involvement is so important but even if i signed this it would be worthless because i dont have the authority to grant so who does said barb i really dont know maam its never come up oh cmon i see it all the time law and order crossing jordan milo said sometimes on federal cases there are grants of confiden see barb swiveled hard and tapped her sisters knee thats exactly what mike said susan said hal still thinks it could apply to a nonfederal case barb rolled her eyes milo said ladies i promise to do everything i can to ensure your utmost security your names will not be part of any public record unless theres a trial and a defense attorney requests thats exactly what mike said hals not denying that ladies if it gets to that point and thats a big if the suspect will be in custody what about bail said susan unlike on tv murderers dont get bail maam murderers said barb bruno hard to believe it happened to our property so degrading youre saying you wont sign lieutenant i can sign it but id be lying to you maam and if you do have relevant information you really need to tell me silence ladies you know as well as i do that its your obligation barb said seems as if were being punished for doing our civic duty if we hadnt come forward on our own we wouldnt be in this position thats true of any hero said milo barb blushed the color spread to her sisters face as if by sibling osmosis susan said were not trying to be heroes but barb said i guess in a sense we are heroes milo folded the sheet and put it in his jacket pocket please tell me why youre here barbs turn to mess with her hair susan watched fascinated the sisters looked at each other barb said if you cant sign it how about this once this whole mess dies down were going to build our pool its the obvious feng shui thing to do the purifying nature of water city codes have gotten totally bonkers the zoning boards been literally driving us crazy because they cant grasp the concept of shared property and dual liability they want to impose ridiculous limits on size depth are demanding ludicrous fencing even though all our kids are great swimmers and the whole point is building an olympicsized pool which will not impact the neighborhood because we have fabulous landscaping plans and our fence is right out of a zen garden in niigata japan i said where the koi are bred she beamed yes exactly we have a fabulous pond show quality susan said my daughters on the archer school swim team and needs the full lap length to work on her stroke barb said everyone is way past the age where drownings an issue well even work with the lottie affidavit requirement though we dont think its necessary but we would like for you to exert some influence here and smooth the process with the zoning commission said milo one agency talks to another said susan thats what hal says barb said have some big shot in your department or better yet the fire department because theres an abatement issue as well have someone call the head of the building division and smooth things out for us its the least you can do that said milo is feasible susan said it is her sister shot her a sharp glance of course it is when theres a will milo said ill talk to the police chief personally were having a meeting soon fantastic said barb shifting her body closer to him milo said go ahead please barb said okay when you called sue and asked about that bright person she said she didnt know him because she doesnt neither of us do but then we got to talking and we realized there was something that happened that we thought was a little creepy holding her hand out to susan susan said there was this person who tried to get our husbands to invest with him took us out to dinner at cut thats wolfgangs new place at the beverly wilshire spent a lot on wine very hotsytotsy four seasons beverly wilshire said barb now weve got two four seasons a mile apart must be so confusing for the tourists susan said this person really laid on the sales pitch visited us at home my house because barbs kitchen was being renovated and she and mike and lacey were eating all their meals with us our husbands were still considering his offer so when we had the cocktail party he was invited a benefit for moca said barb my sister and i planned the entire event the lot was set up with a tent and a band people had a great time everything was prepared in my kitchen said susan we moved the furniture people had a choice to come upstairs and see the view from the living room great party said barb people were talking about it for weeks the only creepy thing was him something he said to both of us and the crazy thing is we never knew that until yesterday when we compared notes susan said so obviously it wasnt just a casual comment milo said obviously barb said first he asked about the lot seemed really interested in it but plenty of people are like that because nowadays who has open land in the middle of bel air and no one can understand how sue and i share so wonderfully so that alone wouldnt have stood out but then after he found out the details about the pool susan broke in even though id already told him he had the same conversation with barb playing games as if wed never compare notes said barb i guess we didnt said susan whatever the point is after talking about the pool he gave this strange creepy smile lecherous if you must know said barb i felt hed been coming on to me all night me too said susan it was nothing you could call him on lieutenant but you know the handshake that lasts too long the kiss on the cheek that moves a leetle too close to the lips not too smart of him seeing as he was chasing after hal and mike to invest with him what did he think wed be turned on and work on the guys for a second i thought he was actually going to plant one on me said barb instead he whispered in my ear it would make a great family plot i said pardon and he said a plot for burial lots of wealthy families in europe have them its a mark of aristocracy as if that was supposed to impress us said susan blue eyes widened he told me the exact same thing word for word we both ignored him and never mentioned it to anyone said barb there was no need because hal and mike decided not to invest with him they did some background checking couldnt find any any background said milo exactly his excuse was hed been living in europe all his projects were overseas mike said that sounded like fourplus bullshit so did hal so there was no reason to think about what he said he was off our list barb said but now seeing as that poor girl was milo said whats this guys name susan said our identities will really be confidential unless theres a trial one hundred percent another silent sisterly consultation barb bruno said hes a real smoothie drives a bentley wears nice suits for all we know its not even his real name milo waited susan appel said tell them barb bruno said he goes by nick nicholas st heubel chapter milo paced the interview room the sisters had just left reminding him not to forget our zoning issues hed pressed them for details on the man they knew as nicholas st heubel barb bruno thought her rude guest played tennis susan appel believed the game of choice to be golf both women admired his clothes but thought him way too smooth both had discarded his address and phone number milo cited the brentwood street where wed encountered heubel and the bentley and they said thats it in unison he asked for their husbands work numbers mike wants nothing to do with this same for hal thanks ladies you really are heroes heubel working his shoulder and torturing his hair i said hes the right age and height thinner than the descriptions weve gotten of bright but nothing a diet couldnt accomplish able to keep it off one hand grazed his belt that alone makes him a goddamn criminal tasha described tweed as having a puffy face and heubel has a pouchy mouth as if someones compressing his cheeks kissypoo he said kissing off the world i said he slapped a wall hard enough to send vibrations through the floor bastard called in the bentley to stir it up facetoface hes that confident the cops are stupid hes been getting away with serious bad deeds since childhood thinks hes invincible no more st heubel whats that another game im really not so pure its all about games i said he played with the sisters heads returned months later and buried a body under their noses the image of a backhoe churning up kats bones gave him serious jollies putting on the frightenedcitizen act im calming him down frown i was worried he might know the mayor he might rosalynn carter partied with john gacy oh man he said three more circuits asshole stalks kat in his own wheels spins a yarn about theft and recovery leaves blood all that just to jerk us around using his own wheels was the perfect cover i said the bentleys a conspicuous car even at that hour he had to consider someone might see it but so what hed be the last person to suspect if he hadnt made the sisters nervous hed never have been connected to any of it true he said what was that family plot stuff about arrogance why spook the sisters if he wanted their husbands to invest with him alex by that time he probably knew the husbands wouldnt bite and taunting their wives was a subtle form of aggression or he just felt like being extranaughty what makes him a tough quarry is its hard to say what he wants im not sure he always knows what do you mean i see his brain as a battlefield with logic and compulsion constantly skirmishing his lifestyle his ability to adapt to live simply when he needs to says logic dominates then there are the times he needs to work off a little energy and people die that lifestyle of his was grubstaked by slashing his way to a millionplus inheritance most psychopaths wouldve burned through the money quickly he managed to parlay it into affluence i wouldnt be surprised if he really does trade commodities its a loner job with high thrill capacity he rubbed his face eight years between the safrans and kat is way too occasional i agree therere bound to be more bodies no other blackcar murders so far but that means diddly he said lots of stuff never hits the news the cars are props i said not his signature he uses them in locales where everyone drives hes adaptable never registered a vehicle in new york walking the safrans somewhere and doing them then what off to europe something he actually told the truth about good liars mix it up he used his own name in new york but adopted a new identity when he returned to california that could be covering his tracks for the bad deeds he pulled off during the interim nicko st heubel continental naughty boy wonder where he came up with the name could be the oldfashioned way he plugged heubel into criminal databases came up negative a web search proved no more fruitful okay he said the antiquated way the chiefs secretary said the boss was in sacramento smoking cigars with the governor shed pass on the message i called sal polito and he greased access to his brotherinlaw the manhattan deputy chief the dcs secretary took down the information and ten minutes later a clerk in albany phoned nicholas heubel born in yonkers the same year as ansell dale bright had died of meningitis at the tender age of five no social security number issued until twentyfive months ago milo wrestled with the irs for half an hour in order to learn that heubel had filed tax returns for the last two years i said six years hes out of the country he comes back goes the legal route ill get an interpol thing going but with the focus on terrorism its gonna take time meanwhile tricky nickys having leisurely breakfasts at the brentwood country mart he stood grabbed his jacket checked the magazine of his gun and holstered up he asked the watch commander for six officers in plainclothes and three unmarkeds that took another fortyfive minutes to put together and it was nearly two by the time we convoyed to brentwood no swat team because that wouldve been too conspicuous in nicholas heubels leafy lovely neighborhood but bulletproof vests for everyone shotguns and rifles at the ready milo had the other cars hold back a block parked ten houses up from the vanilla house told me to sit there and proceeded on foot ambling as if this were a casual visit he made it past six houses stopped pointed for lease sign staked in the lawn of the vanilla house taking out his weapon he held it close to his pants dark pants the gun was barely visible brief stop at the front door and a bell ring the inevitable silence he walked around the side of the house a similar foray last year had resulted in a date with a shotgun i sat there he reappeared shaking his head weapon back in the holster cell phone in his palm he punched it hard enough to kill it ten minutes later a white jaguar drove up to the house and a short dark woman in an eggplantcolored pantsuit got out milo greeted her ms hamidpour i am soraya you are the lieutenant straightening the for lease sign lieutenant sturgis maam thanks for coming you say there is a problem with the house i come what is the problem how long has it been for lease two days how long has it been vacant the owner doesnt know exactly what is the problem whens the last time the owner heard from the tenant the owner doesnt hear from the tenant its a managed property your company now it is us who was it before she named a competitor milo said owners not happy with their performance not at all the tenant left without giving notice two months unpaid rent at least he left it clean milo rubbed his face have you cleaned it further yesterday said soraya hamidpour the usual vacuuming carpet shampoo to make it look extragood its scrubbed down pretty nice most of the rooms dont even look as if they were lived in whos the owner maam he lives in florida out came the notepad name please soraya hamidpour scrunched her lips its a little tricky how so the owner likes to stay private hermit not exactly she turned back to the sign scraped something from a corner maam do we need to get into that we really do maam the problem with the house is the tenants not a nice person i see my problem is the owner a certain type of exposure he likes but loo a big blond cop wearing an untucked denim shirt and jeans waved from ten feet away as he got closer the shirts flap billowed exposing his sidearm soraya hamidpour seemed entranced by the weapon milo said whats up greg sorry to bother you but calls are getting heavy and watch commander wants to know how long youll need us one car stays for right now the rest of you go call for a crime scene team were going to tear this place apart tear said hamidpour greg said the warrant signed sealed

of an alist movie star milo said did he know mr heubel no no never its managed he lives in florida cupping her hand around her mouth something to do with community property the last divorce also he gets a place to park his airplane chapter a call to the company that had leased the house to nicholas heubel firmed up the details alist leading man had owned the property for five years purchasing it as part of a divorce settlement with his fourth wife the plan had been for her to live there but shed changed her mind and moved to colorado with a younger actor where alist bought her a ranch upon

months nicholas heubel heubel had coldcalled the company representing himself as a freelance investor produced a bank account more than substantial enough to qualify hed paid first and last months rent plus a damage deposit with a twentyfourthousanddollar money order the leasing agent still miffed about being fired promised to fax over heubels rental application and any other paperwork in the file milo said time to talk to tony mancusi as we set out on the drive to hollywood he phoned sean binchy forget the paintandchrome stuff heres something real you can do spelling out the precise wording of a warrant for the vanilla house he named a judge likely to speed things along see if you can get a current photo of heubel assholes a shapeshifter but maybe we can get a decent likeness yeah it is weird and all your fault sean im kidding you did good tony mancusis toyota remained where wed last seen it no answer to the bell ring we squeezed through a cramped walkspace narrowed further by ragged planting and made our way to the back of the building a slim rear door looked out to a dumpsterlined alley garbage overflowed the containers and specks of trash had blown up the asphalt i said this reminds me of something the back of leonora brights salon that so he scrutinized the alley stepped to the door solidcore hefty deadbolt please keep locked at all times sign affixed dead center the knob turned easily the door swung open mariachi music from somewhere upstairs was loud enough to soundtrack the hallway bright white hallway carelessly painted blue doors as we reached tony mancusis apartment a woman stepped out of another unit carrying two seethrough plastic bags she shot us a look continued toward the front door maam she stopped the badge made her flinch fiftyish short and solid with nutmeg skin and black hair tied in a tight bun the bags held party favors and bags of candy milo pointed se√±or esta aqui she shook her head left hurriedly milo s knock on mancusis door fought the beat of the music no reply harder rapping followed by mr mancusi its lieutenant sturgis had all the effect of a foam hammer he put his ear to the door if hes in there hes keeping it quiet the front door swung open and the woman with the bags came back in se√±ora said milo i speak english she said sorry for not answering but you scared me howd you get in back door was unlocked maam again just what we need youve had problems with breakins someone upstairs got robbed a few weeks ago i think they were drug dealers because they never called the police and right after they moved out before that there were a couple more incidents every time i see the door open i lock it but other people dont bother milo asked her name irma duran looks like someones having a party my grandsons class reward for reading accomplishment im a teachers assistant at his school on my way over there reason why i came back is someone else was looking for that guy his mother she seemed worried his mother said milo when was she here when i came out to take my grandson to school around six thirty raymond goes to a magnet in the valley we need to leave early she asked the same thing you did had i seen him said she was his mother and he hadnt called when he was supposed to i told her i hadnt seen him and she looked concerned and left is he okay you know mr mancusi i see him once in a while weve said hello thats about it mostly he keeps to himself what did his mother look like maam i really didnt get a good look at her because i was busy with raymond and his backpack getting him to eat his sweet roll and drink his milk she sounded worried i felt sorry for her thats why i came back so you could contact her appreciate it ms duran she didnt by any chance leave a number no sorry do you remember anything about her appearance um tall and she had a nice car white lexus i saw her driving away that was a little surprising what was her having money because he looks like he shops at a thrift store now that i think about it she was just the opposite well dressed classy said irma duran in an oldfashioned way like one of those women you see in old movies all put together suit stockings shoes big leather handbag like that agatha christie detective miss marple he said i love those books said irma duran exactly like that conservative sensible except for her scarf that was different really colorful big like a shawl all kinds of wild colors is the son a drug dealer why would you suspect that he doesnt do anything all day never had a visitor that ive seen oh i guess that means he isnt a dealer at least not out of his apartment milo said moms his first visitor moms care said irma duran she seemed so as if shed been putting up with him for a while milo kicked the door hard the rip of splintering wood cut through trumpets and guitarr√≥n but the panel remained shut his second attempt broke it free of the frame we stood back mancusis murphy bed listed from the wall at an acute angle propped in place by a nightstand a pair of arms extended from the sides of the mattress gray mattress except where it was reddish brown most of it reddish brown splotches the same color topped the nightstand ran down the drawers spread on the carpet one of the hands was missing two fingers the severed digits sat in their own pool of blood shriveled and white desiccated grubs a blood trail led to the shabby kitchenette milo got closer to the threshold kept his feet in the hall but stuck his head inside the apartment i heard a sharp intake of breath peered around him on the counter next to a box of advil sat an empty half gallon of diet tonic water to the left of the bottle sat a spherical thing on a dinner plate thing with droopy yellow hair tony mancusis eyes were open but his mouth was shut the plate made it worse hed been served up a cannibal entr√©e milo said oh lord i had nothing to add chapter milo gloved up propped mancusis door in place left the building smoked composed himself got the yellow tape out of his trunk a cloudbank cleared the sun rodney drive almost looked pretty i sat on the curb trying to clear my head waste of time no trick of my trade was up to the task tony mancusi was hollywood s first homicide of the year and milo phoned detective petra connor she was on vacation in greece and her partner raul biro summoned the crime scene crew and the coroner biro was young an afghanistan vet thoughtful perceptive with freakish stamina hed emerged from mancusis apartment expressionless took notes as milo summarized tugging at a pale blue brocade tie that didnt need adjustment thick dark hair starting to gray prematurely was sprayed in place his suit was navy tailored spotless paper booties protected spitpolished loafers when milo finished he said let me frame this in my head youre figuring bright heubel whichever you want to call him has been here before knows the backs usually unlocked or he picks the lock because he knows how to do that same deal for getting access to mancusis apartment once in does his thing on his way out he encounters the neighbor pretends to be looking for mancusi makes his getaway sounds logical but im thinking there could be another possibility loo after mancusi ditched the heshe he met up with bright and they returned here together milo scratched the side of his nose could be though mancusi mightve been wary of him raul said if bright and mancusi were real good buddies before mancusi couldve given bright a key maybe brights been here out of drag when i get back ill see if theres a recent photo canvass the tenants however bright gained access weve got a pretty good fix on the time frame we saw mancusi leave gorditos around two fortyfive the neighbor saw fake mom here at six thirty almost four hours is time enough to do his thing clean himself up he stashes his tools in that big leather purse the neighbor described slips out in broad daylight no sweat because hes got a great cover biro closed his pad dowdy drag except for the scarf lots of blood back there but i didnt see any impact spatter how about you milo shook his head so im thinking mancusi was likely dead when he got cut up loo bright couldve used the scarf to choke him out got himself a passive corpse to dissect for shonsky he used the scarf as a prop stabbed her to death for all his victims we know of the weapon was a knife but he mixes it up identitywise so maybe he likes variety in his methods too i said a stealth strangulation for mancusi makes sense tony was a heavy man making him harder to subdue and wary because he knew or suspected what bright was capable of biro said sneak up behind get the scarf around the neck avoid a violent struggle keeping it quiet at three four am he fooled with his tie again first mama now the son hes got something against this family if only it was that simple raul the psycho dogooder thing huh in his mind hes helping out then he snaps i said the dogooder thing is a power play he was a cruel kid killed his own sister for bigtime financial gain developed a taste for playing god making the rules said biro he picks the who and the when and the how but mancusi got done because bright was worried hed talk milo said thats how we see it serving it up on that plate thats a whole different universe of bad milo lit another cigarillo inhaled for a long time and blew smoke at the sky if he followed me when i was trailing tony saw me put tasha in the car that coulda been tonys death warrant because bright knew tasha was at the party when tony griped about his mother figured too close for comfort i said if bright was watching tony hed already been thinking about snipping loose ends he grunted biro said how we dividing the chores mancusis yours the rest is my headache you have any problems with this expanding to what another tug at the tie this many bodies over all these years a suspect that psycho someone suggests a task force i really dont see how we can stop it milo said we take it wherever it goes raul biro said meanwhile we work with what weve got starting with finding the heshe you want me to get vice over to gorditos tonight let me cover that you concentrate on this biro flipped through his pad so we know whodunit and maybe at least part of whydunit and howdunit now all we have to do is find this altruist a slow smile brightened his unlined face rich old lady maybe i should start visiting some of those womens clubs bridge bingo high tea whatever bygone generation raul actually loo they still do the tea bit out in pasadena and san marino you grew up there nope east la said biro my mother cleaned rooms at the huntington a crime scene tech emerged from the apartment in full hazmat suiting unmasked wiped sweat from his face got the bathroom dark enough to luminol detectives lots of swipe marks and someone used granulated cleanser but theres a whole lot of hemoglobin left tub floor sink oodles in the shower oodles said milo thats a technical term said the tech this ones something huh got a spare smoke at three thirty pm we left the scene and cruised by gorditos two rangy hookers not even close to feminine sat nibbling and drinking and gabbing a trio of construction workers occupied a nearby table everyone minding their own business milo said drive a little and circle back well keep trying for a while once tasha finds out tony got sliced shes a sure rabbit his cell beeped whats up sean any resemblance better than nothing zip a copy over to raul biro the smart one worked with petra yeah him anything else good get over to the house and be in charge while the techies do their thing i dont care about that sean if any of those chrome mavens have a problem tell em to call me now read everything youve got go slow and enunciate i got old ears he listened for several minutes worked his jaws clicked off got a twoyearold dmv shot on nicholas heubel unfortunately the photo shows him with a full gray beard and a shaved head and the address he listed is a pob in brentwood that he only rented the month he applied for the lease on the house he gave three references ansel d bright san francisco roland korvutz new york and a mel dabson here in la i said establish a fake identify and back yourself up with your real name clever boy huh the leasing company says brights reference was glowing and the number they reached him at traces back to a prepaid cell korvutz never responded to the request unlike this dabson character who said hed known heubel for years nicky was upright honest and dependable two out of three plus twentyfour grand in cash was enough to close the deal i said where in la does dabson live he checked his notes altair terrace zip code looks like not too far from here in the hollywood hills i said wonder if you can see the sign from there i made several passes up and down highland drove over to santa monica where transsexual and male hookers share the stroll with varying degrees of harmony milo looked for tasha while he worked the phone trying for background on melvin then mel dabson no such individual i said could be another alter ego he ran autotracks and criminal searches using melford melrose meldrim and melnick sat back cursing a call to the state franchise tax board on dabson came up empty but a brief chat with a helpful clerk at the county assessor brought a smile to his face trammel dabson been paying the property tax on altair terrace for twentyone months a dive back into ncic came up empty i said trammel means to hinder building word power every day he phoned sean to check on the toss of the brentwood house empty clean no cars in the garage as he shut his eyes and leaned back something caught my eye at the edge of a strip mall near orange drive rise and shine i pointed he jerked upright pull over chapter this time tasha ran oh great said milo as she ducked off santa monica onto orange and veered into an alley he jumped out of the car and i circled the block to mansfield when i got to the mouth of the alley tasha was racing toward me skinnylegged sprint easily outstripping milo s openmouthed lumber shoes in hand panty hose shredding milo s arms churned air his face was crimson tasha looked back at him picked up speed saw me looked back again stumbled she went down hard on her back purse landing just out of reach from a splayed arm as she got to her feet milo caught up sucking air he flipped her over did a quick frisk and cuff snarled a command not to move snagging the purse he dumped the contents tissues condoms cosmetics and a packet of oreos landed on the asphalt then a clatter as a pearlhandled straight razor slid out still panting milo stomped the weapon hard ground pearl into dust hauled tasha up hard idiot he said she grew limp in his grasp her face crumpled bits of gravel clung to her pancake veneer she began working up a smile milo s snarl killed that he put her in the back of the car used the seat belt for further confinement this time he got in front tasha jangled the cuffs you can take these off i wont run sir i promise sir open your mouth again pant pant and ill hogtie you to me hollywood station sir thats not necessary milo strained so hard for oxygen that his bulk rose off the seat i drove tasha said least its a nice ride love these old caddylackers what was it confiscated from some shut the hell up sorry sir are you deaf five blocks from wilcox avenue sir dont get mad but youre still breathing hard you sure youre okay why the hell did you rabbit i got scared did we hurt you the first time no but but what silence milo said god forbid you should miss a trick idiot a girls got to make a living youre not gonna be living if you dont stop acting like a moron guess who got cut right after he left you someone got cut you really are deaf long silence youre not saying tony youre ready for jeopardy genius tony got cut omigod is he all right milo said quite the opposite you mean were talking one trick that wont be giving you any repeat business omigod ohsweetlord it happened right after he saw you said milo were figuring someone was watching besides us who who who whats that your owl imitation who sir please think ugly suit and seamed stockings him omigod no way you know something about him we dont no sir no but i just never knew someone who did that all those years on the street said milo spare me the innocence i seen fights sir seen a man beat another man to death over a wrong look seen people all doped up losing their lives cause a seen plenty of badmen sir but no not that never something like that not what something all controlled how do you know it was controlled wannaboos said tasha its all about the game tony didnt do nothing to nobody right why not tony was weak there was no anger in him just sadness youre right about one thing said milo this was real controlled i dont wanna know sir please dont tell me details fine but we like details lets hear everything you know about tweed nothing else i swear nothing milo turned to me this is not going well pard tasha said just what i told you sir thats everything i know how many parties have you been to with tweed just that one why not more silence what was the problem said milo its not a place i gone to again thats no answer tasha said its to be honest no one invited me when we got to the rear door at hollywood station she said you dont need to lock me up i promise milo whistled dixie sir theres a problem a real problem usually they only got one girl cell free cause all the troublemakers are boys and if the girl rooms all full they put you in a boy room and its dangerous you have equipment for the girl room silence do you barely audible not yet im saving up nothing i can do then you know the rules i am human sir not plumbing what can i say tough tone but his cheek muscles twitched please sir other policemen are nice to me i dont make trouble

and ill do anything you tell you what said milo you cooperate i wont book you for the blade even though you were already warned or for resisting even though you made me exercise yes sure of course what does cooperate mean youre a material witness i might even get you a snack that is so kind sir you did lose my oreos hollywood division obliged with an empty interview room where milo stashed tasha he brought her a donut and a coke phoned raul biro at the murder scene on rodney biro was still waiting for access to the apartment had some forensic guesses to pass along tony mancusis head had been sawed off right beneath the chin leaving most of the necks internal structure intact care had been taken to sever vertebrae without breaking them clean work the coroners investigators guess was a large extremely sharp nonserrated blade consistent with the weapon that had dispatched ella mancusi the same weapon had probably been used on tonys fingers exploratory cuts on the other hand suggested intent for a bilateral amputation maybe he got bored said biro or ran out of time final disposition was the coroners purview but the ci a registered nurse with twenty years experience admitted off the record that the hyoid cartilage appeared ruptured pinpoint hemorrhages in the eyes couldve been due to a number of causes but combined with the neck injury strangulation was a decent possibility lets see if the doc agrees milo looked for the altair terrace address in a thomas guide found a single block of curving deadend tributary off the northeastern edge of beachwood drive not far from a rentahorse ranch where i used to ride when i worked at western pediatric walking distance from franklin avenue but heavily wooded and freakishly quiet i remembered how bends in the trail opened abruptly to dry flat mesas the vulgar message of the hollywood sign milo said im starved and called out for four barbecued beef sandwiches from a place on western i had one he ate two he passed the last one to tasha who said normally i stay away from red meat but that smells yum by six forty the sky was feltgray deepening to black and we put her back in the seville she said im still tasting that lovely sauce milo said behave yourself and you can have dessert so kind sir i do like this car i drove up beachwood parked two blocks south of altair terrace milo unbelted time for a little hike sir its uphill you sure youre okay your concern is touching lets go is this guaranteed safe what are you worried about he could see me what makes you think hes here youre taking me here this is to jog your memory i already told you this is definitely the place were not on the street yet this is it i feel it esp i get feelings she said in my hair the roots get all tingly means im getting a message out of the car one block later can we at least go slow sir my poor little feet are so sore i offered to get you some sneakers with this dress as if can we just go slow milo exhaled and shortened his steps tasha winked at me ebony night no sidewalks or streetlights wide spacing between the properties filled with unruly greenery and oldgrowth trees a world in silhouette tasha said thats the party house im sure lets go whisper sorry thats the party i heard you which one um were not there yet forward march ninety seconds later thats the one all the way on top whisper dammit sorry sorry thats it for sure a longnailed hand pointed to a low pale box perched on the uppermost rim of the culdesac milo motioned us to stay in place hiked past three houses then four more stopped just short of the target waited hazarded a quick flashlight wash of the fa√ßade blank but for a single shuttered window garage to the left with a corrugated aluminum door the flashlight beam dipped to a cement walkway pines and eucalyptus towered behind the flat roof sparse vegetation in front a spindly yucca plant and a stunted palm milo padded back youre sure tasha said absolutely sir that stupid spiky thing got a run in my stocking and over theres where if you step out in back you can see the sign and over there is where tony resthissoul and me walked tracing the curve of the culdesac its all coming back to me out there is where all the coyote screaming came from i got so scared sir it was dark just like it is now i hate the darkness can we go stay put with my partner he retraced his climb got closer to the pale house tasha said all that climbing cant be good for him i didnt answer he should work out you dont say much sir its too weird out here real scaryquiet know what i mean like somethings gonna jump out like somethings gonna quiets basically an evil thing the devil likes quiet the devil likes you to think everythings nice and quiet then he jumps up and grabs you this is a bad quiet even fontana had a better quiet than this quiet when the chickens were all sleeping you could hear the train i liked to lie in bed listening to the train and wondering where it was going okay here he is again maybe he seen enough and we can get outta here milo said cant be sure but looks like no one home tasha said my hair says thats a message from god lets get outta here find us some noise chapter as we descended altair terrace milo phoned in outlining a surveillance plan for later that night at beachwood tasha said im feeling my appetite coming back you can drop me at the baskinrobbins before milo could answer headlights whitewashed us single vehicle climbing from the south milo pushed tasha into the brush the headlights reached the intersection vw bus a dim color hard to make out in the darkness grinding noise as its tires turned left onto altair tasha said they need transmission fluid milo stepped out reached for the side of the bus just as it turned tapped the passenger door one hand on his holstered gun the other waving his badge the bus stopped short milo made a cranking motion the passenger window rolled down manually the drivers hand remained on the handle as she leaned toward him young woman thirty or so with wide surprised eyes and short brown hair the rear of the bus was piled high with cardboard boxes do you live on this street maam uhhuh somethings wrong nothing to be alarmed about do you know the occupants of the house at the end of the road not really no i theyre not there not around much her eyes flicked to the rear of the bus nope milo said everything okay maam you surprised me i have to go officer have a child to look after biting her lip she gunned the engine ground the gears lurched forward nearly running over milo s foot he fell back barely held on to his balance we watched as the bus puttputted up altair tasha said maybe its me but thats one scared girl we stayed in the shadows watched as the bus parked between the pale house and its nearest neighbor i said when you asked if she lived here she said somethings wrong statement not a question milo got on the phone again whispered orders the van sat there for several minutes before the woman got out and unlatched the rear doors shaking her head as if responding to an unseen questioner a second figure emerged from the bus taller short hair shirt and pants male he pointed at the woman and the two of them pulled something out of the van rectangular a carton maybe four feet long the man straightarmed the woman away completed the extrication lowered the box to the ground the bump was audible the woman let out a highpitched noise the mans hand on her shoulder silenced her she reached for the box he slapped her hand away pointed again she moved several feet away stood there hand to mouth the man began rocking the carton let go of it the woman lunged forward broke the fall straightened the box the man placed his hands on his hips the sound of laughter filtered down altair the woman tried to lift the carton failed the man grasped one end and the two of them carried it toward the pale house milo said here goes aerobics and took off on big rubbersoled feet chapter i heard the scuffle before i saw it tasha shivered grabbed a branch for support leaves rattled i said dont budge an inch you dont have to convince me sir i followed milo s pathway up the street twenty feet from the house the details kicked in milo s feet planted twohanding his mm the weapon aimed at the smiling face of the man who called himself nicholas heubel fast uphill run but not a trace of raspy breath heubel wore a scoopedneck peasant blouse white culottes that exposed hairy ankles red bakelite earrings red lipstick a twoday beard stubble and granny glasses rounded out the ensemble bad joke if not for the arm around the shorthaired womans neck forcing her backward so that her spine arched and her eyes watched the sky in heubels other hand a little black pistol pressed against the top of the carton seemed to be piercing the carton embedded in a hole at the top the woman said please let him go he doesnt have much air milo said good idea dale heubel didnt respond the woman said my baby and heubel put weight on the gun drove it deeper into the box he said maybe the merciful thing would be to blow his little tot brains out please howled the woman lights went on in a house midway down altair heubel said now look what youve done and pushed the gun so deep the barrel disappeared into the box cardboard flexed he kicked the carton noise leaked from within muffled cries oh god please please i beg you said the woman heubel choked off her voice with an arm twist milo said bad idea dale heubel said im the idea guy in a strange vacant voice i called for backup dale the smart thing is defuse this now dale said heubel who in the world is that the cries from the box got louder then coughing the woman said he cant breathe heubel said life is transitory makes us appreciate what we have please hes only two milo took a step closer heubel kicked the box again milo edged nearer heubel said sneak up like that again and ill bambam bam bam emilio said the woman hes got a name lets just take it easy said milo good idea said heubel im as mellow as layer cake anyone for anagrams the woman whimpered milo said theyll be here any moment dale heubel said dont insult my intelligence i know its only you and you dont have a radio i called dale quick arm twist the woman gasped shush now said heubel i believe in happy endings dont you chiquita yes yes please let him go i guess my definition differs from yours milo said the last thing i want to do is insult your intelligence but your presence insults my intelligence grinding the gun into the box milo said nice outfit whos your tailor heubel gave a start the gun hand loosened for a second i jumped out shouting freeze drop the gun drop it or something like it who remembers heubels head swiveled hard toward the intrusion relaxing his choke hold long enough for the woman to twist her head lower she bit down on his arm he shook her off said byebye emilio milo emptied his weapon heubel stood there for an instant threw up his hands as if surrendering fell one of his earrings flew off like a speck of hail the woman dove at the box managed to keep it upright ripped the lid off screaming pulled out a sobbing flailing toddler and held him to her breast heubel made an odd little squeaky noise when the child calmed down the woman carried him over to heubels body kicked viciously chapter the womans named was felicia torres and she was twentyeight her husband a landscaper studying biology at night had been sent by the national guard to iraq three months ago without stuarts income the young familys savings depleted quickly and felicia began looking for temp jobs no computer skills limited her options for office work she lowered her sights a couple of officecleaning jobs downtown hadnt worked out because the babysitting money just about wiped out her salary the craigslist ad for a twoday housestraightening position in brentwood had seemed promising great neighborhood generous pay and the man who answered at the number sounded friendly generous pay translated to twenty dollars an hour way more than felicia had hoped for when nick readily agreed to let her bring emilio along that clinched it with her hyundai in the shop shed needed to take the bus from her onebedroom in venice and walk a ways on sunset pushing emilio in his stroller the street was hard to find and there were no sidewalks so the stroller bumped a lot but that helped put emilio to sleep when she finally found the house she knew she had a winner gorgeous and huge like something out of house garden shiny white lexus in front she knocked on the door and that same friendly voice said its open cmon in nick was just as nice in person kind of lanky real well built goodlooking in that olderrichguy way he handed her a hundreddollar bill this is your advance keep track of your hours and let me know when youre due for more the house was even huger than it looked from the outside with cathedral ceilings and white walls real bright even with the lights off probably cheery when furnished now to felicias surprise it was totally empty and really pretty cleanlooking but it was nicks money and she liked the feel of that hundred in the pocket of her jeans emilio was still snoozing away felicia looked for a place to park the stroller nick smiled whispered cute led her to a room at the back where hed set up a toddler gate and some toys unbelievable when she tried to thank him he shrugged took the stroller and wheeled it into a corner sunlight glowing through a big spotless window turned patches of oak floor gold no glare on emilio nick had put the stroller in a cool shady corner such a considerate man through the glass felicia saw a really lush tropicaltype garden and a blue lap pool she wondered what stuart would think of the plantings they looked okay to her but she wasnt picky cute toys some of them still in boxes nick grinned i cant believe you took the time sir no big whoop felicia using her name like theyd known each other for a long time she said to me it sure is this had to cost nick placed a finger on her lips the main thing is when he wakes up hell get all jazzed he will for sure these are just what he likes do you have kids sir not yet i went over to toyland asked the salesgirl that is so felicia if no one went the extra yard the world would be a pretty sad place cmon let me show you the gig anytime you need to tend to little man feel free felicia felt her eyes swell maybe nick sensed her emotion i like to help he said kind of selfish really makes me feel good emilio woke up in an okay mood the toys overwhelmed him and he got hyper but then he calmed down and focused on some plastic cars making that seriousoldman crunchedup face that reminded felicia of her dad in florida the only funny thing was emilio didnt seem to like nick got all whiny when nick tried to talk to him but her son was a shy boy not used to strangers the main thing he was occupied and felicia could work steadily the gig was different you couldnt ask for anything easier felicia wondered why nick was willing to pay someone to drymop every inch of wall and floor scrub down granite counters and appliances in the clearly unused kitchen when nick made her go over the walls a second then a third time gave her freshly shredded tshirts and ammonia spray to really get down into the corners she thought it was a little weird but it was his money and the takeout thai food he ordered from a place in the county mart was delicious not to mention the candy for emilio knowing somehow that she loved thai shed use a toothbrush and a magnifying glass if thats what he wanted while she cleaned nick kept busy in the master bedroom emerged from time to time to inquire if she and emilio were okay between the second and the third gorounds when she made a joke about it being like one of those forensics shows on tv cleaning up the evidence nick thought that was hilarious on the second day the bus was late and so was she but nick was cool about it he patted emilios head and had felicia go over the dining room again then he showed her into the master bedroom the only part of the house she hadnt been this was different clothing was piled everywhere on the bed the floor in the closet except for one section where stacks of folded cardboard boxes stood ready to be assembled as if the contents of the entire house had been concentrated in one space please fold everything and pack but not too tight he told her if you can arrange it loosely by color that would be great but dont worry if its not perfect do you know how to fold these sides to make the boxes sure then youre all set big smile im going out for a while i left drinks in the fridge and some snacks its really nice having you help me felicia me too she said boy did that sound stupid um afterward after the food is gone do i need to scrub down the fridge again nick thought about that no that wont be necessary it didnt take long to realize everything was for a woman big woman expensive stuff a lot of it vintage gowns and dresses silk blouses and skirts tweed suits a whole collection of those silky negligees and panty hose and real silk stockings you needed garters and clips for shed never actually seen those before lots of bras size fortyfour c on the bottom of one pile she found a bunch of cute little leather boxes filled with costume jewelry tucked in a corner were cool old hatboxes round and hexagonal containing feathery cloches felt derbies berets delicate straws with fake wooden cherries sticking out of the bands one blue plaid cap that looked like a mans but women with hat faces looked cute in them too she tried that one on tilted it at a jaunty angle grinned at the mirror people had told her she had a hat face parting two other stacks in the corner revealed a bunch of plastic bags containing tubes and jars of highend cosmetics some of it all dried up but she packed it anyway nick was the boss in a humongous plastic bag she found a dozen wigs with tissue paper between them all different colors and styles in a matching bag were the little foam dealies you put wigs on the coolest find was thirtythree of the nicest scarves felicia had ever seen vuitton and armani and chanel and escada and some others shed never heard of she counted them because shed never seen so much gorgeous handpainted silk in one place no mens stuff not a single sock felicia wondered if nick was a costume designer or maybe married to an actress who traveled needed all those changes big woman maybe a

shed lost all her preg weight but twentyfive months later was still a little poochy in front favored baggy sweatshirts no competition for nicks glamorous wife stupid thought like the fantasies that had begun filling her mind since last night lying in bed hoping emilio would sleep through the night thinking about stuart in fallujah it had been three weeks since shed heard from him and no way would she listen to the news all news did was make everything as horrible as possible stuarts face faded from view nicks took its place felicia felt stupid and ashamed fought the fantasy but it kept coming back and finally she gave in her and nick it starts off all friendly totally innocent theyre both good people the two of them in that vanillacolored house beautiful warm sunny day shes mopping dusting sweeping stuff outside she goes outside by the pool to dustpan it up its so hot she peels off her sweatshirt underneath is that skimpy black tank top the one stuart always asked her to put on when they for some reason shed worn it to work no bra she stretches bends down accidentally flashes a full view of her dangling boobs thats okay no one there uhoh there is nick lounging under a palm tree reading a book wearing swim trunks nothing else nice body not an ounce of fat he sees her smiles she smiles back shyly her eyes drift to his swim trunks uhoh thats kinda hard to miss nick blushes tries to hide the evidence with a book she smiles walks over to him real slow both of them working at controlling themselves because theyre good people but remembering last nights fantasy felicias cheeks burned her knees felt weak from the corner room with the toys emilio cried thank god for the interruption at the end of the third day nick came home around five pm whistling and looking happy and carrying a big brown leather bag that couldve been a purse or one of those things guys use felicia said you want me to pack that too not necessary looks like youve made excellent progress felicia she had getting through most of the clothing everything folded and organized perfectly by color and fabric she bragged about it silk with silk linen with linen nick flashed his big white smile removed his glasses and looked at her with clear brown eyes felicia loved the fact that she could please someone her own happiness was an elusive thing she knew stuart wrote as often as he could but nick said why dont you take a break cool fingers grazed the nape of her neck when had he moved close enough to do that felicia drew back feeling the scorch of her cheeks wondering if shed done something to let him know what was flying through her head his smile turned crooked im going to look over these boxes see if theres anything i want you to change i hope theres more work said felicia youre a great boss why had she said that nick laughed boss were two people whove reached an agreement take a break felicia go chill by the pool drink something youre sweating running a finger along her arm she shivered sure he closed the door to the master bedroom and she went to the kitchen brought a diet peach snapple outside along with a carton of strawberries from the collection of luscious fresh fruit nick had bought at the country mart this morning she stretched out in a lounge chair the same one shed imagined nick in stretched and yawned and half a bottle of tea and seven berries later the sun did a number on her head when she awoke the sky was dark and her watch said shed been out for thirtyfive minutes now shed have to bus back later than she liked walk those streets where gangbangers sometimes cruised omigod emilio hadnt eaten dinner then why wasnt he crying she hurried inside to the toy room no emilio she called his name heard a funny sound like a bird when its wings were restrained from the master bedroom rushing there she found the door closed opened it nick had pushed boxes out of the way and created a narrow space where emilio now sat in his stroller surrounded on three sides like her baby was being walled in he saw her and wailed maaamaaa nick said poor little guy he woke up cranky she turned to him gaped nick was dressed in a lavender satin ball gown lowcut something stuffed in the bodice to plump his chest up to cleavage hairy cleavage he had on dangling violetcolored earrings tacky purplish lipstick real whorey fake eyelashes combined with his short hair and beard stubble it was it was pivoting and cocking a hip he wiggled his butt at her then at emilio maaamaaa voil√† said nick tr√®s chic non emilio cried louder for some crazy reason felicia laughed she didnt know why no matter how many times shed try to figure it out she would never come up with why because she didnt think it was funny not any of it what she did feel was grossed out and freaked out and what came out was laughter and that changed everything about nick and he had a gun chapter i spent most of the day after at western pediatric medical center listening to felicia torres guiding her through the hospital system observing emilio the little boy clung to his mother mute and tense physically okay according to dr ruben eagle an old friend and head of the outpatient division we agreed that rochelle kissler a brilliant young psychologist whod been my student would be perfect for the long term i introduced both of them to felicia stayed with her after they left and asked if there was

delaware being helpful thats what he pretended what kind of sick joke was that i didnt answer i never trusted him doctor not from the minute i met him milo and i decompressed at a bar in santa monica eleven pm hed spent his day with raul biro and two other hollywood detectives going through the house on altair terrace one of the homes dale bright had bought as nicholas heubel the other was a cabin near palmdale where hed confined felicia torres in a bathroom forced her to imagine what he was doing to emilio mostly hed ignored the child letting him cry then scream no food or water then a quick drop into a shipping carton airholes to prolong the ordeal milo said i know im supposed to have a reaction to shooting anyone but god help me alex i wish id had more bullets three of five rooms on altair were filled with mementos nice view of the hollywood sign from a corner of the deck white lexus in the garage the bentley had been moved from the lapd motor lab to the same departmentsanctioned tow yard where kat shonskys car had been ignored i said maybe the chief can use it as his official ride milo said harness a couple of thoroughbreds to the front bumper be perfect ansell dale brights medicine cabinet yielded nothing stronger than aspirin and overthecounter sinus remedies under the sink was a polished blackwalnut box filled with ampules of synthetic testosterone its birdseye maple mate held plasticsealed hypodermic needles pumping himself up said milo to go with a dress i threw up my hands he finished his martini and told me about the passports under half a dozen aliases the trove of documents that traced brights path from new york to london then paris lisbon back to england ireland scotland final stop zurich trammel dabson was another pilfered identity same dob as bright and the unfortunate nicholas heubel the original owner of the identity an infant buried in the morton hall cemetery in edinburgh bright had done a gravestone rubbing mounted it in a scrapbook one of fifteen scrapbooks chronicle of a life lived in costume the souvenirs werent limited to paper in a small basement cut into the hillside behind the house milo discovered a trio of footlockers filled with firearms knives two acetylene blowtorches stout rope surgical gloves and tools scalpels probes tissue spreaders vials of poison newspaper clippings from foreign papers created another chronology unsolved murder of the landlord of a rooming house in the eleventh arrondissement of paris disappearance of an oxford publican with a famously nasty disposition an article in portuguese yet to be translated but the grainy snapshot of a heavyset woman and the recurrent word assasinato said plenty the brentwood house had served as a front and yielded nothing of forensic value upscale address for the social life brightasheubel had hoped to live as a financial advisor soraya hamidpour had a client from the industry ready to move in access to brights computer was easy no encryption and his password was bright guy his hard drive contained mostly financial files algorithms for trading performance histories linkups to bourses around the world and a scatter of sadistic pornography in a separate folder were five drafts of a prospectus nicholas st heubel iii had composed and dated two years previous plans to start hydroworth a hedge fund emphasizing oil commodity trading bright had appended a puffedup bio lied about attending eton harvard and wharton termed himself a brilliant tactician and financial soothsayer the boast had some basis in fact upon arrival in london from new york hed used fake credentials to get a job at a brokerage house in london learned to trade futures well enough to earn enormous performance bonuses and a letter of commendation from the managing director within eighteen months hed quit was investing for himself nine years after inheriting million his savings had grown to million not counting the swiss bank account which would take a while to access something else from switzerland mounted at the back of one of the scrapbooks was an elegantly handwritten receipt from a clinic in lugano nothing itemized the franc conversion translated to fiftyfive thousand american dollars maybe a drug problem one of those highend rehab places said milo but except for the machojuice we didnt find anything iffy couldve been successful rehab i said if so too bad for society what do you mean he got his head clear enough to chop off other peoples despite nicholas st heubel iiis financial acumen hed picked up no clients and hydroworth remained a scheme i said superficially charming but maybe when they got to know him he spooked them like he did the sisters too cute for his own good the game was too much fun raul found something he wrote on a hard copy of the prospectus time for a frugal lifestyle funnel in on whats important getting his priorities straight i said he said another too bad as we worked on our second round of drinks milo s phone vibrated on the bar inaudible above the drone of bartalk and an old football game on espn classic he watched it jump like a mexican bean chewed his olive swallowed picked up sturgis youre up late doc that so oh man i do appreciate it anything else true ill ask him thanks for letting me know emptying his glass he waved for a refill i said which doc was that steinberg at the coroners ol dales autopsy was prioritized orders from the chief all those bullet holes an autopsy was necessary policeinvolved shootings must be treated with utmost care he pronounced as if talking about someone else his drink came he sipped hummed something i couldnt make out i said what he placed his glass on the bar twirled the stem turns out dalenickmr bizarro had no balls literally surgically removed nice neat job all healed over the swiss clinic i hear money buys you anything there he pays to get castrated i said takes testosterone to stay masculine no doubt youve got an explanation based on your training and expertise above us on screen someone made a thirtyyard run for a touchdown ancient history but some of the drinkers at the bar got excited i said i could theorize about the desire for total control regulating his dosage enjoying the fluctuation but i snagged the bartenders attention pointed at milo s glass mouthed me too chapter two days after the rescue of felicia and emilio torres milo was called to the chiefs office for what he assumed was a pat on the back that morning wed both been at the coroners and i stayed with him for the short ride to parker center the forensic pathologist had been asked to conduct a psychological autopsy and wanted my professional opinion on the psychological motivation behind ansell dale brights selfmutilation hormonal manipulation and fascination with macabre altruism id rattled off a bunch of jargon that seemed to make everyone happy as milo pulled into the headquarters staff lot he said why dont you come up his majesty would probably like to meet you probably he has his moods thanks anyway ill catch some air he went inside and i took a walk nothing much to see but the fall air was clean for downtown la and the homeless guys i passed seemed tranquil half an hour later i was back in front of headquarters and milo was pacing been here long big guy twenty minutes short meeting i said cuz jacksons other claimed bodies have frittered to nothing the only thing holding texas back from spiking the bastard is antoine pointing his finger and beetling his brows do something lieutenant not a word about bright crossdressing bastard got what he deserved back to the hollywood hills watching wilson goods house after dark a night of nothing followed by a day of the same hard to find shelter on the high sunny street but milo really wasnt hoping for much the second night i offered to come along he said too much free time something like that mr dotcoms executive secretary had phoned this morning announcing her bosss intention to visit his commission in three days robin was working overtime to assemble the mandolin she said youre okay with being here can i hold your tools when you get in a certain frame of mind everything you say sounds suggestive and the problem is absolutely nothing i parked the seville at the southern edge of wilson goods street close enough for a long view of the house and the electric mesh gate that caged its frontage a couple of lowvoltage spots created useless puddles of illumination most of the enclosure was dark i said wheres the red bull milo said drank coffee all day we settled in for the long haul no need to two minutes later we both spotted movement behind the mesh the man was trapped slinking into a corner he ignored milo s command to show himself huddled low trying to look small milo stood out of view hand on gun hed used the weapon more this week than in months previous out pal lets have a look at you freeway hum put your hands on your head and walk backward toward the sound of my voice now the distant bovine moan of a truck horn milo repeated the order louder nothing suit yourself friend one way or the other youre coming out silence you like fire hoses zoom zoom zoom from miles away he called for three hollywood patrol cars and a locksmith five officers arrived under the tutelage of a sergeant who scoped out the situation and said dont see what we can do the locksmith showed up ten minutes later squinted at the gate from ten yards away he armed dont know what do you expect me to do thats electric anyway i cant do anything with it any suggestions use a tactical nuclear weapon gee thanks welcome can i go now five more minutes of nothing before milo called out you up for a climb buddy no answer pal one way or the other youre busted the sergeant said maybe hes deaf central had a deaf guy last year got shot big trouble milo continued his monologue alternating cajoling with threats when he said okay do the tear gas a voice from behind the gate said ill come out a figure stepped out to the center of the enclosure the moon lit up half his face thin gaunt black man ragged hair scruffy beard sagging clothes hands on your head scrawny arms shot up fast turn around and walk toward me back up so youre touching the gate the man said i know the drill milo cuffed both his hands to the mesh gate thought you wanted me out of here officer i climbed in could climb out milo turned to the sergeant there should be some kind of manual control over there near the motor anyone in good shape the sergeant said someone feeling like tarzan a short stocky female officer said i used to do gymnastics go for it officer kylie after a couple of false starts kylie got a foothold on the mesh moments later shed scrambled up and over here it is right on the box milo told the cuffed man listen carefully gates gonna swing open just move with it dont panic i never panic said the man unflappable that too freed from the gate and recuffed the man stared off into space milo let the uniforms go sat him on the curb i finally get to meet you bradley bradley maisonette hung his head here to see your old pal will interesting way to visit you

frowned as if aware of his own odor for the first time milo offered him something to drink maisonette said ill take a steak filet mignon medium rare inside charred crisp on the outside with some nice fried onions caesar salad to start extra dressing red wine i prefer california over french pinot noir cooperate bradley i can get you caviar hate that stuff tastes like bad pussy turn either down

ceiling milo said is that a tough question bradley maisonette slid around in his chair ill take some food now and a coke real sugar no diet answer the question first maisonette rubbed his palms

happens sometimes how did antoine affect you me im cool not will maisonette hugged himself cold in here would you please turn down the ac milo said what preyed on will he did something to twan you and he did something together maisonettes head turned slowly his eyes filled with tears you think that mr maisonette ive got a sixteenyearold homicide all stirred up like you said and two supposed friends of the victim rabbiting supposed here are the facts we were best friends best i didnt do anything to antoine will didnt do anything to antoine antoine disappeared into thin air we didnt do it not will or me who did maisonette worked his hands through his hair dandruff snowed on the table milo slammed the table hard enough to twang the metal enough of this bullshit whatd happened to antoine real rage maisonette parried it with long cool stare nothing milo shot up to his feet leaned on the table nearly upended it with his weight sixteen years bradley antoines parents living with the pain of not knowing you and your socalled friend were at that funeral pretending to be all torn up sixteen fucking years maisonettes skinny frame began to shake say it maisonettes head dropped damn will will

aka howard cooper sayder sixteen years ago hed been the west coast sales professional for youth in action the company defunct for over a decade had turned out to be a scam taking cash for magazine subscriptions rarely delivered zint arrived in la in may after a stint in tucson set about recruiting students from local schools concentrating on minority kids using the racist logic that dark skin equaled poverty and poverty was a great motivator when antoine will and bradley met zint he was a smoothtalking thirtyfiveyearold selfdescribed former college jock able to sell anything now he was a middleaged inmate at the supermax prison in florence colorado the mug shot revealed a gaunt whitebearded apparition with dead eyes twentythree hours a day in your cell could do that to you especially with ninetytwo years left on a hundredyear sentence for abducting beating cutting and molesting scores of boys sixteen years ago zint hadnt yet progressed to violence was content to seduce his prey with cash and promises of video games running shoes cool athletic gear for the older boys hookups with hot babes it started off simply in la zint picked the three laughing black boys up on a street corner outlined their routes collected them at the end of their shifts advanced them money even though it was against the rules after trust was built up he began pulling them off early one at a time where icy cans of beer freshly rolled joints and pills zint assured them were just for relaxation awaited more cash was disbursed then zint played music from a boom box and watched smiling as the boys got all hazy what i mean by that said bradley maisonette is even now i cant be sure it actually happened even though yes i know it did maybe on my own i never wouldve come to that conclusion i dont know i really dont know i said but when will told you after he tried to jump off the long beach pier is when he told me second semester at college i held him back had to fight with him he was always big i said what the fuck you want to go and do that for thats when he told me deep breath i saved his life what does he do when hes finished talking hauls off and hits me rubbing his jaw i said man

zint didnt come back went into zints van and the van drove off which was different usually zint parked on a quiet street stayed in place to party like the van was his house he had housekeeping stuff in there food drinks books games all kinds of shit zint changed his style that day and drove off dont ask me where ive been asking myself that for sixteen years maisonette sprang up circled the room wedged his head in a corner stood that way for a while when he returned to the table he put his head down closed his eyes his lips moved after a while sound came out first time i said it was the first time twan went into the van nod his hair scraped the table twan didnt trust him twan was smarter than us but that day his eyes clenched oh god this is so he flung one hand over his cheek milo touched his shoulder youre doing the right thing maisonette sat up stared at something miles away sunken cheeks vibrated his eyes were red and wet twan went in there cause we said it was cool zint paid us fifty bucks to convince twan it was cool will didnt want to admit what happened to him same with me we told twan it was cool to go in there and he did and we never saw him again and now nobodys going

purchased zint drove to the undeveloped wilderness north of the la cienega oil fields and buried the boy on a dune somewhere on the eastern edge of what was now the kenneth hahn recreational area sixteen years later he drew a map development had resected the land in some places augmented others it took a while to find the spot bones the autopsy revealed no serious head injury but did highlight multiple cutmarks on antoines ribs ever the con zint had reached for one more guiltminimizing lie there was talk about negating the agreement and putting him on trial for murder sharna and gordon beverly said just give us antoine and leave us alone the funeral was held on a beautiful autumn morning over two hundred friends relatives and wellwishers the predictable sprinkle of politicians journalists and community activists trawling for photo ops bradley maisonette was nowhere to be found and neither was wilson good good and andrea had been staying at a motel in tarzana picked up their dog the day before wed found maisonette left town for parts unknown milo said hopefully someplace without a pier after the ceremony we queued up to pay our respects gordon beverly clasped our hands moved forward as if to embrace us stopped himself sharna beverly pushed aside her veil her face was carved mahogany her eyes clear and dry you did it lieutenant taking milo s face in both hands she kissed each cheek lowered the veil turned away and waited for the next person in line chapter robin pulled an allnighter and had the mandolin bound and varnished six hours before her patron was due to

he saw us on the terrace studied the house walked to the rear of the van muscle i said in case you dont want to give up the goods not funny said robin but she smiled large guy opened the vans rear doors a ramp descended electrically he reached in and guided out a wheelchair the figure in the chair was slight pale crewcut babyfaced wearing a black sweatshirt with the same logo and blue jeans nothing much filled the jeans as the chair rolled down the ramp his body flopped held in place by a leather strap around his middle one of his fingers pushed a button the chair rolled forward stopped he looked at the house just as his driver had taking in the steep stone steps that lead to the terrace on the other side an acutely sloping grass and rock pathway robin and i were attracted to the lot
