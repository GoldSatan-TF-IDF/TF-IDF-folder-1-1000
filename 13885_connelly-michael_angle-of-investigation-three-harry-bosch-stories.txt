michael connelly angle of investigation three harry bosch stories christmas even the three kings pawnshop on hollywood boulevard had been victimized by a burglar three times in two years the criminal methods of each breakin were similar and so it was suspected by the los angeles police department that the same thief was responsible each time but the thief was careful never to leave a fingerprint or any other clue to his identity no arrests were ever made and none of the stolen property was ever recovered nikolai servan the russian immigrant who owned the store was left to wonder about the justice system of his adopted country on the day before christmas of this year servan unlocked the rear door of the pawnshop entered and discovered that his business had been victimized a fourth time he also discovered that the burglar was still inside it was this discovery that ultimately brought detective harry bosch and his partner jerry edgar to the three kings pawnshop shortly after am they arrived in a slickback bosch had checked out of the motor pool at the hollywood division they knew a burglary detective named eugene braxton was already waiting inside the shop with nikolai servan along with the body look at that harry looks like a big old christmas present edgar remarked as bosch killed the engine just waitin for us to open it edgar was right the exterior walls of the small singlestory pawnshop were painted a garish red the yellow crime scene tape that had been strung across the front by the patrol officers looked like a bow bosch didnt bother to comment on his partners observation he got out and closed the car door bosch stood for a moment on the sidewalk and studied the front of the pawnshop it was between a porno emporium and a shop that offered private mailboxes a steel security gate had been folded openpresumably by servan that morning after he called the police bosch looked up at the sign on the front wall above the plateglass windows he saw that the triangular formation of three ballsthe international pawnshop emblemhad been modified to include a kings crown on each ball cute edgar said looking up at the sign too very bosch said lets get this done dont worry about me har im not going to hold things up its christmas eve i wanna wrap this thing up and get home early for a change bosch stepped in and moved through the front of the shop past the bicycles and golfeize clubs and antiques and musical instruments and reached the counter where braxton and servan waited braxton who had investigated the previous three burglaries at three kings had gotten there first because servan had his business card taped to the side of the telephone when the shop owner came to work that morning and found the dead burglar behind the jewelry case he didnt dial he dialed braxton merry christmas brax bosch said what have we got deck the halls harry braxton said weve got one less burglar in the world and that makes christmas a good one for me already bosch nodded and looked at servan who was seated on a tall stool on the other side of the counter he was about fifty with black hair thinning on the top he had a lot of muscle that was going soft he had no visible tattoos this is nikolai servan braxton said this is his store bosch reached a hand across the counter to shake servans hand the russian came off the stool and shook hands firmly mr servan im detective bosch this is detective edgar nick call me nick please his accent was heavy bosch guessed hed been in the country only a few years edgar reached across the counter and shook his hand as well bosch moved around braxton and over to the area behind the glass jewelry counter sprawled on the floor in this close space was the body he was a white man dressed head to toe in black all except for the right hand it was not wearing a glove while the left hand was bosch crouched like a baseball catcher next to the body and studied it without touching anything a knit ski mask had been pulled down over the face there were openings for the eyes and mouth bosch noted that the eyes were open and the lips were pulled back despite the teeth being closed together tightly he spoke without looking up whats the eta on me and sid on the way braxton said thats all i can tell you not much traffic today though the medical examiners team and the forensics people would be coming from downtown bosch and edgar had driven only eight blocks from the station where they were posted you know this guy brax cant see enough of him to know for sure bosch didnt say anything he waited he knew that braxton had to have taken a quick look under the ski mask even though this would have violated crime scene protocol it kind of looks like a guy i popped about five years back nathears bamed monty kelman braxton said bosch nodded local guy i take it most of the time from what i heard he used to take outoftown assignments was on a crew that took work from a setup guy named leo freeling worked out of the valley but leo got himself killed a few years back i think montys been sort of setting up his own capers since then works alone depends on the job bosch took a pair of latex gloves out of his pocket blew them up like balloons to make them fit better and then slipped them on he adjusted his position and tried to roll the body a little bit to check for wounds and the missing glove he didnt see anything but he didnt want to roll the body completely over until after photos were taken and the medical examiners investigators surveyed the scene so how did this guy die the question was rhetorical but he looked up at servan just as he said it it seemed to take the shop owner by surprise as if he had been accused of something servan spread his hands and shook his head i dont know this he said i come to shop unlock he is dead right there bosch nodded and looked around the counter area he noticed edgar was no longer there he looked at braxton brax why dont you take mr servan to one of the patrol cars so we can work in here while braxton took servan outside bosch went back to the body and continued his examination he lifted the bare hand and studied it trying to figure out why there was no glove he noticed a discoloration on the pad of the thumb a brownish yellow line there was a matching line of discoloration on the index finger using both hands he placed the thumb and finger together aligning the two marks it appeared as though the handthe right handhad been holding a pen or some other thin instrument when the marks had been made bosch carefully placed the hand on the floor and moved down the body to the feet he removed the right shoe a black leather athletic shoe with a black rubber sole and peeled off the black sock on the ball of the dead mans foot was a circular discoloration that was brown at its center tapering outward in yellow whadaya got harry bosch looked up it was braxton im not sure yet you see a glove the guys missing a glove over here it was edgar he was behind another display case on the other side ofustther si the shop bosch stood up and walked over edgar crouched and pointed beneath the case theres a black leather glove under the case i dont know if its a match but it is a glove bosch got down on his hands and knees so he could look underneath the display case he reached under and pulled out the glove looks the same he said if it does not fit you must acquit said edgar bosch looked at him johnnie cochran edgar said you know the oj gloves right bosch stood up one of his knees made a popping sound as he did so he looked into the case it contained two shelves lighted from inside on the shelves were nonjewelry items of what appeared to be high value there were coins and some small jade sculptures gold and silver pillboxes cigarette cases and other ornate and bejeweled trinkets it was highend stuff most of the coins bosch noticed were russian bosch stepped away from the case and surveyed the shop other than the two display cases there was mostly junk the property of financially desperate people willing to part with almost anything in exchange for cash brax bosch said wheres the entry braxton signaled him toward the back and led the way bosch and edgar followed they came to a rear room that was used as an office and for storage gravel and other debris were scattered on the floor they all looked up there was a hole roughly cut in the ceiling it was two feet wide and there was blue sky above its a composite roof braxton said no big thing cutting through a half hour maybe it would make noise edgar said anybody know when the porno palace closes i remember i checked one of the other times this place was hit braxton said he closes at four reopens at eight fourhour window the roof the entry point in the other three hits bosch asked braxton shook his head he hit the back door the first two times and then the roof this is the second time through the roof you think it was monty all three times before wouldnt doubt it thats what these guys do hit the same places over and over after the second time the back door was used mr servan took precautions there added more steel reinforcement so the guy went up onto the rook ionto thf why this place so many times edgar asked a lot of immigrants come here russians koreans from all over they pawn the stuff they brought with them from the homeland jade gold coins small expensive stuff burglars love that shit man that case where you found that glove its all in there thats what the guy came in for i dont know why he ended up behind the jewelry case whats been the take on the prior three bosch asked its probably averaged out to forty to fifty grand a hit braxton said thats on the high side for a pawnshop thats why this guy kept getting hit a patrolman stepped back into the rear room and told the detectives that the medical examiners people had arrived the three detectives continued to huddle for a moment to discuss initial impressions and boschs theory on what had happened to the burglar and to set a case strategy it was decided that edgar would stay on scene and assist the me and sid teams as necessary bosch and braxton would handle servan and nextofkin notification as soon as the medical examiners investigator rolled a set of prints off the burglars exposed hand bosch and braxton headed back to hollywood division along with nikolai servan bosch scanned the prints into the computer and sent them downtown to the print lab at parker center he then conducted a formal and taped interview with servan though the pawnbroker added nothing new to what he had told them in his shop it was important for bosch to lock down his story on tape by the time he was done with the interview he had a message waiting from a print technician named tom rusch the prints were matched by computer to a thirtynineyearold exconvict named montgomery george kelman kelman was on parole for a burglary conviction it took bosch three calls to locate kelmans parole agent and to get the dead mans current address and employer he was told kelman worked a morning dishwashing shift at a restaurant on hillview the parole agent had already received a call that morning from the restaurant owner who reported that kelman had not shown up for work or called in sickas parole regulations dictated the agent seemed pleased to learn he didnt have to bother filing all the paperwork needed to show kelman violated parole merry christmas he said to bosch before hanging up after checking with edgar by phone and learning the techs were still working the body and scene bosch told his partner that the victim had been ided as kelman and that he and braxton were headed to the address the parole agent had provided for kelman he said they were going to leave nikolai servan behind in an interview room at the division monty kelmans address was an apartment on los feliz near griffith park boschs knock was answered by a young woman in shorts andresn short a longsleeve turtleneck shirt she was thin to the point of being gaunt an obvious junkie she abruptly collapsed into the fetal position on the couch when they gave her the bad news about monty while braxton attempted to console her and gather information from her at the same time bosch took a quick look around the onebedroom apartment as he expected there was no obvious sign that the premises belonged to a burglar this apartment was the frontthe place where the parole agent visited and kelman kept the semblance of a lawabiding life bosch knew that any active burglar with a parole tail would keep a separate and secret placea safe housefor his tools and swag in the bedroom was a small desk in which kelman kept his checkbook and personal papers bosch flipped through the checkbook and saw nothing unusual he looked through everything else in the drawer but found no lead to kelmans safe house he wasnt particularly anxious about it it was just a loose end something that would be of greater concern to braxton as a burglary detective than to bosch as he turned to leave the bedroom he saw a saxophone propped on a stand in the corner by the door he recognized from its size that it was an alto he stepped over and lifted it into his hands it looked old but well cared for it was polished brass and he saw the buffing cloth pushed down into the mouth of the instrument bosch had never played the saxophone had never even tried but the instruments sound was the only music that had ever been able to truly light him up inside he held the instrument with a sense of reverence he rarely exhibited for any person or thing and for a moment he was tempted to raise the mouthpiece to his lips and try to sound a note instead he gripped the instrument the way he had seen countless musiciansfrom art pepper to wayne shorterhold theirs harry you got anything braxton said from the other room bosch carried the saxophone and stand out to the living room the woman was sitting up on the couch now her arms folded tightly across her chest tears streaked her face bosch didnt know if she was crying over her lost love or her lost junk ticket he held up the saxophone whose is this she swallowed before answering its montys was he played he tried he liked jazz he always said he wanted to take lessons he never did a new rush of tears cascaded down her cheeks its gotta be swag braxton said ignoring her and speaking to bosch i can run it on the box when we get back on those things the manufacturer and serial number are engraved inside the bell he pointed to the mouth of the horn in there wouldnt surprise me if it came out of servans shop on one of the earlier b and es bosch pulled the felt buffing cloth out of the opening and looked inside there was an inscription on the curved brass but he couldnt read it he walked over to the window and angled the instrument so sunlight flooded into the mouth he bent close and turned the instrument so he could read it calumet instruments chicago illinois custom made for quentin mckinzie the sweet spot bosch read it again and then a third time his temples suddenly felt as if someone had pressed hot quarters against them a flash memory filled his thoughts a musician under the canopy set up on the deck of the ship the soldiers crowded close those in wheelchairs the men missing limbs at the front the man playing the sax bending up and down and in and out like sugar ray robinson coming from the corner of the ring the music beautiful and agile lighting him up the sound better than anything he had ever heard the goddamn light at the end of all his tunnels jesus harry whats it say bosch looked over at braxton the memory retreating into the darkness what you look like you saw a ghost hidin in there whats it say chicago it was made in chicago calumet howd you know im a burglary detective its my job to know calumet is one of the big ones been around a long time we might be able to trace it bosch nodded you finished here he asked lets go on the way back to the station bosch let braxton drive so that he could hold and study the saxophone whats something like this worth he asked after they were halfway to their destination depends new youre talking in the thousands to a pawnbroker probably a fneprobablew hundred you ever heard of quentin mckinzie braxton shook his head i dont think so they called him sugar ray mck on account of when he played the sax hed bob and weave like the fighter sugar ray robinson he was good he was mostly a session guy but he put out a few records the sweet spot you never heard that tune sorry man not into jazz too much of a cliché you know detectives and jazz i listen to country myself bosch felt disappointed he wanted to tell him about that day on the ship but if braxton didnt know jazz it couldnt be explained whats the connection braxton asked bosch held up the saxophone this was his it says inside here custom made for quentin mckinzie thats sugar ray mck you ever see him play bosch nodded one time nineteen sixtynine braxton whistled long time ago you think hes still alive i dont know hes not recording last disc he put out was man with an ax that was at least ten years ago maybe longer it was a compilation bosch looked at the saxophone cant record without this anyway i suppose boschs cell phone chirped it was edgar harry whereyat on the way back to the station we just checked out kelmans apartment anything not really a junkie and a saxophone what have you got first off weve got lividity issues this guy was moved and whats the me say about cause hes going with your theory at the moment electrocution the burns on the hand and footwhere the juice went in and out you find the sourcekelm sasource i looked around cant find it bosch thought about all of this postmortem lividity was the settling of the blood in a dead body it was a purple gravity line if a body is moved after the blood has settled then a new gravity line will appear it is an easy tipoff that most people outside of homicide investigation dont know about you looked around the case where the glove was yeah i looked i cant find any electrical source that can explain this the case youre talking about has internal lighting but theres no malfunction braxton pulled into the parking lot behind the station and into a spot reserved for investigators cars you do a property inventory on the guy yet yeah nothing pockets empty no id or anything else all right were at the cop shop let me think about it and call you back whatever harry i just want to get out of here on time tonight and i dont like the looks of this i know i know bosch closed the phone and got out of the car with the saxophone what has he got braxton asked nothing much bosch said over the top of the car it looks like an electrocution you called it when we get in can you pull the reports on the three prior b and es at three kings you got it what about servan ill check on him but im going to let him sit for a while they went into the station and down to the detective bureau where they split up braxton going to the burglary corral to get the reports and bosch to the rear hallway that led to the interview rooms servan was in interview room pacing in the small space when bosch opened the door mr servan are you okay it shouldnt be too much longer yeah okay okay you find he pointed to the saxophone bosch nodded did this come from your store servan studied the instrument and nodded vigorously i think so yes okay well well find out for sure weve got a few things to do and then well get back to you you want some coffee or to use the bathroom servan declined both and bosch left him there when he got to the homicide table he started looking for quentin mckinzie running searches on the dmv voter registration and crime index computers he came up with a record of drug arrests in los angeles in the s and s but no address and nothing that gave a clue to his current whereabouts braxton came over and dropped three thin files on his desk bosch told him to take the photo of monty kelman they had pulled off the computer and show it to servan to see if he recognized kelman as ever coming into the shop as a customer after braxton was gone bosch started looking through the burglary reports beginning with the first breakin at three kings he quickly flipped through the pages until he got to the stolenproperty inventory there was no saxophone on the list he scanned the items listed and determined they were all small pieces taken from the lighted display cabinet he flipped back to the summary which had been written by braxton it reported that the unknown suspect or suspects had broken through the rear door to enter the establishment then had emptied the display case containing the highestvalue items in the shop braxton noted that the display case had a key lock that had either been left unlocked or was expertly picked by the thief he went on to the next report and found a saxophone listed on the stolenproperty inventory it was described as an alto saxophone but there were no other identifiers and no listing of who the person was who had pawned the saxophone he read the summary and found it mirrored the summary in the first burglary report the burglar or burglars broke through the rear door opened the display case and took all of the highprice valuables the saxophone appeared to have been taken as an afterthought and bosch knew now that that was because monty kelman had always wanted to learn to play the instrument the third report was the same with the exception of the method of entry this time with the back door fortified the burglar or burglars cut through the composite roof and dropped down the lock on the display case was picked and the shelves emptied for the third time the losses from the three burglaries averaged out to a hit servan had insurancethough bosch assumed the premiums were ever increasing most of the items stolen were sale items meaning their original owners had let the pawn period lapse and ownership now belonged to servan braxton walked out of the back hallway and came to the homicide table yeah he recognizes him he said said he came into the store a couple days ago looked at some of the coins in the case he ever see him before that he thinks so but cant be sure anybody else work in that shop besides him no hes a oneman show six days a week nine to six your average hardworking immigrant story bosch leaned back in his chair and combed one side of his mustache with his thumb he didnt say anything after a few moments braxton got tired of waiting harry what else you need from me bosch didnt look up at him um can you go back in there and ask him about the case the case you mean the display cabinet yeah ask him if hes sure he locked it every time on all the burglaries he could tell braxton was still waiting by the table what what am i the errand boy here no brax youre the guy he trusts go ask him the question bosch waited stroking his mustache and thinking braxton wasnt long he said he absolutely locks that case even when hes open for business its locked he only unlocks it to put something in or take something out then he relocks it every time he keeps the key with him all the time there are no copies so then our guy used picks looks that way bosch nodded um one more thing brax the saxophone he has to keep pawn records right he has to keep them and we get copied as well the pawn detail they compare pawn inventories to stolenproperty reports you know look for matches bosch reached over and lifted the saxophone off the desk so then how can i find out who pawned this braxton seemed mildly taken aback whats it got to do with all of this nothing as far as i know but i want to find out who pawned it it shouldnt be too hard the guys in the detail keep everything separated by storewited by s in shoeboxes they could just look through the box for three kings depending on how far back they go it might be in there what would work better if you call them or i call them theyre not going to like it either way but let me take a crack at it thanks man bosch looked at his watch it was almost noon and tell them wed like to hear back on it today ill tell them but i doubt theyll make any promises its christmas eve harry people are trying to get home early just tell them its important to you or the case bosch didnt answer and eventually braxton went back to his desk to make the call bosch looked through the three burglary reports again when he finished he got up and went down the back hallway to the interview rooms instead of going into where servan was he went into and looked through the mirrored glass at the pawnbroker he was sitting at the table with his arms folded and his eyes closed he was either sleeping or meditating maybe both he left the room and went back to the homicide table he sat down and picked up the saxophone again he liked handling it the feel and weight of it in his grasp knowing that the instrument could produce a sound that echoed all the sadness and hope of humanity gave him pause again he remembered the day on the ship sugar ray bobbing and weaving through the sweet spot and a few other tunes bosch fell in love with the sound that day it felt like it had come from somewhere deep within himself he was not the same after that day he came out of the memory and walked over to a shelf that ran above the row of file cabinets he took down one of the forensics manuals and turned to the index he found what he wanted and went to the page he was sitting down reading the manual when his cell phone chirped and he dug it out of his pocket it was edgar harry theyre about to clear here you want me to come in not yet well what are we doing there was nothing with the body right no tools no picks thats right i already told you i just read through the reports from the three priors that display case was hit each time it was picked servan said it was always locked well we got no lock picks here harry i guess whoever moved the body took the picks it was servan edgar was quiet and then said why dont you run it down for me harry bosch thought for a moment before speaking hed been hit three times in two years every time the highend case was picked its hard to work a set of picks with gloves on servan probably knew that the one time this guy took off his gloves was to work the picks steel picks going into a steel lock if he put a hundred ten volts into that lock it couldve shut this guys heart down not necessarily ive been sitting here reading one of the manuals oneten can stop your heart but it all depends on the amps theres a formula it has to do with resistance to the charge you know like dry skin versus moist skin things like that this guy just took his glove off he probably had sweaty hands exactly so if the resistance was low and servan had somehow rigged a oneten line going directly into that lock then the initial jolt could have contracted the muscles and left our burglar unable to let go of the pick the juice goes through him hits the heart and the heart goes into vfib ventricular fibrillation is a natural cause harry not when you use oneten to get it then were talking more than just homicide this is lying in wait the da can decide all of that we just have to bring in the facts by the way howd you know to take off his sock and look for the exit burn the burns on his fingers i saw them and just took a shot well id say you hit the bullseye partner got lucky so now you have to get into that case and find out how he wired it did sid leave theyre still packing up tell them to take the case as evidence the whole case its ten feet long tell them to take it with them you go with it the case is the key and tell them to be careful with it theyre going to have to get a special services truck out here whatever call them now get it done bosch closed the phone and got up from his desk he went down the hallway past the watch office to the locker rooms he bought two packages of peanut butter crackers from the vending machine he opened one and ate all the squares while he was walking back to the detective bureau he put the other package in his coat pocket for later he stopped once on the way back to get a drink from the water fountain braxton was waiting for him at the homicide table with a sheet of paper in his hand you got lucky he told bosch as he approached the guy pawned that saxophone two years ago but they still had the slip he gave the sheet of paper to bosch it was a photocopy of the pawn slip it contained the name address and phone numbers of the customer the man who had pawned quentin mckinzies saxophone was named donald teed he lived in the valley nikolai servan had given him for the instrument bosch sat down and noticed that teed had listed his work phone number with a area code and a hollywood exchange that might explain why a man who lived in the valley had used a pawnshop in hollywood he picked up the phone and punched in teeds work number it was answered immediately by a woman who said splendid age excuse me bosch said splendid age retirement home how can i help you yes is donald teed a resident there a resident no we have a donald teed who works here is that who you mean i think so is he there he is here today but i am not sure where he is right now hes a custodian and moves around who is calling is this a solicitation bosch felt things falling into place he decided to take a shot im a friend can you tell me if another friend of mine is there his name is quentin mckinzie yes mr mckinzie is a resident here what is this about ill call back bosch hung up the phone and his eyes drifted to the saxophone nikolai servan opened his eyes the moment bosch came through the door bosch put the piece of paper he carried down on the table and took the seat across from servan folding his arms and putting his elbows on the table in almost a mirror image weve hit a snag mr servan a snag a problem actually a few imaually aof them and what id like to do here is give you the opportunity to tell me the truth this time i dont understand i tol you truth i tol you truth i think you left some things out mr servan servan clasped his hands together on the table and shook his head no i tol everything im going to advise you of your rights now mr servan listen closely to what i read you bosch read servan his rights from the paper on the table he then turned it around and asked the pawnbroker to sign it he gave him the pen servan hesitated and seemed to slowly reread the rights waiver form all over again he then picked up the pen and signed bosch asked the first question the instant the point of the pen came off the paper so what did you do with the burglars lock picks mr servan servan held his lips tightly together for a long moment and then shook his head i dont understand sure you do mr servan where are the picks servan only stared at him okay bosch said lets try this one tell me how you wired that display case servan bowed his head once i have attorney now he said please i have attorney now bosch pulled to a stop in front of the splendid age retirement home and got out with the saxophone and its stand he heard christmas music drifting out of an open window elvis presley singing blue christmas he thought about nikolai servan spending christmas eve and christmas day in the parker center jail it would probably be the only jail time hed ever see the district attorneys office would not decide until after the holiday whether to charge him or kick him loose and bosch knew it would probably be the latter prosecuting the case against the pawnbroker was fraught with difficulties servan had lawyered up and stopped talking afternoonlong searches of his home car the pawnshop and the trash containers in the alley failed to produce monty kelmans lock picks or the method by which the display case had been rigged to deliver the fatal charge even the cause of death would be difficult to prove in a court of law kelmans heart had stopped beating a burst of electricity had most likely caused ventricular fibrillation but in court a defense lawyer could easily and most likely successfully argue that the burn marks on the victims hand and foot were inconclusive and possibly not even related to cause of death and all of these obstacles were minor in comparison with the main difficultythe victim was a thief killed during the commission of a crime he had engaged in repeated offenses against the defendant would a jury even care that nikolai servan had set a fatal trap for him probably not the prosecutor told bosch and edgar bosch planned to go back to the pawnshop the following morning in his personal ledger everybody counted or nobody counted that included burglars he would look until he found the picks or the wire servan had used to kill monty kelman as he approached the front doors of the retirement home he noticed that not much about it looked particularly splendid it looked like a final stop for pensioners and people who hadnt planned on living as long as they had quentin mckinzie for example few jazzmen and drug users went the distance he probably never thought hed make it this far according to the information bosch got off the computer he was seventytwo years old bosch entered and walked up to a welcome counter the place smelled like most of the lowrent retirement homes he had ever been in urine and decay the end of hopes and dreams he asked for directions to quentin mckinzies room the woman behind the counter suspiciously eyed the saxophone under boschs arm do you have an appointment she asked evening visiting is by appointment only is that to give you time to clean the place up before the kids come by to see dear old dad i beg your pardon i dont need an appointment where is mr mckinzie he held his badge up a foot from her face she looked at it for a long momentlonger than it took to read itand then cleared her throat hes in oneohseven down the hall on the left side hes probably sleeping bosch nodded his thanks and headed down the hall the door to was ajar the light was on in the room and bosch could hear television sounds coming from inside he knocked softly and didnt get a response he slowly pushed the door open and stuck his head in he saw an old man sitting in a chair next to a bed a television mounted high on the opposite wall was droning the old mans eyes were closed he was gaunt and depleted his body taking up only half of the chair his black skin looked gray and powdery despite the thin face and loose skin gathering below his chin bosch recognized him it was sugar ray mck he stepped into the room and quietly came around the bed the man didnt stir bosch stood still for a moment wondering what he should do he decided not to wake the man he put the instrument stand down on the floor in the corner he then cradled the saxophone in it he straightened up took another look at the sleeping jazzman and nodded to him in some sort of unnoticed acknowledgment as he headed out of the room he reached up and turned off the television at the door he was stopped by a raspy voice hey bosch turned sugar ray was awake and looking at him with rheumy eyes you turned off my box sorry i thought you were asleep he came back into the room and reached up to turn the television on again who are you boy you dont work here bosch turned to face him my name is harry harry bosch i came sugar ray noticed the saxophone sitting in the corner of the room thats my ax bosch picked up the saxophone and handed it to him i found it i saw your name in it and i wanted to get it back to you the man held the instrument like it was as precious as a new baby he slowly turned it in his hands studying it for flaws or maybe just wanting to look at it the way he would look at a loved one long gone away bosch felt a constriction rising in his chest as the jazzman brought the instrument to his mouth licked the mouthpiece and then held it between his teeth his chest rose as he drew in a breath but as his fingers went to work and he blew out the riff the wind escaped from the weak seal his lips made around the mouthpiece sugar ray closed his eyes and tried again the same result sounded from his instrument he was too old and weak his lungs were gone he could no longer play its all right bosch said you dont have to play i just thought it should be back with you thats all sugar ray cradled the instrument in his lap as if he were protecting it he looked up at bosch where did you get this harry bosch i took it from a guy who stole it from a pawnshop sugar ray nodded like he knew the story was it stolen from you bosch asked no i had it pawned a fellow here did it for me so i could get money for the box i dont like being in the dayroom with the others theyre all suicides waitin to happen so i needed my own box he shook his head his eyes went up to the tefyup to tlevision on the wall over boschs shoulder imagine a man trading the love of his life for that bosch looked up at the tube and saw a commercial where a santa claus was drinking a cold beer after a long night of delivering presents and cheer he looked back at sugar ray he didnt know whether to feel good or bad about what he had done he had returned an instrument to a musician who could no longer play it but as this indecision gripped his heart he saw sugar ray pull the saxophone closer to his body he held it there tightly as if it were all he had in the world he brought his eyes to boschs and in them harry saw that he had done the right thing merry christmas sugar ray sugar ray nodded and looked down bosch knew it was time to leave him alone he reached over and gripped his shoulder for a moment why sugar ray asked why what why did you do this for me you think youre playing santa claus or something bosch smiled and squatted down next to the chair he was now looking up into the old mans eyes i did it to try to make us even i guess the old man just looked at him waiting in december nineteen sixtynine i was on a hospital ship in the south china sea bosch touched his left side just above the hip i got bamboobladed in a tunnel four days before you probably dont remember this but the uss sanctuary off danang of course i remember you were one of the boys in the blue bathrobes huh sugar ray smiled bosch nodded and continued i remember the announcement that the show was canceled because the seas were too high and the fog too thick the big hueys with all the equipment couldnt land we had all been waiting on deck we saw the choppers coming in through the mist and then just turning around to go back sugar ray raised a finger you know it was mr bob hope who told our pilot to turn that son of a bitch around again and put it down on that boat bosch nodded he had heard it was hope one chopper turned again and came to the sanctuary the small one the one with the headliners onboard i remember it was bob hope connie stevens you and a beautiful black girl from that tv show teresa graves laughin man you remember everything just cause im old doesnt mean i cant remember the man on the moon was there too bosch smiled sugar ray was filling in details he had forgotten neil armstrong yeah but the rest of the bandthe playboy allstarswas on one of the other choppers and it went back to danang it was only you and you carried your own ax you played for us solo bosch looked at the instrument in the old mans gray hands he remembered the day on the sanctuary as clearly as he remembered any other moment of his life you played the sweet spot and then auld lang syne i played the tennessee waltz too by request of a young man in the front row hed lost both his legs and he asked me to play that waltz bosch nodded solemnly bob hope told us his jokes and connie stevens sang promises promises a cappella in less than an hour it was all over and the chopper took off man i cant explain it but it meant something it made something right in a messedup world you know i was only nineteen years old and i wasnt sure how or why i was even over there anyway ive listened to a lot of saxophone since then but i havent heard it any better bosch nodded and stood up his knee creaked loudly he guessed it wouldnt be too long before he was in one of these places if he was lucky i just wanted to tell you that he said thats all you were in the tunnels over there huh i heard about them bosch nodded coulda used you going about this bin laden character he pointed up to the tv as if that were where the terrorist was bosch shook his head nah its a different game back then they gave you a flashlight and a fortyfive said good luck and dropped you in a hole now its sound and motion detectors heat sensors infrared its a different game maybe but a hunter is still a hunter bosch look lubosched at him for a moment before speaking take it easy sugar ray he headed toward the door and one more time sugar ray stopped him hey santa claus bosch turned back you strike me as a man who is alone in the world sugar ray said that true bosch nodded without hesitation most of the time you got plans for christmas dinner bosch hesitated he finally shook his head no plans then come back here at three tomorrow we have a dinner and i can bring a guest ill sign you up bosch hesitated he had been alone so often on christmases past that he thought it might be too late that being around anyone might be intolerable dont worry sugar ray said they wont put your turkey in the blender as long as youve got teeth bosch smiled all right sugar ray ill be by then ill see you then bosch walked down the yellowed corridor and out into the night as he headed to the car he heard christmas music still playing from an open window somewhere it was an instrumental slow and heavy on the saxophone he stopped and it took him a moment to recognize it as ill be home for christmas he stood there on the walkway and listened until the end of the song the author would like to gratefully acknowledge john houghton for recounting and sharing the experience on the uss sanctuary that inspired this story fathers day the victims tiny body was left alone in the emergency room enclosure the doctors after halting their resuscitation efforts had solemnly retreated and pulled the plastic curtains closed around the bed the entire construction management and purpose of the hospital was to prevent death when the effort failed nobody wanted to see it the curtains were opaque harry bosch looked like a ghost as he approached and then split them to enter he stepped into the enclosure and stood somber and alone with the dead the boys body took up less than a quarter of the big metal bed he had worked thousands of cases but nothing ever touched bosch liket di the sight of a young childs lifeless body fifteen months old cases in which the childs age was still counted in months were the most difficult of all he knew that if he dwelled too long he would start to question everythingfrom the meaning of life to his mission in it the boy looked like he was only asleep bosch made a quick study looking for any bruising or other sign of mishap the child was naked and uncovered his skin as pink as a newborns bosch saw no sign of trauma except for an old scrape on the boys forehead he pulled on gloves and very carefully moved the body to check it from all angles his heart sank as he did this but he saw nothing that was suspicious when he was finished he covered the body with the sheethe wasnt sure whyand slipped back through the plastic curtains shrouding the bed the boys father was in a private waiting room down the hall bosch would eventually get to him but the paramedics who had transported the boy had agreed to stick around to be interviewed bosch looked for them first and found both menone old one young one to mentor one to learnsitting in the crowded er waiting room he invited them outside so they could speak privately the dry summer heat hit them as soon as the glass doors parted like walking out of a casino in vegas they walked to the side so they would not be bothered but stayed in the shade of the portico he identified himself and told them he would need the written reports on their rescue effort as soon as they were completed for now tell me about the call the senior man did the talking his name was ticotin the kid was already in full arrest when we got there he began we did what we could but the best thing was just to ice him and transport himtry to get him in here and see what the pros could do did you take a body temperature reading at the scene bosch asked first thing ticotin said it was oneohsixeight so you gotta figure the kid was up around oneoheight oneohnine before we got there there was no way he was going to come back from that not a little baby like that ticotin shook his head as though he was frustrated by having been sent to rescue someone who could not be rescued bosch nodded as he took out his notebook and wrote down the temperature reading you know what time that was he asked we arrived at twelve seventeen so i would say we took the bt no more than three minutes later first thing you do thats the protocol bosch nodded again and wrote the time pmnext to the temperature reading he looked up and tracked a car coming quickly into the er lot it parked and his partner ignacio ferras got out he had gone directly to the accident scene while bosch had gone directly to the hospital bosch sihtal bosgnaled him over ferras walked with anxious speed bosch knew he had something to report but bosch didnt want him to say it in front of the paramedics he introduced him and then quickly got back to his questions for the paramedics where was the father when you got there they had the kid on the floor by the back door where he had brought him in the father was sort of collapsed on the floor next to him screaming and crying like they do kicking the floor did he ever say anything not right then then when when we made the decision to transport and work on the kid in the truck he wanted to go we told him he couldnt we told him to get somebody from the office to drive him what were his words he just said i want to go with him i want to be with my son stuff like that ferras shook his head as if in pain at any time did he talk about what had happened bosch asked ticotin checked his partner who shook his head no ticotin said he didnt then how were you informed of what had happened well initially we heard it from dispatch then one of the office workers a lady she told us when we got there she led us to the back and told us along the way bosch thought he had all he was going to get but then thought of something else you didnt happen to take an exterior air temperature reading for that spot did you the two paramedics looked at each other and then at bosch didnt think to ticotin said but its gotta be at least ninetyfive with the santa anas kicking up like this i dont remember a june this hot bosch remembered a june he had spent in a jungle but wasnt going to get into it he thanked the paramedics and let them get back to duty he put his notebook away and looked at his partner okay tell me about the scene he said weve got to charge this guy harry ferras said urgently why what did you find its not what i found its because it was just a kid harry what kind of father would let this happen how could he forget ferras had become a father for the first time six months earlier bosch knew this the experience had made him a professional dad and every monday he came into the squad with a new batch of photos to bosch the kid looked the same week to week but not to ferras he was in love with being a father with having a son ignacio youve got to separate your own feelings about it from the facts and the evidence okay you know this calm down i know i know its just that how could he forget you know yeah i know and were going to keep that in mind so tell me what you found out over there whod you talk to the office manager and what did he say its a lady she said that he came in through the back door shortly after ten all the sales agents park in the back and use the back doorthats why nobody saw the kid the father came in talking on the cell phone then he got off and asked if hed gotten a fax but there was no fax so he made another call and she heard him ask where the fax was then he waited for the fax how long did he wait she said not long but the fax was an offer to buy so he called the client and that started a whole backandforth with calls and faxes and he completely forgot about the kid it was at least two hours harry two hours bosch could almost share his partners anger but he had been on the mission a couple decades longer than ferras and knew how to hold it in when he had to and when to let it go harry something else too what the baby had something wrong with him the manager saw the kid no i mean always since birth she said it was a big tragedy the kid was handicapped blind deaf a bunch of things wrong fifteen months old and he couldnt walk or talk and never could even crawl he just cried a lot bosch nodded as he tried to plug this information into everything else he knew and had accumulated just then another car came speeding into the parking lot it pulled into the ambulance shoot in front of the er doors a woman leaped out and ran into the er leaving the car running and the door open thats probably the mother bosch said we better get in there bosch started trotting toward the er doors and ferras followed they went through the er waiting room and down a hallway where the father had been placed in a private room to wait as bosch got close he did not hear any screaming or crying or fists on fleshthings that wouldnt have surprised him the door was open and when he turned in he saw the parents of the dead boy embracing each other but not a tear lined any of their cheeks boschs initial splitsecond reaction was that he was seeing relief in their young faces they separated when they saw bosch enter followed by ferras mr and mrs helton he asked they nodded in unison but the man corrected bosch im stephen helton and this is my wife arlene haddon im detective bosch with the los angeles police department and this is my partner detective ferras we are very sorry for the loss of your son it is our job now to investigate williams death and to learn exactly what happened to him helton nodded as his wife stepped close to him and put her face into his chest something silent was transmitted does this have to be done now helton asked weve just lost our beautiful little yes sir it has to be done now this is a homicide investigation it was an accident helton weakly protested its all my fault but it was an accident its still a homicide investigation we would like to speak to each of you privately without the intrusions that will occur here do you mind coming down to the police station to be interviewed well leave him here the hospital is making arrangements for your sons body to be moved to the medical examiners office theyre going to cut him open the mother asked in a nearhysterical voice they will examine his body and then determine if an autopsy is necessary bosch said it is required by law that any untimely death fall under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner he waited to see if there was further protest when there wasnt he stepped back and gestured for them to leave the room well drive you down to parker center and i promise to make this as painless as possible they placed the grieving parents in separate interview rooms in the thirdfloor offices of homicide special because it was sunday the cafeteria was closed and bosched and had to make do with the vending machines in the alcove by the elevators he got a can of coke and two packages of cheese crackers he had not eaten breakfast before being called in on the case and was now famished he took his time while eating the crackers and talking things over with ferras he wanted both helton and haddon to believe that they were waiting while the other spouse was being interviewed it was a trick of the trade part of the strategy each would have to wonder what the other was saying okay bosch finally said im going to go in and take the husband you can watch in the booth or you can take a run at the wife your choice it was a big moment bosch was more than twentyfive years ahead of ferras on the job he was the mentor and ferras was the student so far in their fledgling partnership bosch had not let ferras conduct a formal interview he was allowing that now and the look on ferrass face showed that it was not lost on him youre going to let me talk to her sure why not you can handle it all right if i get in the booth and watch you with him first that way you can watch me whatever makes you comfortable thanks harry dont thank me ignacio thank yourself you earned it bosch dumped the empty cracker packages and the can in a trash can near his desk do me a favor he said go on the internet first and check the la times to see if theyve had any stories lately about a case like this you know with a kid id be curious and if there are we might be able to make a play with the story use it like a prop im on it ill go set up the video in the booth ten minutes later bosch entered interview room where stephen helton was waiting for him helton looked like he was not quite thirty years old he was lean and tan and appeared to be the perfect real estate salesman he didnt look like he had ever spent even five minutes in a police station before immediately he protested what is taking so long ive just lost my son and you stick me in this room for an hour is that procedure it hasnt been that long stephen but i am sorry you had to wait we were talking to your wife and that went longer than we thought it would why were you talking to her willy was with me the whole time we talked to her for the same reason were talking to you im sorry for the delay bosch pulled out the chair that was across the small table from helton and sat down first of all he said thank you for coming in for the interview you understand that you are not under arrest or anything like that you are free to go if you wish but by law we have to conduct an investigation of the death and we appreciate your cooperation i just want to get it over with so i can begin the process what process is that i dont know whatever process you go through believe me im new at this you know grief and guilt and mourning willy wasnt in our lives very long but we loved him very much this is just awful i made a mistake and i am going to pay for it for the rest of my life detective bosch bosch almost told him that his son paid for the mistake with the rest of his life but chose not to antagonize the man instead he just nodded and noted that helton had looked down at his lap when he had spoken most of his statement averting the eyes was a classic tell that indicated untruthfulness another tell was that helton had his hands down in his lap and out of sight the open and truthful person keeps his hands on the table and in sight why dont we start at the beginning bosch said tell me how the day started helton nodded and began sundays our busiest day were both in real estate you may have seen the signs haddon and helton were ppgs topvolume team today arlene had an open house at noon and a couple of private showings before that so willy was going to be with me we lost another nanny on friday and there was no one else to take him how did you lose the nanny she quit they all quit willy is a handful because of his condition i mean why deal with a handicapped child if someone with a normal healthy child will pay you the same thing consequently we go through a lot of nannies so you were left to take care of the boy today while your wife had the property showings it wasnt like i wasnt working though i was negotiating a sale that would have brought in a thirtythousanddollar commission it was important is that why you went into the office exactly we got an offer sheet and i was going to have to respond so i got willy ready and put him in the car and went into work what time was this about quarter to ten i got the call from the other realtor at about nine thirty the buyer was playing hardball the response time was going to be set at an hour so i had to get my seller on standby pack up willy and get in there to pick up the fax do you have a fax at home yes but if the deal went down wed have to get together in the office we have a signing room and all the forms are right there my file on the property was in my office too bosch nodded it sounded plausible to a point okay so you head off to the office exactly and two things happened helton brought his hands up into sight but only to hold them across his face to hide his eyes a classic tell what two things i got a call on my cellfrom arleneand willy fell asleep in his car seat do you understand make me understand i was distracted by the call and i was no longer distracted by willy he had fallen asleep uhhuh so i forgot he was there forgive me god but i forgot i had him with me i understand what happened next helton dropped his hands out of sight again he looked at bosch briefly and then at the tabletop i parked in my assigned space behind ppg and i went in i was still talking to arlene one of our buyers is trying to get out of a contract because hes found something he likes better so we were talking about that about how to finesse things with that and i was on the phone when i went in okay i see that what happened when you went in helton didnt answer right away he sat there looking at the table as if trying to remember so he could get the answer right stephen bosch prompted what happened next i had told the buyers agent to fax me the offer but it wasnt there so i got off the line from my wife and i called the agent then i waited around for the fax checked my slips and made a few callbacks while i was waiting what are your slips phone messages people who see our signs on properties and call i dont put my cell oriv t my ce home number on the signs how many callbacks did you make i think just two i got a message on one and spoke briefly to the other person my fax came in and that was what i was there for i got off the line now at this point it was what time i dont know about ten after ten would you say that at this point you were still cognizant that your son was still in your car in the parking lot helton took time to think through an answer again but spoke before bosch had to prompt him no because if i knew he was in the car i would not have left him in the first place i forgot about him while i was still in the car you understand bosch leaned back in his seat whether he understood it or not helton had just dodged one legal bullet if he had acknowledged that he knowingly left the boy in the careven if he planned to be back in a few minutesthat would have greatly supported a charge of negligent homicide but helton had maneuvered the question correctly almost as if he had expected it okay bosch said what happened next helton shook his head wistfully and looked at the side wall as if gazing through a window toward the past he couldnt change i uh got involved in the deal he said the fax came in i called my client and i faxed back a counter i also did a lot of talking to the other agent by phone we were trying to get the deal done and we had to handhold both our clients through this for two hours yes it took that long and when was it that you remembered that you had left william in the car out in the parking lot where it was about ninetyfive degrees i guess as soonfirst of all i didnt know what the temperature was i object to that i left that car at about ten and it was not ninetyfive degrees not even close i hadnt even used the air conditioner on the way over there was a complete lack of remorse or guilt in heltons demeanor he wasnt even attempting to fake it anymore bosch had become convinced that this man had no love or affinity for his damaged and now lost child william was simply a burden that had to be dealt with and therefore could easily be forgotten when things like business and selling houses and making money came up but where was the crime in all of this bosch knew he could charge him with negligence but the courts tend to view the loss of a child as enough punishment in these situations helton would go free with hi defree wis wife as sympathetic figures free to continue their lives while baby william moldered in his grave the tells always add up bosch instinctively believed helton was a liar and he began to believe that williams death was no accident unlike his partner who had let the passions of his own fatherhood lead him down the path bosch had gotten here after careful observation and analysis it was now time to press on to bait helton and see if he would make a mistake is there anything else you want to add to the story he asked helton let out a deep breath and slowly shook his head thats the whole sad story he said i wish to god it never happened but it did he looked directly at bosch for the first time during the entire interview bosch held his gaze and then asked a question do you have a good marriage stephen helton looked away and stared at the invisible window again what do you mean i mean do you have a good marriage you can say yes or no if you want yes i have a good marriage helton responded emphatically i dont know what my wife told you but i think it is very solid what are you trying to say all im saying is that sometimes when there is a child with challenges it strains the marriage my partner just had a baby the kids healthy but moneys tight and his wife isnt back at work yet you know the deal its tough i can only imagine what the strain of having a child with williams difficulties would be like yeah well we made it by all right the nannies quitting all the time it wasnt that hard as soon as one quits we put an ad on craigslist for another bosch nodded and scratched the back of his head while doing it he waved a finger in a circular motion toward the camera that was in the air vent up on the wall behind him helton could not see him do this when did you two get married he asked two and a half years ago we met on a contract she had the buyer and i had the seller we worked well together we started talking about joining forces and then we realized we were in love then william came yes thats right that mustve changed emve chathings it did so when arlene was pregnant couldnt the doctors tell that he had these problems they could have if they had seen him but arlenes a workaholic she was busy all the time she missed some appointments and the ultrasounds when they discovered there was a problem it was too late do you blame your wife for that helton looked aghast no of course not look what does this have to do with what happened today i mean why are you asking me all of this bosch leaned across the table it may have a lot to do with it stephen i am trying to determine what happened today and why the why is the tough part it was an accident i forgot he was in the car okay i will go to my grave knowing that my mistake killed my own son isnt that enough for you bosch leaned back and said nothing he hoped helton would say more do you have a son detective any children a daughter yeah well then happy fathers day im really glad for you i hope you never have to go through what im going through right now believe me its not fun bosch had forgotten it was fathers day the realization knocked him off his rhythm and his thoughts went to his daughter living eight thousand miles away in her ten years he had only been with her on one fathers day what did that say about him here he was trying to get inside another fathers actions and motivations and he knew his own could not stand equal scrutiny the moment ended when there was a knock on the door and ferras came in carrying a file excuse me he said i thought you might want to see this he handed the file to bosch and left the room bosch turned the file on the table in front of them and opened it so that helton would not be able to see its contents inside was a computer printout and a handwritten note on a postit the note said no ad on craigslist the printout was of a story that ran in the la times ten months earlier it was about the heatstroke death of a child who had been left in a car in lancaster while his mother ran into a store to buy milk she ran into the middle of a robbery she was tied up along with the store clerk and placed in a back room the robbers ransacked the stotoucked thre and escaped it was an hour before the victims were discovered and freed but by then the child in the car had already succumbed to heatstroke bosch scanned the story quickly then dropped the file closed he looked at helton without speaking what helton asked just some additional information and lab reports he lied do you get the la times by the way yes why just curious thats all now how many nannies do you think youve employed in the fifteen months that william was alive helton shook his head i dont know at least ten they dont stay long they cant take it and then you go to craigslist to place an ad yes and you just lost a nanny on friday yes i told you she just walked out on you no she got another job and told us she was leaving she made up a lie about it being closer to home and with gas prices and all of that but we knew why she was leaving she could not handle willy she told you this friday no when she gave notice when was that she gave two weeks notice so it was two weeks back from friday and do you have a new nanny lined up no not yet we were still looking but you put the feelers out and ran the ad again that sort of thing right but listen what does this have to let me ask the questions stephen your wife told us that she worried about leaving william with you that you couldnt handle the strain of it helton looked shocked the statement came from left field as bosch had wanted it what why would she say that i dont know is it true no its not true she told us she was worried that this wasnt an accident thats absolutely crazy and i doubt she said it you are lying he turned in his seat so that the front of his body faced the corner of the room and he would have to turn his face to look directly at bosch another tell bosch knew he was zeroing in he decided it was the right time to gamble she mentioned a story you found in the la times that was about a kid left in a car up in lancaster the kid died of heatstroke she was worried that it gave you the idea helton swiveled in his seat and leaned forward to put his elbows on the table and run his hands through his hair oh my god i cant believe she he didnt finish bosch knew his gamble had paid off heltons mind was racing along the edge it was time to push him over you didnt forget that william was in the car did you stephen helton didnt answer he buried his face in his hands again bosch leaned forward so that he only had to whisper you left him there and you knew what was going to happen you planned it thats why you didnt bother running ads for a new nanny you knew you werent going to need one helton remained silent and unmoving bosch kept working him changing tacks and offering sympathy now its understandable he said i mean what kind of life would that kid have had anyway some might even call this a mercy killing the kid falls asleep and never wakes up ive worked these kinds of cases before stephen its actually not a bad way to go it sounds bad but it isnt you just get tired and you go to sleep helton kept his face in his hands but he shook his head bosch didnt know if he was denying it still or shaking off something else he waited and the delay paid off it was her idea helton said in a quiet voice shes the one who couldnt take it anymore in that moment bosch knew he had him but he showed nothing he kept working it wait a minute he said she said she had nothing to do with it that this was your idea and your plan and that when she called you it was to talk you out of it helton dropped his hands with a slap on the table thats a lie it was her she was embarrassed that we had a kid like that she couldnt take him anywhere and we couldnt go anywhere he was ruining our lives and she told me i had to do something about it she told me ho e told w to do something about it she said i would be saving two lives while sacrificing only one bosch pulled back across the table it was done it was over okay stephen i think i understand and i want to hear all about it but at this point i need to inform you of your rights after that if you want to talk well talk and ill listen when bosch came out of the interview room ignacio ferras was there waiting for him in the hallway his partner raised his fist and bosch tapped his knuckles with his own fist that was beautiful ferras said you walked him right down the road thanks bosch said lets hope the da is impressed too i dont think well have to worry well there will be no worries if you go into the other room and turn the wife now ferras looked surprised you still want me to take the wife shes yours lets walk them into the da as bookends ill do my best good go check the equipment and make sure were still recording in there ive got to go make a quick call you got it harry bosch walked into the squad room and sat down at his desk he checked his watch and knew it would be early in hong kong he pulled out his cell phone anyway and sent a call across the pacific his daughter answered with a cheerful hello bosch knew he wouldnt even have to say anything and he would feel fulfilled by just the sound of her voice saying the one word hey baby its me he said daddy she exclaimed happy fathers day and bosch realized in that moment that he was indeed a happy man angle of investigation then this is all because of manson eckersly said bosch looked across the seat at his training partner unsure of what he meant charles manson you know helter skelter and all of that shit eckersly explained theyre still scared bosch nodded though he still didnt get it he looked out the windshield they were heading south on vermont through territory unfamiliar to him it was only his second day with eckersly and his second on the job almost all of the neighborhoods in wilshire were unfamiliar to him but that was okay eckersly had been working patrol in the division for four years he knew the neighborhoods somebody doesnt answer the phone and back east they think squeaky and the rest of charlies girls have broken in and chopped them up or something eckersly continued we get a lot of these check the lady calls nearly four years now and people still think las been turned over to the nuts bosch had been away from the world when manson and his people had done their thing so he didnt have a proper read on what the murders had done to the city when he had come back from vietnam he had felt an edginess in la that had not been there before he left but he didnt know whether that was because of the changes he had been through or the ones the city had been through south of santa monica they took a left on fourth street and bosch started reading numbers off of mailboxes in a few seconds eckersly pulled the squad car to a stop in front of a small bungalow with a driveway down the side to a single garage in the back they both got out bosch taking his nightstick out of the plastic pipe on the door and sliding it into the ring on his equipment belt oh you wont need that eckersly said unless you want to use it to knock on the door bosch turned back to the car to put the club back come on come on eckersly said i didnt tell you to put it back i just said you wouldnt need it bosch hustled to catch up to him on the flagstone walkway leading to the front door he walked with both hands on his belt he was still getting used to the weight and the awkward bulk of it when he was in vietnam his job had been to go into the tunnels hed kept his body profile as trim as possible no equipment belt he carried all of his equipmenta flashlight and a fortyfivein his hands eckersly had sat out the war in a patrol car he was eight years older than bosch and had that many years on the job he was taller and heavier than bosch and carried the weight and bulk of his equipment belt with a practiced ease he signaled to bosch to knock on the front door as if that took training bosch knocked three times with his fist like this eckersly corrected he rapped sharply on the door police mrs wilkins can you come to the door please his fist and voice had a certain authority a tone that was what he was trying to teach his rookie partner bosch nodded he understood the lesson he looked around and saw that the windows were all closed even though it was a nice cool morning nobody answered the door you smell that he asked eckersly smell what the one area where bosch didnt need any training from eckersly was in the smell of death he had spent two tours in the dead zone in the tunnels the enemy put their dead into the walls death was always in the air somebodys dead bosch said ill check around back he stepped off the front porch and took the driveway to the rear of the property the odor was stronger back here to bosch at least the dispatcher on the radio had said june wilkins lived alone and hadnt answered phone calls from her daughter in philadelphia for seven days there was a small enclosed yard with a clothesline stretching from the corner of the garage to the corner of the house there were a few things hanging on the line two silk slips and other womens undergarments there were more clothing items on the ground having fallen or been blown off the line the winds came up at night people didnt leave their clothes on the line overnight bosch went to the garage first and stood on his toes to look through one of two windows set high in the wooden door he saw the distinctive curving roofline of a volkswagen beetle inside the car and the clothing left out on the line seemed to confirm what the odor already told him june wilkins had not left on a trip simply forgetting to tell her daughter back east she was inside the house waiting for them he turned to the house and went up the three concrete steps to the back door stoop there was a glass panel in the door that allowed him to see into the kitchen and partway down a hallway that led to the front rooms of the house nothing seemed amiss no rotting food on the table no blood on the floor he then saw on the floor next to a trash can a dog food bowl with flies buzzing around the rotting mound inside it bosch felt a quickening of his pulse he took his stick out and used it to rap on the glass he waited but there was no response he heard his partner knock on the front door again and announce once more that it was the police bosch tried the knob on the back door and found it unlocked he slowly opened the door and the odor came out with an intensity that made him drop back off the stoop ron he called out open door in the back after a moment he could hear his partners equipment belt jangling as he hustled to the back his footfalls heavy he came around the corner to the stoop did youoh shit that is rank i mean that is bad weve got a db in there bo motheresch nodded he assumed db meant dead body should we go in he asked yeah we better check it out eckersly said but wait a second he went over to the clothesline and yanked the two slips off the line he threw one to bosch use that he said eckersly bunched the silk slip up against his mouth and nose and went first through the door bosch did the same and followed him in lets do this quick eckersly said in a muffled voice they moved with speed through the house and found the db in the bathroom off the hallway there was a clawfoot bathtub filled to the brim with still dark water breaking the surface were two rounded shapes one at either end with hair splayed out on the water flies had collected on each as if they were lifeboats on the sea let me see your stick eckersly said not comprehending bosch pulled it out of his belt ring and handed it to his partner eckersly dipped one end of the stick into the tubs dark water and prodded the round shape near the foot of the tub the flies dispersed and bosch waved them away from his face the object in the water shifted its delicate balance and turned over bosch saw the jagged teeth and snout of a dog break the surface he involuntarily took a step back eckersly moved to the next shape he probed it with the stick and the flies angrily took flight but the object in the water did not move so readily it was not freefloating like the dog it went down deep like an iceberg he dipped the stick down farther and then raised it the misshapen and decaying face of a human being came up out of the water the small features and long hair suggested a woman but that could not be determined for sure by what bosch saw the stick had found leverage below the dead persons chin but it quickly slipped off and the face submerged again dark water lapped over the side of the tub and both of the police officers stepped back again lets get out of here eckersly said or well never get it out of our noses he handed the nightstick back to bosch and pushed past him to the door wait a second bosch said but eckersly didnt wait bosch turned his attention back to the body and dipped the stick into the dark water again he pulled it through the water until it hooked something and he raised it up the dead persons hands came out of the water they were bound at the wrists with a dog collar he slowly let them back down into the water again on his way out of the house bosch carried the stick at arms length from his body in the backyard he founthyard hed eckersly standing by the garage door gulping down fresh air bosch threw the slip he had used to breathe through over the clothesline and came over congratulations boot eckersly said using the department slang for rookie you got your first db stick with the job and it will be one of many bosch didnt say anything he tossed his nightstick onto the grasshe planned to get a new one nowand took out his cigarettes what do you think eckersly asked suicide she took the pooch with her her hands were tied with the dogs collar bosch said eckerslys mouth opened a little but then he recovered and became the training officer again you shouldnt have gone fishing in there he said sternly suicide or homicide its not our concern anymore let the detectives handle it from here bosch nodded his contrition and agreement what i dont get his partner said is how the hell did you smell that at the front door bosch shrugged used to it i guess he nodded toward the west as if the war had been just down the street i guess that also explains why youre not puking your guts out eckersly said like most rookies would be doing right now i guess so you know what bosch maybe youve got a nose for this stuff maybe i do now harry bosch and his partner kiz rider shared an alcove in the back corner of the openunsolved unit in parker center their desks were pushed together so they could face each other and discuss case matters without having to talk loudly and bother the six other detectives in the squad rider was writing on her laptop entering the completion and summary reports on the verloren case bosch was reading through the dusty pages of a blue binder known as a murder book anything rider asked without looking up from her screen bosch was reviewing the murder book since it was the next case they would work together he hadnt chosen it at random it involved the slaying of june wilkins bosch had been a patrolman then and had been on the job only two days when he and his partner at the time had discovered the body of the murdered woman in her bathtub along with the body of her dog both had been held underwater and drowned there were thousands of unsolved murders in the files of the los angeles police department to justify the time and cost of mounting a new investigation there had to be a hook something that could be sent through the forensic databases in search of a match fingerprints ballistics dna that was what rider was asking had he found a hook not yet he answered then why dont you quit fooling with it and skip to the back she wanted him to skip to the evidence report in the back of the binder and see if there was anything that could fit the bill but bosch wanted to take his time he wanted to know all the details of the case it had been his first db one of many that would come to him in the department but hed had no part in the investigation he had been a rookie patrolman at the time he had to watch the detectives work it it would be years in the department before it was his turn to speak for the dead i just want to see what they did he tried to explain see how they worked it most of these cases they couldashoulda been cleared back in the day well you have till im finished with this summary rider cautioned after that we better get flying on something harry bosch blew out his breath in mock indignation and flipped a large section of summaries and other reports over in the binder until he got to the back he then turned to the tab marked forensics and looked at an evidence inventory report okay weve got latents you happy rider looked up from her computer for the first time that could work she said tied to the suspect bosch flipped back to the evidence report to look for the summary ascribed to the specific evidence logged in the inventory he found a oneparagraph explanation that said a right palm print had been located on the wall of the bathroom where the body had been found its location was sixtysix inches from the floor and seven inches right of center above the toilet well well what its a palm she groaned it was not a good hook databases containing palm prints were relatively new in law enforcement only in the past decade had palm prints been seriously collected by the fbi and the california department of justice in california there were approximately ten thousand palms on file compared with the millions of fingerprints the wilkins murder was thirtythree years old what were the chances that the person who had left a palm print on the wall of the victims bathroom would be printed two decades or more later rideju laterr had answered that one with her groan its still worth a shot bosch said optimistically ill put in the sid request you do that meantime as soon as im done here ill see if i can find a case with a real hook we can run with hold your horses kiz i still havent run any of the names out of the book give me today with this and then well see not good to get emotionally involved harry she responded the laura syndrome you know its not like that im just curious it was sort of my first case no it wasnt you know what i mean i remember thinking she was an old lady when the detectives gave me the rundown on it but she was only fortysix i was half her age so i thought anybody fortysix was old and had had a good run of it i didnt feel too bad about it now you do fortysix was too young kiz well youre not going to bring her back bosch nodded i know that you ever seen that movie laura yeah ive seen it detective falls in love with the murder victim you yeah but it doesnt hold up too well sort of a parlor room murder case i liked the burt reynolds take on it in the eighties sharkys machine with rachel ward you seen it i dont think so had bernie casey in it when i was a youngster i always thought he was a finelooking man bosch looked at her with a raised eyebrow before i switched teams she said then i rented it a couple years ago and bernie didnt do it for me i liked rachel ward her bringing up her sexuality seemed to put an uneasiness between them she turned back to her computer bosch looked down at the evidence report well we know one thing he said after a while were looking for a lefthanded man she turned back to look at him how do you know that he put his right hand on the wall over the toilet and its just like a gun kiz he aimed with his left hand because hes lefthanded she shook her head dismissively men she went back to work on her computer and bosch went back to the murder book he wrote down the information he would need to give to the latent prints section of the scientific investigation division in order for a tech to look up the palm print in their files he then asked if rider wanted him to pick her up a coffee or a soda from the cafeteria while he was floating around the building she said no and he was off he took the murder book with him bosch filled out the comparison request forms and gave them to a print tech named larkin he was one of the older more experienced techs bosch had gone to him before and knew that he would move quickly with the request lets hope we hit the jackpot harry larkin said as he took the forms it was true that there was always a sense of excitement when you put an old print into a computer and let it ride it was like pulling the lever on a slot machine the jackpot payoff was a match a cold hit in police parlance after leaving sid bosch went to the cafeteria for a cup of coffee and to finish reading through the murder book he decided he could handle the constant background noise of the cafeteria better than he could the intrusive questions from kiz rider he understood where his partner was coming from she wanted to choose their cases dispassionately from the thousands that were open her concern was that if they went down a path in which bosch was exorcizing ghosts or choosing cases with personal attachments they would burn out sooner rather than later but bosch was not as concerned he knew that passion was a key element in any investigation passion was the fuel that kept his fire burning so he purposely sought the personal connection or short of that the personal outrage in every case it kept him locked in and focused but it wasnt the laura syndrome it wasnt the same as falling in love with a dead woman by no means was bosch in love with june wilkins he was in love with the idea of reaching back across time and catching the man who had killed her the killing of june wilkins was as horrible as it was cunning the woman was bound hands and feet with a dog collar and a leash and then drowned in the tub her dog was treated to the same death the autopsy showed no bruising or injuries on wilkins suggestive of a struggle but analysis of blood and tissue samples taken during autopsy indicated that she had been drugged with a veterinary paralytic it meant that it was likely that wilkins was conscious but unable to move her muscles to fight or defend herself when she was submerged in the water in the bathtub analysis of the dogs blood found that the animal ith the anhad been drugged with the same substance a textbook investigation followed the murder but it ultimately led to no arrests or the identification of a suspect june wilkins had lived alone she had been divorced and had one child a college student who went to school in philadelphia june worked as an assistant to a casting director in an office in a building at hollywood and vine but had been on a twoweek vacation at the time of her death no evidence was found that shed had an ongoing romantic relationship or that there were any hard feelings from a former relationship it appeared to neighbors acquaintances coworkers and family members that the love of her life was her dog a miniature poodle named frenchy the dog was also the focus of her life he was of pure breed and the only travel wilkins did in the year most recent to her death had been to attend dog shows in san diego and las vegas where frenchy competed the second bedroom of her bungalow had been converted into a grooming salon where ribbons from previous dog shows lined the mirrors the original investigation was conducted by partners joel speigelman and dan finster of wilshire division they began with a wide focus on wilkinss life and then narrowed in on the dog the use of the veterinary drug by the killer and the killing of the dog suggested some connection to that aspect of the victims life but that avenue soon hit a dead end when the detectives found no indication of a dispute or difficulty involving wilkins in the competitive world of dog shows they learned that wilkins was considered a harmless novice in that world and was neither taken seriously by her competitors nor competitive in nature herself the detectives also learned that frenchy though a purebred animal was not a championcaliber dog and the ribbons he took home were more often than not awarded for simply competing not winning the detectives changed their theory and began to consider the possibility that the killer had purposely misdirected the investigation toward the dog show angle but what the correct angle of investigation should have been was never determined the investigation stalled the detectives never linked the palm print on the bathroom wall to anyone and lacking any other solid leads the case was pushed into the waitandsee pile that meant it was still on the desk but the investigators were waiting for something to breakan anonymous tip a confession or even another murder of similar method but nothing came up and after a year it was moved off the table and into the archives to gather dust while reading through the binder bosch had written down a list of names of people who had come up in the investigation these included family members neighbors and coworkers of the victim as well as acquaintances she encountered through veterinary services and the dog shows she attended in most cases speigelman and finster had asked for birth dates addresses and even social security numbers while conducting their interviews it was standard operating procedure their thoroughness back then would now help bosch when he ran every name from the list through the crime computer when finished reading bosch closed the murder book and looked at his list he had collected thirtysix names to run through the computer he knew he had theen w he ha names and the palm print and that was about it he could also run ketamine hydrochloride through the computer to see if it had come up in any other investigations since he decided that if nothing came out of the three angles of investigation he would drop the case admit defeat to his partner and press on to the next case that had a valid hook as he finished his coffee he thought about the palm print there had been no analysis of it other than to measure its location on the wall and have it ready for comparison to suspects that might come up in the investigation but bosch knew that there was more to it than that if the print was sixtysix inches up the wall that meant it was likely that the man who had left it was over six feet tall he came to this conclusion because he knew that if the suspect leaned forward to brace himself while urinating he would probably put his hand on the wall at shoulder level or slightly above add a foot in height for his neck and head and you have a man ranging from six two to six six in total height a tall lefthanded man that narrows it down bosch said to himself noting his own sarcasm he got up dumped his coffee cup and headed out of the cafeteria on the elevator up to five he thought about the times he had leaned his hand on the wall over a toilet he was either drunk middleofthenight sleepy or burdened by something besides a heavy bladder he wondered which of these conditions had fit the tall lefthanded man most of the police departments civilian offices were on the fifth floor along with the openunsolved unit he passed the units door and went down to the personnel department he picked up contact information on speigelman finster and his old partner eckersly in years past such information would be jealously guarded but under order from the office of the chief of police detectives with the openunsolved unit were given carte blanche because it was part of investigatory protocol to contact and interview the original investigators of a case that had been reopened eckersly of course was not one of the original investigators he was only there on the morning they had found the lady in the tub but bosch thought it might be worth a call to see if he remembered that day and had any thoughts on the reinvestigation of the case bosch had lost contact with eckersly after he completed his street training and was transferred out of wilshire division he assumed he was no longer on the job and was not mistaken eckersly had pulled the plug at twenty years and his pension was sent to the town of ten thousand palms where he was the police chief nice move bosch thought running a smalltown police force in the desert and collecting an lapd pension on the side every cops dream bosch also noted the coincidence of eckersly now living in a town called ten thousand palms and the fact that bosch was currently running an angle through a database of ten thousand palm prints rider was not at her desk when bosch got back to the unit there was no note of explanation left on his desk and he figured she had simply taken a break he sat at her desk and looked at her laptop she had left it on but had cleared the screen before leavingchifore le the office he pulled the list of names out of the murder book and connected to the national crime index computer he didnt have his own computer and was not highly skilled in the use of the internet and most law enforcement databases but the ncic had been around for years and he knew how to run names on it all thirtysix names on his list would have been run through existing databases in and cleared what he was looking for now was whether any of the thirtysix people had been arrested for any kind of significant or similar crime in the years after the june wilkins murder the first name he entered came back with multiple hits for drunk driving arrests this didnt get bosch particularly excited but he circled the name on the list anyway and moved on no hits came up on the next seven and he crossed them out the next name after that scored a hit with an arrest for disturbing the peace bosch circled it but again was not feeling the tug of a hook yet the process continued with most of the names coming up clean it wasnt until he entered the twentyninth name that bosch looked at the screen and felt a tightness grip in his chest the twentyninth name was jonathan gillespie he had been described in the murder book as a dog breeder who sold miniature poodles in he had sold the dog frenchy to june wilkins two years before her death and was interviewed by speigelman and finster when they were trying to run down the dog show angle on the case according to the ncic records gillespie went to prison on a rape charge in and served six years in prison he was now a registered sexual offender living in huntington beach there had been no other arrests since he was sixtyeight years old bosch underlined the name on the list and wrote down the case number it had an lapd prefix though he immediately wanted to go to work on gillespie he finished running the rest of the names through the ncic database first he got two more hits one for a dui and one for a hitandrun accident with injuries he circled the names to keep with his procedure but was not excited about them before signing out of the ncic system he switched over to the crimetracking database and entered ketamine hydrochloride into the search window he got several hits back all within the last fifteen years and learned that the substance was being used increasingly as a date rape drug he scrolled through the cases listed and didnt see anything that linked them to june wilkins he logged off the database to begin his pursuit of jonathan gillespie closed cases from had gone to microfiche archives and the department was slowly moving backward and entering case information into the departments computerized database but was too far back the only way bosch would be able to look at the sexual assault case that had sent gillespie to prison would be to go to the records archives which were housed over at piper tech the storage facility and air squadron base at the edge of downtown bosch went to his side of the desk and wrote a note to rider telling her he had come up with a hot angle and was chasing it through piper tech the phone on his desk started to ring he finished the note and grabbed the phone while standing up to reach the note over to riders desk heightem openunsolved this is bosch harry its larkin i was just going to call you really why i have a name for you funny i have a name for you i matched your palm and youre not going to like it jonathan gillespie what jonathan gillespie who is that thats not your match not quite bosch sat back down at his desk he pulled a pad over in front of him and got ready to write who did you come up with the palm print belonged to one of ours guy must have left it while at the crime scene sorry about that who is it the name is ronald eckersly he worked for us sixtyfive to eightyfive then he pulled the pin bosch almost didnt hear anything else larkin said shows that he was a patrol lieutenant upon retirement you could go to personnel and get a current location if you need to talk to him but it looks like he might have just screwed up and put his hand on the wall while he was at the scene back then they didnt know anything about crime scene protocol and some of these guys wouldhell about twenty years ago i was dusting a homicide scene and one of the detectives who had been there all night started frying an egg in the dead guys kitchen he said he aint gonna miss it and im goddamn starved you believe that so no matter how hard you drill into them not to touch thanks larkin bosch said ive got to go bosch hung up grabbed the note off riders desk and crumpled it in his hand he took his cell phone off his belt and called riders cell number she answered right away where are you bosch asked having a coffee you want to take a ride ive got the caseegot the summary to finish a ride where ten thousand palms harry thats not a ride thats a journey thats at least ninety minutes each way get me a coffee for the road ill be right down he hung up before she could protest on the drive out bosch told rider about the moves he had made with the case and how the print had come back to his old partner he then recounted the morning he and eckersly had found the lady in the tub rider listened without interrupting then she had only one question at the end this is important harry she said you are dealing with your own memory and you know from case experience how faulty memories can be were talking thirtythree years ago are you sure there wasnt a moment when eckersly could have put his hand on the wall yeah like he mightve leaned against the wall and taken a leak while i didnt notice im not talking about taking a leak could he have leaned against the wall when you found the body like he got grossed out or sick and leaned against the wall for support no kiz i was in that room the whole time he was he said lets get out of here and he was the first one out he did not go back in we called in the detectives and then stood outside keeping the neighbors away when everybody showed up thirtythree years is a long time harry bosch waited a moment before responding i know this sounds sad and sick but your first db is like your first love you remember the details plus he didnt finish plus what plus my mother was murdered when i was a kid i think its why i became a cop so finding that womanmy second day on the jobwas sort of like finding my mother i cant explain it but what i can tell you is that i remember being in that house like it was yesterday and eckersly never touched a thing in there let alone put his hand on the wall over the toilet now she was silent for a long moment before responding okay harry ten thousand palms was on the outskirts of joshua tree they made good time and pulled into the visitor parking space in front of the tiny police station shortly before one they had worked out how they would handle eckersly in the last half hour of the drive they went in and i rwent inasked a woman who was sitting behind a front counter if they could speak with eckersly they flashed the gold and told her they were from the openunsolved unit the woman picked up a phone and communicated the information to someone on the other end before she hung up a door behind her opened and there stood ron eckersly he was thicker and his skin a dark and worn brown from the desert he still had a full head of hair which was cut short and silver bosch had no trouble recognizing him but it didnt appear that he recognized bosch detectives come on back he said he held the door and they walked into his office he was wearing a blue blazer with a maroon tie over a white shirt it did not appear to bosch that he had a gun on his belt maybe in a little desert town a gun wasnt needed the office was a small space with lapd memorabilia and photographs on the wall behind the desk rider introduced herself and shook eckerslys hand and then bosch did the same there was a hesitation in eckerslys shake and then bosch knew instinctively he knew he was holding the hand of june wilkinss killer harry bosch eckersly said you were one of my boots right thats right i came on the job in seventytwo we rode wilshire patrol for nine months imagine that one of my boots coming back to see me actually we want to talk to you about a case from seventytwo rider said as planned she took the lead they took seats and bosch once again tried to determine if eckersly was armed there was no telltale bulge beneath the blazer rider explained the case to eckersly and reminded him that he and bosch had been the patrol officers who discovered the body she asked if he remembered the case at all eckersly leaned back in his desk chair his jacket falling to his sides and revealing no holster or weapon on his belt he looked for an answer on the ceiling finding nothing he leaned forward and shook his head im drawing a blank detectives he said and im not sure why you would come all the way out here to ask an old patrol dog about a db my guess is we were in and out and we cleared the way for the dicks isnt that right partner he looked at bosch his last word a reminder that they had once protected each others back yes we were in and out but we have informationnewly discovered informationthat you apparently had a relationship with the victim rider said matteroffactly and that this relationship was not brought to light during the initial investigation eckersly looked closely at her wondering how to read the situation bosch knew this wase wnew thi the pivotal moment if eckersly were to make a mistake it would be now what information eckersly asked were not at liberty to discuss it chief rider responded but if you have something to tell us tell us now it would be best for you to clear this up before we go down the road with it eckerslys face cracked into a smile and he looked at bosch this is a joke right bosch youre putting her up to this right bosch shook his head no joke bosch said youre in a spot here chief eckersly shook his head as if not comprehending the situation you said openunsolved right thats cold case stuff dna this a dna case bosch felt things tumbling into place eckersly had made the mistake he had taken the bait and was fishing for information it wasnt what an innocent man would do rider felt it too she leaned toward his desk chief do you mind if i give you a rights warning before we go further with this oh come on eckersly protested you cant be serious what relationship rider read eckersly the standard miranda rights warning from a card she pulled out of a pocket in her blazer chief eckersly do you understand your rights as i have read them of course i understand them ive only been a cop for forty years what the hell is going on here whats going on is that we are giving you the opportunity to explain the relationship you had with this woman if you choose not to cooperate then its not going to work out well for you i told you there was no relationship and you cant prove there was that body had been in that tub for a week from what i heard it practically came apart when they were taking it out of there you got no dna nobody even knew about dna back then rider made a quick glance toward bosch and this was her signal that he could step in if he wanted he did you worked wilshire for four years before that morning bosch said did you meet her on patrol when she was out walking the dog where did you meet her chief you told me you were working solo for four months before i was put in the car with you is that when you met her when you were out working alone eckersly angrily grabbed the phone out of its cradle on his dellyle on hsk i still know some people at parker center im going to see if they are aware of what you two people are doing coming to my office to accuse me of this crap if you call anyone you better call your lawyer bosch said eckersly slammed the phone back down into its cradle what do you want from me i did not know that woman just like you i saw her for the first time floating with her dog in the bathtub first and last time and i got out of there as fast as i goddamn could and you never went back in thats right boot i never went back in there they had him then how come your palm print was on the wall over the toilet eckersly froze bosch read his eyes he remembered the moment he had put his hand on the wall he knew they had him eckersly glanced out the offices only window it was to his left and it offered a view of a fire department equipment yard he then looked back at bosch and spoke in a quiet voice you know how often i wondered when somebody like you would show up here how many years ive been waiting bosch nodded it must have been a burden he said without sympathy she wanted more she wanted something permanent eckersly said christ she was fifteen years older than me she was just a patrol pal thats what we called them but then she got the wrong idea about things and when i had to set her straight she said she was going to make a complaint about me she was going to go to the captain i was married back then i couldnt he said nothing else his eyes were downcast he was looking at the memory bosch could put the rest of it together eckersly hatched a plan that would throw the investigation off send it in the wrong direction his only mistake was the moment he put his hand on the wall over the toilet you have to come with us now chief rider said she stood up eckersly looked up at her with you he said no i dont with his right hand he pulled open the desk drawer in front of him and quickly reached in with his left he withdrew a black steel pistol and brought it up to his neck no rider yelled eckersly pressed the muzzle deep into the left side of his neck he angled the weapon upward and pulled the trigger the weapons contact against his skin muffled the blast his head snapped back and blood splattered across the wall of police memorabilia behind him bosch never moved in his seat he just watched it happen pretty soon the woman from the front counter came running in and she screamed and held her hands up to her mouth bosch turned and looked at rider that was a long time coming he said laura was already rented at eddies saturday matinee so bosch rented sharkys machine instead he watched it at home that night while drinking beer and eating peanut butter sandwiches and trying to keep his mind away from what had happened in eckerslys office it wasnt a bad movie though he could see almost everything coming burt reynolds and bernie casey made pretty good cops and rachel ward was the call girl with a heart of gold bosch saw what burt saw in her he thought he could easily fall in love with her too call girl or not dead or alive near the end of the movie there was a shootout and bernie casey got wounded bleeding and out of bullets he used a zen mantra to make himself invisible to the approaching shooter it worked the shooter walked right by him and bernie lived to tell about it bosch liked that at the end of the movie he remembered that moment the best he wished there were a zen chant he could use now so ronald eckersly could just walk on by him too but he knew there was no such thing eckersly would take his place with the others that came to him at night the ones he remembered bosch thought about calling kiz and telling her what he thought of the movie but he knew it was too late and she would get upset with him he killed the tv instead and turned off the lights about the author michael connelly is the author of the recent new york times bestsellers the fifth
