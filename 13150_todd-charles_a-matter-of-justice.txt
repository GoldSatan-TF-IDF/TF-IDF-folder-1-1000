charles todd a matter of justice the scilly isles may ronald evering was in his study watching a mechanical toy bank go through its motions when the idea first came to him the bank had been a gift from a friend who knew he collected such things it had been sent over from america and with it in a small pouch were american pennies with which to feed the new acquisition because they fit the coin slot better than the english penny a painted castiron figure of a fat man sat in a chair his belly spreading his brown coat so that his yellow waistcoat showed and one hand was stretched out to receive his bribe from political figures and ordinary citizens seeking his favor his name was boss tweed and he had controlled political patronage in new york city in the aftermath of the american civil war through an alliance between tammany hall and the democratic party graft had been his stockintrade now his image was encouraging children to be thrifty a penny saved the note accompanying the gift had ended look on this as a swindler of sorts for the swindled my dear ronald and take your revenge by filling his belly full of pennies in time to recoup your pounds he hadnt particularly cared for the tone of the note and had burned it still the bank was a clever addition to his collection it had been a mistake to confide in anyone and the only reason hed done it was to vent his rage at his own impotence even then he hadnt told his friend the whole truth that hed invested those pounds in order to look murderers in the face to see if such a thing existed what it was that made a man a killer in the end all hed achieved was to make himself known to two people who had no qualms about deliberately cheating him the explanation was simplethey wanted no part of him and losing his money was the simplest way to get rid of him without any fuss he hadnt foreseen it and it had become a personal affront he had sensed the subtle change in the air when hed first given his name and cursed himself for not using his mothers maiden name instead but the damage was done and hed been afraid to let them see what he suspected yet it had shown himeven though he couldnt prove itthat hed been right about them what he didnt know was what to do with that knowledge vengeance is mine saith the lord but the lord had been remarkably slow exacting it if anything these two men had prospered and he had had no experience of vengeance there was only his mother crying in his fathers arms this quiet unassuming woman fiercely demanding that whoever had killed her dear boy be punished a tenyearold listening from the shadows of the stairs shocked and heartbroken had endured nightmares about that moment for years afterward and it was his mothers prodding after his fathers death that had sent him to cape town in to bring her dear boy home from his south african grave your father couldnt do it but you must shed urged him time and again its your duty to timothy to me to the family bring him home let him lie beside your father in the churchyard where he belongs find a way if you love me and let me see him resting there before i die trying to shake off the memory evering took another penny from the pouch and placed it in boss tweeds outstretched hand almost quicker than the eye could follow the hand slid the penny into the waistcoat pocket as boss tweeds head moved to nod his thanks the man smiled it was no wonder he preferred these toys to people he had come home from cape town with his brothers body after two years of forms and long hours in hot dusty offices in search of the proper signatures what he hadnt bargained for was the information hed collected along the way information he had never told his mother but which had been a burden on his soul ever since almost ten years now because like hamlet he couldnt make up his mind what to do about what he knew well to be fair not ten years of singleminded effort the great war had begun the year after his return from south africa while he was still trying to discover what had become of those two men after they left the army it wasnt his fault that hed been stationed in india far from home but that had turned out to be a lucky break for he discovered quite by accident where they were and what they were doing in early hed been shipped back to london suffering from the bloody flux almost grateful for that because he was able at last to look into the information hed come by in poona only hed misjudged his quarries and made a fool of himself it wouldnt do to brood on events again that way lay madness on the shelves behind him was an array of mechanical and clockwork toys many of them for adults like the golden bird that rose from an enameled snuffbox to sing like a nightingale banks were a particularly fine subject for such mechanical marvels a penny tip to the owner sent a performing dog through a hoop in another example a grinning bear disappeared down a tree stump as the hunter lifted his rifle to fire humor and clever design had gone into the creation of each toy the shifting weight of the penny set the device concealed in the base into motion making the action appear to be magical he had always found such devices fascinating even after hed worked out the mechanism that propelled them his mind grasped the designers plan very quickly and sometimes he had bettered it in devices of his own skill calling to skill he took quiet pride in that he reached for another penny to put into boss tweeds hand thinking to himself that it would be equally as fascinating to trick human beings into doing whatever one wished by placing not a coin in a slot but an idea in their minds he sat back stunned at the thought hadnt he gone to south africa to please his mother to earn the love shed always lavished on his elder brother hoping in some fashion that when he had accomplished what she asked of him hed be loved as much too she had used him as surely as if she had slipped a penny in the proper slot his mother had died six weeks after they had buried his brother in the churchyard and it wasnt his name on her lips as she breathed her lasther final thoughts had been turned toward that glorious reunion in heaven with her dear boy it was over her corpse lying in her coffin in the hall of this very house that hed poured out all hed been told in south africa wanting to hurt her as much as she had hurt him but well aware that nothing he said could touch her now knowing himself for a coward even as the words drained him and in the silence of the empty house he could almost hear her voice as clearly as if she spoke from the closed coffin telling him to do his duty once more kill them ronald see that they pay send them to hell my boy and ill love you then easy enough for her to say but how did one go about finding one murderer let alone a pair of them and once found how did one go about punishing them does one conceal a revolver in ones pocket and shoot the bastards there and then both men were equally guiltyhe had no reservations about that one for the act itself the other for never reporting it and seeing that justice was done he didnt want to hang for them or his mother or her dear boy he had tried to persuade the army to look into the matter and they had turned a blind eye they hadnt even initiated an inquiry hadnt so much as taken down names his only evidence was the word of an aging drunken boer who hated the english ten years later as much as hed hated them during the fighting and what was that worth i ask you the army had said against the word of two englishmen and yet the afrikaner who had been left for dead by his comrades had lain there wounded within sight and hearing of the train until hed stopped bleeding and could crawl away he had watched the horror unfold and it must be truein gods name how could he have made up such a monstrous tale what he couldnt tell evering was why it had been done except that he had heard two men arguing over money and evering hadnt cared about that only about the death of his brother in the hall staring down at the coffin ronald evering hadnt been able to shut out the voice of his mother even after swearing he would see that the devils paid for months afterward it was as if she could see his ambivalence and cursed him for it hadnt he loved his brother didnt he want revenge for what had been done to him yes but how dear god how it was a vicious circle and hed gone round and round it looking for a solution until he had learned to shut her out even when hed tried to take a first step it had been disastrous hed crept home with his tail between his legs like a whipped dog too bad he couldnt set into motion a little scene of his own paying one figure a penny to scurry across the castiron stage to bury his woodsmans ax into another figures skull while the wolfhimself leered from behind painted castiron bushes it could be done in iron he knew given the right counterweights and the right penny it would take less than a day to create a drawing would it work with fleshandblood people as well as these mechanical devices no reason why it shouldnt his mother was proof of that he sat back and reviewed everything hed learned about the two men where was the penny the chink in the armor they had built for themselves what was the instinct or desire or fear that would send a human being headlong into action without thinking about consequences like the mechanical hunter or the mechanical dogonce set in motion the outcome was inevitable inescapable surely he could work out a revenge that would in no way make him vulnerable either to the police if he succeeded or to retribution from those two men if he failed a cowardly wish he was willing to admit that but hadnt he already suffered enough on his brothers behalf perhaps afterward he could get on with his own life engrossed by the idea he sat there for some time staring into the painted features of the new york man who had run tammany hall for years and grown fat on trickery and power now reduced to a victorian concept of thrift and good humor no one took this boss tweed seriously a figure of fun not a figure of fear and perhaps that was the best trick of all those murderers had dismissed him ronald evering as no danger to them hadnt they theyd even taken his money as proof that he was harmless no doubt laughing behind his back at how clever theyd been making certain that whatever he might tell the world about them they could claim he was no more than a disgruntled client he reached for pen and paper after half an hour spent putting together his design weighing the balances and counterbalances he rather thought it could be done amazing how simple it was really he hadnt known he was capable of such a scheme his mother would have been horrified south africa twenty years earlier the boer war the military train pulled out just after dawn three carriages guarded by a company under lieutenant timothy evering it was carrying weapons and ammunition forward and bringing wounded back the boers were masters at ambush and three trains had been stopped on this line in the past month alone spread out through the carriages his men were silent for the most part their nerves on edge as they watched for the danger that was invisible somewhere out there in the bush evering hunkered by the window in the last carriage was all too aware that he had been given green men men who hadnt faced a baptism of fire he didnt want to think about how they would respond if the dutchmen attacked if they didnt shoot themselves in the foot in their nervousness it would be a miracle and hed already thanked god for sergeant bellman an old hand at war and steady as a rock he turned to say something to the private nearest him when the engine brakes caught with a screech of metal that deafened him the train lurched and fought against the brakes and for an instant he thought the engine or the cars would jump the tracks then they came to an abrupt stop that nearly threw him across the carriage floor the boers had blocked the bloody right of way he could hear sergeant bellman yelling orders somewhere ahead and the thud of his boots as he ran back through the train encouraging his men to hold their fire until he gave the order evering scrambling to his feet called to the men in the next carriages to keep a sharp lookout and then before the words were out of his mouth the orangemen were on them dead shots all of them and fearless it was a short fight the british soldiers were outnumbered and outgunned private quarles cringing behind a large crate swore a steady stream of profanity that was in effect a prayer his rifle on the floor beside him hadnt been fired what ran through his mind at that instant was purely selfcentered hed taken the queens shilling to get himself out of the mines his father and his brothers had worked as long as he could remember the army was better than breathing in the black dust until he coughed his lungs out better than hearing the timbers over his head creak and snap as they gave way better than living without his legs because the coal face collapsed on them before he could get clear and now he was going to die anyway those bloody men out there would kill them all and leave their bodies in the harsh southern sun to rot or be picked apart by those bloody great vultures hed seen digging into carcasses someone was screaming just behind him jabbing at his back with the butt of a rifle and quarles wheeled ready to lash out from sheer selfpreservation boer or british soldier he didnt care nothing was going to make him come out and fight but it was only penrith trying to squeeze his thin body into the space that could hardly conceal one man much less two quarles swung at him forcing him back and in that few seconds silence fell across the veldt they stayed where they were two privates so frightened that the sweat soaked their uniforms and ran down their pale faces like rainwater quarles could hear horses now riding fast he thought for an instant that they were coming to search the train and shoot the survivors someone was groaning in the carriage up ahead and he could see the sergeant crumpled by a window his breath bubbling in his throat if only the damned fools would be quiet the commando might believe theyd already finished the killing the lieutenant was lying in a pool of blood and after a few seconds quarles reached out dipped his hand in it and wiped it across his face and through his hair another handful went down the front of his tunic he could pretend to be dead if he could stop shaking but it wasnt him shaking it was penrith behind him theyve gone is it a trap to lure us out for gods sake what are we to do he was whispering frantically quarles ignored the man trying to hear nearly a quarter of an hour passed and nothing happened flies were already buzzing loudly in the stillness whoever had been groaning up ahead had stopped but now someone was calling for water it was a london voice cockney quarles shoved the shivering man beside him out of his way and keeping his head down crawled to the nearest window unable to stand the uncertainty there was nothing as far as the horizon neither man nor animal the boers had vanished as swiftly as theyd appeared evering had put up a good fight but the commando sharpshooters were used to hitting their mark he crawled into the next carriage to be sure shoving the sergeant aside the man was dead his body unwieldy quarles carefully lifted his eyes to another window nothing to be seen on that side either the boers had gone he stood up his legs shaky from crouching so long and wiped his forehead with his hand he was close to laughing at the sight he must make bloody enough to be a hero it was his first fight and by god if he had anything to say to it it would be his last looking around he grimaced at the amount of blood covering the carriage floors he hadnt realized that a man had so much in him or that it could sicken the stomach with its stench penrith peering out from behind the crate in the last carriage pleaded is it over say something his frantic appeal carried in the silence quarles ignored him he went through the rest of the carriages to see how many of everings men had survived then he came back to the last one where evering lay badly wounded the mans eyes blazed up at him and his voice only a husky whisper demanded where were you as if one more man might have mattered as if another rifle could have held them off quarles dragged the lieutenant out of the sun and propped him against a box of shells it was only then that he saw what the lieutenant was lying ontwo leather bags one of them torn open with the edges of pound notes just visible in the white african light spilling through the window he knelt over the bags and reached in unable to believe his eyes there was more money in them than hed seen in his lifetime more money than god himself had he wasnt sure where it was being taken or why it was there and he couldnt stop looking at it evering was saying something but quarles didnt listen his mind was enthralled by the sight and he knew he wanted that money more than hed ever wanted anything ever penrith came stumbling toward him he said most of them must be dead i counted four wounded quarles answered quickly shoving pound notes under the edge of everings tunic out of sight not including him he jerked his head at the lieutenant but penrith had seen the money good god falling on his knees he reached out to touch the bag just as quar les snatched it away evering behind them said quite clearly put it back but quarles had no intention of obeying he picked up the two bags four wounded he repeated five counting him he got to his feet and reached for his rifle starting toward the engine wait here im coming stay with him i say quarles went forward to find three men bleeding profusely but still alive the fourth was already unconscious his face gray water one of the men begged reaching out his hand shaking like a palsy quarles shot him and before the others could move he shot them as well then he moved on to the locomotive both the engineer and the fireman were dead looking out he could see the boers had pulled out the tracks and piled the ties in plain view to force the engineer to stop there would be no going forward now and no returning to the depot unless penrith knew how to manage the damned controls he went back to the last carriage and knelt beside evering is there any more of this he held up the bags for the lieutenant to see them evering shook his head whats it for then evering fighting to stay alert didnt answer penrith crouched in a corner said i heard gunfire theyre back quarles was on the point of shooting him as well and then he thought better of it i was afraid there was something out there never mind it was nothing nerves penrithcan you run the locomotive the way ahead is blocked we have to go back me no what are we to do then weve got to get the wounded to cover and one of us ought to go for help even as he said the words he read the decision in quarless face and began shaking his head why does it have to be me quarles was in no frame of mind to argue ill see to the men go on then walk as far as you can before dark then find somewhere to dig in ill stay here until you come back i dont want to go and what about this money what are you going to do with it ill see to that as well mind you dont mention it to anyone otherwise theyll take it from us im not leaving it behind i dont trust you youve done nothing to earn it my lad not yet go for help leave me to clear away here and when you find that help mind you act dazed confused just tell them the boers attacked and the lieutenant here sent you for help the less you say to them the better without warning he set aside his rifle and swung his fist as hard as he could catching penrith on the cheekbone and then hit him again blood ran from a torn lip dripping onto his uniform penrith angrier than he could ever remember being lunged at quarles but the man had already retrieved his rifle and kept him at bay dont be a fool penrith if you arrive after a fight with the boer looking fresh as a bleeding daisy theyll be suspicious something in his face made penrith look sharply at him i counted four shots you killed them didnt you the wounded yes and ill kill you too if you dont listen you want a share of that money how are we going to do that hmmm tell the army weve taken a fancy to it tell them no one else is alive so we thought wed help ourselves theyll hunt us like animals first we must deal with this lot go back to the camp and think about it as you walk if were smart well let the army blame the boers for the money going missing we know nothing about it eh it was the lieutenants little secret and we never laid eyes on it but hes alive look at him do you think hell last the day im no doctor i cant save him hes the only one can talk if we keep our heads whats it to be then do your part or die with the others its all the same to me penrith staring at the rifle in the other mans hands said with as much bravado as he could muster ill go but play any tricks on me and ill see you hang he backed out of the carriage his gaze on quarles and nearly stumbled over a railroad tie as he stepped down then he stopped fool that he was hed left his own rifle in the train as if hed read penriths mind quarles reached down picked up a rifle and tossed it to him take the sergeants you wont get far without it penrith caught it retreating watching those cold eyes watching him and expecting to be shot in the back when he turned when he was safely out of range quarles was still standing there in the carriage door his face a mask of blood and determination penrith turned on his heel and began to walk the tracks back to the depot he didnt trust quarles on the other hand he told himself the man was right if he didnt share the money penrith could turn him in and he thought on the whole the army was more likely to believe him a curates son than quarles a less than exemplary soldier time would tell what would come of this days work he could still see those pound notes thick wads of them it was all he could think of as he walked steadily toward the depot on the train quarles waited until penrith was out of sight and no threat to him then he did three things he went through the carriages again to be certain there were no more wounded he scanned the veldt for miles to be certain the boers had gone away and then he searched every inch of the last carriage for other bags of money as he did he could feel everings eyes on him baleful and full of pain there was no more hed found it all quarles took the two bags ignoring the weak protests of the severely wounded man and stacked the notes to one side he remembered an oiled cloth hed seen near the dead fireman and trotted forward to fetch it it was thick with coal dust and torn but it was still large enough for his purpose wrapping the money carefully in the cloth he took it outside and searched for a place to dig he found that some thirty yards from the tracks and with his bare hands he worked furiously at creating a hole deep enough to conceal the bundle it took him over an hour but when he was finished there was nothing to show that hed been there a small branch swept across where hed worked erased any signs of digging he stepped back considering his handiwork the question was how to mark the spot looking around he saw a flat rock shaped like a turtle it was heavy but he carried it across to where the money was hidden and set it on top it was the best he could do when he got back to the carriage he was surprised to find evering still alive the man was holding on tenaciously determination in the set of his jaw his eyes watched quarles bright against the flushed skin of his face as if recording everything he saw for the courtmartial to come quarles ignored him going about his next task with cold efficiency he placed the empty money bags at everings feet and then went searching for lanterns after pouring all their oil over the last carriage he took the lanterns back to where hed found them evering was still watching him but with alarm in his eyes now what are you doing man he managed to say with sufficient force to be heard youre the only one who knew about the money and when they come theyll want to know where it is theyre not going to believe that the boers took it are they so i dont have any choice he had found matches in the sergeants kit and he struck them now and lit the spreading puddles of oil the old carriages were tender dry theyd burn in a hurry they wouldnt need the oil after a few minutes evering cried you cant do this its inhuman watch me quarles said and jumped out of the carriage he tried to walk far enough away to shut out the cries of the burning man but he could hear them in his mind if not his ears they would haunt him for a long time but it was so much money it would set him up for life even if he shared it with penrith or not it would depend on how useful the man was he waited until the flames had nearly died down then went back to the blackened carriages and thrust his hands into the remnants of the fire he hadnt known it would hurt that badly but he forced himself to put his face close enough to singe his hair and his skin and then fighting the pain as best he could he crawled under what was left of the first carriage out of the sun hen help arrived many hours later quarles was half out of his he hadnt looked at what was left of lieutenant timothy barton evering mind with pain and thirst they dealt with him gently and the doctor did what he could he didnt see penrith and didnt ask for him he lay on the stretcher calling everings name until someone bent over him and said hes dead there was nothing you could do after that he shut his eyes and was quiet the inquiry into the ambush was not lengthy penrith supported the account that a shot could have broken a lantern and set the last carriage on fire but i didnt see it burning when i left all i could think of was the wounded and getting help for them as fast as possible his face was pale and his voice tended to shake penrith was the son of a curate they believed him quarles when interviewed remembered only beating at the flames to reach the lieutenant his burns were serious and his bandages spoke to his courage he was sent to cape town where doctors worked on his hands and penrith whose feet had been badly blistered by his walk was sent to a hospital in port elizabeth they didnt meet again until the end of the war in it was penrith who came to find quarles and he asked him outright for his share of the money ive earned it now and ill have it before were sent home quarles smiled oh yes and you on a spending spree a privates pay couldnt explain no we split the money and take it home with us we wait a year and then decide how to hide it in plain sight do you think weve fooled them stupidity will get us hanged yet as long as we split it now penrith said i want it in my hand where you cant trick me or hide from me once weve split it were finished with each other did you hear they found the boers that attacked our train and hanged the leader i wouldnt press my luck if i were you a misstep now and well be decorating the gibbet he kept warm for us but penrith was not to be put off quarles took five days of leave and found a carriage and horse that he could borrow though his hands were still stiff and almost useless he located the site of the attack after some difficulty found the flat stone after walking in circles for three hours and dug up the packet in the oiled cloth most of it he split into two black valises hed brought with him for the rest he found a black woman in an isolated hut and asked her to sew the money into pockets in the lining of his tunic she thought him a mad englishman but he promised to pay her well when the tunic was ready he drowned her in the stream where she washed her clothes for fear she would gossip if hed been a superstitious man hed have believed she put a curse on him as she died as it was she fought hard and he was glad he hadnt put his tunic on before dealing with her penrith was waiting for him at the livery stable when he brought the carriage back and demanded that he take his pick of the two valises to be sure the split was fair and square as god is my witness quarles answered him youll find both hold the same sum look for yourself its more than either of us can ever expect to earn dont be greedy penrith said his curiosity getting the better of him as he examined both valises does it ever bother you how we came by this does it bother you quarles retorted picking up the nearest case he walked off and didnt look back as luck would have it the two men arrived in london on the same troop ship and were mustered out of the army in the same week quar les took penrith to the nearest pub and made a suggestion weve got to find work until the armys forgot us it wouldnt look right would it for either of us to be rich as a nob when we joined up with no more than a shilling to our names penrith was stubborn youve put me off long enough i have my share ill spend it as i please you do that and ill tell them you stole the money while i was trying to save the lieutenant in the end quarles put the wind up penrith who was afraid of quarles and would be for years to come they each took up positions at a merchant bank penrith as the doorman because of his fair looks and his air of breeding and general work for quarles with the ugly scars on his hands his eyebrows had never grown out again properly giving him a quizzical expression but he was a big man with pale red hair and a charm that he practiced diligently turning it on at need the account he gave of his burns elicited laughter and sympathy for he kept the story of rushing into a burning house to save a child droll rather than dramatic there was no mention of the army or south africa and as far as anyone knew neither penrith nor quarles had ever left the country quarles had been good at numbers in school and that training together with a clever mind was put to work it wasnt long before he caught the eye of one of the junior partners and six months later he was promoted to mr jamess clerk on that same day quarles said to penrith i can see that theres a way to be rich without suspicion and outlined his plan penrith ever slow to see what might be to his own advantage said but weve got money we dont need to work you promised quarles looked at him have you counted what youve got its nothing compared to what comes in and out these doors every day it looked like a kings ransom there on the veldt but i know better now ive asked mr james if hed be kind enough to invest what an old aunt left me i told him id run through it in six months else and hes agreed youd be smart to do the same soon well be twice as rich and then theres no stopping us he smiled mr james sees a coal miners brat with brains in his head hes a snob he thinks im a clever monkey doing tricks to amuse him but in the end its mr james whos jumping through hoops of my making im a clerk now and mark my words ill go higher as high as i please and if youre a wise one youll hang on to my coattails i didnt do you a bad turn in the transvaal did i we havent hanged yet have we penrith said youre a clever monkey all right the question is do i trust you and how far quarles laughed harshly suit yourself but dont come whining to me when your pittance runs out and theres no way to replace it and dont think you can blackmail me into saving your arse youll hang beside me somerset near exmoor may there was a stone terrace on the northern side of the house with a dramatic view down to the sea the town of minehead was invisible around the next headland to the east and to the west exmoor rolled to the horizon empty as far as the eye could see not even a gulls cry broke the stillness though they sailed on the wind above the water wings bright in the morning sun rutledge sat in a comfortable chair by the terrace wall more relaxed than hed been in some time half an hour later a faint line of gray was making itself known in the far distance storm clouds building somewhere over cornwall a pity he thought watching them the weather had held fair so far all that was needed was barely another twentyfour hours for tomorrows wedding after that the rain could fall he had taken a few days of leave edgar maitland a friend from before the war had asked rutledge to come to somerset to meet his bride and to stand up with him at the wedding this had been maitlands grandfathers house and rutledge could understand why his friend preferred to live here most of the year now keeping his flat for the occasional visit to london edgar had also inherited his grandfathers law firm in nearby dunster and appeared to be well on his way to becoming a country solicitor rutledge and maitland had lost touch after but when mait land had come to town in april to buy a ring for his bride hed tracked rutledge down at scotland yard france had changed both men but they understood that these differences were safest left unspoken what had drawn them together at university had been an enthusiasm for tennis and cricket what had made them friends was a feeling for the law and this each of them in their own way had held on to through the nightmare of war seeing their salvation in returning to it maitland had often goodnaturedly berated rutledge for choosing to join the police a waste old man you must see that and rutledge always answered i have no ambition to be a kc ive left that to you when rutledge had met elise on his arrival in dunster hed had reservations about the match she was young pretty and in love the question was whether she was up to the task of caring for a man whod lost his leg in france and with it for many months his self worth unlike the steady happy man rutledge had seen in london now edgar was by turns moody and excited as the wedding day approached and that boded ill for the future indeed last night when they were alone on the terrace darkness obscuring their faces and only their voices betraying their feelings edgar had said morosely i cant dance she says she doesnt care for dancing or play tennis she doesnt care for tennis she says but thats now what about next year or the year after if shes bored and some other bloke asks her to dance or to be his partner in a match what then will she smile at me and ask permission and be relieved when i give it rutledge had grinned cold feet lieutenant wheres the bane of the sappers the man who never backed out of anything even a burning tunnel yes well i was brave once too often and its cold foot now do you know i can still feel pain in my missing leg phantom pain they call it the nerve endings looking for something that isnt there and worrying themselves into knots thats common i think apparently but its damned odd when its your foot itching and theres nothing there to scratch they had laughed but edgar had drunk a little too much last night and was sleeping it off this morning rutledge watched that thin line of gray cloud for a time decided that it was not growing any larger and turned his attention to the sea below tranquil before the turn of the tide behind him the terrace door opened and he looked up expecting to see edgar elise came out to join him he hadnt heard her motorcar arriving in the forecourt but she must have driven over from dunster looking for edgar he wished her a good morning as he rose to bring a chair forward for her she sat down sighed and watched the gulls in her turn a penny for your thoughts he asked after a time i wish i knew what was worrying edgar its frustrating he wont talk to me that makes me feel young useless and the weddings tomorrow he realized that she had come to find him not maitland youre several years younger in age rutledge pointed out gently and a hundred years younger in experience she shrugged irritably i know the war ive been told that until im sick of it it doesnt explain everything in a way it does rutledge replied carefully it marked most of us i expect that it will stay with us until were dead yes but thats looking back isnt it you survivedand so theres life ahead marriage a family a future you and edgar were the lucky ones you lived now get on with it he laughed would that we could oh dont be silly ian you know what i mean if you stay bogged down in the trenches then theyve won you went on with your profession edgar can go on with his hes not the only man in england with one leg hes not a freak hes not unique a solicitor can manage with one leg for heavens sake he couldnt tell her why hed returned to the yard last year at what cost and for what reasons he answered only have you ever had a terrifying nightmare elise of course everyone has she was impatient think about the worst one you can recall then try to imagine waking up to find that it was real and would go on for years not minutes without respite thats not possible she stopped oh i see what you mean trying to shake off a nightmare is harder than having it she turned her head watching the gulls after a moment she went on when i was five i was frightened by a friends little dog i was creeping up on her to surprise her and the dog heard me first and attacked me after that i was always afraid of dogs any dog rutledge nodded are you still afraid of dogs not afraid wary perhaps yes thats what war does to you it leaves you wary because you cant erase what you saw or felt or did it cant be safely tucked away in the attic until youre fifty and decide to bring it out and look it squarely in the face and edgar is reminded of his missing leg every time he puts on a shoe or tries to walk across the room or step into a motorcar its a fact he cant escape however hard he tries and in turn this is a constant reminder of a day he doesnt want to remember she turned to look at him where are your scars they are there just a little less visible than missing a leg he found it hard to keep the irony out of his voice thank god no one could see hamish or hear him he couldnt even be explained away logically a haunting that was no ghost a memory that was filled with guilt a presence where there was none except to him elise said youre telling me that patience is my cue im telling you that getting on with it will always be easier for you and so you must teach edgar to forget not only with patience but with the understanding that some memories may never fade if you cant accept him as he is then you must walk away now she smiled a pretty girl barely twenty he felt like a grandfather in her presence though he was the same age as her older brother how on earth would edgar cope or had he deliberately chosen someone so young someone who had no experience of war in the hope that it would help him forget it was not his business to ask he was here to support the groom and that was that elise was saying i appreciate your candor ill try to understand and when i cant i wont judge then youll make edgar an admirable wife her laughter rang out fresh and untroubled inside the house silver rattled against silver aha i hear sounds from the dining room by the way my matron of honor has arrived ill bring her along to meet you this afternoon she got up and went inside leaving rutledge with his thoughts ronald evering stood by his bedroom window that same morning watching the small mail boat make for the harbor at st annes there was only one passenger on board he could pick out the blue jacket and white trousers of davis penrith who was standing amidships his face turned toward the landing his fair hair blowing in the wind the launch came in tied up and davis stepped ashore looking up the winding hill that led to the only large house on the island evering wondered what he was thinking no doubt gauging how many pounds this venture might bring him was he so foolish that he thought he would be trusted again with a small fortune did he feel no twinge over cheating a man twiceof his brother and of his money apparently not or he wouldnt have come evering turned away from the window and went down to await his guest in the hall but the memory of his mothers corpse lying there at the foot of the stairs prodded him to move on to the stone steps of the house st annes was one of the smaller of the inhabited scilly isles the romans had come here and then the church and finally cornish men looking to make money any way they could cut flowers had become the latest source of wealth for they bloomed here earlier than anywhere else in england and so they had been very much in demand for country houses and london weddings the war had put an end to that of course getting perishable flowers across to the mainland and to their hungry markets had been impossible what with workmen gone to fight or to factories the government taking over the trains for troops and the wounded and the german menace out there waiting to sink whatever vessel sailed into their sights he doubted that the market for fresh flowers would be as profitable again not the way it was before it would be too costly now workmens wages too high and no one was entertaining on the scale they once had done great vases of flowers in every room profligate and beautiful were a luxury now even for the wealthy he was glad his father hadnt lived to see this day he had mourned his elder son then given his only remaining child all that he had dreamed of for timothya fine education this house and a love for the scilly isles that in the end had come to be the strongest bond between them if this day bore fruit the senior evering would have lost both sonsone to murder and the other to an unconscionable act that would damn him for an instant he was torn penrith hadnt seen him yet let him knock at the door and when no one answered his summons go back to cornwall and thence to london cursing a wild goose chase or tell him to his face that it had been a mistake there was no money left to invest after all evering turned and went back inside it would seem tooeagerto be seen waiting by the steps invisible in the quiet parlor he soon heard shoes crunching in the shell walk that led through the trellis gate up to the door at the sound of the bell he counted to ten then he himself opened the door to penrith welcoming him as his father would have done with an old fashioned courtesy evering was far from feeling its not too late penrith stepped into the cool hall and said plaintively i thought perhaps youd have sent a cart to meet me the boatman said it was usual alas the horse is lame but the exercise will have whipped up your appetite breakfast is waiting in the dining room i could do with a cup of tea penrith followed him down the passage to the dining room its windows looking out to sea where nothing stood between the stone walls of this house and the great expanse of the atlantic penrith took his tea standing up looking out at the cloudless sky is that a bank of sea mist out there on the horizon i didnt notice it from the boat but of course were higher here i can tell you i wouldnt care to be caught in one of those ive heard tales of what it would be likedank and damp like cotton wool worse than a london fog no wonder the cornish coast is famous for its shipwrecks i see the boat has continued on its roundsi thought it might stay on for a bit how long before it returns to st anne evering smiled deliberately misunderstanding him i promise you well have more than enough time to discuss our business it must be quite lonely here i should think youd open your london house for the summer penrith went on as he set his cup down on the table and accepted the plate evering was holding out to him not in summer thats the best season for us next winter perhaps evering shrugged that is to say if i am luckier in my investments than i was the last time and can afford to open the london house again surprisingly enough ive never found it lonely here perhaps because i was born in this house he searched penriths face for signs ofwhat something any thinga conscience a reason to put a stop to what he was about to do but all he read there was impatience and greed i brought the papers you asked for i think given the state of business these days that weve got something to offer something that might well recoup that earlier loss something with longterm potential and an excellent rate of return that would certainly be desirable frankly i could use the income but you told me much the same story the last time and look where it led yes well we apologized for the cumberline stocks no one was more surprised than i when they went down with a crash i lost money myself evering raised his eyebrows but said nothing he had heard rumors that penrith and his partner had had a miraculous escape a word of warning in the right ear at the right time but not passed on to clients not this client at least penrith took his filled plate to the foot of the table and sat down picking up his serviette i say this is a wonderful spread were still trying to get decent food in london you have a fine cook as well my compliments they ate their meal in a drift of light stilted conversation touching on events in london the state of the economy the worsening situation in russia no money to be made there penrith said with a sigh youd think given their way of looking at land reform that theyd put it to good use in my view theyre going to be hardpressed to feed their own people and their factories such as they are produce only shoddy goods europe isnt going to be back on its feet for another dozen years if im any judge but there are opportunities in south america cattle coffee mines that sort of thing its what i intend to talk to you about thus far penrith had made no mention of his business partner and the omission was glaring evering brought him up instead and what is quarles doing to keep himself out of trouble penrith grimaced i daresay he manages we no longer handle joint ventures which is why you contacted me i think you never liked quarles nor you evering thought but was silent they finished their meal and adjourned to the study it too looked out across the sea but there were other islands in this direction scattered blue smudges penrith glanced toward the long bank of mist one more time before sitting down there was some anxiety in his face as if he was trying to judge how far it had advanced since last he had measured it lets get down to business shall we evering asked by all means the next two hours were spent in intense exposition of the properties that penrith had brought for discussion evering listened carefully to everything he was told then sat back with a frown i dont know he pulled at his lower lip a study in uncertainty penrith said persuasively its the best opportunity i can see to improve your position i like whats here and i have a feeling that were moving into a decade of handsome rewards for the farsighted investor evering said yes yes youve done your work well stillwould you mind leaving these papers here for a week im to travel to kent shortly and i can bring them to you with my decision he smiled wryly ive learned to be careful you see caution is important there are no guarantees that what i tell you will be right in five or seven years time however time is something we must consider as well i suggest you make your decision within the fortnight or we stand to lose as the shares go up they arent going to be overlooked for long i can assure you evering studied the earnest handsome face penrith fair and tall and very presentable gave the impression of coming from old money and it stood him in good stead this impression more than one woman and many a man had fallen for this quality and trusted the advice tripping so lightly from his tongue in their partnership penrith had been the velvet glove quarles the iron hand though quarles could be very pleasant when it served his purposes and very coldblooded when it didnt the contrast between the two men was something evering hadnt been prepared for when first he met them one obviously a gentleman the other a blunt yorkshire man with unreadable eyes and a tight mouth in gods name what had drawn them together in south africa much less kept them together all these years he couldnt fathom what it was unless it was the strength of quarless personality weaker men were often drawn to that if quarles had manipulated penrith surely he himself could manage it as well and yet the weak could be as cruel as the strong hed had cause to know in his own mother it was the main reason why evering had chosen penrith as his penny quarles would not be as easily influenced i assure you im as eager as you to see this under way butwell id feel better if i had a little time to consider penrith nodded suit yourself though it was clear that he was not pleased about being put off he got up and stretched walking to the window staring worriedly at the fog bank evering swore silently at the distraction cursing the weather penrith turned to his host when did you say the mail boat comes back this way evering glanced at his watch it should be here within a quarter of an hour it makes the rounds of the inhabited islands before going back to the mainland naturally it depends on how much mail and how many passengers there are on a given run but for the most part it keeps to its schedule thats a small vessel to take on storms in some twentyeight miles of open water its a wonder anyone has the courage to live this far out think of it as our moat at any rate the master is a good man he can read the weather the way youd read a book many of us have made the crossing on our own in heavy seas when theres no other way all the same ill take my chance on dry land thank you evering laughed and got to his feet joining penrith at the window he said yes in fact there the boat is now pulling around the headland youve got about twenty minutes before you need to be at the harbor ill walk you down good exercise ive become quite fond of taking my constitutional earlier this time of year before the heat builds come along then have everything there do you penrith had shoved the remaining papers back into his case his eagerness to be away getting ahead of his professional manner yes all here he cast a last glance at the spread of unsigned documents on the table and added you will let me know wont you what you decide to do i give you my word evering assured him they walked out together taking the shell path through the flower beds to the ornate garden gate where the islands only road crossed the track down to the harbor but as they passed through the gate evering paused in the middle of the road penrith a little ahead turned and said arent you coming the rest of the way yes ive just been debating with myself he hadwhether to go on or not to keep his hands steady he reached out and caressed the white wooden necks of the swans that curved gracefully to form the top of the gate old man theres something else i wish to say to you and im afraid i dont know quite how to find the words penrith frowned i dont follow you i thought id answered all your questions he was annoyed standing there with the sunlight glinting on his hair an eye on the mail boat i really must get back to london tonight you did answer my questions and admirably this isto be truthful its a personal matter in point of fact a little gossip that came to my ears recently i found it rather shocking and brushed it aside as nonsense but now that im facetoface with you penrith bristled ive done nothing to be gossiped about i assure you that business with cumberline no no your reputation is sound or you wouldnt be here no this is a personal matter i told you penrith gestured toward the harbor can you tell me as we walk the boat is coming in yes of course its just thatlook to be honest im uncomfortable mentioning this at all but youve been kind enough to come here and advise me i can only say that its very likely the purest gossip still i owe you something what are you trying to say i dont follow you at all penriths eyes were hostile now as if expecting accusations he wasnt prepared to answer his defensiveness clearly centered on his business and evering found that interesting all right ill be blunt if youll forgive me its the stories going round about quarles and yourdamn it man about your wife my wife caught off guard penrith stared at his companion i dontyou must be mad what is this about is it your way of he broke off unwilling to say more no just rather embarrassed to bring the matter up at all forget that i said anything it was a mistake a mistake born of friendship nothing more he walked on but penrith didnt move no you brought this matter up evering i demand that you tell me what it is youre hinting at evering took a deep breath it was at the middleton house party i wasnt there of course but someonei shant say whomsaw quarles coming out of your wifes bedroom at some ungodly hour of the morning shoes in hand there was a little talk among the guests when that got about but for your sake nothing was said then two weeks later at the garrisons house damn you youre a liar penriths face was flushed with anger his fists clinched at his side take it back evering now on this spot or we shall do no business together all right i apologize im sorry i thoughti dont know what i thought i was wrong to bring it up at all youre paying me back for cumberline by telling me this arent you evering said no penrith on my honor iits the gossip man i didnt make it up and i thought you should know if you didnt already its vicious and meant to hurt im sure i was wrong to tell you im sorry penrith turned to walk on and then stopped i shant need your company the rest of the way evering im rather disgusted if you want the truth i understand im sorry penrith stalked off shoulders tightly squared evering watched him go an angry man with time on his hands to dwell on his anger and the wife he doted on was in scotland visiting her sister where penrith couldnt question her easily yes that journey had been a stroke of unexpected luck worth the effort hed expended on perfecting the details of his plan when penrith reached the mail boat and stepped in without looking back evering returned to his house shut the door against the incoming fog and in the parlor poured himself a large whiskey too early in the morning for it he scolded himself but it was what he needed his hands were shaking what would come of this days work then he went up to his room and was sick in the basin on the table by the window elise came back for drinks in the afternoon bringing with her the rest of her wedding party rutledge had gone up to change after walking down to the waters edge and the laughter announcing their arrival drifted up the stairs to him on his way down to join them he heard hamishs voice in his ear ware a young woman with dark red hair and freckles was standing in the doorway at the foot of the stairs listening to the ominous rumble of thunder in the distance she turned and said hallo im mary as she offered her hand assuming she was the newly arrived matron of honor rutledge introduced himself and added that hed been looking forward to meeting her she gestured toward the clouds i dont relish the drive back to dunster if it storms edgar may have to put us up ive never cared for lightning the unmade road from dunster to maitlands house ended in a pair of nasty turns and driving them in the dark and heavy rain would be tempting fate rutledge said im sure theres more than enough room here mary resolutely turned her back to the storm and rutledge kept her busy with questions about her journey until a little of her anxiety had faded then they joined the rest of the guests in the dining room where the wedding party had gathered watching them rutledge thought that edgar and elise made a striking pair and she was carrying out her duties as hostess with smiling grace edgars eyes followed her and his happiness was reflected in his own smile rutledge had already met elises parents and he was standing with them at the edge of the crush of people when someone he thought it was mary said and ian i believe you know mrs channing he spun on his heel trying to keep the shock out of his face meredith channing smiled up at him and gave him her hand yes weve met before hallo ian how are you she was giving him time to recover managing it somehow he said im well and you im well thank you it appears weve just made it before the storm yesyou were fortunate and then elises cousin was greeting him and meredith channing moved on her voice drifting back to him as she said something to edgar about the setting of his house when he had a moment to himself rutledge turned to watch her crossing the room and helping herself to the refreshments on the drinks table he had met her first on new years eve at maryanne brownings house where meredith had come to conduct a seance for the amusement of maryannes guests something about her had struck him then a certainty that she knew more about his war years than he was willing to tell anyonehed even been absurdly afraid that she would find hamish in his mind a fear that had been reinforced when he learned that shed served as a nurse at a forward aid station and remembered seeing him there they had been thrown together a number of times since that night and hed come to an uneasy truce with her meredith channing had never spoken of his past or her own keeping their friendship such as it was firmly anchored in the present and yet an undercurrent was always there her warm charm and that quiet poise so unusual in a woman only a few years his junior a snare that drew him and repelled him at the same time she came across the room later and stood before him looking out the windows as the rain pelted down and the thunder echoed wildly across the moor before she could say anything mary the redhaired bridesmaid hed met earlier came up to claim his attention hed been standing a little apart from the others in the room his claustrophobia getting the better of him his back was to the windows that looked out on the terrace and he suddenly felt cornered glancing uneasily at the swirling rain as a sheet of lightning lit up the sky mary said doesnt it bother you she shivered her hands cupping her elbows as if to hold warmth in shall i find a wrap for you he asked dodging the question mary shook her head its the thunder it reminds me of the guns in france we could hear them in kent where i lived then and sometimes even see the flashes her words were suddenly loud in a brief lull in the conversation and people stood still as if not knowing how to break the spell they cast then elises father said thank god thats behind us and changed the subject mary turned away from the dark glass i think ill make some tea if elise hasnt sorry dont apologize i understand she gave him a grateful smile and left him there meredith channing said for rutledges ears alone you neednt worry the storm will pass soon and then well be gone he said im not sure it will be safe even then the road is tricky theres a moon when it breaks through the clouds there will be enough light to see our way against his will her calm assurance enveloped him he said everyone seems quite content to stay until then most of us have known one another for some time its like a family gathering everyone catching up on news the war years were hard and weve all paid a high price for this peace he wanted to ask her what her price had been but couldnt bring himself to introduce such a personal note yet he found himself comparing meredith channing to elise they were only a few years apart in age but elise had been sent to live in the comparative comfort and isolation of dunster with no troop trains arriving in the night with the wounded no outbound trains filled with cheering soldiers marching away to war shielding her from the cauldron of anguish and suffering mrs channing had seen at the front and so age was not a measure of the differences between them only experience could be that thought reminded him of an earlier one that perhaps edgar had deliberately chosen someone like elise as perhaps he himself had held to the memory of his former fiancee jean long after any hope of reconciliation were they both so desperate to wipe away the bitterness and fear and nightmares theyd brought home with them mrs channing smiled as if shed read his mind and he swore to himself as she said i believe theyll be happy those two elise is steadier than she appears right now shes giddy with happiness and has a right to be edgar wouldnt propose until he was sure he was well enough he didnt want to be a burden i imagine but elise was afraid hed never work up the courage he needs her brightness in a few months hell forget hes lost a limb and agree to one of those artificial ones that are available now edgar had said nothing to him about replacing his leg with an artificial one and again meredith said apropos of that he was afraid hed make a fool of himself tomorrow falling he feels safer just now with his crutches did elise tell you that he said or had you read it in edgars tea leaves a twinkle appeared in merediths dark eyes ian ive seen edgar any number of times when he has come up to london if he brings elise she stays with me for proprietys sake and weve talked a time or two he felt himself flush with embarrassment managing a laugh he said sorry i met you first as a necromancer remember yes i remember it was not the best of footings for friendship was it i can sometimes guess what someone is thinkinganyone can if he knows human nature a policeman employs the same skills surely it isnt so strange a gift a policeman he responded dryly doesnt care to have those skills used against him she laughed it was low and husky and somehow intimate touche as the storm descended on them in earnest the party moved down to the kitchen and made a spurofthemoment tea out of what they found there carrying it triumphantly to the room overlooking the terrace and sitting on the rugs or in the chairs conversation flowing smoothly rutledge found he was enjoying himself meredith channing was talking with neal hammond and rut ledge could hear her voice but not what she was saying though it was clear from the expression on hammonds face that he found her attractive from the way he touched her arm at one point it was also clear that they had known each other for some time hamish spoke startling rutledge he had been silent since that first sharp ware as rutledge had come down the stairs earlier in the evening to join the gathering ye canna let your guard down it would be foolish but the evening had unexpectedly turned into a very pleasant few hours and when the storm had passed and it was too late to adjourn to the luttrell arms for dinner no one made a move to leave edgar coming to sit beside rutledge was in the best of spirits all qualms apparently quashed for now and he smiled at his friend with wry warmth thank you for coming ian i thought i needed support through this now im glad i have a friend beside me a thunderstorm can work wonders rutledge said grinning at edgar did you order it up yourself if id thought about it id have tried i think elises parents are satisfied now that shes not marrying a cripple with no prospects they knew my grandfather and ive heard they told their daughter in the beginning that i wasnt half the man he was that thank god was on my last leave before id lost my leg i was greener then they seem to be enjoying themselves tonight he stretched out his leg and said i hadnt realized that you knew meredith it was a fishing expedition transparently so i met her at maryanne brownings rutledge replied shes been a widow for several years now im glad to see her out and about again edgar maitland was matchmaking rutledge smothered a smile ill keep that in mind he said dryly you could do worse im not one to speak ill of the dead but jean wasnt right for you i could have told you that in but you wouldnt have listened probably not edgar laughed you have no idea what happiness is until youve found someone to love just look at me elise came over to join them saving rutledge from finding an answer to that he stood up to offer her his chair but she said its near the witching hour and the storm seems to have dwindled to broken clouds we must leave i have it on good authoritymy motherthat its bad luck to see ones bride on the day of the wedding until she walks down the aisle we dont want to risk that edgar got to his feet with some difficulty then shoved his crutches under his arms with the ease of habit lets start rounding up the guests in a flurry of farewells elise collected her family and friends and set out for dunster edgar watched them go the headlamps of the convoy of cars twisting and turning down the road you didnt wish mrs channing a good night not that i saw ill see her tomorrow and apologize profusely youre incorrigible my friend hammond will snap her up if you dont he wedding was held in st georges a small gem that had once laughing they went up to bed been part of a longvanished priory before becoming a parish church it boasted a magnificent wagon roof and what was said to be the longest rood screen in england but all eyes were on the bride as she walked down the aisle photographs of the wedding party were taken in what had once been the priors garden and there was a breakfast and music but not for dancing in the luttrell arms across from the yarn market a quartet played softly in the background and the cake was a masterpiece of culinary art on the top sat an elegant sugar swan wings spread wide and a ribbon in its beak bearing the names of the bride and groom in gold lettering rutledge seated next to edgar led the toasts and then as the conversation grew more general discovered that elises father was a longtime friend of his godfather david trevor who lived now in scotland wonderful architect caldwell said its a pity that he retired so early but then i understandi also lost a son in the war elises middle brother not something you get over is it no sir it isnt have you also retired to my sorrow no i advise people on how to invest their money and they wont hear of my giving it up caldwell smiled the day will come inevitably i expect i shall have to ease them into accepting it my wife is eager for me to grow roses and spend more time with her he made a face id much rather fish you know im an angler by nature not a gardener in the early afternoon the bridal pair set off on their wedding trip edgar drove waving gaily to guests as he and elise bounced over the cobbles and turned beyond the castle the motorcar had been modified so that he could manage it was hed told rutledge a matter of pride once out of sight elise would take the wheel for the rest of their journey the remaining guests left the inn in the next hour many of them on their way back to london and rutledge found himself facetoface with meredith channing as she came to say goodbye they had been thrown together often during the morning and rutledge had to admit that hed enjoyed her company safe journey he said and she nodded same to you im driving with friends we ought to make good time that was a lovely toast you proposed to the bride and groom you have a way with words thank you it was heartfelt yes edgar was touched it was good to see you again ian she offered her hand and he took it they shook briefly and then she was gone leaving an unexpected emptiness behind her rutledge told himself it was because everyone else had left and the day that had begun with such glorious sunshine for the wedding was now changing he turned to say goodbye to elises parents as they followed the last of the guests out the door caldwell clapped him on the shoulder and said if youre in the city stop in i will sir thank you and then he was back at the house on the hill where the view was magnificent and his footsteps echoed through the rooms the ghosts of laughter and excitement and happy voices made the silence seem almost ominous and he shrugged off the sudden upsweep of melancholy he spent the next hour clearing away as edgar had asked him to do preparing to close up the house before he left in the morning and then he sat on the terrace to watch the sun set behind a bank of clouds restless he was in no mood to sleep but finally he took himself off to bed with a small whiskey and the voice of hamish macleod for company when someone knocked at maitlands door shortly after midnight rutledge came awake with a start he fumbled for his dressing gown and slippers then went to answer the summons at first sight of the grimfaced uniformed constable standing on the doorstep he thought oh dear god edgar insisted on driving all the wayand theres been a crash and then the next thought pray god they arent hurt badly he could feel the presence of hamish stark and loud in his ears as he said good evening constable not bad news i hope and waited to hear the worst but the middleaged man standing there in the quiet night air asked mr rutledge sir yes im rutledge what is it man theres been a telephone call from london chief superintendent bowles sir he says youre the nearest man to the scene and would you return his call at the yard straightaway relief washed over him let me find my shoes and a coat he went back up the stairs to the guest room leaving the constable standing in the hall waiting for him when chief superintendent bowles wanted a man it paid to be prompt throwing his coat on over his pajamas and thrusting his bare feet into the shoes hed worn for the wedding he wasted no time wondering about the summons closest to the scene generally meant that bowles had little choice in the matter of which man to send and was putting speed before preference he helped the constable lash his bicycle to the boot of the motorcar rather than the rear seat unwilling in the dark to risk finding hamish in what always seemed to be his accustomed place just behind rut ledges shoulder it was a silent drive down to dunster the air was warm and heavy the stars vanished the only sign of life they saw was a hare bounding off into the high grass by the road the constable commented as they reached the towns outskirts easier coming down by motorcar than peddling up as i did on that confounded bicycle dunsters streets were quiet the police stations lights almost blinding as rutledge stepped through the door it was five minutes after the connection was made before bowless voice came booming down the line in somerset are you yes sir i took several days leave he reminded the chief superintendent for a friends wedding ill be back in london on monday indeed well theres a change in plan youre to go at once to cambury its just south of glastonbury im told the local man is on the scene already and hes handing the case over to us youre the closest inspector ive got to cambury by my reckoning you can be there in three hours or less why is he asking for our help at this early stage a mans been killed name of quarles his place of business is in leadenhall street here in london his country house is in somerset and apparently hed come down for the weekend ghastly business i cant think why anyone would wish to do such a thing but there you are theyre expecting you see that you dont dally no sir but bowles had cut the connection and the line was dead rutledge closed up maitlands house left a note for edgar regarding the sheets the laundress wouldnt be able to collect with the door locked then took his luggage out to his motorcar he thought ruefully that evening dress and casual attire would hardly be what cambury was expecting but it was all he had with him a lowlying mist had crept in on the heels of the warm air wreathing the night in a soft veil that threw the light from his headlamps back in his face and from time to time made the road seem to vanish into a white void he was given directions to cambury by the police in dunster and found that the road was fairly good most of the distance its a village thats outgrown itself the constable had said and much like dun ster in its own way though we have the castle dont we and theres none such in cambury still there are those who claim king arthur knew it and might be buried thereabouts my wifes sister plumps for glastonbury of course thats where she lives when he could relax his concentration on the road rutledge considered what bowles had told him the chief superintendent took a perverse pleasure in giving out as little information as possible to any subordinate he didnt like but everyone at the yard knew that it was one of the methods bowles used to weed out men he didnt wish to see climb the ladder of promotion the victim quarles had a place of business in leadenhall street and thus lived in london who then was taking over that part of the inquiry while rutledge was busy in somerset it would be revealing to have the answer to that rutledge drove on through the mist with only hamish for company the voice from the rear seat just behind his ear keeping up a running commentary hamish had beenfor himunusually silent during the weekend his comments brief enough to be ignored it was never clear why hamish sometimes had nothing to say like an army that had lost contact with the main body of the enemy rutledge was always on his guard at such times distrustful of the silence prepared for an attack from any quarter when he least expected it dr fleming who had saved rutledges sanity and his life in the clinic barely twelve months ago forcing him against his will to acknowledge what was in his head had promised that his patient would learn to manage his heavy burden of guilt instead rutledge had become a master at hiding it all the same he answered that voice aloud more often than he liked both out of habit and because of the compelling presence he could feel and not see he stood in constant danger of disgracing himself in front of friends or colleagues drawing comment or questions about the thin edge of selfcontrol that kept him whole shell shock was a humiliation proof of cowardice and a lack of moral fiber never mind the medals pinned on his breast and so the tension within himself built sometimes to intolerable levels it was the only scar he could show from his four years in the trenches unlike edgar maitland his men had commented on his luck watched him with misgivings at first and then with something more like fear many an inexperienced officer gained a reputation for reckless daring and wild courage believing himself invulnerable more often than not he died with most of his men not so much as an inch of ground gained but the young scots under rutledge soon realized that their officer put the care of his men above all else and so they had followed him into whatever hell was out there across the barbed wire knowing he would spare them where he could and bring them back when he couldnt and that had finally broken him aware of the faith put in him trying to live up to it and watching men die when it was impossible to save themeven while he himself livedhad taken an incalculable toll of mind and spirit hamishs unnecessary death had been the last straw finding a way back had somehow seemed to be a final betrayal of the dead in that last dark hour before the spring dawn the road rutledge had been following rounded a bend and swept down a low hill into a knot of thatched cottages then like a magicians trick the road became camburys high street leading him into the sleeping village the mist that had kept pace with him most of the way was in tatters now a patch here and there still lying in wait and sometimes rising to embrace the trees on the far side of the duck pond the perpendicular church tower to his left loomed above the clouds like a beacon the villages modest prosperity was visible in the shop fronts and in the houses that lined the street typical of somerset there was an air of contentment here as if the inhabitants neither needed nor expected anything from the outside world he noted several lanes that crossed the high street vanishing into the darkness on either side like dunster whatever cambury had been at the height of the wool trade when it had had the money to build such a church it was now a quiet byway what he wondered had brought quarles here it wasnt the sort of village that had much to offer a wealthy londoner unless there were family ties to somerset hamish said ye ken its a long way to london in miles and in pace and outlook an interesting point what reputation did quarles have here and was it different from that of the man of business in the city and could that have led to murder he saw the police station just ahead and pulled over inside a constable was waiting for him yawning in spite of himself as he got up from his chair to greet rutledge you made good time sir he said im to take you along to the house straightaway my name is daniels sir constable daniels for the second time that night rutledge helped a constable lash his bicycle to the boot and then the man cranked the motor for him before getting in and shutting the door where are we going rutledge asked as daniels directed him out of the village the house is called hallowfields this was mainly monastery land once and theres a tithe barn built to hold whatever goods the local tenants owed the monks as rent the high street had turned back into the main road again and as they crested a slight rise walled parkland on their right marked the beginning of an estate the tithe barn is on his property and so mr quarles set himself up as squire taking over from the monks you might say was this popular in the village surely not he wasnt the first owner to claim squires rights but as he was mostly in london it wasnt hard to ignore him though some of the farmers came to him for help when their crops were bad or their plows broke or their roofs leaked daniels grinned at rutledge his face bright in the reflected glow of the headlamps a costly business being squire there you can just see the gates coming up ahead well pass them and turn instead at the entrance to the home farm hamish said he doesna grieve oer much for the dead man a pair of handsome iron gates disembodied in the mist closed off what could be seen of the drive before it vanished into the night a gray ribbon that appeared to go nowhere they came to a break in the wall where a small whitewashed gatehouse marked the way into the working part of the estate the cottage was very pretty with roses climbing up the front framing the windows and the single door here we are sir does anyone live there rutledge asked nodding at the gatehouse no sir its been empty for some time rutledge turned into the lane that led to the farm and almost immediately his headlamps picked out a track bearing to the left that way sir if you please we dont go as far as the farm rutledge bumped into the rutted track that curled through a copse of trees ahead his lights picked out the rising bulk of a gray stone building that appeared to block his way the mist lingered here in the trees as if caught among the branches and then without warning he drove into a thicker patch like cotton wool it swallowed the motorcar and he felt the sudden shock of claustrophobia as the track seemed to vanish as if by magic leaving him in an opaque world just as suddenly he came out into a small clearing where a bicycle and two other vehicles were clustered together as if for comfort at the edge of the clearing stood the tithe barn vast dark and hunched as if it had lurked there for hundreds of years waiting patiently for the return of its builders judging from the size of ita good feet long and possibly closer to this part of somerset had been prosperous under the monks rule the roof soared high above their heads as they got out of the motorcar and something about the way it loomed in the darkness and shreds of mist was almost evil he laughed at himself a night without sleep played odd games with the imagination where once there had been a roofed entrance on the side of the barn facing him there was a single door now dwarfed by the heavy stone walls rising into the night sky he turned to ask daniels a question as the constable gestured toward the door that way sir theyre expecting you im to fetch the doctor now that youre here he went around to the back of the motorcar and took down his bicycle nodding to rutledge as he mounted the machine and peddled into the mist rutledge walked toward the entrance the heavy door creaked under his hand as he shoved it open and stepped inside it was like stepping into the truncated unfinished nave of an enormous church there was no great west front no transepts or choir or altar or apse only a forest of huge squared wooden timbers rising like columns into the darkness overhead where they supported a handsome array of beams the silence was almost that of a church as well where a whisper would carry round the bare stone walls the only light came not from wax sanctuary candles but from three lanterns that rested on the flagstone floor picking out three startled men standing staring at him as if he were an apparition walking through the door the taller of them the one with a square face cleared his throat inspector rutledge i take it yes im rutledge we werent expecting you for another two hours the speaker walked forward hand outstretched inspector padgett and two of my men constable horton and constable jenkins i expect youve met constable daniels he was waiting to bring you here rutledge acknowledged the introductions and just as he shook hands with padgett something in the rafters caught his eye he stopped his head raised his gaze fixed above them like an avenging angel high among the beams that held up the roof was a man with outflung arms and immense feathered wings springing from his back gentle god rutledge murmured before he could stop himself quite padgett replied is that quarles is he dead yes on both counts we didnt touch him i sent constable daniels to call scotland yard and then wait for whoever was coming of course we recognized him straightaway its harold quarles beyond any doubt this is his landhis barn what killed him we dont know yet how in the name of god did anyone get him up there its easy if you know the trick quarles puts on a christmas pageant here complete with live sheep and a donkey and even an inflatable camel he brought down from london the figures are local people and its considered an honor to take part wise men shepherds and so on theres an angel as well with a rig to hold him or her up there quite comfortably im told if a little hairraising i wouldnt want to try it myself i can tell you he gestured toward the shadows along the walls trestle tables and benches over there and on this side the manger and the bits that create the stable and its roof and along there as well the apparatus for the angel its kept in a chest out of sight along with the wings its very well known our christmas pageant even the london papers have written it up and a gazette featured it one year my son was the babe in the manger that christmas which tells me a good many people knew the apparatus was here and that it works i would say so yes is the door kept locked it hasnt been for some years the hasp rusted through and no one has replaced it wheres the need weve never had any trouble before who found him how long has he been up there we dont know how long were hoping the doctor can answer that i came past here on my way home its a little out of my way but id told constable horton here that id do his last patrol for him before he went off duty at eleven wed had a busy night of it with a pair of quarrelsome drunks and we were tired just by the turning for the home farm i heard a dog barking in an alarmed sort of way and i stopped to investigate the noise was coming from the trees here and i walked in toward the barn i saw that the door was ajar and i thought perhaps the dog had cornered a badger inside i went back to my motorcar for my torch and by that time the dog had given up and gone away i was on the point of leaving myself but decided to step inside since i was already here and at first i saw nothing then something creaked and i looked up i can tell you i got the fright of my life it was a wellrehearsed account and rutledge nodded still staring at the figure over his head into his minds eye came the image of the swan on edgar mait lands wedding cake its wings spread a ribbon in its mouth the contrast was appalling wheres the dog now what did it look like i heard him i didnt see him there are several dogs at the home farm and im told mrs quarles has two king charles spaniels rutledge took out his own torch and shone it on the spectral winged body in the darkness above quarles was dressed in street clothes a dark suit waistcoat and white shirt his arms were rigidly outstretched in an openwork cage that enclosed his entire body an angel in a nativity pageant could easily conceal the white cage with a fulllength robe and long flowing sleeves worn over it giving the impression of floating in the shadows overhead the thickly feathered wings attached somewhere at the back of the shoulders and partially outstretched as if in flight were a bizarre counterpoint to the dead mans ordinary clothing hes a reasonably heavy man could one person pull him up to that height its block and tackle ive seen one man do it for the pageant is there anyone who hated quarles enough to do this to him because this is not just murder theres viciousness at work here otherwise hed have been lying on the floor padgett sighed i shouldnt wish to speak ill of the dead but he was a hard man to like coldnatured and unbending when he wanted his way id bring my children here for the pageant like the rest of the village and the surrounding farms but only because they wanted to come and see the angel and the camel id have stayed away myself ill tell you straight out i didnt have much use for harold quarles padgett turned away as if ashamed of his honesty but something in his face told rutledge that the mans feelings were too strong to conceal hamish said he intended for you to hear it from him first youve described the public man why did you dislike him so much rutledge was blunt padgett shrugged he could be callous almost to the point of cruelty i dont like that in anyone rutledge walked in a circle trying to judge the body from every viewpoint but only the mans front was visible what else might be there on the dark side would have to wait until he was brought down theres no blood on his shirt padgett offered we dont know if he was shot or stabbed and no blood here on the floor i had to leave him long enough to fetch horton and the lanterns there was nothing else i could do padgett confessed you were certain before you left that there was no one else here in the barn hiding behind one of the trestle tables i made sure of that and besides he was already dead what harm could the killer do to him now he had time to clear away any evidence hed left behind at that moment the door opened and they turned as one man to see who was coming in constable daniels had returned this time with a thin man wearing goldrimmed spectacles he appeared to have thrown his clothes on in some haste and his hair hadnt been properly combed rutledge put his age at early forties the doctor one of the constables said under his breath whats this about padgett daniels wouldnt tell me oneil came briskly toward them his gaze on the men staring back at him padgett almost reflexively glanced upward and oneils eyes followed his good god he said in horror you arentthats quarles he stood there for a long moment as if unable to take in what he was seeing what the hell is he doing up there his gaze swung toward padgett is he dead he must be dead to the best of our knowledge he is i didnt care to move him until you got here padgett crossed the flagstone floor to shake the mans hand then presented rutledge dr oneil inspector rutledge from london oneil looked rutledge up and down has he been up there that long for you to be sent for i should have been called sooner i was in dunster attending a wedding and word reached me quickly we think he must have been killed earlier tonight last night but thats your province indeed his attention turned back to the dead man who in gods name strung him up like that he couldnt have done that to himself could he and how are we to get him down padgett nodded to daniels who was standing behind the doctor his jaw fallen in shock it was the first time hed been allowed inside the barn constable youve used this apparatus let him down daniels startled said me sir yes yes man get on with it youve done it often enough for the pageant daniels reluctantly went toward the shadowed west end of the barn and fumbled at something on the wall as he did the man above their heads swayed his hands moving as if he still lived and the lamplight picked out the whites of his open eyes as he seemed to stare balefully at his tormentors inspector padgett sucked in his breath and took a long step back dr oneil swore sharply adding have a care man the apparatus creaked as daniels put his weight into it and a feather dislodged from one of the wings drifted down from above turning and spinning holding all their eyes as it wafted slowly among them as if choosing and then coming to rest finally at rutledges feet the other men turned toward him as if somehow he had been marked by it a shock swept through rutledge and he couldnt look away from the white feather he prayed his face showed nothing of what he felt during the war the women of britain had handed out white feathers to anyone they felt should have joined the armed forces challenging the man to do his duty or be branded a coward it had got out of hand this white feather business to the point that the government had issued special uniforms for the discharged wounded to spare them the mortification of explaining publicly why they were not now fit for active duty every man there knew that story and rutledge could feel a slow flush rise in his cheeks as if the feather had been earned though in another time or place by the charge of shell shock that they recognized him even without evidence for what the world believed he was padgett broke the spell cursing daniels under his breath he started forward to help his constable and then thought better of it horton constable horton hurried forward his face tight and in short order the two men got the apparatus under control bracing themselves against the dead mans weight they began gently to lower quarles into the circle of lamplight rutledge saw watching them now that a single man could have manipulated the rope under less stressful circumstances but daniels fearful of dropping quarles had found it impossible to work the rope smoothly hamish said ma granny wouldna care to see this in a tone of voice that reflected his own feelings witchcraft shed ha called it it was as if quarles flew down landing easily first on his toes the taut rope almost invisible against the darkness of the ceiling the wings moving gently as if of their own volition and the watchers could at last see the other side of the body the back of quarless head was matted with dark blood staining the pale red of his hair attempting to tie off the rope the two constables accidentally lifted the body again and it seemed to the onlookers to have life in it still there was a brief hesitation as if no one was eager to step closer then oneil said tersely get him out of that wretched thing releasing quarles from the brace that had held him in the air was difficult with a living person it would have been different but the dead weight was awkward and after that detaching him from the wings hooked into the cage and the cloth at his shoulders and meant to appear from below as if they belonged where they were fastened growing out of the mans own back took several people rigor mortis hadnt set in that much was apparent as oneil quietly pointed out as they worked when at last quarles slumped to the flagstone floor of the barn and the harness and cage had been dragged away the doctor beckoned for the lamps to be brought nearer and knelt to begin his examination as oneil ran his hands over the body a frown between his eyes rutledge got his first good look at the victim quarles had pale red hair a freckled complexion and surprisingly regular features although one eyebrow had a quizzical twist to it a vigorous body with a barrel chest and long legs rutledge judged him to be five feet ten inches tall and put his age at either the late thirties or early forties without the force of his personality he seemed oddly vulnerable but the strong jaw and chin spoke of a man who knew what he wanted from life oneil was saying nothing broken as far as i can judge no signs of a wound other than what we can see on the back of his head and that was the cause of death if im not mistaken he moved his fingers through the bloodsoaked hair and then wiped them on his handkerchief there are several blows here lacerations on the scalp in two areas ill know more later but someone wanted to make sure the first blow had done the job and judging from the blood you can see in his hair it hadnt the aim was better the second time because poor quarles was semiconscious and not resisting but both were struck from behind rutledge asked he had been studying the dead mans hands they were badly scarred the skin was still tight and shiny in places though the worst of the injury had faded with time hamish said aye weve seen burns before but look you theyre no on his face dr oneil was regarding rutledge his expression puzzled he realized that the doctor hadnt taken his point he clarified his question that is to say do the blows indicate whether quarles had turned away from someone he was talking with or was it a surprise attack something he didnt see coming thats your task to work out not mine all i can say is that he might have been turning away the first laceration is a little behind and to the right of the second or at the last minute he could have heard someone coming up behind him and started to turn to confront whoever it was i cant tell you what was used to kill him or where he was killed unless theres blood on the floor that i havent seen in this light horton padgett said over his shoulder take one of the lanterns and go over the flagstones as carefully as you can pay particular attention by the mechanism of that rig the man set off his light bobbing as he searched oneil stood brushing off the knees of his trousers its my opinion that he hasnt been dead very long hours rather than days any idea who could have done this none padgett replied shortly how did he come by those burns on his hands rutledge asked oneil said hes had them as long as ive known him i asked once professional interest but he just said it was an accident it was clear he didnt want to talk about it which reminds me has anyone thought to let mrs quarles know that her husband is dead we preferred to keep this quiet until rutledge got here padgett pulled out his watch theyll be stirring at the home farm soon if they arent already it wont take long for someone to see the vehicles outside and come to find out whats happening i suppose i ought to go to the house directly if youll lend me one of your men ill see to the moving of the body while alls quiet anything else you need from me nothing at present he was interrupted by horton calling from the other end of the barn so far theres no blood to indicate if he was killed in here sir we might do better in daylight but ill wager it wasnt in the barn padgett turned to rutledge do you want to go to the house with me breaking bad news was not rutledges favorite duty but someone had to do it and it was just as well to meet the family now sometimes the way the household reacted to a death could be telling he nodded all right horton you help the doctor daniels you and jenkins can see to this apparatus put it where it belongs and shut the chest on it i dont want to see it again as it is ill be hardpressed to attend the pageant this year then i want the two of you to stand watch at the barn door ill leave my motorcar for jenkins turn about every two hours rutledge said wait let me examine that cage it was indeed wicker as hed thought reinforced by wires and the wings he discovered were attached as a rule to a brace that locked across the wicker frame holding the christmas angel safely in place it was all in all a clever device and must create quite a spectacle but there was nothing on the harness or the ropes or the pulleys that offered him any clue as to who had used it for a dead man thanks he said nodding to the two constables and turning to dr oneil he asked do you think quarles was still alive when he was put into this contraption if he was attacked here in the barn id say he was dead before he was hoisted up into the rafters the second blow rendered him unconscious if he wasnt already and he was dying beyond saving in fact even if his attacker had changed his mind it must have taken several minutes to get him into that device very likely there was a cloth or coat around his wound or youd have seen where his head rested during the process at a guess thats why theres no blood to be found here its a deep wound i could feel where fragments of bone have been driven into the brain if he was brought here from somewhere else he was dead before he got to the barn and heavy as he is he wouldnt have been easy to manage but it could be done id look for scuff markswhere he was draggedoutside if we havent obscured them with our own tramping about thank you doctor rutledge turned to follow padgett and oneil went with them as far as his own motorcar to fetch a blanket shielding his torch padgett studied the turf around the door hes right too many feet have trod here but theres no other way in we had no choice rutledge cast his light a little to one side trying to find signs of torn grass how did the killer bring quarles here motorcar on his back if we knew that wed be ahead of the game wouldnt we padgett replied morosely he climbed into the passenger seat while rutledge was cranking the motor and said to no one in particular i dont relish this mrs quarles is an unusual woman as youll see for yourself in what way youll see rutledge turned the motorcar and went back through the trees the mist had vanished as if it had never been there where the track to the tithe barn met the farm lane padgett said well go through the main gates set me down as you get there and ill open them the drive ran through parkland specimen trees and shrubs providing vistas as it curved toward the house when it came out of the trees and into smooth lawns toward the southeast it went on to loop a bed of roses in front of the door in the light breeze of early morning their scent was heavy and sweet and dew sparkled like diamonds among the leaves the house was tall perfectly set among gardens its dormer windows on the eastern approach already touched with the first rays of bright gold as the sun rose a very handsome property rutledge thought as he pulled up the sort of house that spoke of old money and breeding for a long moment padgett sat there looking at nothing well he said finally we must do our duty and break their tran quility into shards i dont see any dogs surely if they were loose theyd be here to greet us rutledge commented as they mounted the shallow steps and padgett lifted the brass knocker at the very least the one you might have heard padgett listening to the sound of the bell ring through the house said i doubt the dog was hers well ask at the home farm for several minutes no one came to the door then it swung open and a housekeeper stood there glaring at them before she recognized padgett inspector she said in wary acknowledgment what brings you calling so early id like to speak to mrs quarles if i may if she isnt awake i doubt anyones asleep after such a summons at this hour its rather urgent padgett replied goaded ill ask if shell receive you now rutledge said i understand mrs quarles has several small dogs the housekeeper stared at him as if hed lost his mind if its the little dogs youve come about theyre asleep in mrs quarless bedroom where they belong she shut the door in their faces and padgett repeated sourly ill ask if shell receive you as if im a bloody tradesman come to settle my accounts its a matter of form rutledge said yes well well see whos unwanted soon enough when the housekeeper came to the door again this time she swung it wide to allow them to enter mrs quarles will see you if youll follow me they walked into a spacious foyer the black and white marble of the floor had been set in a chessboard pattern and the walls were a pale green trimmed in white a flight of stairs curved upward and a small winged mercury gleaming in a shaft of sunlight from the fanlight above the door balanced on his toes atop the newel post both men glanced at it sharply reminded of the winged corpse in the tithe barn as he looked around padgetts face mirrored his thoughts ostentatious but the foyer while handsome enough was by no means the finest the west country had to offer did padgett know that rutledge wondered or would it matter if he did he seemed to resent everything about harold quarles the housekeeper led them to a door down the passage and tapped lightly come the womans voice inside the room was well bred and composed the housekeeper opened the door and said inspector padgett madam the small sitting room was clearly a womans morning room a french gilttrimmed white desk stood between the windows and there was a pretty chintz on the settee and the two side chairs that stood before the hearth the pattern showing a field of lupines on a cream background the blue of the lupines had been picked up again in the draperies and the carpet mrs quarles was standing with her back to the grate her fingers pressing the collar of her cream silk dressing gown at her throat her fair hair neatly pinned into place she was a very attractive woman perhaps in her middle thirties at her side was a tall man sitting in an invalids wheeled chair a rug over his knees his dark hair was graying at the temples and his face was distinguished with dark eyes beneath heavy lids he had an air of sophistication about him despite his infirmity mrs quarless other hand fell to rest on his shoulder as padgett introduced rutledge from scotland yard she repeated in a clear cool voice examining rutledge why are you here at this hour is something wrong you havent come about my son have you theres been a death mrs quarles padgett said taking it upon himself to break the news im afraid its your husband death her eyebrows rose as if she couldnt quite understand the word are you sure quite sure weve just found his bodythat is a few hours ago padgett stopped tangled in his own explanation it was clear that he felt ill at ease in her presence and that it annoyed him are you telling me that my husband killed himself she demanded i refuse to believe anything of the sort where did you find him and what has happened to him we found him in the tithe barnthat is i did and summoned mr rutledge here because of the unusual circumstances she said testily please get to the point inspector padgett bristled he was murdered mrs quarles the words were blunt his voice cold rutledge silently cursed the man he was letting mrs quarles set the direction of the interview her hand resting on the mans shoulder gripped hard rutledge could see the slender knuckles whiten with the force murder the man raised a hand to cover hers rutledge thought they are lovers there was something in that touch that spoke of years of companionship and caring but here in quarless house mrs quarles recovered herself and said by whom for gods sake are you quite sure it wasnt an accident of some sort my husband was forever poking about the estate on his weekends here and sometimes drove tom masters to distraction we dont have the answer to that at present shall i send dr oneil to you directly or the rector it was noticeable that padgett failed to offer the formal words of condolence to me i shant need dr oneil or the rector her face showed shock but no grief well need to speak to the staff and i should like to see mr quarless rooms if i may i understand hed come down from london for the weekend was he expected the man in the chair answered for her generally he sends word ahead but not always its his house after all this time he arrived in the late afternoon friday and spent most of yesterday with tom masters who sees to the home farm he came back around four i should think and told the staff that he intended to dine out this was relayed to me when i came down before dinner padgett asked mrs quarles sharply seeking confirmation yes as far as i know thats all true were you on good terms with mr quarles during this visit on good terms did you quarrel have words he watched the first crack in her facade of cool reserve as she snapped we never quarrel why should we most married couples do did you see him when he returned from his dinner engagement i was not waiting up for him if thats what youre asking rutledge stepped in before padgett could follow up on that did he dine alone mrs quarles turned to him almost with relief how should i know we go our separate ways harold and i then you would have no reason to worry if he didnt return at the end of the evening we live in different wings mr rutledge by mutual agreement is there anyone on the staff who saw to his needs while he was here in somerset someone who might have noticed that he was out later than usual for an instant he thought mrs quarles had misinterpreted his question then she answered he doesnt have a valet my husband wasnt brought up with staff to look after him he preferred not to be troubled now rutledge turned to the man in the wheeled chair she hadnt introduced him by choice the man said with something of a smile im mrs quarless cousin the name is charles archer i live here can you shed any light on mr quarless movements during the evening or did you hear something that worried you a dog barking the sound of raised voices lights near the drive my rooms overlook the main gardens i wouldnt be likely to hear anything from the direction of the drive mrs quarles added if he was killed near the road anyone could have seen him walking there and attacked him we dont know yet where your husband was killed did he have enemies that you know of padgett asked mrs quarless laughter rang out silvery and amused why ask me she demanded you yourself never liked himnor he you for that matter and you must know that half the families in cambury had fallen out with him in one fashion or the other stephenson jones brunswickthe list goes on rutledge said are you saying that these people felt strongly enough about your husband that they might have killed him mrs quarles shrugged expressively walk down a street and point to any door and youre likely to find someone who detested harold quarles as for taking that to the point of murder you must ask them why should they dislike him so intensely because heshe wasruthless he gave no thought to the feelings of others he was very good at pretending he cared when it suited his purpose but the fact iswasthat he used people for his own ends when people discovered his true nature they were often furious at being taken in by then it was too late hed got what he wanted and moved on the wreckage left in his wake was nothing to him when he couldnt simply walk away he paid his way out of trouble most people have a price you know and he was very clever at finding it then why are you so surprised that he was murdered i suppose i never expected anyone to act on their feelings not herethis is somerset people dont kill each other here padgett seeing his opportunity said and you mrs quarlesdo you number yourself among his enemies she smiled at him amused i havehada very satisfactory arrangement with my husband she said why should i spoil it by killing him it wouldnt be worth hanging for though mind you there were times when he exasperated me enough that i might have shot him if id held a weapon in my hand but that was the aggravation of the moment he could be very aggravating you should know that as well as i all the same i had nothing to gain by killing him your freedom perhaps rutledge asked or a large inheritance she regarded him with distaste mr rutledge i already have my freedom and money of my own as well my husbands death is an inconvenience if you want the truth ive been patient enough if you wish to question my staff downing the housekeeper will see to it otherwise i must bid you good day padgett said in a final attempt to irritate her dr oneil and the rector will confer with you about the services when the body is released for burial thank you at the door rutledge paused i understand you have dogs mrs quarles yes two small spaniels were they with you during the night she glanced at archer almost reflexively then looked at rutledge they were with me they always are but they were not here now are there other dogs on the estate i believe tom masters has several they arent allowed as far as the house or gardens hamish was clamoring for rutledges attention pointing out that mrs quarles had not asked either policeman how her husband had died she had shown almost no interest in the detailsexcept to assume in the beginning that it was an accidental death and padgett as if hed overheard hamish though it was more likely that he was goaded by a need rutledge didnt know him well enough to grasp said with venom perhaps it would be best if we tell you before you hear the gossip mrs quarles we found your husband beaten to death hanging in the tithe barn in the straps meant for the christmas angel charles archer winced rutledge took a step forward in protest he had not wanted to make such details public knowledge at this stage but mrs quarles said only i never liked that contrivance i told harold from the start that no good would come of it a flush rose in padgetts face and he opened his mouth to say more but rutledge forestalled him thank you for seeing us mrs quarles padgett there was stern command in rutledges voice as he ushered the man through the door but before he could shut it charles archer asked is there anything we should do from the passage padgett interjected you must ask dr oneil about that sir rutledge felt like kicking him in the shins to silence him but padgett had had his say and let the man from london shut the door the housekeeper was waiting and rutledge wondered if she had been listening at the keyhole padgett said to her what is said here is not for gossip do you understand indeed well be back in the afternoon to speak to the staff i dont want them talking amongst themselves before that rutledge said do you have keys to mr quarless rooms i want you to lock them now in our presence and give the keys to me she was about to argue then thought better of it the two policemen followed her up the stairs and toward the wing that quarles used on his visits to hallowfields mrs downing made certain that each passage door was locked and then without a word handed the keys to those rooms to rutledge these are the only ones yes i dont think mr quarles wished to have just anyone going through his possessions it was a barb intended for padgett but he ignored it who cleans his rooms that would be betty inspector but she has no keys she asks me for them if mr quarles isnt here when hes at home the rooms arent locked are there any other rooms in the house that mr quarles used on a regular basis rutledge asked only the gun room sir he had his study moved up here some years ago in the suite next to his bedroom and put through a connecting door for privacy he said they thanked mrs downing and went down the stairs she followed to see them out as if expecting them to lurk in the shadows and steal the best silver when no one was looking they could hear the click of the latch as she locked the door behind them rutledge turned to inspector padgett as they crossed the drive to the motorcar the anger hed suppressed during the interview with mrs quarles had roused hamish and his voice was loud in rut ledges ears what the hell were you thinking about you were rude to the victims widow and you made no effort to conceal your own feelings i told you i hate them all i wanted to see her show some emotion something to tell me that she cared about the man something that made her human next time we call on witnesses youll leave your own feelings at the door is that understood padgett said fiercely this is my turf my investigation ill run it as i see fit not while the yard is involved another outbreak like that and ill have the chief constable remove you from the case no you wont try me rutledge walked down to the motorcar and turned the crank he could hear hamish faulting him for losing his own temper but shut out the words padgett had behaved unprofessionally intending to hurt and that kind of emotion would cloud his judgment as he dealt with the evidence in this case for an instant rutledge thought padgett would turn on his heel and walk to the tithe barn instead sulking he got into the motorcar without a word as they drove toward the gates rutledge changed the subject who is charles archer besides mrs quarless cousin gossip is hes her lover ive heard he was wounded at mons shouldnt have been there at his age but when the war began he was researching a book he intended to write on wellington and waterloo the hun was in belgium before anyone knew what was happening and archer fled south into the arms of the british he stayedexperience in battle and all that for his book well he got more than he bargained for didnt he and he lives at the house not the normal family arrangement is it but then rumor has it that theres not a pretty face within ten miles that quarles hasnt tried to seduce sauce for the gander is sauce for the goose id say any official complaints about his behavior not as such mrs quarles mentioned a son are there any other children just the one boy hes at rugby they reached the gates and turned into the lane that led to the tithe barn harold quarless body had been taken away and the barn had been searched again for any evidence or signs of blood without success nothing to report sir the constable told padgett gesturing to the shadowy corners weve gone over the ground carefully twice and nothings turned up rutledge with a final look around the dimly lit cavernous building found himself thinking that something must have been left behind by the killer some small trace of his passage no crime was perfect if only the police knew where to look surely there must be something some small thing that was easily overlooked another problem where did he dine he mused aloud and how did he get there weve only mrs quarless word that he went out to dine padgett pointed out it could be a lie from start to finish i hardly think she would kill her husband in the house rutledge said to padgett after dismissing the constable and hes not dressed for a walk on the estate lets have a look at that gatekeepers cottage i recall you told me no one lived there but thats not to say it hasnt been used he glanced around the tithe barn theres something about this placeits not a likely choice for a meeting somehow if id been quarles id have been wary about that but the gatehouse is another matter private but safe in a way is it unlocked do you think lets find out picking up a lantern padgett followed rutledge out the barns door they walked in silence through the trees to the small cottage by the home farm gate there was a single door and when they lifted the latch they found it opened easily rutledge took the lantern and held it high there were only three rooms on the ground floor a parlor cum dining room a tiny kitchen a bathroom hardly big enough to turn around in stairs to the upper floor were set into the thickness of one wall there were two bedrooms the smaller one possibly intended for a child though someone had converted it into a workroom when jesse morton lived here he made gloves hed been a head gardener until rheumatism attacked his knees that was before quarles bought hallowfields gloves rutledge turned to look at padgett its a cottage industry in many parts of the county and especially here in cambury hides are brought in from hampshire and distributed to households on the list mr greer owns the firm here and there are still a good many people who earn their living sewing gloves my grandmother for one she raised three fatherless children sewing for the greers father and son the furnishingswellpolished denizens from an attic judging by their age and qualitywerent dusty rutledge noted running his fingers over a chair back and along a windowsill and the bedclothes smelled of lavender sweet and fresh yet when he opened the armoire there were no clothes hanging there and nothing in the drawers of the tall chest except for a comb and brush and a single cuff link did you come here when the man morton lived here has it changed he asked padgett once with my grandmother i remember it as dark reeking of cigar smoke and there was a horsehair settee that made me break out in a rash so i was never brought back and youre sure that no one has lived here since then as sure as may be whats this then a place of rendezvous its been made to appear comfortable rutledge mused to give an air of respectability hamish supplied so clearly that the word seemed to echo around the solid walls but hamish was right there were lace curtains at the windows chintz coverings on the chairs and cabbage roses embroidered on the pillowcases if quarles had an eye for women he could bring his conquests here rather than to an hotel or other public place or the house respectability rutledge finished lets have a look at the kitchen it yielded tea and sugar and a packet of biscuits that hadnt been opened along with cups and saucers and a teapot ready for filling from the kettle on the cooker who washes the sheets and sweeps the floor clean padgett asked looking round you cant tell me mr high and mighty quar les does that not for any woman an interesting point rutledge answered well ask betty the maid who does his rooms at the house both men could see at a glance that this was most certainly not the place where quarles was killed no signs of a struggle no indication on the polished floor that someone had tried to wipe up bloodstains or dragged a body across it rutledge said all right if they met here quarles and his killer then the confrontation was outside somewhere between this cottage and the tithe barn padgett said nothing following rutledge out and closing the door behind them the sun was up light striking through the trees in golden shafts and the side of the cottage was bright casting heavier shadows across the front steps the roses running up the wall were dewwet todays blooms just unfurling a path of steppingstones set into the mossy ground led to the shaded garden in the rear of the cottage flower beds surrounded a patch of lawn where a bench and a small iron table stood setting the grassy area off from the beds was a circle of whitewashed river stones all nearly the same size perhaps a little larger than a mans fist in the dark rutledge realized the white stones would stand out in whatever light there was marking where it was safe to stroll otherwise an unwary step might sink into the soft loam of the beds he moved closer to examine them none of them appeared to be out of place still he leaned down to touch each stone in turn with the tips of his fingers one of them halfway round and half hidden by the bench moved very slightly as if not as well seated as its neighbors padgett watching said youre barking up the wrong tree there was a heavy mist last night remember hardly the weather for chatting under the light of the moon and if quarles was walking here for whatever reasoncoming home from a dinner partyit was a perfect site for an ambush hed have walked down the main drive who knows he might have intended to go to the home farm farfetched early days thats all i think weve done all we can here rutledge was ready to go on but padgett was staring now toward the house which he couldnt see from here if charles archer could walk id wager it was him she may have been content with the status quo but if the man has any pridewell it takes nerve to cuckold a man in his own house padgett turned to walk back through the wood and rutledge getting to his feet heard hamish say hes no verra eager to help they went back to the tithe barn where rutledges motorcar was standing padgett nodded to the constable guarding the tithe barns door as rutledge turned the crank they drove in silence each man busy with his thoughts as they reached cambury the high street was empty and many of the houses were still shuttered bells hadnt rung for the first service and the doors of the church beyond the distant churchyard were closed sunday morning a long day stretched ahead of them padgett was rubbing his face im dog tired and you must be knackered well sleep for a few hours then go back to hallowfields its bound to be someone there stands to reason they knew his movements rutledge said nothing padgett went on i sent constable daniels to bespeak a room for you at the unicorn after he telephoned the yard its just across the street there they had reached the police station as rutledge stopped the motorcar in front padgett added come in well make a list of names persons to consider it wont take long with reluctance rutledge followed him inside padgetts office was tidy folders on the shelves behind his desk and a typewriter on a table to one side indicating the machine as he sat down and offered the only other chair to rutledge he said ive learned to use the damned thing theres no money for a typist but i find that most people cant read my handwriting its the only answer he seemed to be in no hurry to make his list collecting several papers from his blotter he shoved them into a folder and then turned back to rutledge perhaps i should tell you a little about cambury its a peaceful town as a rule weve had only two murders since the war market day is wednesday and theres always a farmer who has had a little too much to drink at the glovers arms the younger men prefer the black pudding they grew up wild some of them with no fathers to keep them in line an idle lot living off their mothers pensions but wheres the work to keep them honest a good many workmen congregate there too it can be a volatile mix in an effort to bring padgett back to the task at hand rutledge said do you think either of these two murders has a bearing on quarless death on no of course not a young soldier killed his wife we never got to the bottom of that because he came here straightaway and confessed seems he was wild with jealousy over someone shed been seeing while he was in france why he didnt kill the other man god knows and truth be told i dont think he intended to kill her but he knocked her down with his fist and she struck her head on one of the firedogs the other murder was family related as welltwo brothers angry over the fact that the third brother inherited everything when the mother died they shouldnt have been surprised theyd walked out and left the boy to care for both parents while they were making their way in london they didnt come home for the fathers funeral and probably wouldnt have come for the mothers if there hadnt been property involved there was a quarrel the night after her funeral and it ended in the murder of the youngest they claimed theyd already returned to london that morning but there were witnesses to say otherwise who was left to inherit a cousin from ireland shes living in the house now as a matter of fact her coming here set the cat amongst the pigeons i can tell you ohara is her name harold quarles was taken with her she told him what she thought of him in the middle of the high street he grinned at the memory rutledge was accustomed to dealing with the various temperaments of the local policemen he was sent to work with some were single minded others were suspicious of his motives as an outsider or protective of their patch a few were hostile and others were grateful for another set of eyes though wary at the same time padgett seemed to feel no urgency about finding quarless murderer and rutledge wondered if he had already guessed who it might be and was busy throwing dust in the eyes of the man from london and the next question was why hamish said ye ken hes dragging his feet after yon dressing down rutledge had already forgotten that but it wouldnt be surprising if padgett was still smarting there was arrogance behind the mans affability he asked before padgett could digress again who might have had a reason to kill quarles he took out his notebook to indicate that he was prepared to write down names consider half the population padgett replied with a broad gesture mrs quarles said as much herself i told you im only one of many who will rejoice that hes dead hardly the proper attitude for a policeman rutledge asked lightly im honest take me or leave me quite rutledge added did quarles spend much time here in cambury or was he most often in london he came down once a month or so it depended on how busy he was in the city last year he came and stayed for nearly three months that must have been an unpleasant surprise for the missus she packed up and left for essex where archers sister lives speaking of charles archer is it certain that he cant walk it was a possibility that shouldnt be overlooked you must ask the doctor rutledge wrote down oneils name at the top of the page lets begin with the household what do you know about them some of them come into cambury on their day off generally they keep themselves to themselves i daresay thats whats expected of them by the family theres no butler just the housekeeper because they seldom entertain if youre looking at the household id put mrs quarles at the top of that list what about the townspeople when padgett hesitated rut ledge added the butcher the baker the candlestick maker the rector the doctor the greengrocer quarles didnt get on with the rector rumor says he thought heller was oldfashioned out of step with the twentieth century the living belongs to hallowfields and quarles could replace him at will and bring in someone younger or more to his taste the doctor he treated like a tradesman the tradesmen he treated with outright contempt mr greer owner of the glove firm crossed swords with quarles a time or two according to quarles he was pushing up the cost of labor in cambury making it difficult for the local gentry to keep staff the glove makers work at home you see its not a bad thing for a woman with children or a man who cant do physical labor rutledge had stopped taking notes the field is wide open then still its hard to believe that this sort of bickering led to murder theres jones the welsh baker if you want more than bickering his daughters head was turned by quarles and jones had to send her away to his family in cardiff and mrs newell was cook at hallowfields until quarles sacked her now theres a woman who could have hauled quarles into the rafters without any help arms like young oaks although in my view shed prefer a cleaver to a stone for the murder weapon mrs quarles also mentioned the name stephenson stephenson is a collector of rare books he moved here from oxford when his health broke he was born in cambury i never heard what lay between them money is my guess he opened a small bookstore down the street where his mother had had her millinery shop and called it nemesis hamish said ye ken he didna bring up the name himsel which was surprising would padgett have mentioned stephenson at all still rutledge was beginning to form a mental picture of harold quarles it appeared that he hadnt made an effort to fit into his surroundings his own wife disliked him come to that was he a contrary londoner who irritated everyone he came in contact with or did he feel that somerset was too provincial to warrant courtesy yet constable daniels had claimed that quarles wanted to be squire it could also be a sign of rough beginnings this ability to rub everyone raw what is quarless background did he come from money lord no he worked his way up from scratch his father went down the yorkshire mines but the boy was given a decent education through some charity or other and rose quickly in the financial world hed tell you that himself proud of his roots and making no bones about his beginnings from what i gather it was his honesty on that score that made him popular in london business circles a diamond in the rough as they say if he hadnt managed that theyd have turned their back on him you know the nobs they sometimes like brutal honesty makes them feel superior but he must have also had the ability to make money for his clients or they wouldnt have kept him very long rough diamond or not i expect thats true padgett stood up with an air of duty done im asleep on my feet im going home youll want at least an hour or two of sleep yourself rutledge put away his notebook ill be back here by twelve oclock make that one they walked out together and padgett turned the other way with a wave of the hand rutledge could see the unicorn from where he stood it was a small hotel graced by a pedimented door and narrow balconies at the windows of the floors above a drive led to the yard behind he turned in there and went through the quiet side passage that opened into reception at the large mahogany desk set in one corner a young man was busy with a sheaf of papers tallying the figures in the last columns he put his work aside as he heard rutledges footsteps approaching and greeted him with a smile are you the guest constable daniels told us to expect i am the clerk turned the book around for his signature were pleased to have you here inspector the constable mentioned that thered been a spot of trouble up at hallowfields yes rutledge answered signing his name and pocketing the key the clerk was on the point of asking more questions but rutledge cut him short with a pleasant thankyou and turned away picking up his valise as he crossed to the stairway the hotel had probably been a family home at some time possibly a town house or a dowager house the curving stairs to one side of reception were elegant with beautifully carved balustrades giving radiant light from above was an oval skylight set with a stained glass medallion of a unicorn his head in the lap of a young woman in a blue gown her long fair hair falling down her back in cascading tendrils as romantic as any preraphaelite painting it must have given the house and subsequently the hotel its name his room was down the passage on the first floor and overlooked the high street long windows opened into a pair of those narrow balconies rutledge had noticed from the police station the sun already warm on the railings he was pleased to see that hed been given such large accommodations with those two double windows their starched white curtains ruffled by the early morning breeze he neednt fight claustrophobia as well as padgett hamish said given to the puir policeman no doot to curry favor with them at hallowfields absolutely rutledge returned with a smile which suggests the hotel is where he came to dine last night hamish chuckled aye yell be sharing the scullery maids quarters when the word is out hes deid and yere no likely to drop a good word in his ear about the unicorn it was truepolicemen on the premises more often than not were kept out of sight as far as possible to prevent disturbing hotel guests which signified that word of the murder had not preceded rutledge to the hotel only the news that quarles had business with him he sighed as he considered the comfortable bed then set his valise inside the armoire and went down to ask about breakfast the dining room was nearly empty there was an elderly couple in a corner eating in silence as if missing their morning newspapers here in the wilds of somerset there was a distinct air of having said all that needed to be said to each other over the years and a determination not to be the first to break into speech even to ask for the salt and a balding man of perhaps fortyfive sat alone by the window his head in a book rutledge ate his meal and then asked to speak to the unicorns manager the elderly woman waiting tables inquired bluntly was there anything wrong with your breakfast if so youd do better speaking to the cook than to mr hunter its to do with last evening she raised her brows at that and without another word disappeared through the door into the lounge it was twenty minutes before the manager arrived freshly shaven and dressed for morning services rutledge introduced himself and said its a confidential matter about one of our guests hunter was a quiet man with weak eyes peering at rutledge as if he couldnt see him clearly there were scars around them and rutledge guessed hed been gassed in the war i hope theres nothing amiss do you keep a list of those who dine here each evening hunter said not as such we have a list of those were expecting and which table they prefer and of course a copy of the accounts paid by each party the cook keeps a record of orders were you here last evening yes i was saturday evenings are generally busy he glanced at the elderly couple erperhaps we should continue this conversation in my office rutledge followed him there hunter kept his quarters spartan there were accounts on a cabinet beside his desk ledgers on the shelves behind it and a half dozen letters on his blotter nothing personal decorated the desks top the cabinet or the shelves the only incongruous piece was the glass figure of a donkey about three inches high standing on the square table by the door hunter sat down and reached for a large magnifying glass that he kept in his drawer with it poised in one hand he asked who is it you are enquiring about harold quarles hunter put down the glass ah i can tell you he didnt dine with us last evening he frowned were you told otherwise we arent sure where he took his dinner the hotel was the most logical place to begin yes certainly er perhaps his wife or staff might be more useful than i they have no idea where he went when he left the house except to dine somewhere close by and you havent seen mr quarles to ask him hes not at home at present rutledge got a straight look what exactly is it youre asking me mr rutledge rutledge smiled its no matter if he wasnt here he wasnt here he rose thank you for your time mr hunter i saw mr quarles last evening but not here not at the hotel rutledge stopped at what time it was close on to tenthirty most of our dinner guests had left and i stepped outside to take a breath of fresh air i was looking up the high streetin the opposite direction from hallowfields you see and i heard raised voices thats not usual in cambury but it was a saturday night and sometimes the men who frequent the black pudding go home in rowdy spirits i stood there for a moment in the event there was trouble but nothing happened no one else spoke there was nothing more to disturb the night as i was about to go inside i heard footsteps coming briskly from minton street and i saw harold quarles turning the corner into the high minton street its just past us where you see the stationers on the corner where does minton street lead there are mostly houses in that direction no other place to dine except in a private home thats right and mr quarles continued to walk past the hotel as far as you know hunter said i had shut the door before he reached the hotel im not on good terms with the man indeed he was drunk and disorderly in the dining room last spring there was a scene and i had to ask him to leave it was embarrassing to me and to the hoteland should have been to him as well i havent spoken to him since padgett had said nothing about hunters encounter he hadnt named the manager at all yes i see that it would be uncomfortable and so you have no way of knowing where quarles went from minton street none it was firmly spoken his eyes holding rutledges and he was alone on foot yes on both counts do you know if theres anyone on minton street who might count mr quarles among their acquaintance i would have no idea rutledge thanked him and left hunter sitting in his office staring at the door at least he thought it put quarles alone and on foot in town around half past ten with perhaps another twenty or at most thirty minutes for his journey homeward if that was where he was intending to go too bad hunter hadnt seen which direction quarles had taken rutledge walked out of the hotel to the corner of minton street looking down it he could see that the nearer houses were large and well kept the sort of home that quarles might have visited it would be necessary to speak to each household then to find out or padgetts men might be able to narrow that down there was a lane at the foot of minton street running parallel to the high street where cottages backed up to the fields beyond a line of low hills in the distance it wasnt likely that quarles had dined in one of the cottages or was it had he chosen to walk into cambury to keep his destination private or was he to meet his chauffeur or retrieve the motorcar somewhere else hamish said if it was the home of a woman that too was possible rutledge continued walking up the high street looking in the windows of closed shops as he passed there were other small streets crossing the highchurch street and button row james street and sedge lane beyond sedge lane stood the workaday world of the smithy turnedgarage and other untidy businesses that clung to the outskirts of a village struggling to become a small town supplying the inhabitants whilst keeping themselves out of sight just beyond these where the main road became camburys main street was the cluster of cottages rutledge had noted in the dark last night he turned back the way hed come crossing the high street where a large pub whitewashed and thatched stood at the next corner offering tables in the front garden under small flowering trees the overhead sign showed a large kettle with steam rising from it made of wrought iron in a black iron frame the black pudding it had the air of an old coaching inn and was one of the few buildings in cambury that wasnt directly on the road only a narrow pavement for pedestrians separating most of the house walls from the street he carried on to the unicorn and went up to his room this time he didnt resist the temptation of his bed and stretched out as he was his mind restless hamish lurking on the threshold of wakefulness until the ringing of the church bells roused him when services had ended rutledge retraced his steps to church street cambury had sprung into life while he slept people stopping to speak to friends or herding their children toward home st martins was set in a broad walled churchyard that abutted a house of the same stone as the church the rectory then a sign board gave the rectors name as samuel heller the stonework of the church facade was old but well maintained and the tall ornate tower rose into a blue cloudless sky last nights mist might never have been crossing the grassy churchyard rutledge saw the gate set into the wall and went through into the front garden of the rectory he could hear birds singing in the trees scattered among the weathered gravestones and a magpie perched on a shrouded marble cross watched him with a black and unreadable eye where there was shade the grass was still wet under his feet on a gentle breeze came the sound of a cow lowing in a field beyond the houses the rector was at his breakfast and came to answer rutledges knock with his serviette still tucked under his chin he seemed surprised to find a stranger on his doorstep but smiled warmly and invited rutledge to step into the narrow hall holding out his hand he said i dont believe youre one of my flock im samuel heller rector of st martins how may i help you the name is rutledge he said taking the rectors hand the mans grip was firm and warm im from london from scotland yard and i need a few minutes of your time to speak to you about one of your parishioners oh dear that sounds rather serious i was just finishing my toast he said taking out the serviette and wiping his lips could i interest you in a cup of tea the kitchen is a pleasant room and my housekeeper doesnt come in on a sunday to chase us out of it rutledge followed him back to the kitchen and it was indeed a pleasant room giving onto a garden a small orchard behind it and several outbuildings that by the look of them their wood a pale silver had served the rectory for centuries the kitchen door stood open to the yard letting in the warmth and sunlight and a handful of flies i dont usually entertain in the kitchen the rector went on in apology but the vestry meeting is in a quarter of an hour and i am running a little late today he did look tired gesturing to a chair across the table from where he had been sitting he brought rutledge a fresh cup then pushed the teapot over the polished wood toward him rutledge helped himself it was strong tea black and bitter as if it had steeped too long now then you were saying it was hard to judge hellerhe was nearing middle age and thin with an open face and calm gray eyes yet padgett had included him in the list of quarless enemies i believe mr quarles at hallowfields is one of your flock there was a brief hesitation in the knife buttering hellers toast but his face showed nothing i include him in my flock yes which as hamish was pointing out was not precisely a response to what rutledge had asked him how well do you know him heller put down his knife and looked at rutledge has he done something wrong something that has drawn the attention of the police he had answered a question with a question almost as if he expected to learn that quarles was on the point of being taken into custody and was reluctant to add to his troubles do you know him mr heller rutledge asked bluntly sadly not as well as i should like i fear hes not what could charitably be called a member in good standing at st martins i expect i could count on one hand the number of times hes attended a service or that i have been invited to dine at hallowfields heller smiled disarmingly but im stubborn to the bone and i refuse to concede defeat we asked mr quarles to serve on the vestry but he replied that it was not in anyones best interest i interpreted that to mean hes not often in cambury and had no real knowledge of our problems here but to give him his due he takes a personal interest in cambury if not the church in what way i think mr quarles looks upon himself as squire much to the erdismay of people in some quarters we arent strictly agricultural you see weve had cottage industries here for many years weaving glove making even lace at one time it changes ones perspective about such things and theres the other side of the coin what does a londoner know about farming the rector was nearly as good at skirting issues as padgett but he had confirmed constable danielss remarks when rutledge didnt comment heller said now perhaps youll be good enough to tell me why you are here what is your visit in aid of why questions about mr quarles on a bright sunday morning im afraid that harold quarles was murdered last night my dear lord shock wiped all expression from the rectors face iwedont often see murder surely it wasnt hereamong us thats why youre from the yard isnt it the poor man died in london im afraid someone met him near the home farm and killed him there heller sat back in his chair staring at rutledge i must go to mrs quarles at once he said finally my meeting will have to wait he frowned near the home farm you say thats dreadful it wasnt someone here was it i mean it stands to reason that someone from london as soon as the words were out of his mouth he glanced at rutledge in consternation as if he would recall them if he could why why heller blinked if he conducts himself in the city the same way he conducts himself here it wouldnt be surprising and im sure some of his business dealings are not always as successful as he might wish ive heard of at least one where there was great disappointment in the outcome not the fault of harold quarles im sure investments can be volatile but when someone has lost his savings he tends to blame the messenger as it were have people here in cambury lost money through mr quarles for instance mr stephenson you will have to ask them inspector i dont feel its my place to say more about a man who is dead if anything you know has a bearing on his murder then you have an obligation to help the police get at the truth yes the word was drawn out heller removed his serviette a second time automatically folding it and setting it neatly by his plate you must forgive me mr rutledge i shall have to speak briefly to my vestry and then go to hallowfields thank you for bringing me the news personally he stood up and rutledge followed suit i would prefer it if you told no one else about mr quarles for the moment but we have many people to interview and it would be best if we could see their reactions to the news for ourselves but you may call on mrs quarles if she needs consolation this is highly irregular murder often is rector they walked together from the kitchen to the door rutledge said whoever killed harold quarles he or she may come to you for comfort of a sort in a roundabout way perhaps but youll sense when something is wrong be careful then will you its likely that this person could kill again he saw once more the winged body in the shadows of the tithe barns roof murder hadnt satisfied the killerwhoever it was had needed to wreak his anger on the dead as well but in the cold light of day as powerful emotions drained away there could be a need to justify them to feel that what had been done was deserved i would hate to think that anyone i knew might be capable of murder the rector had looked away evading rutledges eyes let us hope it was not one of your flock but the fact remains that someone was capable of it or quarles would still be alive and youd be finishing your breakfast in peace heller stopped at the door i dont believe in judging inspector so that i myself need not fear judging with that remark the rector swung the door shut hamish said a verra fine sentiment but no the whole truth rutledge was halfway down the rectory path when he saw a man crossing the churchyard toward the north door carrying a sheaf of papers under his arm the man looked up and for a moment their eyes met then he turned away and stepped inside the church but there was something in that glanceeven at the distance between the two menthat held more than curiosity about a stranger it had lasted long enough to be personal as if weighing up an adversary rutledge changed course as he went through the gate that separated the churchyard from the rectory as he reached the porch and opened the door he could hear music pouring from the church organ the opening notes of bachs toccata and fugue in d minor it was triumphant and sure the instrument responding to the touch of trained hands the great pipes sent their echoes through the sanctuary filling it with sound and the acoustics were perfect for such an emotional piece hamish said his thoughts may ha been elsewhere he came to practice id swear he knows why im here in cambury not many people do yet ye ken he must ha seen you with yon inspector and hes feeling guilty for anither reason rutledge considered that for a moment half of his mind on the music as it seemed to wrap around him there in the doorway he hadnt mistaken that brief challenge and he was certain the man knew rutledge had taken it up and come as far as the church door indeed as he turned to go he could feel the organist watching him in the small mirror set above the keys let him wonder why the encounter had ended here or worry outside rutledge stopped by the church board to see the name of the player it was the third line down one michael brunswick and mrs quarles had mentioned his name only four hours earlier it was past one oclock when rutledge walked into the police station padgett was on the point of leaving and he frowned as rut ledge met him in the passage i thought you might be sleeping still i can tell you id have stayed in my own bed if id been given the choice rutledge said i went to speak to the rector padgetts tone had an edge and was he any help in our inquiries did you expect him to help there was a twitch in padgetts jaw wheres your motorcar still at the unicorn constable jenkins hasnt returned with mine as padgett followed rutledge across the high street he went on ive had time to think i was all for blaming mrs quarles but i was wrong this killing is most likely connected with london in some fashion thats where quarles lived and did business were wasting our time at hallowfields if thats true why wasnt he killed in london too obvious there the first people the police will want to speak to are his clients and business associates you know the drill but kill him in somerset and the police are going to look at his neighbors here never thinking about london rutledge smiled which is precisely what someone here in cam bury may have been counting onthat we will hare off to london someone at hallowfields may point us in the right direction padgett had no answer to that hamish said he wants you away to london ye ken hed like naething better than to find the killer himsel but as the other inspector climbed into the motorcar rutledge found himself thinking that padgett had other reasons to want to see the back of scotland yard they drove in uneasy silence back to hallowfields mrs downing summoned the indoor staff to her sitting room off the passage across from the kitchen and they stood in front of the policemen in a ragged row clearly uneasy rutledge counted them the cook her scullery maid three upstairs maids and a footman the boot boy and the chauffeur all of them denied any knowledge of where mr quarles had gone last evening he had not called for the motorcar nor had he taken it out himself aside from the message to the kitchen that he wouldnt be dining at home no one had seen him after five oclock mrs blount the cook was a thin woman with graying hair she added i was told not to expect mr quarles for dinner and that was that its not for me to question his comings and goings who gave you that message did you speak to mr quarles yourself or to someone else i believe it must have been mrs quarles downing the housekeeper answered after no one else spoke up lily the youngest of the maids softly cleared her throat i was coming to clear away the tea things when i heard him tell someone in the passage that he was dining out did you see who it was he was speaking to no sir i didnt it was me he told the woman standing behind the others spoke up and you are my name is betty sir there was strain in her face rutledge put her age at forty her pale hair and pale eyebrows giving her a look of someone drained of life enduring all the blows that came her way with patient acceptance as if she knew all too well that she counted for little in the scheme of things i look after mr quarles when hes to home her accent wasnt somerset rutledge thought it might be east anglian a stranger among strangers and no likely to pry hamish put in or gossip with the ithers no one saw him leave downing said repressively we have our duties inspector we dont hang about looking out the windows to see what our betters are up to we was that busy in the kitchens the cook added as if excusing the staff there was no one in the front of the house just then mrs quarles had asked for a tray to be brought up and mr archer was taking his dinner alone in the dining room did any of you hear anything in the night dogs barking a motorcar on the drive shouting they hadnt shuffling a little as they denied any knowledge of what had happened betty said please sir ive been told mr quarles is dead mrs quarles called us all together to say so no one will tell me anything else im afraid its true rutledge answered her someone killed him last night he could see the horror reflected in every face and in bettys eyes a welling of tears that were quickly repressed i cant give you any more information at present he added to forestall questions it would help if you could think of anyone who might wish your master harm padgett speaking for the first time kept his voice level without emphasis mrs newell the footman offered to an accompanying ripple of nervous laughter she was cook here before mrs blount she was always quarrelling with him over the cost of food and the proper way to prepare it in the end he sacked her after a mighty row padgett caught rutledges eye i told you so in his expression nothing of substance a wildgoose chase rutledge thanked the staff and nodded to mrs downing to dismiss them then as betty was about to follow the others from the room he spoke quietly to her and asked her to stay mrs downing pursed her lips in annoyance as if in her view he was wasting his time and the staffs but she made no move to leave how long have you been with mr quarles betty hesitated he brought me here at the start of the war and you keep his rooms for him yes sir i do did you also keep the gatehouse cottage tidy when it was asked of me i was to have that cottage when i retire do you know if he chose to use that cottage himself it wasnt my business to ask was it he paid me well for my silence will you tell me where he went to dine last evening even if he asked you to keep his confidence the situation is different now you see we must trace his movements from the time he left the house until he returned rutledge watched her face as he asked the question i dont know i asked if he wanted me to lay out his evening clothes and he said he wasnt changing for dinner he wasnt in the mood did any of his business associates come to visit at hallowfields he seldom had guests mrs downing answered for her he was often invited elsewhere but if he entertained it was in london i dont remember the last real dinner ive served he doesnt even invite rector to dine something a squire did with regularity it was interesting that quarles hadnt cared to exercise this particular duty or perhaps he was embarrassed to ask the rector to sit at table with his wifes cousin rutledge thanked betty and let her go then he said to mrs downing do you know bettys background who employed her before she came to hallowfields she was hired in london i didnt interview her myself shes a hard worker though she mainly keeps to herself weve had no trouble with her wed like to look at mr quarless rooms now if you please as she led the two policemen through the passage door into the foyer she said im not sure his solicitor would approve of this it doesnt seem right to me that you should go through his things i cant think why mrs quarles allowed it is the solicitor a local man rutledge asked hes in london mrs quarles can give you his direction rutledge handed her the keys mrs downing unlocked the door and stepped aside as if taking no part in this desecration of a dead mans privacy the first of the suite of rooms had been converted into a study as theyd been told with a door through to a sitting room and beyond that the master bedroom the suite was handsomely decorated and padgett looked around him with patent interest the desk a large mahogany affair held mainly writing paper pens stamps a map of the estate and a folder of household accounts and another of farm business none of it of interest to the police and nothing personal nothing indicative of the man there were several paintings on the walls mostly landscapes rut ledge wondered if they were quarless taste or if they had come with the house when he purchased the estate the furnishings of the room were midvictorian and well polished bettys work at a guess if she cared for his rooms and his possessions and kept any of his secrets it was small wonder shed taken his death personally between the windowswhich faced the front of the housewere shelves on which stood gray boxes of business papers each with a white card identifying the contents duplicates of the papers quarles had kept in london or were these documents he didnt wish to leave there confidential reports perhaps for his eyes only was that why no one else cleaned these rooms betty appeared to be honest without curiosity a plain woman grateful for her position and not likely to jeopardize it by risking her employers wrath it was even possible that she couldnt read the perfect safeguard rutledge ran a finger along the line of cards he recognized one or two of the names on the outside portfolios then one box bore the single word cumberline they moved on to the sitting room where there was little of interestchairs in front of the hearth more italian landscapes a table for tea and another against the wall the only personal touch was a blue and white porcelain stand holding a collection of walking sticks with ornate handles of ivory or brass or carved wood lifting one of them rutledge admired the ivory elephant set into the handle the trunk providing a delicate grip the workmanship was quite good as was the silver figure of a sleeping fox capping another stick padgett had moved on to the bedroom and rutledge followed him the armoire and chests yielded only the sort of belongings that were usual for a country house walking clothes boots hats two london suits with a bond street tailors label and evening dress several books on a table by the bed had to do with business law and practices one of them was a leatherbound treatise on africa touting the wealth and opportunities that would open up when the war ended thumbing through it rutledge could see that the florid prose offered very little substance railroads mining operations river navigation and ports were discussed at great length along with large farms for the cultivation of coffee and other crops suggesting that what rhodes had accomplished in south africa was possible in other parts of the continent padgett looking out the window across from quarless bed said i cant see the gatehouse or the end of the drive or the tithe barn for the trees in between rutledge came to join him youre right once quarles reached that bend of the drive where the trees begin hed be out of sight he might have met a dozen people at the gates or entertained half of parliament in the cottage and no one would be the wiser by the same token if someone was waiting for him there friend for dinner or killer in hiding quarles himself would have had no warning did you ask at the unicorn if hed dined there he hadnt hunter the manager saw him coming alone out of minton street around tenthirty but he doesnt know where quarles went from theretoward home or toward another destination you cant be sure hunter isnt lying they had a fallingout he and quarles and it almost cost hunter his position quarles was hellbent on seeing him dismissed it was mr greer who was dining there that night who later smoothed the matter over he added didnt think to tell you this morning hunter didnt know that quarles was dead or he didnt let on that he knew padgett took a deep breath but thats neither here nor there he turned to survey the bedroom and the sitting room beyond if there are guilty secrets hidden in this wing i dont know where to find them rutledge agreed with him but it was beginning to look like quarles had no secrets to hide personal or professional none at least that might explain murder here in somerset for that matter if the man had been wise and clever hed kept no record of any misdeeds so that they couldnt be discovered while he was alive or found after his death an interesting thought the heavy dark woods and brocades of the master bedroom were almost melancholy as if quarles had spent very little time here and even when he was in residence he gathered nothing around him that might characterize the man underneath the successful facade was the estate itself all he needed to define himself a measure of prestige a visible statement that a man who had come from nothing had achieved everything old money giving panache to the new for some men it would be the crowning achievement of a lifetime hamish said he was no a countryman it appeared to be true and that would explain why the house was treated as a symbol not a home they locked the door behind them mrs downing waited for the keys to be passed to her but rutledge pocketed them and her mouth thinned into a disapproving line on their way down the main staircase they found themselves face toface with mrs quarles who was crossing the foyer she looked up at them and said i see youve returned yes rutledge answered for both men thank you for making your staff available to us and if i may ask you one more question she stopped waiting rutledge said tomorrowmondayit will be necessary to notify your husbands solicitor and his business associates that hes dead his solicitor is in the city the firm of hurley and sons as for his business associates davis penrith was his partner until a year or so ago he will be able to tell you who to contact she hesitated and then asked did harold suffer you must ask dr oneil but my impression was that he didnt thank you she went on her way without another word and he couldnt tell whether she was pleased or sorry from the house they went to the home farm tucked in a fold of land and out of sight of hallowfields it was a large thatched stone house and along the ridge of the roof the thatcher had left his signaturethe humorous vignette of a long tailed cat chasing a mouse toward the chimney while a second mouse peered out of what looked to be a hole in the thatch just behind the cats heels they had been created out of the same reeds that formed the roof and were remarkably clever tom masters opened the door to the two policemen saying its true then the scullery maid from hallowfields told our cook not more than half an hour ago that mr quarles was dead i went up to the house but no one answered the door whats happened im still in shock he was a square man skin reddened by the sun his dark hair streaked with gray rutledge could see the worry in his eyes may we come in mr masters padgett asked after explaining rutledges presence yes yes to be sure he stood aside to let them enter and took them to a pretty parlor that overlooked the pond sit down please he said gesturing to the chairs across from the leather one that was clearly his the worn seat and back had over the years taken his shape and a pipe stand was to hand do you keep dogs mr masters rutledge asked we have two theyre out with my youngest son at the moment what does this have to do with mr quarles tell me whats going on last night i was driving past hallowfields and heard a dog barking padgett explained it was sharp alarmed when i stopped to investigate i found mr quarless body masters frowned my dogs werent roaming about last night i know that for a fact one sleeps with my son and the other is in my bedroom at night if they were out id have known when i went up to bed the frown deepened are you suggesting that harold quarles simply dropped dead no i refuse to believe it id have said hes fitter than i am he was murdered rutledge watched as several expressions flitted across masterss face murder dear god i find that just as difficult to believe mrs quarleshow is she taking the news shes bearing up padgett said did you see mr quarles yesterday yes several times the last time was just as my wife was bringing our tea i saw him walking toward the house i didnt speak to him then but earlier wed discussed several repairs that are needed about the estate he seemed in the usual spirits at the time masters shook his head this is unimaginable im having trouble grasping it can you think of anyone who might have wanted to harm mr quarles padgett asked a wary expression crept into tom masterss eyes i can think of a dozen people who couldnt bear him thats not to say they could possibly kill him to what end he hesitated are you quite sure this was murder quite rutledge responded how many people are in your household mr masters er my wife two sons and a daughterthe eldest is twelveand four servantsa cook and two maids and a man of all work hes married to the cook do they sleep in the house yes can you hear anything from the direction of the cottage or the tithe barn a dog in distress a motorcar coming down the farm lane a loud quarrel rutledge asked probably not unless i was outside and the wind was in the right quarter alarm spread across masterss face are you saying we might have heardcome to his aid in time my god thats a terrible thought i doubt if youd have been in time whatever you heard they talked for another five minutes but masters appeared to have no information that could help the police in their inquiries all the same rutledge had a strong feeling that the man wasnt being completely honest that behind the pleasant face and forthcoming manner there was a niggling worry rutledge asked the farm manager again if he could name anyone whod had a fallingout with harold quarles and again he denied that he could i shouldnt wish to make trouble for anyone theres a difference between having words with a man and killing him in cold blood he glanced toward padgett im a farmer not a policeman the inspector here can give you better guidance on that score id only be repeating gossip they left soon after that padgett said as they returned to the motorcar you could see he was hiding something i might as well tell you what it is his wife had a disagreement with quarles over a horse of all things but she got the better of him and that was that all the same with two policemen staring you in the face its hard not to think the worst the wonder was quarles didnt sack masters but then hes one of the best farm managers in the west country it would have been cutting off ones nose to spite ones face strange rutledge said how many people who readily tell us how much quarles was disliked stop short at making a guess about who could have killed the man its almost like a conspiracy of silence you did what id have enjoyed doing and now ill thank you by not giving you away padgett laughed you had only to know the man to hate him but ive heard he was highly thought of in london imagine thatthe nobs taking to him like one of their own here there were two problems with harold quarles one was his pursuit of women the other his belief that most people could be used or else hamish said quietly from the rear seat he didna wish to be treated as one of the villagers which came back to quarless simple roots it was late afternoon when they reached cambury padgett stretched his shoulders and said precious little came of interviewing anyone at hallowfields i expect youll want to leave for london tonight and try your luck there what do you know about the church organist brunswick how did you come across him padgett turned to stare at him is there something you arent telling me i saw him going into the church just before i came to meet you ah he was practicing i expect he seems to prefer that to going home not that i blame him his wife is dead a suicide she just went out and drowned herself without a word to anyone why did mrs quarles list him among those who hated her husband yes well probably to throw you off the scent rutledge stopped the motorcar in front of the police station but padgett made no move to step out youd better hear the rest of it he said after a moment his wife worked for mr quarles for three months while he was rusticating here in somerset he needed someone who could type letters keep records when he went back to london he gave her an extra months wages and let her go it wasnt long afterward that she killed herself brunswick jumped to the conclusion that something had happened between his wife and quarles and that she couldnt live with the knowledge had something happened padgett shrugged i expect the only two people who can answer that question are dead there was no gossip theres always gossip where theres scandal but you cant convince brunswick otherwise i kept an eye on him at first thinking he might do something rash and you didnt think he might wait until your guard was down and then go after quarles hes not the kind of man who kills in cold blood but rutledge had seen the look in the organists eyes and heard the passionate music pouring through the empty church he let the subject drop and said instead we should speak to the doctor padgett brought himself back from whatever place his thoughts had wandered oh yes oneil we can leave the motorcar at the unicorn and walk it was not far to the doctors surgery where james street crossed the high street oneil lived in a large stone house set back behind a low wall a walk dividing two borders of flowers a pear tree stood by the gate to the back garden and a stone bench had been set beneath it the other wing of the house was the surgery with a separate entrance along a flagstone path the two men knocked at the house door and after several minutes oneil himself answered it and took them through to his office in a small examining room beyond it harold quarles lay under a sheet he seemed diminished by death as if much of what made him the man he was had been pride and a fierce will ive examined him and my earlier conclusion about the blows on the head stand the first was enough to stun him the second was deliberate intended to kill in my view whoever did this wasnt enraged angry enough to kill certainly but there are only two blows you see if the killer had been in a fury hed have battered the head and the body indiscriminately youd have marks on the face and the shoulders and back even after the man was dead rutledge asked you said the first blow was intended to stun thats how it appears you can see for yourself that hes a strong man well able to defend himself if the purpose of the attack was to kill it would have been easier to accomplish if quarles was down if the murderer had stopped then quarles would have survived perhaps with a concussion and a devil of a headache but alive if hed stopped quarles might have been able to identify him which could mean they were facetoface and then quarles turned his back what sort of weapon made these wounds rutledge lifted the sheet i couldnt begin to guess not angular but not all together smooth solid i should think but not large the edge of a spanner is too narrow but that sort of thing a river stone rutledge gently restored the sheet possibly but not exclusively that an iron ladle im not sure about a croquet ball the brass head of a firedog a paperweight if it was a heavy one and there was enough force behind it surely it depends on whether someone came to do murder or attacked the man on the spur of the moment i couldnt find anything in the woundno bits of grass or rust or fabric to guide us ive given you all i can something a woman could wield padgett suggested i cant rule out a woman oneil said skeptically but how did she manage to carry quarles to the tithe barn and then put him into that harness she had help once shed done the deed she went for help it was padgett speaking his back to the room as he looked out the narrow window possible but who do you ask to help you do such a thing to a dead man a good question rutledge asked is charles archer capable of walking oneils eyebrows flew up archer of course not ive been his physician for several years he can stand for a brief time he can walk a few steps but if youre suggesting that he helped carry quarles to the tithe barn you are mad what if quarles was put into that invalids chair of archers and pushed padgett interjected i cant see archer helping even so of course i cant rule out the use of his chair its important to eliminate the possibility weve been told that quarles went out to dine last night did he in fact eat his dinner rutledge asked i havent looked to see is it important probably not he was seen on the high street around tenthirty that would indicate hed spent the evening in cambury he turned to padgett did quarles have friends on minton street friends he might have dined with padgett said ill have one of my men go door to door tomorrow but offhand i cant think of anyone in particular he was a queer man not one to make friends here mr greer is his equal thats to say financially youd think they might have got on together instead they were often at loggerheads oneil said are you saying it might be one of us i cant think of anyone i know who would kill a man and then hang him in that infernal contraption perhaps the point of that was to make sure he wasnt found for some time if padgett here hadnt heard a dog barking and gone to investigate it might have been a day or two before the barn was searched which would give the murderer time to get clear of cambury and see to his alibi padgett said soon after they thanked oneil and left i must telephone london rutledge commented as the two men walked back the way theyd come someone may already have spoken to the solicitors and the partner hed suspected that bowles had put someone else in charge of the london side of the inquiry now he had an excuse to find out i thought you were in charge padgett said here yes padgett paused by a bookshop rutledge looked up and saw that the name in scrolled gold letters above the door was nemesis the shop was dark but he could see the shelves of books facing the windows and a small untidy desk on one side padgett was saying you didnt tell me this there was dissatisfaction in his voice hed hoped to be rid of the yard if that was the case why had he sent for them in the first place rutledge wondered with a sigh padgett prepared to take his leave see what your london colleague has to say and perhaps well have a better grip on whats to be done here tomorrow ill send constable horton to minton street to discover where quarles dined well see if it holds with what hunter told you at the hotel he nodded in farewell and went on toward his house rutledge watched him go hamish in the back of his mind said it wouldna astonish me if yon policeman was the killer surprised rutledge said aloud why i dona ken why only that he muddles the ground at every turn and theres only his word that he found the body it was true padgett had offered a number of suspects for consideration and then changed his mind others hed neglected to mention the invalid chair aye thats verra clever such a suggestion would please the kc who defends the killer no endwhats more it could have happened that way wed walked about too much to find the chairs tracks if they were ever there i wonder why inspector padgett dislikes the quarles family so intensely at the unicorn rutledge asked for the telephone and was shown to a small sitting room behind the stairs he put in the call to london and after a time sergeant gibson came to the telephone instead of bowles the chief superintendent isnt here sir and i dont know that anyones spoken to the solicitors yet gibson responded to rutledges questions he added inspector mickelson is still in dover but hes expected to return tomorrow at one oclock hes taking the morning train rutledge smiled to himself mickelson was bowless protege and what about the former partner penrith i was sent around to his house this morning sir mr penrith isnt there his wifes in scotland and the valet says he went to visit her he should be home tonight did you tell his valet why youd come to see penrith it seemed best not to say anything sir gibson answered he was a good man with good instincts and the soul of a curmudgeon and if there was gossip to be had at the yard gibson generally knew it then id rather be the one to interview him as to that sir if youre in somerset you wont be in london before one oclock i was present when chief superintendent bowles told the inspector to make haste back to the yard though he didnt say why of course i understand thank you sergeant i do my best sir and gibson was gone hamish said ye canna reach london before noon i can if i leave now rutledge answered its no very wise to hell with wise in a hurry now rutledge strode out of the sitting room and went in search of hunter making arrangements for a packet of sandwiches and a thermos of tea to be put up at once ill be away this evening hold my room for my return please ill be happy to see to it erdid you find mr quarles yes thank you rutledge answered and went up the stairs two at a time he took a clean shirt with him and was down again just as hunter was bringing the packet of food and the thermos from the kitchen the long may evening stretched ahead and he made good time as he turned toward london the soft air and the wafting scents of wild flowers in the hedgerows accompanied him and the sunsets afterglow lit the sky behind the motorcar when darkness finally overtook him rutledge was well on his way but a second night without sleep caught up with him and just west of london he veered hard when a dog walked into the road directly in his path the motorcar spun out of control and before hamish could cry a warning rutledge had crossed the verge and run into a field strong as he was he couldnt make the brakes grip in the soft soil and then suddenly the motorcar slewed in a half circle and came to an abrupt stop as the engine choked his chest hit the wheel and knocked the wind out of him just as his forehead struck the windscreen hard enough to render him unconscious it was some time laterhe didnt know how longthat he came to his senses but the blow had been severe enough to muddle his mind his chest ached and his head felt as if it were detached from his body he managed to get himself out of his seat and into the grass boundary of the field there he vomited violently and the darkness came down again the second time he woke he thought he was back in france he could hear the guns and the cries of his men and hamish was calling to him to get up and lead the way ye canna lie here ye canna sleep its no safe rutledge tried to answer him scrambling to his feet and running forward though his legs could barely hold him upright he must have been shot in the chest it was hard to breathe and where was his helmet hed lost it somewhere he shouted to his men but hamish was still loud in his ear telling him to beware he could see the germans now just at that line of trees and he thought they hadnt told us it was that farthey lied to uswell lose a hundred men before we get there despair swept him and hamishs accusing voice was telling him hed killed the lot of them and the line of trees wasnt any closer the machine gunners had opened up and he called to his men to take cover but this was no mans land there was no safety except in the stinking shell holes down in the muddy water with the ugly dead their bony fingers reaching up as if begging for help and their empty eye sockets staring at the living cursing them for leaving the dead to rot rutledge flung himself into the nearest depression but his men kept running toward the german line and he swore at them his whistle forgotten his voice ragged with effort back damn you find cover now do you hear me he dragged himself out of the shell hole and went after them but they were determined to die and there was nothing he could do he watched them fall one by one and he tried to lift them and carry them back to his own lines but his chest was aching and his legs refused to support him he could hear himself crying at the waste of good men and swearing at the generals safe in their beds and pleading with the germans to stop because they were all dead all except hamish whose voice rose above the sound of the gunscursing him reminding him that each soul was on his conscience because he himself was unscathed ye let them die damn you ye let them die it was what hamish had shouted to him the last time theyd been ordered over the top and the young scots corporal his face set in anger had accused him of not caring ye canna make tired men do any more than theyve done ye canna ask them to die for ye because ye ken they will ill no lead them oer the top again ill die first mysel and yell rot in hell for no stopping this carnage but rutledge had cared that was the problem hed cared too much and in the end like hamish he had broken too he could hear the big guns firing from behind the lines as the germans prepared for a counterattack and firing from his own lines to cover that last sortie over the top the hun artillery had their range now and he struggled to get what was left of his men to safety hed had to shoot hamish for speaking the truth and that was the last strawhis mind had shattered not from the war not the fear of death not even the german guns but from the deaths he couldnt prevent and the savage wounds and the bleeding that wouldnt stop and the men who lived on in his head until he couldnt bear it any longer hamishs voice had stopped and he knew then that hed killed the best soldier he had a good man who was more honest than he was who was willing to die for principles while he himself obeyed orders he hated and went on for two more years killing soldiers hed have died to save someone was grappling with him and he couldnt find his revolver his head was aching blinding him and his chest felt as if the caisson mules had trampled him but instinct was still alive he swung his fist at the mans face and felt it hit something solid a shoulder he thought hamish had come back his breath seemed to stop in his throat hamishs shoulder hard and living under his fist if he opened his eyes a voice said here theres no need for that ive come to help and rutledge opened his eyes and stared in the face of death he slumped back willing to let go almost glad that it was over and longing for silence and rest the farmer grasped his arm where are you hurt man can you tell me rutledge came back to the present with a shock blinking his eyes as the light of a lantern sent splinters of pain through his skull they were going to truss him up in that contraption and hang him in the tithe barn and then the darkness receded completely and he said im sorry the farmer gruffly replied theres a bloody great lump on your forehead it must have addled your brains man you were shouting something fierce about the germans when i came up rutledge shook his head to clear it and felt sick again fighting down the nausea he said sorry again as if it explained everything you need a doctor no i must get to london he looked behind the farmers bulk and saw the motorcar mired in the plowed field his first thought was for hamish and then he realized that hamish wasnt there oh damn the accident is itwill it run now theres nothing wrong with your motorcar that a team cant cure but i didnt want to leave you until i knew you were all right theres no one to send back to the house i saw your headlamps when i went to do the milking youre not the first to come to grief in the dark on that bend in the road rutledge managed to sit up his eyes shut against the pain theres no benda dog darted in front of me i swerved to miss him a dog theres no dog just that bend you must have fallen asleep and dreamt it it was a dog barking that had brought padgett to the tithe barn yes i expect i did he put up a hand and felt the blood drying on his forehead and cheek crusting on his chin it was a good thing he thought wryly that hed brought that fresh shirt with him he heaved himself to his feet gripping the farmers outstretched hand for support until he could trust his legs to hold him upright im all right by the time you get your team here ill be able to drive drive you need a doctor above all else no im all right he repeated though he could hear hamish telling him that he was far from right please fetch your team what time is it do you know past milking time the cows are already in the barn waiting then the sooner you pull me out of here the sooner they can be milked the farmer took a deep breath if thats what youre set on ill go i dont have time to stand here and argue he tramped off a square man with heavy shoulders and muddy boots as the lantern bobbed with each step rutledge felt another surge of nausea and turned away without the lantern he couldnt see the motorcar very well but as he walked around it it seemed to be in good condition the tires were whole and the engine turned over when he tried it though it coughed first hamish said ye fell asleep i thought it was your task to keep me awake we could have been killed it was no likely though ye ken your head hit yon windscreen with an almighty crack rutledge put his hand up again to the lump it seemed to be growing not receding though his chest while it still ached seemed to feel a little better he could breathe without the stabbing pain hed felt earlier his ribs would have to wait it was pride that made you drive all night to reach london before yon inspector he and mickelson had had several runins though the chief cause of mickelsons dislike of rutledge had to do with an inquiry in westmorland last december aye yell no admit it hamish said when rutledge didnt reply the farmer was back with his horses and the huge draft animals pulled the motorcar back to the road with ease the bunched muscles of their haunches rippling in the light of the farmers lantern come to the house and rest a bit the man urged when the motorcar was on solid ground once more a cup of tea will see you right rutledge held up the empty thermos ive tea here but thanks he offered to pay the man but the farmer shook his head do the same for someone else in need and were square he said turning to lead his team back to the barn watching the draft animals move off in the darkness the lantern shining on the white cuffs of shaggy hair hanging over their hooves rutledge was beginning to regret his decision but he could see false dawn in the east and he would need to change his clothes and wash his face before finding penrith the drive into london was difficult his head was thundering and his chest complained as he moved the wheel or reached for the brakes but he was in his flat as the sun swept over the horizon he looked in his mirror with surprise a purpling lump above his eye and bloody streaks down to his collarsmall wonder the farmer was worried about his driving on a quick bath was in order and a change of clothes he managed both after a fashion looking down at the bruised half circle on his chest where hed struck the wheel his ribs were still tender and he suspected hed sustained a mild concussion nausea stood between him and breakfast and in the end after two cups of tea he set out to find quarless former partner there was a clerkjust opening the door at the countinghouse in leadenhall street and rutledge asked for penrith mr penrith is no longer with this firm the clerk said severely eyeing the bruise on rutledges forehead rutledge presented his identification the clerk responded with a nod youll find him just down the street and to your left the third door are any of your senior officials here at this hour no sir im afraid not theyll be going directly to a meeting at ninethirty at the bank of england rutledge followed instructions but discovered that mr penrith had not so far arrived at his firm at the usual hour this morning we expect him at ten oclock the clerk told rutledge after a long look at his identification it took some convincing to pry penriths direction out of the man armed with that rutledge drove on to a tall gracious house in belgravia black shutters and black railings matched the black door and two potted evergreens stood guard on either side of the shallow steps the pert maid who opened the door informed him that she would ask if mr penrith was at home five minutes later rutledge was being shown into a drawing room that would have had padgett spluttering with indignation cream and pale green it was as french as money could make it penrith joined him shortly standing in the doorway as if prepared to flee or so it appeared for a split second when he stepped into the room his expression was one of stoicism he didnt invite rutledge to sit down what brings the police here is it the firm my family rutledge replied mr penrith im afraid i must inform you that your former partner harold quarles is dead the shock on penriths face appeared to be genuine dead where how rutledges head felt as if there were salvos of french eightyeights going off simultaneously on either side of him in somerset at his estate after a moment penrith sat down and put his hands over his face effectively hiding it and said through the shield of his fingers of what cause surely not suicide i refuse to believe he would kill himself mrs quarles had said the same thing why are you so certain sir penrith lowered his hands for one thing harold quarles is wasthe hardest man ive ever met for another he was afraid of nothing i cant even begin to imagine anything that would make him want to die im afraid he was murdered he thought penrith was going to fall off his chair murdered by whom i have no answer to that not yet ive come to london to find it it cant be someone in the city i cant think of anyone who wouldi mean to say even his professional competitors respected him he stopped and cleared his throat he was generally well liked in london both his business acumen and his ability to deal with people took him into the very best circles you can ask anyone you choose i understand quarles was fromerdifferent circumstances in his youth i know very little about his past he was frank about being poor in his youth and people admired that accepted it because of his ability to fit in like a chameleon thats to say his table manners were impeccable he knew how to dress well and his conversation was that of a gentleman though his accent wasnt people could enjoy his company without any sense of lowering their own standards they could introduce their wives and daughters to him without fear that he would embarrass them with his attentions his praise had an edge to it as if penrith was envious have you known him long he and i joined the firm about the same time and we prospered there in fact ended as partners still i preferred to reduce my schedule in the last year or so and left james quarles amp penrith to set up for myself he wished me well and ive been glad of more time to spend with my family penrith was fair and slim and had an air of coming from a good school an excellent background if not a wealthy one it was not likely that the two men had much in common beyond their business dealings that would explain the stiffness in his answers how is mrs quarles taking the news penrith asked i must send her my condolences shes bearing up rutledge answered and saw what he suspected was a flicker of amusement in penriths blue eyes before he looked down at his hands yes well this has been a shock to me thank you for coming in person to tell me will you keep me abreast of the search for his killer id like to know i was fortunate to find you at home at this hour yes ive just returned from scotland and it was a tiring journey my wife is visiting there i must call on his solicitor next do you know of any reason why someone would wish to harm harold quarles you would be in a better position than most to know of a disgruntled client a personal quarrel ive told you his clients were pleased with him as for personal problems i dont believe there were any he wasnt in debt his reputation was solid his connections of the best but then i was his business partner not a confidant i understand in somerset that he had a much different reputa tionfor pursuing women with or without their consent a dark flush suffused penriths fair skin its the first ive heard of it his tone was harsh as if rutledge had insulted his former partner he didnt have the same reputation in london rutledge pressed i told you not at all do you think hed have been invited to weekends at the best houses if that were the case thank you for your help you can always reach me through sergeant gibson at the yard yes yes of course he got up and walked with rutledge to the door this is very distressing rutledge paused on the threshold were you invited down to somerset often quarles and his wife seldom entertained after their separation over the years i was probably in that house a dozen times at most and then only when we had pressing business i can count on one hand the number of times i dined there did you know of mrs quarless relationship with her cousin charles archer yes i did by the time archer came to live at hallowfields harold and maybelle were estranged it made for an uncomfortable weekend there if you must know i never understood what the problem was and harold never spoke of the situation one year they were perfectly happy and the next they were living in different wings of the house this must have been late or early he was angry most of the time and she was like a block of ice but i can tell you that after archer arrived wounded and in need of care the house settled into an armed peace if you can imagine that i shouldnt be telling you thisit would be the last thing harold would countenance from me but hes dead isnt he and i shouldnt care for you to think that mrs quarles was in any way involved in this murder in spite of his claim that he shouldnt have discussed the issue there was an almost vindictive relish behind the words as if penrith was pleased that harolds marriage was in trouble a counterpoint to his own happy one rutledge said i shall of course need to verify your claim to have been in scotland penrith seemed taken aback my claim ohof course routine rutledge thanked him and went out the door feeling dizzy as he reached the motorcar but it passed and he went on to hurley and sons quarless solicitors the street was georgian brick and the shingles of solicitors gleamed golden in the morning light as he found a space for his motorcar a clerk in the outer office verified that hurley and sons had dealt with mr quarless affairs for many years and showed rutledge into the paneled office ofjason hurley a whitehaired man of sixty when he realized that his visitor was from scotland yard he immediately suggested that his son laurence join them the younger hurley was indeed his fathers sonthey shared a prominent chin and heavy flaring eyebrows that gave them both a permanently startled expression quarless solicitors were shocked by the newswhich rutledge gave them in fullasking questions about their clients death showing alarm when rutledge told them that no one had yet been taken into custody but thats monstrous the elder hurley told him i find it hard to believe the inquiry is in its earliest stage he reminded them theres still much to be done thats why im here to ask who will inherit the bulk of harold quarless estate jason hurley turned to his son fetch the box for me will you laurence the younger man got up and left the room hurley said as soon as the door closed was it an affair with a woman by any chance mr quarles had many good qualities but sometimes hiserpassions got the best of him did they indeed occasionally weve been required to mollify the anger of someone who took exception to his pursuit mr quarles didnt wish his pecadillos to come to the ears of his london clientele who were these women where did they live in somerset i sometimes felt that perhaps this wasnt really an unfortunate passion as much as it was a way of striking back at mrs quarles for the separation you know her circumstances ive spoken to her rutledge answered the solicitor she was quite clear about how she felt yes well they had a quarrel the year before the war i have no idea what it was about but the result was a decision to live separately after that mrs quarles undertook the management of her own funds and except for the house for their sons benefit they no longer held any investments in common how did quarles take the arrival of his wifes cousin soon after their separation rutledge asked curious now he had very little to say about it hed already informed us that we would handle the legal aspects of the separation and there was really nothing more to add certainly mr archer was on the continent when the marriage fell apart for whatever reason he couldnt be called to account for that whatever his later relationship with mrs quarles might be was it before or after mr archer came to live at hallowfields that mr quarlesserpursuits began to my knowledge well afterward which is why i drew the conclusions i have as far as the separation went mr quarles was scrupulous in his handling of it aye hamish interjected he could show his vindictiveness then an interesting point and rutledge was on the brink of following it up when the solicitors son returned with the box hurley opened it and looked at the packets inside before choosing one this is mr quarless last will and testament he unfolded it and scanned the document just as i thought the only bequest to mrs quarles is a life interest in the house in which she now resides the estate called hallowfields the remainder of his estate is held in trust until marcuss twentyfifth birthday a wise decision as it is a rather large sum and marcus is presently at rugby nothing unusual in that arrangement laurence hurley put in considering their marital circumstances yes i agree what about his firm did he leave instructions for its future does anyone gain there rutledge asked there is provision for junior partners to buy out his share a very fair and equitable settlement in my opinion when he made out his will mr quarles told me that he couldnt see his son following in his footsteps he felt marcus would be better suited to the law if he wished to follow a profession he held that money could ruin a young man if not earned by his own labor even though his son will be well set up financially can you think of anyone who might have clashed with mr quarles over business affairs or personal behavior enough to hate him and want to ridicule him in death laurence hurley said by indicating that he was no angel or that he pretended to be an angel i dont quite see the point other than to hide his body for as long as possible his murderer would have had to know about that apparatus wouldnt he that smacks of someone local jason hurley frowned at his sons comments to be honest with you i cant conceive of anyone no one in london certainly he was respected here rutledge asked if he wasunhappyabout his wifes situation how did mr quarles react to what he might have viewed as his partners defection was there retaliation even when he and davis penrith dissolved their partnership it appeared to be amicable although i couldnt help but think that mr penrith would have been better off financially if hed continued in the firm not that he hasnt done well on his own you understand but the firm is an old one and has been quite profitable over the years it would have been to his advantage to stay on i understand from mr penrith that he wished to spend more time with his family than the partnership allowed ah that would explain it of course mr quarles was most certainly a man who relished his work and devoted himself to it i sometimes wondered if that had initiated the rift with his wife his clients loved him for his eye to detail but it required hours of personal attention was there anyone else who might have crossed mr quarles who later might have felt that there were reprisals both father and son were shocked they insisted that with the exception of his matrimonial troubles mr quarles had never exhibited a vengeful nature and marriage laurence hurley added has its own pitfalls i daresay he could accept the breakup perhaps in the hope that it would heal in time when mr archer joined the household hope vanished mr quarles wouldnt be the first man to suffer jealousy and look for comfort where he could hamish said ye ken hes speaking of his ain marriage there was nothing more the senior mr hurley could add quarles had left no letters to be opened after his death and no other bequests that in hurleys terms could raise eyebrows except of course the large bequest to a servant one betty richards laurence hurley reminded his father indeed mr quarles himself explained that she had been faithful and deserved to be financially secure when he was dead i havent met her but i understand there was no personal reason for his thoughtful ness except the fact that she was already in her forties and as time passed would find it hard to seek other service he was often a kind man in the will is there any mention of the gatehouse at hallowfields hurley frowned the gatehouse no theres no provision for that i would assume that it remains with the house and grounds were you under the impression that someone was to inherit it hamish said hes thinking of yon man in the wheelchair archer the gatehouse came up in a conversation and i wondered if it held any specific importance to mr quarles laurence hurley said none that we are aware of what do you know of mr quarless background he came from the north coal country im told he arrived in london intending to better himself and because of his persistence and his abilities rose to prominence in financial circles he made no claim to being other than what he was a plain yorkshireman who was lucky enough to have had a fine sponsor mr james the senior partner of the firm when quarles was taken on which meant hamish suddenly commented in a lull in rutledges headache hurley knew little more than anyone else how did he burn his hands so badly it happened when he was a young man there was a fire and he tried to rescue a child i believe he brought her out alive though burned as well in london no it happened just before he decided to leave the north is there any family to notify sadly no his brothers died of black lung and his mother of a broken heart he said it was what kept him out of the minesher wish that he do more with his life than follow his brothers he said she was his inspiration and his salvation apparently they were quite close he spoke sometimes of their poverty and her struggle to free him from what she called the family curse it was she who saw to it that he received an education and she sold her wedding ring to provide him with the money to travel to london he was always sad that she died before hed saved enough to find and buy back her ring it was quite dickensian the question was how much of the story was true enough certainly for a man like hurley to believe it the old lawyer was not one easily taken in or else quarles had been a very fine spinner of tales rutledge left soon after the morning sun was so bright it sent a stab of pain through his head but he had done what hed come to london to do and there was nothing for it but to return to somerset as soon as possible hamish was set against it but rutledge shrugged off his objections he stopped briefly to eat something at a small tea shop in kensington then sped west it was just after he crossed into somerset as the throbbing in his head changed to an intermittent dull ache that he realized davis pen rith had not asked him how harold quarles had died as rutledge came into cambury he pulled to one side of the high street to allow a van to complete a turn the sign on its side read clark and sons millers and it had just made a delivery to the bakery a man in a white apron was already walking back into the shop after seeing it off welsh dark and heavyset he reached into the shop window as he closed the green door removing a tray of buns was he the jones whose daughter had been sent to cardiff after receiving harold quarless attentions very likely and to judge from the width and power of his shoulders he could have managed the device in the tithe barn with ease rutledge went on to the hotel leaving his motorcar in the yard behind the unicorn then walked back to the bakers shop a liver and white spaniel was sitting patiently outside the door his stump of a tail wagging happily as rutledge spoke to him jones was behind the counter talking to an elderly woman as he wrapped her purchase in white paper his manner was effusive and he smiled at a small witticism about her dog and its taste for joness wares watching her out the door he sighed then turned to rutledge what might i do for you sir rutledge introduced himself and jones nodded youre here about mr quarles not for aniseed cake he replied dryly well if youre thinking im delighted to hear hes dead youre right at rutledges expression of surprise jones added oh yes word arrived with the milk early this morning bertie the dairyman had heard it at the home farm great ones for gossip the staff at the home farm tell bertie anything and hes better than a town crier for spreading rumors but this time it isnt rumor is it no and youll understand that i need to know where you were on saturday evening lets say between ten oclock and two in the morning jones smiled in the bosom of my family but i didnt kill him you know there was a time when id have done it gladly save for the hanging ive a wife and six children depending on me for their comfort and even harold quarles dead at my hands wasnt worth dying myself but i say more power to whoever it was it was time his ways caught up with him i understand he paid more attention to your daughter than was proper joness laughter boomed around the empty shop but it wasnt amused laughter you might call it more attention than proper i called it outright revolting a child her age filling gwyneths head with tales of london telling her about the theater and the shops and seeing the king morning noon and night to the point she could think of nothing else but going there she was barely sixteen and easily persuaded into anything but working here in the shop up to her elbows in flour and dough in the wee hours while the ovens heat up taking those heavy loaves out again filling the trays with cakes and buns before we opened at seven its not easy but its what kept food on my table as a boy and food on hers now she was my choice to take over when i can no longer keep it going but after quarles had unsettled her shed no wish to stay in cambury i dont see her now my own daughter but once in three months time i cant leave here and i cant bring her back and shes the apple of my eye but she isnt the same child she once was he cost her her innocence you might say it wasnt unusual for a girl gwyneths age to change her mind every few months about what she wished to do with her life it was a time for dreaming and pretending that something wonderful might happen quarles had precipitated her growing up in a way that jones was not prepared to accept reason enough to kill the man but jones seemed to read his mind and he said before rutledge could pose the next question i would have done it there and then not wait if i was to kill him i could have put my hands around his neck and watched him die in front of me i was that angry if youre a father you understand that if youre not youll have to take my word for it rector helped me see sense im chapel not church of england but he made me think of my family and where id be if i let my feelings carry me into foolishness the words rang true still jones had had time to think about what hed say to the police when someone came to question him since early morning in fact jones was adding my wife was here as soon as shed heard i didnt tell her it was going to come out soon enough anyway she asked me straight out if id done this and i told her no but i could see doubt in her eyes thinking i might have gone out after she went to sleep i didnt in his face was the hurt that his wifes suspicion her need to come to him at once for assurance had brought in its wake which to rut ledge indicated just how much hate this man must have harbored did you know that quarles was in cambury this past weekend not at first then i saw him with mr masters on their way to the ironmongers shop that was saturday morning wed like you to make a statement mr jones will you come to the police station after you close the shop and tell constable daniels what youve just told me ill do it and put my hand on the bible to swear to it the door of the shop opened and two women came in if theres nothing more ill ask you to leave now jones said quietly it wont do my custom any good for me to be seen talking with the police now that the news is traveling rutledge nodded and went out while the women were still debating over lemon tarts and a dark tea bun with raisins in it he walked along the high street listening to hamish in his head until he reached the police station constable horton was there reading a manual on the use of the typewriter he looked up as rutledge came in smiling sheepishly i hear him swearing in his office i wondered what the fuss was all about looks easy enough to me once you know where your fingers belong setting the manual aside he added his eyes carefully avoiding the red and swollen abrasion on the londoners forehead the inspector isnt here sir if its him youre after i need the direction of the jones house i just spoke to mr jones in the bakery id like to talk to his wife next inspector padgett thought youd gone up to london so i have rutledge answered and left it at that horton explained how to find the jones house and rutledge thanked him leaving on the heels of it the jones family had a rambling home at the bottom of james street apparently adding on with the birth of each child there was no front garden but the window boxes were rampant with color and the white curtains behind them were stiff with starch rutledge tapped on the door and after a moment a woman answered it a sleepy child on her hip she had been crying her eyes redrimmed rutledge introduced himself showing her his identification she hesitated before inviting him into the house as if trying to come up with an excuse to send him away in the end she realized she had no choice the parlor with its horsehair furniture and broad mantelpiece was spotlessly clean mrs jones settled the child on her lap and asked quietly what brings you here mr rutledge her welsh accent was stronger than her husbands her hands red from mondays washing brushed a wisp of dark hair back from her face and she seemed to brace herself for his answer youve heard that mr quarles was killed over the weekend the news came with the milk i was sorry to hear of it but he thought she wasnt she couldnt spare any thought or emotion for harold quarles when she could see her whole world crumbing into despair if her husband was the murderer ive spoken to your husband i need only to verify what he told me that he spent saturday evening with you and the children her eyes flickered he did that its the only time we have as a family to tell the truth and he didnt go out after youd gone up to bed that he didnt the next youngest bridgett had a little fever and we were worried about her her hands shook as she smoothed the dress of the little girl in her lap weve six girls she said then immediately regretted speaking i understand that the oldest daughter is living in cardiff she was reluctant to answer as if not certain what her husband might have said gwyneths with my mother a real help to her she is and theres no denying it i also understand that it was harold quarless fault that your daughter had to be sent away the whole town knows of it she answered on the verge of tears we cant go anywhere without some busybody asking after her as if she was recovering from the plague that tone of voice pitying you see but with a hint of hunger about it hoping we had had bad news a baby on the way im sure it has been difficult for you and if youre thinking that hugh had anything to do with what happened to that devil she said fiercely youd be wrong the child in her lap stirred with her intensity an intensity in defense of the husband she herself doubted protecting her family if she must perjure her soul how many wives had done the same time out of mind yet would mrs quarles have protected her husband this fiercely he wondered but hamish reminded him that there was a son marcus how can you be so certain rutledge asked mrs jones he must have felt like any father would feel that the man ought to be horsewhipped he wanted to use his fists on him true enough but there was us to think about too high a price he said and it wasnt as if the devil had touched gwyneth only talking to her in such a way that she believed he would take her away to london it was foolishness but her head was turned wasnt it and shes so pretty it makes your heart ache to think what can happen to one so young she stopped something in her face an anguish that she tried to stifle alerting him to think what can happen not what could have happened but before he could question the difference in tenses she began to cry a silent weeping that was all the more wrenching to watch tears rolling down her face and her arms encircling the sleeping child as if to keep her safe from all harm he had to look away from the grief in her eyes after a moment rutledge said whats wrong mrs jones shall i bring someone to youyour husband oh no please dont let him see me like this she tried to wipe her eyes with the dress the little girl was wearing but the tears wouldnt stop it was as if hed opened floodgates and there was no way to put them right again hamish said its no yon dead man shes crying for and not hugh jones either whats more her husband hadnt appeared to be upset whats happened what is it your husband doesnt know he crossed the room and took the child from her arms and went down the passage to the kitchen where a crib stood under the windows looking out over the back garden the child sighed as he lowered her to the mattress and she put her thumb in her mouth rutledge went back to the parlor and sat down next to mrs jones offering her his handkerchief i couldnt tell him she said sobbing i didnt know how her fingers fumbled in the pocket of her apron and drew out a sheet of paper he saw that it was from a letter the scrawled writing was tear stained and nearly indecipherable but he managed to read the pertinent sentences she must have waited until i was asleep and left then in the middle of the night with only the clothes on her back and im at my wits end what to do or where to lookungrateful child after all ive done gwyneth it appeared had run away from her grandmothers house and if any man had an excuse for murder hugh jones did now are you certain he doesnt know rutledge asked folding the letter and putting it back into mrs joness hand i cant think how he couldbut he loves gwyneth shes our firstborn and hes been set on her since she first saw the light of day he may have felt it in his bones that she was in trouble ive been so frightened with nowhere to turnfor three days its nearly eaten me alive and then bertie this morning spilling out the news as if he knew knew she had run away and was certain hugh must know as well had the girl come to that gatehouse to look for harold quarles and somehow the baker had discovered that she was there but mrs jones was righthow could he have learned she had left cardiff yet she herself had answered her own questionhe may have felt it in his bones that she was in trouble true enough but surely not to the extent of going to the hallow fields gatehouse to see hunter had reported that hed heard voices quarreling just before quarles turned the corner had jones confronted quarles demanding to know where his daughter was then followed him home to hallowfields to see for himself if she was hiding in the gatehouse and when he couldnt find her he lost his temper it was possible all too possible rutledge could understand mrs joness fears but that would have meant he knew it kept coming back to that unless jones had found the letter where shed hidden it from him one of gwyneths sisters might have told him that the post had brought with it a letter that made mama cry hamish said its no likely still rutledge comforted mrs jones as best he could then went to make tea for her the child was still sleeping face flushed a little with the morning heat of the kitchen and silky dark eyelashes sweeping her cheeks her dark hair curling about her neck she would be a beauty he thought when she was grown like her sister but now there was no harold quarles to tempt her she was safe he found cups in the welsh dresser and before he could carry the tea back to the parlor mrs jones had come to stand in the door shame written on her face i am that sorry to put you to such trouble she began but rut ledge cut her short drink this if you will he said setting the cup on the table and pulling out a chair for her to sit down but the cats out of the bag she said wretchedly now hugh will know and everyone else and what am i to do about gwynie i cant go to cardiff and i cant send hugh and shes been gone for days her face changed her eyes suddenly haunted do you think she wrote to him mr quarles when she ran off id not have thought it of her but i havent seen that much of her since we sent her away i might not know whats in her heart now a mothers nightmare staring her in the face for an instant he thought the flood of tears would begin again but she had cried herself out and slumped in the chair at the table so forlorn he felt pity for her what could she do ill speak to london he promised her and have the police in wales alerted we may be able to find her it was all he could promise and she was pathetically grateful reluctantly he left her there staring into her teacup as if the leaves in the bottom held the answer to her worries lived hen rutledge left the jones house he turned toward the church intent on finding out where the organist brunswick just before he reached his destination he came to a pretty cottage where masses of apricot roses climbed cheek by jowl with honeysuckle framing the windows of the south corner and drooping in clusters above the door the stonework was very much like that of the church and the rectory in style and age and he thought it might once have served as a churchwardens house and for all he knew they did he was admiring it unaware at first of the woman kneeling in the front garden setting out small plants from a nursery tray she glanced up as rutledge stopped but didnt speak he glimpsed dark flame red hair a freckled nose and intense blue eyes before she bent her head again to her gardening was this the miss ohara who had come to cambury and set the cat amongst the pigeons as inspector padgett had claimed still digging in the pliable earth she said with a soft irish accent you neednt stare you must be the man from london as a matter of fact he replied i was admiring the house and the roses she looked up again and this time her smile was derisive of course you were he could feel himself flush and she laughed a low sultry chuckle while ive interrupted you miss ohara he said ignoring the embarrassment hed felt at her accusation i might as well ask where you were on saturday night between ten oclock and two in the morning because ive had words with harold quarles he thought he was a great flirt but i didnt care for his attentions and told him as much end of story and if you must know about saturday evening my cat and i were in bed asleep you can ask him if you need corroboration she gestured toward the cottage door hes there in the sitting room curled on a cushion you cant miss him a man has been murdered miss ohara its not a matter ofjest she sobered in a flash i know something about murder mr rutledge and i never consider it a matter ofjest but mr quarless death doesnt touch me i didnt know him except to see him on the street if you expect me to weep over his passing im afraid i cant accommodate you turning back to her plants she said nothing more expecting him to walk on but rutledge was not so easily dismissed he said why did quarles single you out for his attentions did he have encouragement encouragement he had angered her indeed he didnt and its rude of you to suggest it still the question remains she stood up and he realized she was tall nearly as tall as he was if you want the answer to that i suggest you speak to mrs quarles why should she have the answer because he flirts with women to embarrass her she must live here while he appears to spend most of his time in london now and he bears no shame for what he does its like a game to him i dont know how she deals with it i dont care its her business isnt it the people who suffer are the families of the women hes singled out thats very callous of him he said surprised at her perception hed heard much the same suggestion from the elder hurley hes a man who doesnt care what others think of him if it had been mrs quarles who was killed i would believe him capable of it he quickly reassessed his initial opinion of this woman hamish said aye shell turn your head if youre no careful do you think he hated her that much i dont think it was hate precisely but she walked away from him and for that perhaps he wanted to punish her she smiled ive had experience of flirtatious men i can tell the difference between one who is trying to attract my notice and one who is making a show of his interest do you know mrs quarles ive seen her occasionally in the shops she strikes me as a strong woman who knows her own mind what i dont understand is why she married the man in the first place a very good question im told he could be very pleasant if he wished that may be so inspector but im sure most of cambury would wonder if he knew the meaning of the word if thats all you have to ask me the roots of these nasturtiums are drying thats all for now miss ohara he touched his hat and walked on but he could feel her gaze following him the temptation to turn was strong but he refused to give her that satisfaction he stopped briefly at the church but it was empty rutledge went on past the churchyard to the outskirts of cam bury where beyond the last of the houses he could see farms scattered across the fields they could have been ten years old or two hundred crouching so low that they seemed to have grown from seed where they were splashes of color dotted the viewwashing hung out to dry flowers blooming in gay profusion here and there the different green of kitchen gardens the bare earth of barnyards and the fruit trees in small squares of orchards like soldiers on parade all a patchwork laid over the slightly rolling landscape somerset at its prettiest turning around he chose another route to the high street not wanting to give miss ohara another reason to taunt him hamish chuckled in his mind he was halfway to the unicorn when inspector padgett came out of a shop and stopped short i thought youd be in london today i was theres nothing unusual about quarless will except for the bequests to staff everything is left to his son to be held in trust until hes twentyfive his wife will have a life interest in the house after which it reverts to the boy which tells me that quarles never really put down roots here if he had hed have made certain mrs quarles was evicted interesting idea did you speak to the partner penrith former partner he parted with quarles more than a year ago and now has his own firm any hard feelings when they parted company none that i could see penrith told me that quarles wasnt pleased possibly because theyd made so much money as partners but he didnt fight the dissolution of the partnership thats disappointing to hear what about trouble with former clients he couldnt recall any padgett had been staring at the lump on rutledges forehead what happened to you a misstep rutledge answered shortly it must ache like the devil it did but rutledge wasnt giving him the satisfaction of admitting to it all right youre back in cambury have you been to question anyone or are you just taking the air i spoke to mr jones the baker and his wife they both swear jones never left his house on saturday night miss ohara was asleep with her cat i was just about to call on mrs newell the former cook at hallowfields i went to the police station constable horton told me you werent in padgett looked down as if studying the road under his feet yes well i went home you didnt tell me you were going to london i found out quite by chance i left in the night i wanted to be there before penrith went to his office and before mickelson returned from dover fair enough he turned to walk with rutledge im on my way to speak to stephenson at nemesis the bookseller a waste of timei dont think he could have managed the cage but then you never know if he were angry enough what he might carry off are you certain you found nothing in london to turn the inquiry in that direction not yet rutledge said early days padgett grunted come with me then well clear stephenson off our list rutledge went on with him but when they reached the bookshop the sign on the door read closed he never closes padgett said putting up his hand to shade his eyes as he peered into the dark shop celebrating quarless demise you think the sun hadnt reached the windows and the shelves for stephensons stock prevented what light there was from traveling too far into the interior no sign of him thats odd theres a girl who comes in when hes off searching for estate sales hamish said something in the back of rutledges mind padgett was on the point of turning away when a movement caught his eye ohthere he is tapping on the glass he put his face up against it to attract the mans attention then he said abruptly good godrutledge the tone of his voice was enough rutledge wheeled and pressed his face to the glass as well before shoving padgett aside and kicking open the door as it flew back the flimsy lock shattering padgett was ahead of him bursting into the shop beyond the desk in a small alcove where stephenson kept a thermos for his tea and a stock of wrapping paper the man was hanging from a rope attached to a hook in the ceiling where he had once run a cord to bring the lamp nearer the lamp was dangling beside him now and it was the swaying of the glass shade that padgett had glimpsed through the window glass as the bookseller jumped the odor of spilled lamp oil filled the small space for a mercy stephenson had not broken his neck in his fall but his face was suffused with blood and his hands were flailing as if to stop them from rescuing him the chair hed used had tipped over almost directly under him just out of reach rutledge turned it up shoved a stack of books on it and had it under stephensons feet in a matter of seconds catching first one and then the other and forcing them down to relieve the pressure on his neck his hands went on thrashing about in an effort to jerk away padgett had clambered up the shelves in the alcove pushing aside the rolls of wrapping paper and tipping over the thermos in his haste to reach the dangling man rutledge spied a knife used to cut the wrapping paper just as it spun to the floor and releasing one of stephensons ankles he reached up to hand it to padgett stephenson tried to kick him in the face with his free foot but rutledge caught it again just as a toe grazed the lump on his forehead he clamped the foot down hard his grip reflecting his anger the rope was heavy heavy enough to do the work of killing a man but rutledge had stephensons wriggling feet securely pinned while padgett cursed and sawed at the rope from his precarious perch the strands of hemp parted so suddenly that all three men fell to the floor in a tangle of limbs the books from the chair clattering around them rutledge fought his way out of the knot of hands and feet stretching across to lift the rope from stephensons neck a ring of red scraped flesh showed above his collar as stephenson clawed at it and gasped for breath the air whistling in his throat before he could actually breathe again damn you he whispered when he could muster enough breath to speak and after much effort gulping in air struggling to say something he managed to demand why didnt you let me finish itand save the cost of the hangman because you fool we want some answers first padgett shouted at him in furious relief you cant go doing the hangmans work and leave me to wonder if you were the killer or if someone else is still out there rutledge turned to the desk looking to see if there was a note but he found nothing his head was thundering again and hamish was busy in his mind where does he live rutledge asked padgett as they got to their feet above the shop leaving padgett to minister to the distraught man rutledge found the stairs and went up to the first floor it was mostly used for stock with a clutter of empty boxes wrapping paper a ladder and other odds and ends that had no other home after one swift glance rut ledge went on to the second floor there he found modest living quarters a bedroom and a sitting room a kitchen to one side on the walls were framed lithographs the only touch of color except for a red tablecloth in the kitchen there was no sign of a note so stephenson wasnt intending to confess but to leave doubts in all their minds just as padgett had accused him of doing hamish said but it doesna prove hes guilty rutledge hurried back down the stairs and found padgett trying to get stephenson to drink some tea from the mercifully undamaged thermos the man clenched his jaw his eyes closed his abrupt return to life leaving him shaken rutledge squatted beside padgett and when he looked up shook his head padgett nodded they waited for five minutes before questioning stephenson padgett said what in gods name did you think you were doing as the heavy flush faded from stephensons stillpuffy face rut ledge recognized him as the man hed seen reading a book in the hotel dining room the morning hed questioned hunter about quarles stephenson said in a strained voice i knew youd be coming when bertie told me about quarles being murdered i knew it was only a matter of time and when i saw you walking down the high street i couldnt face it any longer a confession rutledge waited grimly face what padgett demanded testily here drink this tea i can hardly hear you he pushed the cup aside i thought everyone knew its why i came back to cambury its why i named the shop nemesis well youre wrong i wanted to kill him you see but lacked the courage i hoped that if i came back here having to see him unable to hide one day id be able to do it he ran his hand through his thinning hair and went on bitterly you cant imagine what its like to want to kill someone it eats away at you until theres nothing of you left its like a hunger that cant be satisfied and in the end it destroys you too the shame of it is like a knife in your brain what had he done to you that you hated him rutledge asked stephenson moved restlessly his face turned away its none of your business it is now if you hadnt tried to hang yourself wed have done nothing more than question you now youre a suspect and a suspect has no secrets padgett said roughly not from the police his words were met with a stubborn silence finally padgett said very well ill see you to dr oneils surgery can you walk that far i dont intend to walk that far or anywhere else thats as may be but youll see the good doctor if i have to fetch a motorcar and drive you there myself fetch one rutledge replied we dont want to give the gossips more than needful with a grunt padgett went away to the police station rutledge could see the man before him sink into himself his face still red coughing racking him he refilled the cup with tea and ste phenson swallowed it painfully almost strangling on it they waited in silence the bookseller looking inward at something he couldnt face and rutledge listening to hamish in the back of his head when padgett came back stephenson stood up shakily a martyr ready to face the lions oh very well lets be done with it are you going to try this again rutledge asked gesturing toward the rope to what end stephenson replied wearily fear drove me to desperate measures youre here now it serves no purpose to die padgett led stephenson out the door and rutledge shut it firmly behind them the broken latch held just and rutledge left the sign reading closed there were a number of people on the street and they turned to stare as rutledge assisted stephenson into the vehicle a young woman rushed up asking whats wrong where are you taking him mr stephenson whats happened you look so ill stephenson unable to face her mumbled to rutledge my part time assistant miss ogden she was very frightened rutledge was suddenly reminded of elise for the women were about the same age yet the differences between the two were dramatic elise with her confidence her willingness to take on a marriage that would challenge her had the courage of her convictions if not the patience miss ogden was gripping her handbag so tightly that her knuckles were white and she was on the verge of tears looking from one man to the other for guidance she struck rut ledge as timid willing to serve perfectly happy to be buried among the dusty shelves of a bookstore and helpless in a crisis expecting others to take the first step and then reassure her were driving mr stephenson to dr oneils surgery he told her gently hell be fine in a day or two theres nothing to worry about could it be his heart she asked anxiously my grandfather died of problems with his heart please ought i to go with you or should i keep the shop open others were attracted by the fuss clustering across the street from the motorcar trying to hear what was being said halting as they came out of shops several women put their hands to their mouths their small children staring with round uncertain eyes as they sensed the apprehension gripping the adults two policemen appearing to take poor mr stephenson into custody rutledge could almost feel the rising tide of speculation rushing toward him on the heels of word that quarles was dead he answered miss ogden before padgett could put a word in mr stephenson had an accident and should see dr oneil but theres no danger of his dying we were lucky to find him in time perhaps we ought to leave the shop closed for today and let him rest he knew how to make his voice carry so that onlookers heard him as well she turned to stephenson for confirmation he nodded wretchedly with a long backward glance she stood aside to let them leave rutledge got into the rear seat with the bookseller swearing to himself padgett drove off without acknowledging the people on the street not interested in what they were thinking did you not consider that that woman would have been the one to find you if we hadnt rutledge demanded of stephenson it was an unconscionably selfish thing you did next time you want to kill yourself choose a more private place stephenson said i was wretchedi only wanted to die his voice had taken on a whine you dont know what i felt you cant judge me but rutledge did know what he felt disgusted with the man he tapped padgett on the shoulder let me out just there if you have no objection ill call on mrs newell as planned he tried to keep the revulsion he was feeling out of his voice go ahead ill be kept some time with this fool there was irritation in the inspectors voice as well as he pulled over to let rutledge step down he offered begrudging instructions on how to find the former cook from hallowfields and then was gone almost before rut ledge had swung the rear door shut rutledge watched them out of sight on their way to oneils surgery then set out for mrs newells small cottage hamish said yeve lost your temper twice now its yon blow to the head yell no feel better until ye gie it a rest rutledge ignored him though he knew it to be true he was just passing the greengrocers shop its awning stretched over the mornings offerings baskets of early vegetables and strawberries and asparagus a motorcar drew up beside him and rutledge turned to see who was there he found himself facetoface with charles archer seated behind a chauffeur one of the servants rut ledge had met in the hallowfields kitchen archers invalids chair was lashed to the boot in a special brace made for it my apologies i cant come down will you ride with me as far as the green yes of course rutledge got into the rear of the motorcar and nearly stopped short when he realized that there was no room for hamish to sit but that was foolishness he shut the door and turned to archer the man shook his head silence fell until the motorcar pulled to the verge next to the green there archer said to the chauffeur leave us for a few minutes will you a turn around the green should be sufficient when the man was out of earshot archer continued ive just come from doctor oneils surgery im told you haventer finished yet with harolds remains but i wanted to see the body for myself he refused to let me even though i was there to identify it in due course i havent told mrs quarles what i came to do she will insist on carrying out that duty herself but theres no need if youll forgive me for saying so mr archer she doesnt seem to be distressed over her husbands death i doubt youre sparing her except in your own mind she married the most eligible of men it was seen as a good match in spite of his background only she discovered too late that the facade didnt match the man i dont know what precipitated the break between them but she has said she had very good reasons for turning her back on him then why not a divorce to end the match once and for all i dont know it isnt money she has her own i think it was in a way to prevent him from marrying anyone else god knows why that mattered to her hamish noted hes verra plausible perhaps to prevent another woman suffering as she has done rutledge suggested thats too altruistic i love maybelle in spite of the fact that im her cousin id have married her myself if she hadnt met quarles while i was away in switzerland for some time my mother was ill and the mountain air had been recommended for her i stayed there six years watching her die when i came home it was to an invitation to a wedding and i couldnt talk her out of it you saw quarles dead i imagine you never knew him when he exerted that wretched ability to make people agree to whatever he wanted its what made him a successful investment banker remembering what heller had hinted rutledge said did any of his advice go wrong i mean very wrong not just an investment that didnt work as it had been promised to do he was damned astute that was his trademark nothing went wrong that he hadnt balanced in ones portfolio to take up the risk should the worst happen people were very pleased that was until cumberline cumberline hed seen the box with a label bearing that name in quarless study yes it was an adventure stock a south seas bubble sort of thing as it turned out do you remember cecil rhodess great concept of a cairo to cape town railway driven through the heart of africa the same sort of thing but here the railroad would run from dar es salaam to the congo river with goods coming by ship from the southern indian ocean to the east african coast carried by train overland to the congo and then put on ships again for the passage north it was expected to save the journey through the red sea and the mediterranean and was to bring out ivory and other goods from east africa as well zanzibar spices kenyan coffee wild animals for the zoos of the world and anything that expanded scientific knowledge labor would be cheap and using the river cut the costs of such a railway nearly in half on paper it was exotic and many men who had made money in the war were in search of new enterprises especially with tanganyika in our hands now i must have been in france while this was talked about it sounds feasible but then i dont know much about the congo other than that the belgians fought the germans from there as did britain in kenya how deep is the congo where a train could transfer goods ive no idea neither did the promoters or the investors it turned out to be a case of the sly fox being tricked by sharper wolves quarles had mentioned it to a few of his clients but for the most part didnt promote it and it was just as well there were only a few clients involved because the project collapsed gossip was soon claiming that hed chosen men he was happy to see fall that it was a matter of revenge and he knew all along that the project was doomed certainly an excellent way to make enemies rutledge agreed quarles went to ground here in cambury until the worst was over the odd thing is it was a nine days wonder his reputation for honesty prevailed and the general opinion was the men who complained were making him the scapegoat for their own poor judgment did any of those clients live here in cambury i have no way of knowing that but i should think that if one of the investors was out for revenge he wouldnt have waited all this time nearly two years i wonder did quarles manipulate this scheme did he for instance collect investment funds but never transfer them to cumber line knowing it was likely to fail rutledge had read parts of the treatise on africa in quarless bedchamber surely a man as astute as he was said to be could see through the promises made in it archer turned to look at him what a devious mind you have it wont be the first time that such a thing was done quarles has a partner one davis penrith i hardly think he could have perpetrated such a scheme without the knowledge of his partner and penrith is not the sort of man who could carry off such trickery even if harold could he came into the firm to lend respectability he has that kind of face and that kind of mind archer hesitated although it was soon after the cumberline fiasco that penrith went his own way interesting yes isnt it but for penrith id almost be willing to believe in your suggestion i dont particularly like the man for reasons of my own still quarles has been scrupulously carefula man of his background has to be thats the way the class system works the chauffeur had made his circuit of the pond and now stood some distance away awaiting instructions the high street was busy people taking advantage of a fine afternoon from time to time they gathered in clusters heads together the likely topic of gossip today was harold quarles and his untimely death or possibly the news of stephenson driving off with padgett was already making the rounds a number of people cast quick glances at charles archer seated in his motorcar deep in conversation with the man from london speculation would feed on that as well as rutledge knew he made to open his door but archer said eryou will have noted the arrangements at hallowfields i wasnt cuckolding harold you know im no longer able to do such a thing but i would have if i could ive found that being with someone you love whatever the arrangement is better than being alone i sank my pride long ago in exchange for her company you neednt have told me this i read your expression when you saw us together i want you to understand that what lies between mrs quarles and myself didnt lead to murder harolds death wont change our arrangement in any way she wont marry me im honest enough to accept that why not because she knows that pity is the last thing i could tolerate as it is we are friends and it is easier to accept pity from a friend not from a lover thank you for being honest i will not ask where you were late saturday night but i must ask if you can tell me with certainty that your invalid chair was in your sight for the entire evening and into the night archer considered rutledge youre saying someone moved the body he wouldnt have been a light burden rutledge said yes the full account of the nightmarish hanging in the tithe barn would be out soon enough for what its worth i give you my word that to my knowledge the chair never left my bedside rutledge got down and as he closed the door archer signaled to his driver as the motorcar moved on toward hallowfields rutledge stood on the street looking after him hamish said do ye believe him time will tell but he made his point that neither mrs quarles nor her lover had any need to murder her husband now the question is why to help usor to hinder the investigation a boy came running up pink with exertion and hope a message for you sir surprised rutledge put out his hand for it the boy snatched the sheet of paper out of reach mr padgett says youd give me ten pence for it rutledge found ten pence and dropped it into the boys hand the crumpled sheet was given to him and then the boy was off racing down the high street the message read im about to speak to mrs newell care to join me rutledge swore turned on his heel and went back to the police station where padgett was on the point of setting out im surprised you got my note i saw you hobnobbing with archer when youd been heading for mrs newells cottage anything interesting come of it the conversation with archer i mean the suggestion was that rutledge had lied to the local inspector hed gone to the surgery to offer to identify the body oneil put him off now dr oneil didnt tell me that did archer ask you to arrange for him to see quarles they were walking down the high street at the next corner padgett turned left onto button row it was a narrow street with houses abutting directly onto it not at all i dont think he was eager to do his duty but he wished to spare mrs quarles he also wanted me to understand his relationship with mrs quarles and did you its unusual but clearly acceptable to all parties thats the point isnt it he went to the surgery to protect mrs quarles if you want my view of it she could have struck her husband from behind then finished the job when he was out of his senses it would be like her not to leave the body there a simple murder but to make a fool of him in death could she have dealt with that apparatus on her own given time to get the job done yes if you let the pulleys work for you you can lift anyones weight thats the whole point of it to make the angel fly without dropping her on top of the creche scene he smiled though id have given much to see that a time or two depending on who flew as the angel that year the question is would she have had the stomach to touch her husbands corpse as she put him into the harness if she hated him enough she might have hamish said he doesna like yon dead man and he doesna like yon widow ye must ask him why until quarles and his wife came to cambury there was no one to make him feel inferior rutledge answered silently they werent born here he didnt like looking up to them and at a guess both of them expected it hamish grunted as if unsatisfied rutledge changed the subject how is stephenson oneil says hell be in pain for several days the muscles in his neck got an almighty yank when he kicked the chair away by the time we reached the surgery he was complaining something fierce dr oneil is keeping him for observation but i dont think stephenson will be eager to try his luck a second time at least not with a rope they were coming up to a small whitewashed cottage in a row of similar cottages this one was distinguished by the thatch that beetled over the entrance as if trying to overwhelm it in the sunny doorway sat a plump woman of late middle age her fair hair streaked with white she was making a basket from pollarded river willows weaving the strands with quick knowing fingers she looked up squinting against the sun inspector she said in greeting when she recognized padgett good afternoon mrs newell i see youve nearly finished that one aye its for rector for his marketing you do fine work rutledge said looking at the rounds of tightly woven willow behind her in the entry he could see another basket ready for work this one square the top edge defined and the tall strands of willow that would be the sides almost sweeping the rooms low ceiling the sleeves of mrs newells dress rolled up past the elbows exposed strong arms and her large hands handling the whippy willow as if it were fine embroidery thread never faltered even when she looked away from them where do you get your materials i pay old neville to bring me bundles when he and his son go to fetch the reeds for their thatching over by sedgemoor these he brought me a fortnight ago are some of the best ive seen my mother made baskets lovely ones that the ladies liked for bringing cut flowers in from the gardens its how i earn my bread these days and who might you be sir the man from london come to find out who killed poor mr quarles bertie and his milk run had been busy yes my name is rutledge im an inspector at scotland yard she studied him still squinting and then nodded ive never seen anyone from scotland yard before but then mr quarles was an important man in london and he let the staff know it every chance he got a ginger cat came to the door rubbing against the frame eyeing them suspiciously after a moment he turned back inside and disappeared can you think of anyone who might have wished to see mr quar les dead rutledge went on she laughed a grim laugh with no humor in it he could charm the birds out of the trees she said if he was of a mind to but he had a mean streak in him and he rubbed a good many people the wrong way when he didnt care about them sometimes of a purpose if you wasnt important enough or rich enough or powerful enough you felt the rough side of his tongue rubbed them the wrong way enough to make them want to kill him youll have to ask them wont you padgett took up the questioning you worked at hallowfields for a good many years was there anyone among the staff or at the home farm who had a grievance against mr quarles she glanced up from her work staring at him shrewdly what you want to know is could i have killed him back then when he let me go yes i could have taken my cleaver to him for the things he said about me and about my cooking the tongue on that man would turn a bishop gray im a good cook mr rutledge and didnt deserve to be sacked without a reference where was i to find new employment it was a cruel thing to do for no reason more than his temper and ive paid for it for weeks i thought about what id like to do to him from hanging him from the meat hook to drowning him in the washingup tub but i never touched him i didnt relish hanging for the likes of harold quarles perhaps someone else in the household believed it was worth the risk how did they get on with the man i cant see mrs downing touching him neither however provoked she is shes all bluster when it comes to trouble besides shes mrs quarless creature would she kill for her mistress mrs newell shook her head she could hardly bear to see me kill a chicken what about mr masters at the home farm they had words from time to time no doubt of it and ive heard mr masters curse mr quarles something fierce when he thought no one was in hearing theres many a house like hallowfields that would like to hire him away from mr quarles but he stays in spite of the wrangling why because nine days out of the ten hes on his own with no one looking over his shoulder and he can do as he pleases mrs quarles herself padgett asked next i doubt she would dirty her hands with him i understand there was no love lost between the two of them rutledge put in but it wasnt murderous if you follow me it was a cold hate that not a hot one id put my money she said warming to the theme on mr jones the baker quarles was after his daughter such a pretty girl raven dark hair and green eyes and only sixteen when quarles spotted her on the street he gave her no peace and offered her the moon ill be bound for one night her pa sent her to wales out of reach and not before times i heard because mr quarles offered to take the girl to london and set her up in style i think shed have run off with him then if her pa hadnt got wind of it this was a richly embroidered version of the story very different from what mr jones or mrs jones had claimed mrs newells fingers were twisting the willow strands viciously as she spoke and rutledge could see how strongly she still felt whatever she was willing to admit to he was probably old enough to be her father rutledge pointed out ah but lust doesnt count itself in years and what young pretty thing in a town like cambury wouldnt see stars when she pictured herself in a fine london house with a large allowance all her own how did mr jones discover what was happening it was miss ohara who put him wise she overheard something in the post office that concerned her and despite not caring for making herself the center of attention again she went to the baker it seems mr quarles had asked the girl for a decision by weeks end hamish was asking if shed told the unvarnished truth or seen her chance to get her own back on quarles even after he was dead or because he was a near run thing rutledge agreed with mrs newell but if mr jones was angry enough to kill quarles why not there and then were none of us eager to hang mr rutledge theres some say that vengeance is a dish better taken cold she spoke with quiet dignity yes i see your point anyone else who might have quarreled with the dead man been cheated by him believed hed seduced a wife padgett asked thats for you to discover isnt it i told you what i thought gossip is always rampant with the likes of harold quarles but gossip doesnt always end in murder nor is gossip always true rutledge said what do you know about mr brunswick the organist at st martins her eyes narrowed what of him his name came up in another context oh yes then let that other context of yours tell you what you want to know ive nothing to say against mr brunswick they spoke to her for another five minutes but to no avail and rutledge found it frustrating that she was so reluctant to talk she knew both the household at hallowfields and her neighbors in cam bury but cooks were an independent lot master of their domains often arbiters of staff matters and even though she had been shown the door and was now reduced to making baskets mrs newell kept her opinions to herself it had been ingrained in her to keep the secrets of a household whatever her feelings toward quarles old habits die hard as they walked away rutledge said dryly as a rule people rush to deny they are capable of murder here everyoneincluding yourselfadmits to having a reason to commit murder refreshing isnt it padgett commented with relish if we find the murderer half the village will be up in arms to protect him or her very likely but im beginning to think that youve encouraged one another in this pastime of disparaging quarles to the point that someone finally decided to do something about it or to put it another way found himself or herself faced with a tempting opportunity that seemed foolproof and took advantage of it for the public good but padgetts humor was forced this time after a moment he went on youve spoken to jones and his wife anything there to support mrs newells suggestion i dont know he swears he was prepared to kill quarles and then remembered that he was the sole breadwinner of a large family so far he has the strongest motive if quarles had meddled with his daughter but both of gwyneths parents deny that anything happened to protect gwyneth or is it true what id really like to know is what triggered the actual killing why have old grievances all at once erupted into murder how does one measure hate i wonder as they turned into the high street again a woman was coming toward them walking her little dog on a lead and rutledge remembered what had happened the night before when hed seen a dog in the middle of the road and the farmer claimed hed seen nothing of the sort but had drifted to sleep just before he reached the bend he said to padgett youve told me you heard a dog barking and went to investigate but so far we havent found a dog that was running loose that night are you certain it was a dog and not a fox padgett caught off guard said i told you it was a dog theres the end of it he was short unwilling to consider another possibility hamish said ill gie ye a hundred pounds hes lying but rutledge wasnt ready to confront padgett he let the subject go it was late the sun low in the western sky his head was thundering and hed had no luncheon lets call it a day he said as they approached the unicorn suit yourself padgett said as if rutledge was failing in his duty i wonder you didnt call on a few of quarless clients while you were in london to get the feel of the man in his own den at a guess many of them dont live in london when weve found evidence pointing in that direction well go back and have a look have you discovered where quarles went to dine on saturday i decided to put my men to asking if strangers were seen about the village on saturday so far no ones noticed anyone they didnt know by sight he admitted grudgingly that simply means whoever was here wisely stayed out of sight i wonder if heshewas waiting in the gatehouse cottage for quarles to return whoever it was couldnt be seen from the house or the farm but he could watch the road not if quarles returned by the main gate to hallowfields but he didnt come back by the main gate why would he use the home farm lane padgett was smiling perhaps he heard the dog i heard they were sparring taking each others measure pointing out each others flaws neither giving an inch because they had more or less rubbed each other the wrong way from the start rutledge recognized it for what it was but he didnt think padgett did hamish said aye but watch your back rutledge bade him a good evening and went up the steps into the hotel padgett still standing in the street watched him go with an unreadable expression on his face it was a long night rutledges head was still aching and he was unable to sleep tired as he was hamish awake and in a surly mood haunted his mind until at one point rutledge got up and sat by the window for a time trying to shut out that persistent familiar voice still hamish gave him no peace first the war then the drive to london then back to the war again before shifting the theme to meredith channing that brought rutledge up out of numbed silence i canna think why she seeks you out rutledge said you dont know what youre talking about oh aye she kens yere no comfortable when shes there but she doesna avoid ye i dont think she knew id be at the wedding i didnt expect to see her there yon bride stayed with her when she went to london yere a fool if ye believe she didna tell the lass that maitland chose ye for his grooms man all right what was she to do beg out of the wedding hamish chuckled would ye ha begged off if maitland had told ye she was coming there was no answer to that he would have had to explain why and he couldnt and it would have aroused edgars suspicions why did ye no ask someone about her since everyone knew her hed been too busy struggling with his fear of what shed see in his mind whatever she said about her ability to read thoughts mocking it as a parlor game to entertain friends he knew too well that she could read his he could feel it or ye didna want to know and edgar maitland had tried to stir rutledges interest in that direction it had been the perfect opportunity to ask her history instead hed brushed off the suggestion that they were suited to each other unsettled and embarrassed shes no sae bonny as the irish lass rutledge swore how did hamish expect him to answer that and then realized that he neednt answer at all he tried to shut the voice out of his mind but it was nearly impossible to ignore it finally as the church clock struck four he drifted into sleep and hamish of necessity was silent morning found the lump on his forehead a variety of shades of blue and purple but the dizziness and the throbbing had gone he shaved dressed and went down to breakfast discovering to his surprise that it was close to nine oclock as he ate he tried to piece together the parts of the puzzle facing him who could have killed harold quarles someone in london or someone here in cambury hamish badtempered this morning reminded him that he hadnt gone to see the organist brunswick he finished his breakfast and went to remedy that shortcoming padgett was in the police station but declined accompanying him there was a housebreaking last night and i must deal with it i know the culprits and this is the first serious trouble theyve been in if i dont stop them now theyll find themselves in prison and wholl run the farm then their mothers at her wits end theyre good lads but theres no hand at the helm so to speak their fathers drunk day in and day out hamish said it could wait he doesna wish to come wi ye it was probably true rutledge left the police station and soon found himself at the small stone house close by the church where padgett had told him that michael brunswick lived brunswick himself answered rutledges knock they stared at each other in silence something in his face told rutledge hed been waiting for it for some time rutledge introduced himself and showed his identification but brunswick brushed it aside i know who you are he stepped back to allow rutledge to enter there was a piano taking pride of place by the window of the sitting room and books of music were scattered about untidy the room was but it had been well dusted and cleaned as if keeping up standards rutledge remembered that this mans wife had died a suicide then you know what im here to ask where were you saturday night at home asleep i dont go out of an evening since my wifes death ive been told that youre among the people i should speak to in regard to what happened to harold quarles it was not a direct accusation but close enough rutledge hoped to elicit a response it wasnt what hed expected hes dead thats all that matters to me then im forced to include you among my list of suspects i think you knew that the first time i saw you what id like to know is why when only a handful of people were aware of why i was here rutledge considered hima tall man fair hair circles under the eyes that spoke of sleepless nights his fingers were long and flexible trained to play an instrument and he was strong enough to move a body if he had to brunswick said include me if you like it makes no difference to me why should you be glad a mans been murdered most people are repelled by the thought of that you know as well as i do that harold quarles was a man who made his own fate he didnt give a damn about anyone as far as i know and in the end that invites what happened to him saturday night you cant walk around oblivious to the pain you cause and expect no one to retaliate theres always a line that one crosses at his own risk beyond it ordinary rules dont apply whatever most people might feel whatever they dream about doing in the dark of night when they cant sleep in the daylight there are obstacles they fear for their souls they fear the hangman they fear for those they love and harold quarles would still be alive brunswick laughed ive lost god ive lost those i loved why should i fear the hangman when he comes to put the rope around my neck i dont have much to live for if you didnt kill the man who did someone who is fool enough to believe he wont be caught inspector padgett brought the yard in didnt he why do you think he did that hamish said aye its a guid question to avoid having to arrest someone he knew rutledge replied and was pleased to see that his answer had taken brunswick aback you think so hes had as much reason to hate as any of the rest of us if you know what that reason is you must tell me brunswick shook his head youre the policeman youll have to ask him then tell me instead about your wifes death brunswicks color rose into his face shes dead leave her in peace i cant he could hear hamish objecting but he pressed on im told she drowned herself did she leave a note any explanation of why she took her own life there was no note nothing leave it alone i tell you do you think harold quarles played any part in her decision why should he have because you hate him its the only conclusion i can draw mr brunswick and the only reason i can think of for mrs quarles to include your name in her list of those who might have killed her husband that shook him to the core did she also tell you that my wife spent weeks at hallowfields working for her bastard of a husband perhaps its time you gave me your side of the story brunswick was up pacing the floor she went there against my wishes she said we needed the money hed left london rusticating he said hiding from angry clients if you want my view he worked in his study at the house and after a time he let it be known he needed someone to type letters for him she applied and he took her on two hours in the morning and three in the afternoon one week after she left hallowfields she was dead what would you make of it if shed been your wife what sort of mood was she in that week mood how should i know she wouldnt talk to me she wouldnt tell me what had happened nor would she explain why she sat here and cried that first morning she didnt go back to him and so you suspected the worst wouldnt you she couldnt live here in this cottage after spending her days at hallowfields she couldnt accept me after shed had her head turned by that bastard do you think i didnt guess that something had happened shed gone to dr oneil that morning first thing she must have thought she was pregnant wed tried we couldnt have a child thats why she wanted the money to go to a specialist in london and find out why after she was dead i went to dr oneil myself and demanded to know what hed said to her i asked him straight out if she was pregnant and he said she wasnt that hed wanted her to talk to someone in glastonbury it was an ovarian tumor he said but the truth was he didnt want me to know what my wife couldnt tell methat the child she was carrying wasnt mine he didnt want me to live with that for the rest of my life but i knew i knew he turned to face the wall his back to rutledge and his head raised to stare unseeingly at the ceiling get out of here ive never told anyone not even rector what i just told you i dont know why id confess my shame to a stranger when i couldnt even confess to god hamish said as rutledge shut the door behind him do ye believe him rutledge replied more to the point i think he believes what he told me and thats the best reason ive heard so far for murdering harold quarles and then hanging his body in that infernal contraption it goes a long way toward explaining why simply killing quarles wasnt enough he walked back to the hotel to his motorcar and drove out to hallowfields mrs quarles agreed to receive him though she kept him waiting for nearly a quarter of an hour before downing came to take him to the same room where hed met her the first time and she was alone are you here to tell me youve found the man who killed my husband not at present ive come to ask you if you know what the relationship was between your husband and mrs brunswick hazel brunswick she came to do clerical work for him there was no relationship as you call it her husband believes there must have been only because of harolds reputation i can assure you there was nothing between them why should he make an exception of hazel brunswick if he didnt draw the line at seducing a girl of sixteen gwyneth jones he wouldnt have touched her either he wanted me to believe he wouldhe wanted me to be torn apart by jealousy and so shamed by his behavior id do anything to stop it and then when i came crawling back hed have the satisfaction of rejecting me but you see i was married to him all those years i learned to see through him once the scales fell from my eyes i realized what sort of man he was and how he punished people who got in his way davis penrith knows that as well but he blindsblindedhimself to what harolds true nature was he didnt want to see or perhaps was afraid to see afraid to recognize the man hed worked with for so long gwyneths father was worried enough to send her away to wales believe me if harold had been seriously interested in gwyneth sending her to wales wouldnt have stopped him from following her my husband got what he wanted most of the time that too was in his nature and in the process he tormented a girl and her father a woman and her husband and who knows what other victims was there nothing you could do to stop the game you havent understood my husband she had kept him standing as if he were a tradesman how do you move someone like that ask samuel heller not me though i doubt very much that harold had a soul i know for a fact that he didnt have a conscience are you aware that sometimes he entertained someone in the gatehouse by the home farm lane ive been told that sometimes the lamps burned there late into the night but no one so far as i know had the courage to find out what he did there it was talked about you see there was speculation and when i went into cambury i had no way of knowing whether the girl who waited on me in a shop or in the hotel dining room was one of his conquests or not but if you look for the truth youll probably discover he never brought anyone there betty might tell you she cleaned those rooms still the gossips of cambury were agog with curiosity and so for the most part i never went into town at all rutledge wondered if she really knew what her husband was doingwhether she had simply convinced herself of his spite or used it to excuse her relationship with charles archer physically or emotionally a tie was there why do you hate your husband so much he asked is this because of charles archer did you marry the wrong man or were you late in discovering the sort of man your husband was i was in love with charles archer and he with me before he took his mother to switzerland for treatment of her tuberculosis theyd told him she was dying but she lived six more years i never saw him during those six years he never left her side he cared for her and he stayed with her to the end while he was away i met harold quarles and he swept me off my feet he was attentive charming caring and he was there there were flowers and gifts invitations to dinner invitations to the opera invitations to go riding he was just a clerk at the house where he was employed but already he was making a reputation for himselfa reputation of another sort as a man who could manage money and was astute in business dealings and he asked me to believe in him and marry him and he would see that i continued to live as well as i did then if not better i thought i was in love with him and i knew i was lonely i could hardly recall what charles looked likecertainly not the man in the photograph hed given me before leaving for switzerland i told myself he was never coming back that the doctors had been wrong before and that his mother would live forever and id be a spinster by that time and so i married and the first years were wonderful harold kept every promise hed made me and i was happy she broke off why in gods name am i telling you all this its none of your business what went wrong he asked gently what changed your feelings i will never tell you that you can hang me if you like but i will never tell you i have a son and i would rather face death than break his heart have you told him that his father is dead she turned away and walked to the window no i havent found the words im leaving tomorrow to bring him home how did you explain charles archer to your son she wheeled to face him again i didnt have to theres nothing to tell except that hes an old friend and i have brought him here to heal you were lovers before charles archer was wounded at mons her face flamed to the roots of her hair how dare you its there in the way you put your hand on his shoulder for strength and for courage he said his voice gentle is your child harolds son or charless get out i must ask that you see because it could explain why you killed your husband hes old enough your son to hear rumors to make guesses to read into your look or your touch when youre with archer more than you expect him to see get out she said again and reached for the bell pull almost yanking at it im sorry if ive upset you but for your own protection you need to tell me the truth your son has lost one parent she strode to the door opening it herself rutledge said im sorry again and left the room passing her so close that he could smell the fear on her but not he thought as he went to find mrs downing fear for herself betty was in the laundry room sorting sheets her long face flushed with the work her eyes red from crying she made a move when she first saw him coming through the door like a startled child who didnt know where to turn and couldnt find its mothers skirts and then she straightened bracing herself waiting for him to speak to her rutledge said im here to ask a few more questions thats all tell me about the cottage at the end of the home farm lane do you know who came there with harold quarles i never asked it was none of my business she said again were there women who stayed therefor an evening for the night i dont know you must you kept the rooms clean and the beds there would be signs i made an effort not to pry i did my duty and saw only what i wanted to see pushing at her sleeves she went back to work her arms though thin were strong the bones large hes dead betty i know he is and where am i to go now without him to care for whats ahead for me how will i manage i was safe here and i was needed where will i find that again he was startled by her vehemence mrs quarles will keep you on or give you a reference if you wish to leave it was not his place to tell her that quarles had taken care of her future you dont understand im tired i cant go on doing the heavy work a maid of my age is given like these sheets i never had to work this hard when mr quarles was alive there was only his rooms and the gatehouse and he wasnt here all that much now im told to help out generally earn my keep hed promised me the gatehouse but they wont let me have it i know they wont and im at my wits end for knowing what im to do indeed she looked tired and ill if mr quarles promised to look after you he will have done and there is no one who can change what he decided to give you she laughed a dry hard sound that seemed to carry all her pain with it ill believe it when i see it do you fear this family so much she looked surprised fear them no of course not its just that i have come to trust mr quarles and he was youngi thought the years ahead would be safe and ive never been truly safe before not in my whole life you dont know what thats like and theres nothing left now he did understand whatever shed suffered before coming to hallowfields shed been given a taste of a different life now she believed that it was being stripped from her and she couldnt find the strength to cope alone quarles had used her to keep his secrets and she still did the bequest would serve to seal her lips for the remainder of her life it was a large sum unexpectedly large for a servant but it would buy silence that was what it had been designed to do there was nothing more rutledge could learn from her not now when her worries went beyond catching a murderer but he asked one last question you knew mr quarles better than most of the staff people tell me hes vicious hes kind hes callous hes cruel hes respected in london and hated in cambury he came from a hard world hed had to make his way where he was treated like the workingclass man he was expected to touch his cap to his betters step out of their way and do what he was told until youve known that you dont know what its like he knew what they thought about him what was said behind his back but he was blessed with a good mind and he prospered in spite of the past and he was proud of that to keep it he told me hed had to fight from the day he left yorkshire and hed had to use whatever tools came to hand not being born with them to start with not six months ago he said to me theres no one to save the likes of you and me betty except ourselves you remember that and youll do fine but she hadnt gained strength from the man shed used his instead rutledge thanked her and left her to the folding of the heavy sheets her back bent to the labor her eyes concentrating on keeping the folds sharp and smooth sprinkling lavender among the folds her rough hands gentle she looked into a stark future and found it frightening r utledge went back to the gatehouse and walked through the wood to the tithe barn nodding to the constable on duty as he opened the door and went inside it was different in the daylight empty a smoky light spilling in from the door the rafters ghostly shapes over his head the barn was as long and as tall as he remembered and he could almost see harold quarles above him the outspread arms the whitefeathered wings its no something you forget hamish said quietly but his voice seemed to echo in the vastness rutledge walked the length of the barn and back again why go to the trouble to put quarles in that abominable harness and lift him to the rafters to hide the body until someone thought to look for him here not in cambury where hed gone to dine to make a mockery of the man who seemed to care so little for the feelings of others or to show the world that even harold quarles was vulnerable if mrs quarles had killed her husband would she have done this not he thought if she cared for her son murder quarles yes ridding herself of him without the shame of a divorce or the truth coming out in a courtroom but making a spectacle of his death rutledge had come to understand her pride and now he could see that she had nothing to gain by such a step hamish said yon organist might have wanted to make a spectacle o him rutledge could readily believe that would inspector padgett try to cover up brunswicks guilt because the man seemed to know more about the inspector than was good for him an interesting possibility padgett hadnt been eager to interview the man rutledge walked the length of the barn again trying to feel something here to sense an angry mood or a cold hatred but the barn had nothing to say to him the silence of the past lay heavily around him smothering the present harold quarles was only a fragment of this great barns history and although his end here was appalling it would be forgotten long before the roof fell in here and the rafters that had held the angel up cracked with age a sound behind him made him whirl but there was nothing to be seen he stood there without moving listening with such intensity that he heard the sound again a mouse moved out of the shelter of one of the columns that supported the roof whiskers twitching as his dark unfathomable eyes examined the twolegged intruder he sat up on his hind legs and waited for rutledge to make the first move but when the man from london stood his ground without a threatening sound or motion the mouse ran lightly to the wall of the barn and disappeared into the shadows had he been here when a murderer had brought harold quarles into the barn and went to take the apparatus out of its box what had he seen hamish said it was no a stranger and that was the key to this barn in the mist that night a stranger would have had trouble seeing it at all if he hadnt known it was here rutledge himself hadnt until he was almost on it and even if the killer had wanted to make certain the body wasnt found straightaway the cottage was closer than the barn in here in the darknesseven with a torchit would have taken time to pull the ropes and pulleys out of their chest and lay them out when quarles could just as well have been stowed behind one of the trestle tables or a section of the stable roof no matter how much had been written about the christmas pageant understanding the mechanismeven if someone knew it was therewas another matter hamish said better to put the body in yon chest exactly hed spoke aloud and the constable at the door peered in rutledge said sorry bad habit talking to myself the man grinned and shut the door again whatever padgett might want him to believe rutledge now had evidence of a sort that the murderer must be here in cambury the journey to london to spike mickelsons guns had probably been an act of vanity nothing more rutledge found padgett in the police station completing his report on the housebreaking even before he reached the office he could hear the ragged tap of typewriter keys and an occasional grunt as something went wrong padgett looked up his ill temper aggravated by the interruption rutledge said not waiting for padgetts good humor to return you wouldnt accompany me when i went to see brunswick it would have been wise if you had he believes you had something to do with harold quarless death he told me to ask you why you hated the man padgetts reaction was explosive he swore roundly his face red with anger while you were exchanging confidences did he tell you that at the time i suspected him of drowning his wife and ive yet to be satisfied that her death was a suicide theres no love lost between us he believes she was quarless lover and that the child she might have been carrying at the time of her death wasnt her husbands reason enough for murder well she wasnt carrying a child at the time of her death not according to oneil but she did have a tumor the size of a small cabbage brunswick believes the doctor is covering up the truth they had words just before the funeral of course hebrunswick wouldnt care to think hed killed his wife for no reason other than his own jealousy could she have borne children if the tumor was safely removed probably not she wasnt drowned at home mind you but in one of those streams on sedgemoor a dreary place to die a dreary battlefield in its day for that matter she ought to have survivedif shed changed her mind she might have saved herself the stream wasnt all that deep the only reason i didnt take brunswick into custody was that simple fact but ive kept an eye on him since then what was your quarrel with the victim you might as well tell me rutledge said it will have to come out sooner or later he could see the defiance in padgetts eyes as he surged to his feet and leaned forward over the desk his knuckles white as they pressed against the scarred wooden top i see no reason to tell you anything im a policeman for gods sake do you think i killed the man if so say that to my face dont go hinting about like a simpering woman rutledge held on to his own temper knowing hed provoked the anger turned against him and that the angry man across from him hoped to use it to deflect him from his probing padgett ill speak to the chief constable if i have to and dont push your luck with me my temper can be as short as yours ware hamish warned rutledge hes likely to come across yon desk and throttle ye but at mention of the chief constable padgett got himself under control with a visible effort leave the chief constable out of this then talk to me im not a suspect i dont have to give you my private life to paw over rutledge was on the point of taking inspector padgett into custody and letting him think his position over in one of his own cells but hamish warned ye ken it will only set him against you more theres shame here and it willna come out whatever ye threaten rutledge took a deep breath padgett you found the body theres no other witness you could have hauled quarles up to the beams yourself as a fitting revenge for whatever he did to you it doesnt look good padgett started for the door intending to push rutledge aside if thats what you want to believe its what the killers barrister will claim to throw doubt on the evidence we collect for trial and then whatever youre hiding becomes a matter of public record forever after i shouldnt have to tell you this think about it man padgett stopped in midstride look set your feelings about quarles aside and consider the case clearly if it were mrs quarlesor jones the bakeror even brunswick who had found the mans body by the side of the road and you knew the history of their relationship with the victim that person would be suspect almost at once an unexpected confrontation a temper lost an opportunity taken youd have no choice but to investigate the circumstances im an honest man a good policeman padgetts voice was tight his face still flushed with his fury no doubt both of these are true do they put you above suspicion you may not be guiltybut you must be cleared any question of doubt put aside so that you dont cast a shadow over the inquiry are you going to take me off the case i dont see how we can work together now im not removing you but you must give me your word you didnt kill quarles what good is my word if im a murderer do you think id stop at perjuring myself to escape the hangman your word as a policeman it was the right thing to say padgetts ruffled feathers relaxed and he swore as god is my witness then i give you my word as a policeman hamish said to rutledge aye all well and good but he didna swear to stop interfering hey went on to dr oneils surgery to interview stephenson i was looking for the truth not trust rutledge answered him grimly the doctor greeted them and if he saw any stiffness in their manner he said nothing about it taking them to the narrow examination room where hed put the bookseller he added hes recovering well enough physically if not emotionally but thats not unexpected given the circumstances be brief if you want to question him before we go in rutledge said can you tell me if michael brunswicks wife was diagnosed with a tumor or was she pregnant at the time of her death oneil sighed brunswick has convinced himself that i lied to him i didnt if he killed quarles hell be coming for me next hes one of those men who can picture his wife in another mans arms if she so much as smiles at a poor devil in the post office or the greengrocers the fact is i believed it to be ovarian from the start because shed had no symptoms until the tumor was well advanced and i told her as much warning her to prepare herself i did prescribe tests to confirm my diagnosis her mother had died of the same condition sadly she knew what to expect and if by some miracle of surgery she survived the cancer there would be no children how did you do the tests from what rutledge had seen of the small surgery he was certain dr oneil didnt have the facilities for them here i sent her to bath to a specialist there quarles lent her his motorcar and his chauffeur she was in her last week of employment at hallowfields the day she came to me and when she told quarles she was glad she was nearly finished because it appeared that she was ill he arranged to send her it was a kind gesture but mrs brunswick made me promise to say nothing to her husband about thatshe said he would disapprove rutledge thought it could have been that brunswick found out but that wasnt the murder hed come to cambury to solve why the interest in mrs brunswick oneil asked clearly busy putting two and two together it could offer a reason for her husband to kill quarles padgett answered following rutledges thinking early days no stone unturned and all that ive finished with quarles by the bye and he did eat dinner the night he was killed then let his wife bury him padgett said the sooner the better oneil looked at rutledge for confirmation and he nodded the doctor opened the door to stephensons room the man looked up sighed wearily and visibly braced himself for what was to come rutledge said im happy to see you feeling a little better theres better and better stephenson said without spirit why kill yourself if youve done nothing wrong rutledge asked its a waste of life my reasons seemed to be sound enough at the time he broke off and turned his face toward the wall tears welling in his eyes do we clap you in gaol as soon as dr oneil here gives us leave padgett demanded irritably you as much as confessed that you wanted to kill harold quarles did you or didnt you you cant have it both ways but he can rutledge put in quietly if he paid someone to do what he couldnt face himself that would be betrayal i wouldnt stoop to that by rights he went on an eye for an eye i should have killed his son i couldnt do that either if you didnt kill quarles why were you so certain we were about to take you into custody for this murder certain enough to kill yourself before we could he added in a level voice no hint of curiosity or prying merely trying to clarify just what did quarles have to do with your son i dont want to talk about it im still shaken hardly able to believe im still alive i expected never to see this world again i thought i was well out of it his face was hidden his voice rough with tears for gods sake go away and leave me alone in the end youll have to clear yourself by telling us the truth i dont have to do anything of the sort you cant threaten me with hanging i know how the noose feels about my neck and what its like to plunge into the dark the next time will be easier and it wont be interrupted i really dont give a damn if you want to die so badly padgett reminded him youd have to convince us first that you deserve to what youre feeling now is selfpity not evidence do you think youre the only man whos lost a son i can find you a dozen such fathers without leaving the parish he was my only childmy wife is dead i never thought id be grateful for that until the day the news came rutledge shook his head warning padgett to leave it as he was about to reply reluctantly padgett turned and walked away shutting the door behind him rutledge said to stephenson consider your situation if you want to claim this crime even though you didnt commit it go ahead thats not vengeance its martyrdom and in the final moments before the trapdoor drops youll find martyrdom isnt a satisfactory substitute for what youd promised your son to do not waiting for a reply rutledge turned on his heel leaving dr oneil alone with his patient as they walked down the passage he could hear stephensons voice i loved him more than anything anything outside padgett said why did he call that bookstore of his nemesis if he wasnt waiting for his chance to kill quarles whatever lay between them it must have been a fearsome hate on stephensons part they had just reached the high street when the boot boy from the unicorn caught up with them youre wanted sir if youre inspector rutledge theres a telephone call for you at the hotel i was told at the station youd be with inspector padgett and who would be calling the inspector padgett asked inquisi tiveness alive in his face london rutledge answered who else he handed the flushed boot boy a coin nodded to padgett and walked away toward the unicorn hunter was waiting for him at reception and escorted him to the telephone room they promised to call again in fifteen minutes he took out his pocket watch thats half a minute from now on the heels of his words they could hear the telephone bell and rutledge went to answer it it was sergeant gibson who asked him in a formal tone to wait for chief superintendent bowles to be summoned the tone of voice as always with gibson reflected the mood of the yard bowles when he took up the receiver shouted you there rutledge yes sir im here whats this i hear about your questioning mr penrith and speaking to hurley and sons mickelson was back in london and complaining it was in the course of i dont give a fig for your excuses i sent you to cambury to find a murderer and ive had no report of your progress davis penrith has been on the horn to the yard expressing his concern wanting to know if weve taken anyone into custody have we not yet i reported the death of his former partner to penrith and asked who among the victims business connections might have a grievance against the man dead i asked hurley and sons who benefited from the will its the usual procedure you gave me no instructions not to follow up in london in the background rutledge could hear hamish derisively mocking his words this was an important man rutledge do you understand me inspector padgett was quite right to call in the yard and if you arent capable of dealing with this inquiry ill send someone down who can were interviewing youre wasting time rutledge i can have you out of there in twentyfour hours if you dont give us results do you hear me the receiver banged into its cradle with a violence that could be heard across the room rutledge smiled mickelson must have been very put out indeed as he turned around to leave rutledge saw that padgett had followed him to the hotel and was standing in the doorway he must have heard a good part of the conversation from the look on his face most assuredly hed heard the receiver put up with force he said blandly i was just coming to inquire do you want to tell mrs quarles that she can bury her husband or shall i rutledge wiped the smile from his lips yes go ahead i think shell be glad of the news yes sooner in the ground sooner forgotten shall i tell the rector that hell be posting the banns for a marriage as soon as the funeral guests are out of sight sorry to disappoint you i dont think shell marry archer now or ever care for a small wager padgett asked as he turned away not waiting for rutledges answer hamish said agreeing with rutledge she willna marry again theres her son rutledge went up to his room surprised at how late in the afternoon it was he felt fatigue sweeping over him and knew it for what it was an admission that padgett and chief superintendent bowles had got to him hamish said you were in great haste to get to london before yon inspector returned from dover you canna expect to escape unscathed it was nearly fourthirty in the morning when someone knocked at the door of rutledges room he was sleeping lightly and heard the knock at once im coming the only reason he could think of for the summons was another murder and he was running down a mental list as he pulled on his trousers and opened the door it wasnt inspector padgett or one of his constables standing on the threshold was miss ohara her hair tousled and a shawl thrown over hastily donned clothes you must come at once she said ive got gwyneth jones at my house she just came home and her fathers at the bakery firing up the ovens her sisters asleep in their beds he turned to find his shoes and his coat is she all right frightened to death tired hungry and looking as if shes slept in her clothes mrs jones told me you knew her story the question now is what to do gwyneths father is going to be furious and her mother is on the point of having a fit have you told the girl that quarles is dead rutledge asked as they went toward the stairs she shook her head no nor has her mother gwyneth explained to her mother that she was homesick but she told me that she missed cambury and wanted to work in the shop again rather than dance to her grandmothers tune they opened and shut the unicorns door as quietly as possible so as not to disturb the night clerk sleeping in his little cubicle how did you know which room i was in he asked as they stepped out into the cool night air and walked briskly toward church street how do you think i looked in the book at reception rutledge found himself reflecting that if the story got around cam bury that he was seen escorting a disheveled irishwoman out of the hotel and back to her house at this hour of the morning gossip would be rampant and padgett would have much to say about it the one bright point was that gwyneth had been sent to miss oharas house while it was still dark they could at least keep her arrival quiet for a while as if shed read his mind miss ohara suppressed a laugh well have to avoid the man who brings round the milk bertie hes the worst rumor monger in cambury if you wish to have your business discussed over the worlds breakfast table confide in him the first hint of dawn was touching the eastern sky and the coolness of evening still lurked in the shadows it would be light enough soon for anyone looking out a window to see them why did mrs jones bring her to you if the other children had seen their sister thered be no keeping the news from their father i was the only woman living alone she could think of what do you know about the situation enough to realize that if shed fled wales and her father got wind of it hed kill harold quarles how did the girl get home begging lifts from anyone she thought she could trust she had a little money with her but not enough to pay for a train or omnibus they had reached the ohara cottage and quickly slipped inside gwyneth jones was sitting dejectedly in the kitchen her hands wrapped around a mug of hot tea her face as long as her tangled dark hair all the same he could see that she was a lovely girl with curling black hair and dark lashes dark eyes skin like silk but whatever spirit she might have possessed was now sunk in gloom and fear she started to her feet like a cornered wild thing when she saw that miss ohara had brought someone with her rutledge said quickly you neednt be afraid your mother has told me about you im a policemanfrom london inspector rutledge and you can trust me miss ohara did the right thing asking me to help you sort out your troubles a policeman she frowned my mother says i cant come homeshe wants to send me directly back to wales and she refuses to let me see my da its as if ive done some terrible thing and no one wants me anymore she sounded like a terrified and bewildered child miss ohara went to her and put a hand on her arm urging her to sit down again instead gwyneth threw her arms around the older woman and began to cry wretchedly miss jones gwyneth rutledge began listen to me theres been some trouble here in cambury thats why im here rather umserious trouble his hesitation as he searched for a less threatening word than murder was enough the girl broke free of miss oharas embrace and turned to stare at him her tearstreaked face appalled my fathers dead thats why they wont let me go to him no its not your father then its mr quarles whos dead and youve got my father in custody for it hes only one of several suspects gywneth no one has been taken into custody i tried to tell him mr quarles isnt a monster whatever the gossips say but he believed them just like she did she pointed to miss ohara then added mr quarles was nice to me he told me that i could choose my own life i dont have to follow my father in the bakery if i dont want to i dont have to be the son my father never had his eyes met miss oharas over the girls head gwyneth did quarles offer to take you to london and help you find this new life of course he didnt he told me i must learn to do something well to make my living to cook or to bake or to make hats it didnt matter he told me not to go into service his sister did and she was wretched to the end where does his sister live rutledge asked thinking that she could provide him with more information about quarles than anyone else shes dead all his family is dead they have been for years he doesnt have anyone but his son youre certain mr quarles didnt try to convince you to run away from home or encourage you to leave your grandmothers and come back to cambury miss ohara asked of course not my father thought he was flirting with me but he wasnt he said he hated to see such a pretty girl waste her life in cam bury when she could live in glastonbury or bath and marry better than the young men i know here and hes right i dont like any of them well enough to marry them it was a different story from the one jones himself had told rut ledge but taking that with a grain of salt rutledge could see that jones was jealous wanted his favorite child to stay with him and inherit the bakery not find work and happiness away from cambury hed seen quarles as the snake in his eden tempting his young daughter with tales that turned her head and hed read what he wanted to believe in the older mans attentions who knew what was in harold quarless mindwhether he wanted to help her or hoped to lead gwyneth astray perhaps take advantage of her when she was older and lonely and far from home she was extraordinarily pretty but would she be any happier in a larger town would she find this young man of her dreamsor would she be trapped by someone who had other reasons for befriending her and in the end ruin her quarles hadnt troubled himself over gwyneths inexperience rutledge could see and understand a fathers anger he could also seeif it were truethat quarles might have discovered in gwyneth more than cambury had to offer and tried to show her that she could reach higher than her parents had her mother with six children her father content with his fourteen hours a day in his bakery it didnt matter quarles was dead and hugh jones had a very good reason for killing this man who was interfering with his family rutledge said did your father know you were running away she looked down as if ashamed ive written to him since march begging to come home i told him i was wretched and couldnt bear to be there away from everyone he knew i was unhappy still he said i must stay for now and so i didnt tell him i had decided to run away hed have come to wales and stopped me if hed had to lock me in my bedroom and so i slipped away without a word didnt you think your grandmother would be frantic with worry no she doesnt like me she says god didnt intend for a woman to be as pretty as i am and its a burden for her to keep an eye on me and the devil works through a pretty face and she burst into tears again even if jones had no idea his daughter was going to run away he knew she was unhappy and he must have missed her greatly himself tormented by the need to keep her away from quarles he could well have decided to take matters into his own hands and rid them both of the man who had caused the family so much grief either way the baker had much to answer for did you write to mr quarles to say you were leaving wales she looked up shocked oh no if i did that da would never let me come home again rutledge said to miss ohara i think you should put her to bed straightaway and keep her out of sight until ive had time to sort this out and to gwyneth he said you must stay here for a day or perhaps two and keep out of sight do you understand i want to go home to my mother and my sisters im afraid youll have to pay that price for leaving your grandmothers house without permission miss ohara has been put to a good deal of trouble taking you in like this but shes done it for your mothers sake and for your fathers as well if you dont listen to her and gossips connect your unexpected return with mr quarless death there could be longlasting suspicion about your fathers guilt even after weve found the killer the bakery could suffer as well you owe your parents this consideration i understand she answered petulantly but she was young and in the end might not be ruled he waited until miss ohara had taken the girl upstairs and put her to bed then thanked her for her help she looked tired and strained i know something about being hunted she said thats why i took gwyneth in her mother was at her wits end i think mrs jones must be a little afraid of her husband perhaps not afraid precisely but shes feeling guilty about her role in hiding gwyneths return did the girl tell you more about how she managed to get this far on her own she took an enormous chance miss ohara smiled she dirtied her face and teeth to make herself seem less attractive now you must go before the neighbors begin to talk i can hear bertie in the next street in fact the clink of milk bottles and berties whistle were ominously close he smiled in return thank you tell mrs jones that patience will serve her better and silence do you believe that this childs father killed quarles god knows for gwyneths sake and her mothers i pray he didnt bertie had other gossip to carry with the milk that morning someone had told him the way in which the body had been found and the shocking news turned the town on its ear it met rutledge over his breakfast rutledge said irritated who let slip this information hamish answered i wouldna put it past yon inspector in retaliation that was not only possible but likely it served two purposes it annoyed rutledge and it made it more difficult for him to do his job properly often what the police held back was a key to tripping up a killer padgett would be satisfied with both outcomes whether he himself was guilty of murder or not he was in no haste to prove that someone on his patch had done such a thing by the same token if it could have been laid at mrs quarless door padgett would have been pleased enough glancing out the window as he drank his tea rutledge saw the quarles motorcar passing down the high street mrs quarles on her way to fetch her son from rugby he pitied the boy the whole ugly story of the murder was common knowledge now and there would be no way to protect him it would have come out in the course of the trial and the newspapers were bound to make much of the circumstances but that was months away not now while the boys grief was raw padgett came to find him before hed finished his tea rutledge swallowed his ire with the last of his toast and waited were not slack in our duty in cambury padgett said sitting down my men have been busy it appears one harold quarles dined with mr greer on saturday evening but not until seven oclock im surprised that he didnt come to us with that information himself youre free to ask him that brings us to another problem where was quarles between the time he left hallowfields and his arrival on minton street it doesnt take that long to walk in from the estate now does it half an hour at most in a leisurely stroll which would mean he could have reached the high street as early as six oclock where was quarles for nearly an hour at the estate still sitting in the gatehouse cottage waiting for someone or had he come into cambury he met someone on the way rutledge answered padgett its the only explanation that makes sense he was expecting to meet someone on the way or hed have left later than he did point taken why did he dine with greer i thought they disliked each other they do rutledge pushed his chair back ill want to pay a visit to mr greer i thought you might padgett grinning followed him out of the hotel the owner of the glove firm lived in a large house next but one to the high street with black iron gates and a handsome hedge setting it off greer was just stepping out his door on his way to his office when the two policemen lifted the gate latch and started up the short walk greer said we will speak here at the house as if hed called the meeting not the reverse a man of middle height with graying hair and an air of confidence he waited for them to pass through the door before him and then shut it behind them this way he led them to a study at the back of the house overlooking the side gardens a bench in the grassy lawn stood beside a small pool and a frog perched on the pools edge set apart by trees this appeared to be a retreat and one of the long study windows opened on to it greer took his chair behind the broad maple desk and gestured to the other two placed across from him well this is to do with harold quarles what is it you want to know he dined at your house on saturday evening what time did he arrive we had another guest a mr nelson they came in together promptly at seven there was something in his tone of voice that told rutledge he was not pleased about that did mr nelson bring quarles in from hallowfields as to that i dont know did they leave at the same time no mr nelson remained here for another hour or more he had a business proposition to put before us neither quarles nor i approved of it we both preferred to see cambury stay as it is rather than bring in new industry to the area mr nelson believed that the village could support two business enterprises and wanted our backing in presenting his concept to the town fathers and so he stayed on to try to convince you quarles was adamant in his position he said what he had to say early on and then left i expect mr nelson had already put as much effort into persuading quarles as he did afterward with me what sort of new industry padgett wanted to know he felt that gloves had seen their day and that the upandcoming field would be leather goods of a different sort valises wallets diariesa long list of items i think if quarles had believed it would benefit me in any way hed have been against change on general principles but i disliked the idea as well for once he said smiling wryly we were actually in agreement about this matter you felt that nelson met quarles first possibly driving him here in order to bring him around to his position as quarles left first and on foot its a natural assumption how did you know he left on foot greer flushed i asked my butler as he was leaving did nelson follow quarles into the street to finish the conversation between them no of course not i told you hed stayed he joined me in a glass of port and continued to try to persuade me do you think mr nelson had any reason to wish quarles harm that he might have followed him back to hallowfields talked to him again and in a fit of anger attacked him it was padgetts question now and greer turned to him in disgust thats absurd nelson mentioned three villages hes interested in for his factory we were the first he spoke to because of my glove firm he still had two others to visit one of them has nearer access to the railway it would suit his purpose much better but theres less competition in cambury and i think that held a great appeal he shrugged labor would be cheaper here you see versus the convenience of the railway for shipping is it possible that quarles agreed with mr nelson after all and you went out as quarles left and had words with him rutledge asked i dont pursue my guests into the street to harangue them but you failed to inform us that youd seen the victim on the evening he was killed rutledge said i saw no reason to present myself at the police station just to tell them id had a dinner guest who later died you found me soon enough and as you can see i was in no way involved with what happened to harold quarles has your staff told you that not only was quarles murdered he was also put into the christmas angel harness and hauled into the rafters of the tithe barn no one had they could see the shock in greers eyes and the graying of the skin on his face my good god rutledge waited saying nothing after a moment greer went on you suspect nelson of having done such a thing but how could he know the harness existed he lives in manchester greer stirred uneasily as if thinking that should it benefit nelson to kill one of the objectors to his project why not make it a clean sweep and kill both he reached for the telephone on his desk and asked to be connected to manchester and the firm of one r s nelson they waited and in due course nelson was brought to the telephone at the other end there was a brief conversation as if nelson thought greer was calling to change his position then greer said no i just wanted to ask if youd spoken to harold quarles after you left me on saturday evening there was a reply at the other end greer said no reason in particular i could see that he was not going to budge i wondered if youd felt otherwise after a moment grimacing he said well if you must know quarles was murdered that night and the police are here asking if you or i know anything about that as apparently were the last people to have seen him alive he listened then said i see ill wish you a good day hanging up the receiver with some force greer said he informed me he had no need to turn to murder to see his business prosper and hed judged quarles as the sort who resisted change for the sake of resisting and he accepted that because and i quote i grew up in the north myself and know a stubborn bastard when i see one he spoke the words with distaste i had no desire to work with that man on saturday evening and even less desire to do it now if you will excuse me im late at my office and i think theres nothing more i can do to help the police in their inquiry he stood up dismissing them rutledge said thank you for your time youll still be required to make a statement about events of that evening if you will give inspector padgett the direction of mr nelson in manchester hell ask the police there to take his that seemed to please greer and make up for the unpleasantness of having to present himself at the police station he followed them out and as he closed the gate behind them he said i never liked harold quarles and ive made no pretense of anything else but i dont resort to murder to settle my differences i would not have willingly invited the man to dine most certainly not on a social occasion because he doesnt entertain at hallowfields it was left to me to invite both men here i can tell you that my wife didnt join us it was not that sort of evening he nodded and left them standing there pompous ass said padgett watching greer walk up the street but he filled in that hour for us whats left is to find out who argued with quarles before he reached the corner of the high street where hunter tells us he was alone you believe him then padgett asked and nelson as well it doesnt appear to be a motive strong enough for what happened at the tithe barn i hardly see this man nelson killing someone he had never met before just to rid himself of an obstacle to the site for his factory do you no padgett returned grudgingly but by god ill see to it we have both statements in our hands they had reached the high street themselves now and in the distance greer was just walking through a door his place of business rutledge asked yes beyond nemesis in fact you know it could have been stephenson who spoke to quarles on the street or brunswick but probably not the baker jones he would have been home at that hour not prowling the streets but my men tell me that sometimes stephenson is restless and walks about at night well have to ask him rutledge broke off the rector samuel heller was coming toward them distress in his face when he reached rutledge he said you misled me in what way mr heller you told me that mr quarles was dead but not the manner in which he was found my housekeeper informed me this morning is it true and if so why did you keep it from me it was a police decision rutledge replied i didnt want that part of quarless death to be public knowledge until i was ready and so we all have learned such terrible news with our morning tea and from a servant its not proper would it have made any difference in what you told me rut ledge asked as i remember you were not eager to judge others heller had the grace to flush and i would still tell you the same thing but this isi dont knowi can hardly find the word for it blasphemous yes blasphemous suits it best to use that angel in such a fashion what drives another human being to that sort of barbarity if you remember i warned you to beware of a confession that might mean someone is looking for absolution for what hed done yes mr rutledge you warned me and i have been on my guard but no one has come to confess though i have heard from dr oneil that mr stephenson from the bookshop might have need of my counseling apparently hes distraught working himself up into an illness any idea why rutledge asked he lost his only child in the war and he feels that he himself is partly responsible for the boys death in the war padgett asked quarles didnt have anything to do with it heller lifted his eyebrows harold quarles i should think not if theres anyone to blame its the army or the kaiser what made you suggest mr quarles because stephenson admits to hating him indeed he told us he wanted to kill the man wheres the connection if hes haunted by the son and hates quarles padgett asked in his own poor imagination i expect heller said with some asperity a man who is in great distress great agony of spirit sometimes blames others for his misfortunes rather than face them himself im a greater believer in connections than in spiritual agony thank you all the same rector padgett said heller smiled grimly i would never have guessed that mr padgett and with a nod to rutledge that was brief and unforgiving heller turned away and strode back toward his church i think rutledge said slowly we ought to have another chat with stephenson whats the use hes not ready to tell us anything and i have work to do you might contact the army to see if theres any truth in what the rector was told changing the subject rutledge asked has mrs quarles made any decision about her husbands burial yes oddly enough shes taking him back to yorkshire i can understand that she might not want him here although that might be his sons choice but why not london she said that he deserved to return to his roots padgett answered him whatever that might mean rutledge considered the matter then whatever turned her against him might also have to do with his roots she knew what he was when she married him yes shes honest about that but what did she learn later that made her judge him differently and demand a separation apparently quarles didnt fight it and its possible he didnt want whatever it was to become open knowledge for that matter why was she searching his background in the first place was she looking for something or did she stumble over it and i dont believe it was charles archer wounded in france that upset the marriage you cant be sure of that padgett objected rutledge gave him no answer he was already in a debate with hamish over the subject hamish strongly supporting the need to find out more about quarless past while his own pressing concern at the moment was the bookseller padgett said well ill leave you to your wild goose chase ill be at the station if you want me hamish was saying now what about yon lass ye canna leave her much longer let her sleep then well see what to do about her ill have to tell her father and that should answer a lot of questions he walked on to the doctors surgery found that dr oneil was busy with another patient and asked his nurse if he could speak to stephenson without disturbing the doctor she was willing to allow him to see the patient she said if he promised not to upset the man weve got five people in the waiting room and i dont want a scene has stephenson been upsetting the household not precisely but his state of mind is delicate i was asking him just this morning if there was anyone we might send for a cousin or something to help him through his distress and he began to howl i cant describe it as a cry and the doctors wife came running to see what was the matter small wonder that oneil had sent for the rector rutledge gave her his word and hoped that he could keep it as he was led back to the room where stephenson was sitting on the edge of his bed his face buried in his hands he looked up as rutledge came through the door then dropped his head again saying what is it you want cant you leave me alone im worried about you rutledge said easily i think theres something on your mind that you cant let go is it the fact that quarles is out of reach now and theres no one else to hate except yourself his words must have struck a chord stephenson lifted his head again his eyes showing alarm what have you found out what do you know very little you mourn for your son you hated harold quarles there has to be a link somewhere and if you hate yourself it was because you feel you let your son down in some way when he needed you most stephenson began to cry in spite of himself yes yes i should have put him on the first ship out of england and let him go somewhereanywheresafe but i didnt he was so young and i wanted to keep him with me he was so like his mother so gentle and sweet natured i couldnt let him goand so i killed him alarmed rutledge said when damn you not literally id never have laid a finger on him then how is quarles involved im tired of playing solve the riddle stephenson burdened by his shame buried his face in his hands again unable to look anyone in the eye rutledge considering what stephenson had just told him asked was your son called up in the draft and afraid to go to war it was hazarding a guess but he was surprised at the reaction stephenson rose to his feet to defend his son gathering himself together to shout rutledge down he could see it coming and so he added or was the coward you stephenson gasped his features changing from pure blazing anger to such selfloathing that rutledge had to look away but he thought stephenson was lying when he said yes it was i i couldnt bear to see him brutalized by the army shoved into the battle lines told to kill or be killed i couldnt live with that it was the boy whod been afraid who had wanted to take ship and the father who was determined to keep him in england the boy not the man what could you do about it i went to the only person i could think of important enough to help me i went to harold quarlesid grown up in cambury my mother was still living hereand i begged him to find a way to get my son out of the army i told quarles what would happen if i let him go and i promised him anything that i would do anything he asked however difficult it was if he would go to the army and tell them not to send tommy across to france and what did harold quarles promise you stephensons face twisted in grief he wouldnt even hear me out he refused to help i tried to tell him that they have all sorts of units quartermaster signals radio enlistmentsnone of them having to do with actual fightingand i told him tommy could do those he was cold unyielding and told me that he would not speak to the army for me or anyone else and so tommy went to be trained as a soldier and he was shipped to france and on his first day at the front he waited until the trench had emptied and bent over his rife and pulled the trigger the letter from his commanding officer called him a coward and said that he had disgraced the company all i could think of was that he was dead and that surely there had been some way for a man as powerful and well thought of as harold quarles to stop him from going abroad he was silent in his grief now and that was all the more telling as he stared into a past he couldnt change rutledge rested a hand on his shoulder i wanted to kill his commanding officer then i realized those were only words they didnt matter it was quarles who was to blame and i wanted to make him suffer as i had done i came here to haunt him i wanted him to think about tommy every time he passed the shop or saw me on the street and remember his own child i made a point to find out when he was returning to cambury and i put myself in his way as often as i could and when i had wrought up my determination i was going to kill him but like my son i couldnt find the courage to do anything like my son i couldnt bring myself to kill and yet i wanted it as id never wanted anything before or since save to keep tommy alive stephenson saw himself as failing tommy twice rutledge realized in not saving him in the first place and then in not being able to avenge him in the second and as long as harold quarles was alive the opportunity to kill him still existed once quarles was dead it was too late for vengeance and so the bookseller had punished himself by putting that rope around his neck it wasnt so much a fear of the police that had driven him it was the knowledge that when he was questioned his shame would be exposed to the whole world tommy the coward son of a coward but the story was out now as if stephenson realized that he lay back on his cot his arm over his face and his face to the wall rutledge said thank you for telling me whatever you feel about harold quarles the fact remains that we must find out who killed him its a question ofjustice as for his failure to help you and your failure to help your son there are times when no one can help and a mans life has to take its course tommy wasnt the only one in that battle who was afraid most of us in the trenches were terrified it would have been unnatural not to be stephenson said he was the only one who didnt go over the top that morning he was the only one who used his weapon against himself rather than the enemy he let all the world see his fear and judge him for it i think of that often how awful his last hoursminutes must have been with no one to tell him he was loved and must live i wasnt there i wasnt there the final failure in the fathers eyes nor was god rutledge said and sat with the grieving man for another quarter of an hour until he was calmer rutledge went back to the ohara cottage and tapped lightly on the door he had the distinct feeling that every window overlooking where he stood was filled with people waiting to see how he was received miss ohara answered his knock her finger to her lips shes asleep i can only hope her mother is resting as well what are we to do have you spoken to her father not yet he followed her into the pretty room he had hardly had time to notice that morning there were comfortable needlepoint cushions everywhere a row of small framed photographs on the mantel and surprisingly a pair of revolvers mounted on a polished board as he glanced at them she said my fathers there was defiance in the words as if rutledge might think she had no right to them certainly they were incongruous in this very feminine setting but he had no intention of rattling her pride she offered him tea but he declined adding youve been up most of the night i think sit down well have to work this out between us the rest of the family gwyneth included will be too emotional to choose whats best what is best she countered rutledge took a deep breath i dont believe gwyneth could have killed the man i dont think her mother much as she hated what quarles had done to her family would have carried the murder to such extremes yes she interrupted with a little shiver ive heard the tale of the christmas angel its barbaric mrs jones might well have killed him but not that i agree which leaves us with gwyneths father and whether or not he knew about the letter from her grandmother does it really matter the childs complained to him enough he might have decided to bring her home the only way he could coincidence rutledge shook his head i dont know it will not be easy talking to him but i dont think mrs jones will be able to cope when he comes home this evening it will spill out somehow a child asking why mummy cried all day a neighbor wanting to know why she was here in your house at such an ungodly hourand she will break down and tell him the truth shes stronger than you realize but his suspicions will be aroused there was a short silence he said you told me you knew something about murder and about being hunted that i did its why im in england the last place on earth id like to be i was caught in the middle of the easter rebellion in i did what i had to do to save myself and my family and after that i had to leave do you want to take me up for that he could feel her anger and resentment its not my jurisdiction he answered mildly if it has no bearing on quarless death then i have no business interfering thank you for being so damned condescending she flared her voice rising a little before she could control it condescending he smiled and it touched his eyes hardly its you who is still sensitive im merely putting your mind at ease she had the grace to laugh lightly you were in the trenches i think you know what war is like well it was war in dublin and elsewhere we were under siege and we were afraid of what would happen if we lost what sort of retribution there would be for us and more urgently our families i went to the fighting to bring my fathers body back and i had to kill someone to do it i dont regret it he doesnt invade my dreams and id do it again if i had to she would have been an easy target with that flame red hair it had been a brave thing to do to go after her father and it could have ended horribly right or wrong his cause or not rutledge could respect her courage returning to what had brought him here rutledge said may i leave gwyneth in your care for a little longer ill be gone for some time dont let her leave for any reason no ive kept the door locked until l look to see whos knocking ive said my prayers for that family i hope god is listening as he rose to leave miss ohara said she wont go back to her grandmothers i can tell you that she was wretched and the old woman used her unmercifully the tyranny of the weak and then she had the unmitigated gall to tell the poor lass that she was the devils get whenever gwyneth failed to please her i dont think the family knew they must have but they closed their eyes because there was no other way to keep her out of the mans clutches quarles had much on his soul when he went to god and the names of gwyneth and her family are engraved on it rutledge went out the door and waited until hed heard the click of the key locking it before turning toward the joness house hamish was saying ye ken you were taken in by what that one the irish lass ye absolved her of the killing withoot a single proof that what she said was true its not my jurisdiction he said a second time oh aye shes done you a guid turn and bought your silence it doesnt matter right now the girl does she admits to a murder hamish admonished him whats to say that the second killing wasna easier and the lass has a temper when he spoke on the street she gave him short shrift but who is to say what happened next between them it was true but it will have to wait rutledge said hugh jones must be sorted out first before he learns that gwyneth is back in cambury hamish said still not satisfied she holds on to a guid deal o anger that lass she would ha put him in the rig to be a lesson even if only for her ain pleasure yon murderer felt the same anger its no a thing most of the village could ha done i dont see stephenson dragging quarles to the tithe barn and manhandling him into that cage but then it might explain his strong sense of guilt ye ken ye havena delved into yon dead mans past is it to put yon inspectors nose oot of joint that ye cling to this village just as ye went in sich a great hurry to london to spike the guns of the ither inspector thats nonsense rutledge snapped and then realized hed spoken aloud he wasnt aware that during his conversation with hamish hed been standing outside the jones house going up to the door he hoped it would be mrs jones who answered not one of the children but she was quick before hed knocked as if shed been watching for him to come she could see the ohara house from the south window of her parlor the little girl wasnt on her hip today and she glanced over her shoulder as she opened the door as if to be sure there was no one about do come in she said softly and as soon as they were shut into the little parlor she went on how is she i was that worriedshe was in such a state when i opened the door god alone knows she took an awful risk all alone on those roads i knew she was unhappy her voice trailed off shes sleeping its what she needs but she wont go back to cardiff you do see that dont you the next time she may not be as lucky well she wont have to now will she and she broke off her hand to her mouth as if to stop the words but it was too late with quarles dead he was an awful man i cant wish him alive again and i want my girl home to stay her grans getting on she wasnt always such a terror but what choice was there i ask you her eyes were pleading with him to tell her that everything would be all right that this nightmare would resolve itself without trouble for anyone she loved but he couldnt and after a moment she looked away sadness pulling her face down what are we to do about gwyneth she must come home i want her here not at a strangers house mrs jones i must ask you again can you be absolutely certain that no one in the house told your husband about the letter from wales i dont see how anyone could have done the post came when only the baby was here and she wouldnt know and i kept it safe in my apron pocket where no one would look but he could read the uncertainty in her face now the fear that she hadnt done enough would you have killed harold quarles to keep your daughter safe he asked bluntly i have to know she looked at him then if it was to be gwynnie or him id choose gwynnie but what about the rest of them what are they to do without me if im gone besides ive heard what was done to him much as i wanted him away from gwynnie i couldnt have brought myself to touch him on the whole rutledge thought that was true she wasnt the sort of woman to take pleasure in her vengeance it would be enough for the man to be dead out of her daughters troubled life i must go now and tell your husband will you do nothing until ive seen him when he comes home tonight what will he say thats what frightens me hell know i kept secrets as well hell be angry with me for keeping gwynnie from him i cant promise you he wont be angry you think hes done this thing i dont know mrs jones and thats the truth he could have pulled him up on that rig hes done it before for the christmas angel he was shocked that she would admit it at first he wondered if she was trying to shield herself the mother the protector of her children and then he realized that she was thinking aloud that she had forgotten he was there in the agonizing drain of her own worry he said goodbye and she nodded absently her mind so wrapped up in the question of whether the man shed married and given six daughters to was capable of murder that he wasnt sure she knew when he left the walk to the bakery was silent hamish had finished what he wanted to say but rutledges thoughts were heavy if he took jones into custody who would keep the bakery open not his wife and not the girl despite her training up to fill his shoes what would become of this family it was the duty of a policeman to be objective hed told padgett that and yet sometimes it was impossible to ignore the different personal tragedies that murder brought in its wake few of those touched by violent death walked away unscathed hamish said startling him theres yon widower as well brunswick yes i know if indeed he killed his wife would that have satisfied his jealousy or did he bide his time and wait for the opportunity to stalk quarles orif he didnt kill his wife if her death was a suicidehe might well kill quarles and put him in that contraption to have the final word and stephensons case hinges on whether he scraped up the courage to act on behalf of his dead son they were just passing nemesis the bookshop rutledge wondered if it would ever reopen the closed notice was still in the window but then people were surprisingly resilient sometimes the shop might be all the man knew to do and the only haven from torment books were a great comfort because they didnt stand in judgment he would feel safe among them the bakery was just ahead now jones bowing a welldressed woman out a white box in her hands and a smile on her face then he looked up the high street and saw that rutledge was coming his way as the woman moved on jones stood there and something in his posture told rutledge that he knewor guessedwhat was coming he straightened his apron as if girding his loins for battle and waited when rutledge reached him jones said come inside then rutledge followed him into the bakery it was redolent with cinnamon and baked breads swept clean the shelves sparkling like diamonds in the sun coming in the windows at present the shop was empty it wasnt time for the tea trade to come will you have something jones said to put off the inevitable are you a man with a sweet tooth thank you but its important for us to talk before someone comes in jones nodded to two wroughtiron chairs painted white and the seats covered with a rosebudpatterned fabric it was where women could wait until their orders were ready incongruously now it served as a place of interrogation as he sat down jones said i didnt kill the man but you dont believe me there was strength in his voice and certainty thats how it stands now but there are new extenuating circumstances to answer to mr jones the welshman was wary now as if half afraid his wife had confessed or that rutledge had discovered something jones believed hidden too deep to be found your daughter ran away from her grandmothers house when his voice was taut with fear several days ago jones surged from his chair and started for the door close up behind me im on my way to wales this business of quarles can wait theres my daughter to be thought of waitwe know where she is jones stopped in his tracks what do you mean you know shes been found shes safe but the man was not satisfied ill see her for myself if that man talked her into anything rash ill go to the doctors surgery and cut out his liver dead or not see if i dont there was such rough menace in his voice that rutledge could believe he would do just that sit down man and let me finish he said curtly jones stood where he was by the door grim and determined i said sit down jones or youll learn nothing more it was the voice of a man accustomed to being obeyed on a battlefield jones didnt move for an instant longer then grudgingly came to sit down his body so tense rutledge could see the cords standing out in his neck shes safe and shes had no dealings with quarles shes said as much and i believe her homesickness made her run away and a grandmother who berated her for being pretty he growled like an animal deep in his throat she wrote she was unhappy but i didnt want to believe her i didnt want to see what the old woman was capable of i wanted her safe thats all let go of your hate and think about your daughter and what this means in terms of your own guilt my guilt there was something in his eyes that rutledge couldnt read but he could see that joness mind was moving swiftly and in a direction that was unexpected yet he said nothing and sat where he was if you knew gwyneth had run away it would make the case for your killing quarles strong enough to bring in a verdict against you at least at the inquest if you found out shed left wales and decided to make certain this time that your daughter could remain in somerset the next logical step would be confronting quarles there would certainly be words between you and if in his usual callous way he turned his back on you it would surprise no one if you lost what was left of your temper and killed him its an explanation im bound to tell the inquest but is it rightor wrong i must make a decision jones and you will have to give me the unvarnished truth in order to make it jones looked him in the eye how did you learn all this about my daughter running away who knew to tell you at the moment it was my wife wasnt it it has to be did gwynnie write her a letter rutledge could answer that no gwynnies mothers been crying i could see it when i came home at night redness that she said was from soap in her eyes or the babys fist striking her while she was nursing but it was a letter wasnt it from gran then if not from gwynnie he had come to the truth in his own fashion a man with a mind that was as sharp as the knives with which he cut the dough on his board he had let himself be blinded by his love for his daughter but now he was thinking clearly and about to protect his wife rutledge cut him short your wife couldnt have put quarles in that apparatus oh yes i heard about that but i could have come along behind her and done it couldnt i to throw suspicion away from her thats how itll be seen well i wont have it i killed the accursed harold quarles and i ran him up into the rafters like a rat on a string and if you let me see my daughter one last time ill go with you to the station and sign my statement i give you my word and what rutledge demanded irritated will become of the bakery and your family had you forgotten jones blinked as if hed been slapped in the face ive trained my girl she can run it for us damn it man shes still half a child how is she going to manage and at her age what will this do to her slaving the hours you do even if your custom stays with you coming home at night tired and dispirited with nothing to look forward to but another morning baking bread for people who stare at her and remember you were hanged jones took a deep breath it was extraordinary rutledge thought to watch two people trying to protect each other out of sheer fright and neither had the courage to ask the other for the truth no dont tell me again that youre guilty go home and speak to your wife man and between the two of you try to make sense we dont need martyrs we want to find a killer jones said staunchly i told you i killed harold quarles and not a quarter of an hour ago you were prepared to tell me you hadnt talk to your wife afterward ill take you to gwyneth your daughter shouldnt be there until youve come to grips with yourselves in the interim stay here and think about what youre asking of your wife and your daughter cambury has a long memory hugh jones and youll find if you confess to murder even the murder of someone as unpopular as harold quarles there will be people who turn against you its how people are he got up to leave there was no fear of flight in this case he thought jones wouldnt leave his family to face their nightmare alone jones called to him as rutledge was reaching for the door she couldnt have done it its not in her nature to kill but rutledge thought he was trying to convince himself not the man from london as he spoke the words sometimes doubt was the deadliest of fears it grew from nothing more than a niggling concern until it overwhelmed trust and shone a new light on small inconsistencies white lies honest mistakes and human frailty and as it distorted perspective it could also distort the truth words taken out of context loomed terrifyingly large and in the end doubt could convince a loving husband or wife that their partner was capable of the unthinkable both hugh jones and his wife were in the throes of doubting and they would never quite be the same again outside on the high street rutledge swore it hadnt gone well this business with the baker but it had been doomed from the start because the girl had run away would jones persist in his assertion that hed killed quarles or would his wife persuade him to let the police do their work unhindered and in the meantime what was he rutledge to do if one of that family was a murderer padgett was just coming out of the station you look like a man who wished he hadnt seen a ghost the inspector said in greeting rutledge was in no humor for the mans badgering i want to know what it is you held against harold quarles and i want to hear it now if not in the station we can walk on the green i told you i know what you told me and im damned well running out of patience what did quarles do threaten to have you dismissed its the only reason i can think of other than insulting your wife for your refusal to give me the truth its none of my business but it is this is your last chance talk to me or ill know the reason why padgett walked away as if turning his back on rutledge then he whirled around his face twisted with fury i gave you my word i hadnt killed him other people in cambury are having to watch their most private affairs being aired in public why should you be different whether you killed him or not i want to know what lay between the two of you i want to make my own judgment call i can tell you if im recalled to london youll fare less well with the man who will take my place at least you know you can rely on my discretion all right lets be done with it you wont be satisfied until you know there were two occasions when the bastard swore he was going to speak to the chief constable and have me dismissed and he could do it rich and powerful as he was he could do it the chief constable doesnt like to be disturbed thats why i called london myself instead of going to him anything for peace thats his belief what happened with quarles one such occasion was when hunter was having trouble with him at the hotel it was while quarles was rusticating here i stepped in and quarles told me flat out that he would see the chief constable the next day he did and i was dragged on the carpet for upsetting an important man told to mind my manners and get along with my betters and stop this nonsense that must have stung you have no idea padgett said trenchantly and the other occasion it was shortly after quarles moved into hallowfields i had to remind him that the two dogs he had at that timenot the spaniels but two large brutescouldnt be allowed to run free and attack the sheep of nearby farms he told me theyd done no such thing i replied that i had eyewitnesses and would pursue the matter he told me hed have the chief constable teach me my manners and i was called to account i referred the chief constable to the farmers whod complained and when he spoke to them quarles had paid them off without my knowledge they denied losing a single sheep but the dogs were penned at night after that and i was left to look the fool where are they now the dogs they were old they died some time ago they werent eating the sheep just chasing them and killing them for sport i never found out what price hed paid the farmers but they blandly lied on his behalf and left me hanging out to dry lazy he may be but the chief constable has a long memory youll find and thats why i couldnt have you going to him it would be the last straw id lose everything it could hamish told rutledge explain the bark of the dog outside the tithe barn that attracted padgett to investigate a wellhoned lie that had about it the sweet taste of vengeance you heard a dog the night quarles was murdered so i did you cant disprove it nor do you seem to be able to prove it padgett said ive told you now the matter is closed do you hear me you still havent grasped the fact that by your own admission youre a suspect dont you see whether you like it or not whether i wish to pursue it or not you had a very good reason to kill that man dont expect favors from me i will treat you as fairly as i do everyone else is that why youve held information back from me do you really think ive killed harold quarles there was something in his eyes a measuring look that made rutledge want to step back away from padgett it doesnt matter what i feel ill want to find your statement ready for me tomorrow morning about finding the body whether i use it or not i must ask for it and whether you want to give it or not personally and professionally you have no choice damn you padgett turned and went back into the police station slamming the door behind him rutledge let out a long breath but the question now was how had brunswick learned of quarless two attempts to have padgett sacked had he been present that night in the hotel dining room and had someonehis wifetold him about the earlier event there must even have been talk in the village at the time forgotten though it might be now hamish said ye must ask yon clerk why he didna tell ye that the inspector was present when there was trouble that was easily dealt with rutledge crossed the street to the hotel and went in search of hunter the manager was working in his office behind reception he rose when rutledge came through the door wariness in every line rutledge greeted him and got to the point you didnt tell me when you described the problem you had with harold quarles here in the hotel dining room that you had called the police in inspector padgett was here that night a diner he and his wife were celebrating her birthday he came to my assistance when quarles turned nasty and intervened did you know that quarles had spoken of this to the chief constable in an effort to have padgett dismissed from his post in the police hunters eyes slid away yes i heard later it was talked about i didnt wish to bring it up it wasnt my place if you want to know more you should speak to inspector padgett if youve misled me about this how do i know that youve told me the truth about quarles arguing with someonequarles turning the corner out of minton street and the fact that you have no idea where he went from there hunter said i told you the truth my truth i thought it was best that inspector padgett explain his role and the consequences of his actions because this information could involve him in the murder smiling wryly hunter said thats not my problem its yours it seems hes told you or someone has either youve leapt to conclusions about the chief constable being approached or you know what transpired there i dont i kept my position and mr padgett kept his that was what mattered who else was here that night do you remember the dining room was quite busy that evening i cant recall everyone who was here mr brunswick mr greer the rector dining with a curate he knew from another living others it was a matter of face you see mr quarles was intent on saving his and inspector padgett was trying to calm a volatile situation quarles insisted that i be sacked from the hotel but fortunately for me the owner had no intention of being bullied hardly youd think a reason to kill a man in your case possibly not but this was relevant to my inquiries what else have you neglected to tell me nothing to the very best of my knowledge ive spoken only the truth a truth with holes in it there are no other holes i swear to you hamish said ye ken he didna need to kill the man only lie for someone else padgett was that who had quarreled with the victim on minton street after hed left the greer house and had hunter shut his eyesor his ears in this case and told the police he hadnt recognized the voice of the other person murder was a strange business as rutledge had learned from years of meticulous detective work and wellhoned intuition the smallest clue could change a case from the most straightforward appearance of truth to a tangled web of lies or vice versa there could be no small mistakes no withholding of evidence to spare someoneor to condemn someone had hunter lied for padgett on the whole rutledge thought not there appeared to be no real connection between the two men no depth of commitment that would make one protect the other after all neither had lost their positions in spite of quarles padgett had been shamed by his superior and in front of his fellow villagers and so had hunter but in a vastly different sense padgett depended on his standing in cambury for his authority and influence as a policeman rutledge said if there are any more omissions youll like to mend you know where to find me and he walked out of the office leaving hunter chewing his lip from the hotel rutledge went to miss oharas house gwyneth was still sleeping and he told miss ohara about the interview at the bakery mrs jones is afraid he killed quarleshes used that apparatus and hes afraid she has though he knows she wouldnt have thought of hanging him in the beams of the tithe barn he ended but hes going to confess to protect her hes confused worried about his wife worried about his daughter and in the end to protect both of them hes willing to step forward is it a smoke screen though she asked twisting her long slim fingers into knots is he hoping youll refuse to hear his confession and leave him in the clear after all theres that ive told him to go home and talk to his wife she may tell him his daughter is here and she may not i want you to be prepared it will be a tearful reunion she sighed all right ill do my best to keep them from foolishness if they come here first but look at this mr rutledge he never swore to you that he didnt see that letter if it were kept in her apron pocket it could have fallen out he could have seen it he wouldnt tell her if he had true she looked at him thoughtfully you dont want the killer to be one of the jones family do you if the fates are kind he smiled did you think he might be afraid that gwynnie killed quarles she couldnt have put him in that harness but if she had killed him her mother whatever the qualms on her own account might have gone back to the scene and tried to hide the body she might have thought of the cage she might have reasoned that if quarles could just go missing for a day or two she could smooth over her familys anguish regarding gwyneths whereabouts and make it all come out right mrs jones might have tried to hide the body but shed have been in a great hurry to get back to gwyneth for fear shed do something foolish the rig would have taken too long no i saw her after shed got the letter and she was frantic she didnt know where her daughter was besides the girl reached cambury after quarles had been found miss ohara said yes thats true look youve got me spinning motives in my head i dont know what to believe do you want me to take the girl away is she too much for you here shes safe from talk let her stay he thanked her and left he was almost on the point of going on to the jones house to tell mrs jones how her husband had reacted to the news of his daughters return but decided against it let the man and his wife work out their own problems first and the girls next after that it was more likely that the truth would come out one way or another padgett jones brunswick stephenson mrs quarles what was it about this case that he couldnt put his finger on why didnt he have that instinctive sense of where an inquiry was going it all came back to that damned cage who knew about it and why would someone want to put a dead man in it and leave him to hang among the shadowy beams of a medieval tithe barn what was the truth behind not the murder but the hatred that launched it in the event hugh jones sent for rutledge almost a quarter of an hour after hed closed the bakery and come home rutledge had spent some time talking to the war office on the telephone asking for the military record of one thomas stephenson after several delays as he was sent to one desk after another stephen sons description of his sons death was confirmed the officer reading it was cold unsympathetic and rutledge wondered if he had ever served in france or merely kept the accounts of those who had and considered himself an expert on trench warfare he wasnt ready to confront the tangle of hugh jones and his family but he walked there and when no one answered his knock he let himself in i couldnt wait jones said as rutledge came though the parlor door i shut the bakery early my wifes not here theres a neighbor caring for my girls and nobody knows where gwynnie is i asked her sisters they havent seen her shes with miss ohara i expect your wife has gone there against my advice your daughter slept most of the day this will be the first opportunity her mother has had to speak to her jones heaved himself from the horsehair sofa then well go to the irish womans cottage rutledge walked a little ahead of him and when they reached the house he could hear raised voices inside miss ohara opened her door and it was plain that shed had enough like parents everywhere mrs joness fright and worry had dissolved into anger and as her daughter stood before her hangdog and crying she was berating her for causing the family such grief gwyneth looked up to see her father coming into the room and she stood poised for flight like a startled animal knowing it was cornered and had nowhere to go mrs jones whirling gasped and fell silent jones stood where he was taking in the situation at a glance you did a bad thing he scolded his daughter you caused us much grief and your mothers tears his voice was stern but you wouldnt let me come home you did nothing the girl cried and whose fault is that and now the man is dead and were being looked at by the police because you couldnt mind your father or listen to your mother girl youre going to be the death of me his voice broke on the last words and he stood there his mouth open nothing coming out and his face was filled with all the things he wanted to say and couldnt gwyneth turned and ran back through the house to the room where shed been sleeping her mother with a swift glance at jones started after her but rutledge stopped her no shes better off out of this mrs jones ive come to take your husband into custody id promised that he could see his daughter first youll do no such thing she said fighting through her emotional turmoil i killed that man dont be a fool woman jones began but she turned on him next and what have you done but thunder and threaten to kill the devil yourself and fumed with frustration that your daughter had to be sent away while he still lorded it over the village i heard you a thousand times and yes so have your children and for all i know your neighbors where theres the power of words you are a murderer and god help me so am i because in my heart i wanted to see him dead they stared at each other out of the corner of his eye rutledge saw miss ohara step out her own door and move into her garden her hands clasping her elbows and hugging her arms to her chest jones had turned to rutledge and was repeating what hed claimed earlier i killed the man let it be done with youre a stubborn welshman hugh ioan jones do you hear that his wife accused he said for the first time showing gentleness what would you have me do love let you hang in my place she began to cry i just want things to be the way they were i want to go back to when we were safe and the only worry was how to feed the next mouth he crossed the room and gathered her in his arms id do anything for you love die for you even she was not a woman of beauty time and childbearing had worn her down and worry had added lines to her face and drawn the color from it there were times i wondered she said then pushed him away go to your daughter hugh jones and then come home to your dinner i doubt its edible now but well eat it anyway he held her for a moment then without a word went down the passage to find gwyneth mrs jones looked up at rutledge were a sorry lot bragging of being murderers and you still arent sure are you rutledge asked wryly are you she said simply if hed killed harold quarles he wouldnt have touched me hed have gone directly to gwynnie for fear hed break down it was a womans reasoning but rutledge nodded whether or not it cleared hugh jones was another matter she sighed ill go fetch the children and set out our dinner i doubt any of us will swallow more than a spoonful he let her go and waited after a time hugh walked into the parlor without his daughter shell come home in her own time ill ask miss ohara if she minds keeping her a little longer he walked past rutledge and went out the door rutledge waited and in ten minutes her face washed and her hair brushed gwyneth jones stepped shyly into the parlor the resilience of youth he thought the selfishness of the young hamish countered she got what she wants even if no one else did she was indeed a pretty girl despite the dark circles beneath her eyes and the strain in them only just easing in a small voice she apologized to rutledge for being so troublesome and then looked around for miss ohara shes in the garden she wanted to give your family a little privacy gwyneth nodded and went out after a time miss ohara walked back in her own house and shut the door behind her well she said hands shoved into the pockets of the short jacket she was wearing all this drama has made me hungry youll take me to the unicorn to dine ill expect you in half an hour and let the gossips be damned he found himself laughing and then realized that she was quite serious the next morning padgett met rutledge at the dining room door as he was leaving after his breakfast padgett followed him into reception and said the rumor mill has been busy i hear you had dinner with the lovely miss ohara wont look good in london will it if you have to take her into custody for murder i doubt she killed quarles because he flirted with her in the street oh ho shes already in the clear he held up a hand before rutledge could make the retort that padgett saw coming never mind weve got a far different problem the baker hugh jones is in the station wanting to make a statement rutledge swore silently let him make whatever statement he cares to write down and sign but well not take any action on it until im satisfied he isnt lying his girls come home he thinks that makes him your favorite suspect and it does but i havent yet been able to show he knew shed left her grandmothers if jones killed quarles without knowing she was leaving wales it was coincidence shed written him that she was unhappy there he just told me as much he might have been clearing the way for her to come rutledge considered padgett do you really think hugh jones is our murderer better him than me padgett said tersely then he added i dont see him leaving his family destitute and he would still if quarles goaded him who knows what he might have forgotten in the heat of the moment hes a strong man mind you theres something else i want to speak to you about lets walk they went outside where they couldnt be heard rutledge said this business with brunswick leaves me unsatisfied whether he killed his wife or she killed herself in a way sunday when we were discussing past murders here in cambury you told me about a young soldier returning from the war who believed his wife had been unfaithful he knocked her down and killed her yes he claimed it was in a fit of temper who was the man he suspected of sleeping with her padgett frowned we never knew he told me hed killed his wife and there was the end of it gossip claimed it was a lorry driver whod been seen about the place from time to time but he turned out to be her brother and after killing her the husband wasnt about to besmirch her good name odd business but for all i know the war turned his mind and it was all in his imagination there was no talk about her before he came home could the other man have been harold quarles theres a rumor about a mistress was she this woman or is his mistress just wishful thinking on the part of busybodies padgetts eyebrows flew up quarles somehow i dont see it and nor did the gossips but theres her farm and this business of him playing squire when he first came to hallowfields it could have begun that way what put you on to that possibility thinking last night about brunswick and his wife padgett shook his head the soldiers wife was quite pretty but water over the dam now nothing we can do about it even if it was quarles it might explain why brunswick was so certain his own wife was unfaithful there was precedent i put that down to his naturally jealous nature but you never know dr oneil is releasing stephenson today with orders not to open the shop for the rest of the week ive spoken to the army stephensons son died in france of a selfinflicted gunshot wound has the rector been to see him yes according to oneil mr heller was there for nearly an hour and he said that afterward stephenson appeared to be in a better frame of mind we seem to be at a standstill do you think well find our man he was serious now and his eyes were on rutledges face trying to read his thoughts well find him rutledge answered grimly whoever did this went to great lengths to leave behind no evidence we could collect or use against him but theres always something when we have that well have him padgett was silent for a moment then he said youre the man on the spot ill see to jones and ill have a brief chat with brunswick as well he nodded and walked away lmost without conscious thought rutledge went to the hotel rutledge stood looking after him with mixed feelings yard and got into his motorcar he hadnt planned to drive out to hallowfields but he found himself drawn again to the tithe barn restless in his own mind unable to pinpoint what it was that niggled at the corners of this inquiry why it was he couldnt seem to draw all the edges together and make a whole he had watched mrs newell do that with her willow strands the basket taking shape under her deft fingers the certainty with which she worked demonstrated by the steadily rising levels on the basket sides the way the willows whippy and straight bent and wove to her fingers and the simple grace with which it all came together would he thought driving down the high street toward hallow fields that murder inquiries had the same subtle texture and execution he left the motorcar by the main gate and walked from there to the gatehouse at the home farm then stood in its little garden trying to put himself in the darkness of saturday near midnight and the confrontation in this place that must have led to murder after a moment he went across to the one stone that had been slightly dislodged from its neighbors no blood or hair would have adhered to it whoever had used it would have seen to that but he hefted it in his hand and felt the smooth weight of it the neatness with which it filled his palm and the size which allowed him a firm grip it was made for murder he thought as perfect a weapon as even an ancient warrior could have found before he learned how to shape a tool for killing hamish said its whimsy this rutledge smiled and put it back in its place beside its neighbors he looked up at the gatehouse across to the tithe barn no longer guarded by one of padgetts constables and then down the lane toward the home farm was there nothing here to recreate that scene of murder pacing on the grassy verges of the lane he tried to shut his mind to someone calling somewhere in the distance and the sound of a tractor rumbling into a barn at the end of his next turn he looked up following the flight of a bird and realized that the parkland on this side of the road part of the estate had a matching stretch of wood on the far side perhaps thirty feet deep and overgrown whether or not it belonged to the estate he didnt know but seedlings must have escaped from the park over the decades and found fertile soil there making themselves a poor reflection of their better grown neighbors walking over the road he stepped into the bushy tangle of wild flowers and brambles that marked the verge and went about ten feet into the wood so that he could look back at hallowfields from a different perspective he realized he had a better view of the home farm lane from here than he did from the estate property and moved another half dozen steps among the trees until he could see both gatesthat to the farm and the drive to the house changing his angle a little he nearly stumbled over a length of half rotten wood from a fallen tree he turned to look down at it and what struck him then was how out of place it appeared even here amidst all the other tangled debris of winter curious he began to walk in a half circle and about ten feet away he found the rest of the tree the length had come from lichen covered the stump from which the tree had split and in its fall it had broken into two sections the longest half was disintegrating where smaller branches lay half covered in last years leaves just where the shortest length should have been was a mossy depression that section had been lifted out and moved to a better vantage point no animal could have done that he walked back to the length hed seen first and measured it and then looked once more at the empty space where it had been removed from the rotting trunk yes a perfect fit this wood wasnt dense anyone walking here could easily be seen from the road but in failing light or in the dark when there was no movement to attract the eye no light to pick out shapes or brightness of skin someone could sit on that short length of trunk and wait with a perfect view of the entrances to hallowfields how had he come here by foot bicycle motorcar where would he have hidden a motorcar rutledge left the wood and walked on up the main road just as a lorry came roaring past leaving him in a cloud of dust the wall of the estate ran on for some distance but there was a rutted track some fifty or sixty yards away from the gates where a team and farm equipment could pull in and turn around it was used often enoughthe grass was matted and torn muddy in places deep grooves in others in the distance he spied a small farm the barns roof towering over the house and a team standing in the yard while a man bent over the traces between the track and the farm was plowed land already a hazy green with its spring crop a vehicle sitting here on a saturday evening would be invisible in the darkness hamish said yon inspector told ye there were no strangers in the village yes but if someone drove through without stopping it would make sense aye but why not afoot quarles was on foot that limits where he came fromand where he could go afterward yere searching for straws gie it up someone waited there sae ye think but ye canna say when and how did he know what was in the tithe barn rutledge began to walk back to the wood true enough what about the man nelson had he waited here for quarles no quarles left the greer house and would have been well home and in his bed before nelson came this way again if greer was telling the truth who argued with quarles outside the greer house who had known to look for him there had the argument not been resolved and so he had come ahead of quarles to pursue it again padgett he admitted to being on this road the same night it had been some time since the incident in the dining room of the unicornwhy should padgett suddenly attack quarles why now that was a sticking point was there something that had happened more recently tipping the scales trying a temper that was already on a short leash padgett hadnt been very forthcoming it could be true no one would notice a policeman passing along this road it was regularly patrolled because of hallowfields it wouldnt be reported that padgett had come this wayif he hadnt taken over his mans last run if he hadnt found the body who would have known he was here waiting rutledge reached the log again and sat down carefully so as not to ruin his trousers but this bit of wood was dry and his feet sank comfortably into a slight depression that appeared to be made for them it would be possible to sit here for some time hours if need be who and how many weekend evenings had someone waited here to catch harold quarles unawares standing up he found a few long twigs and set them up around the log put his coat over them to resemble a man his hat on the log itself and went back across the road in the daylight he might well have seen the coat looking for it but it didnt strike the eye at once and if there was no movement hed have missed it even with the sun out rutledge went back to retrieve his clothing and cranked the motorcar hamish said what does it prove nothing we still have the problem of the apparatus coming into cambury he was reminded of something hamish had accused him of earlier that he hadnt looked into quarless past and then one name leapt out at him the partner davis penrith he hadnt asked how quarles had been killed rutledge hesitated nearly pulled into the unicorns yard to make a telephone call to london and instead he gunned the motor and drove through the village without stopping hamish called him a fool its no whats wise i couldnt think straight monday morning i didnt have any reason then to question him further it wasnt until id left london that i realized he showed no curiosity about his partners death if they worked together for nearly twenty years there would have been some interest in the mans demise even if they disliked each other after the breakup of the partnership excuses hamish grumbled and settled into a morose monologue for the rest of the journey it was late when rutledge reached the city nevertheless he went straight to penriths house the footman who answered the door at this late hour was dubious about disturbing penrith hes entertaining a guest he informed rutledge and told me hed ring when the guest was leaving he didnt want to be disturbed meanwhile yes i understand but this is police business and it comes first the young footman stood there uncertainly for a moment then replied ill go and ask he came back five minutes later can this wait until tomorrow it cannot the footman went away again and when he returned he led rut ledge into a small room at the back of the house that appeared from the way it was decorated to belong to penriths wife the furnishings were feminine painted white and gold the chairs delicate and the hangings at the windows trimmed with tassels penrith was standing there a frown on his face when rutledge walked through the door i hope youve come to tell me that youve caught harolds murderer in fact i havent rutledge said easily ive come with questions i should have asked you on monday this is not the time im afraid your business with your guest will have to wait it was interesting rutledge thought watching the man to see that a stern front made him back down if the partnership was to have succeeded for many years it would have been quarles who was the dominant force penrith couldnt have controlled the other man hamish said but ye didna know him alive rutledge nearly answered aloud but caught himself in time to penrith he said this may take some time i suggest we sit down penrith sat at the small french desk and as rutledge took the armchair across from him penrith said i dont care for your tone for that i apologize but the fact is time is passing and i need to confirm several pieces of information before i can move forward at this penrith seemed to relax a little marginally but noticeably as if he was more comfortable with a simple request for information in the first place why did you and the victim sever your business ties ive told you i wished to spend more time with my family im not a greedy man ive made enough money to live comfortably for the rest of my life why spend every hour of my day grubbing for more surely you could have stayed within the partnership and simply cut back on your appointments in fact you appear to have one this evening penrith picked up the pen by his wifes engagement book you didnt know harold quarles there was no such thing as half measures for him did your decision to leave have anything to do with the cumber line debacle the pen snapped in penriths fingers where did you hear of cumberline i saw the box in the victims study and there is some talk in cam bury about his rusticating there i put two and two together something went wrong and you left the firm i didnt intend to defraud anyone if thats your insinuation as an afterthought he added and i dont think quarles did either but he made no attempt to prevent a handful of people from investing in a foolhardy scheme that was bound to fall through some people think they know best theres nothing you can do to educate them or protect them some of those who made a great deal of money during the war were hot to double it i found that distasteful but i didnt try to trick them did you have your own money in cumberline a little he broke off why am i being questioned like this because your partner is dead and theres no one else i can ask lets suppose for the sake of argument that you disagreed with quarless methods in dealing with cumberline and in order not to be tarred by that brush you decided the time had come to leave james quarles and penrith he didnt need to hear confirmation of his question it was written in penriths face and id like to suggest to you that you havent always seen eye to eye with your partner here penrith said leaning forward you arent suggesting that i killed the man im trying to get to the bottom of harold quarles if his own partner didnt care to be associated with him any longer and if his wife has made her own arrangements to deal with the problems in her marriage i want to know more about the man and who else might have hated him i didnt hate him i think it more likely that you feared him penrith got to his feet i wont hear any more of this we are speaking of quarles not of you if you feared him why didnt his wife that caught penrith off guard idont know whether she feared him or not it seems that a few years into their marriage she learned something about him what sort of man he was that caused her to separate from him legally not just a move to another part of the house but terms drawn up by their solicitors just as you did financially there was worry in penriths eyes now that he couldnt conceal i dont know what their relationship wasor why she stopped coming to london and they stopped entertaining and quarles became a different man in some ways he never spoke of his wife to me after that i told myself it might be because of archer he stopped does she tell you she feared him that he might have made her come to regret her decision there was intensity in the question that penrith couldnt keep out of his voice whatever it was that came between them she appears to feel a deep and abiding emotion of some sort i think if you want the truth that she acted to protect her son light seemed to dawn behind penriths eyes yes he said slowly i begin to see what you are saying then what was it that turned maybelle quarles against her husband penrith sat down heavily i dont know what it was but you must have some suspicion it wasnt only cumberline that turned you away from the firm the two of you had built together the immediate cause perhaps but not the longstanding one that hit its mark but penrith said nothing what is there in harold quarless background that could have brought someone to cambury to kill him considering the reputation he had for being overbearing and dictatorial in the village i should think you would find enough suspects there to satisfy any police inquiry he retorted the more i question the villagers the more i hear one thing whatever their grievances people tell me that harold quarles wasnt worth hanging for hamish said he didna mention the women it was you but then not living in cambury he might not know rutledge answered silently when penrith made no reply rutledge said you never asked me how he died surprised penrith said didnt i of course i did he was struck in the head with one of the white stones that ring the iron table in the home farms gatehouse garden penrith turned away thats terrible but the words lacked feeling did you know that quarles provided a christmas pageant in the tithe barn on his property for the entertainment of the village i was the one who went out and found that confounded camel penrith told him with some force it took me the better part of a week why were you sent on such an errand why not one of the house clerks quarles was threatening to sack everyone in sight god knows why he wanted a cameli expect it was something his son asked for we know very little about quarless life before he came to london only that hed worked in the mines came south to make his fortune and so on you must know more than that penrith was suddenly wary his background i dont think he spoke of it except for that early story about his mothers ring he was an odd sort hed dredge up stories about going down for coal and they rang true people believed him and five minutes later he was a londoner through and through the time came when i didnt really know what to believe whether he used the coal face to promote himself or whether he really did go down he said once that his parents house had been eaten by the coal that he had nothing to go back to but bad memories no one came from yorkshire to visit him no one stopped him on the street to beg a few pounds from an old friend no one wrote to him he told me his family was dead i had no reason to think that was a lie penrith said defensively after all i didnt really give a damn about his past you were a curates son i believe yes how did you know that someone told me that you gave respectability to the firm after quarles took over from the james family penrith flushed if you say so i had no prospects when iwhen i came to london like most young men i was grateful to find a position i had no expectation of rising in it where was your fathers living in hampshire why you didnt know quarles before you were thrown together in london thats right i dont see where this is going neither did rutledge he was looking for anything a crack in pen riths armor a small piece of information that he could move ahead with but his sixth sense his intuition told him that something was not right penrith seemed to alternate between fears for his own standing and distancing himself from quarles look ive left my guest for long enough if you will come again at a more convenient time ill be happy to continue this conversation rutledge stood up thank you i will penrith was waiting for rutledge to precede him through the door but as rutledge came up to him he stopped and said what village was that in hampshire penrith stiffened i thought perhaps you would prefer to know where in yorkshire harold quarles had come from i think that door is shut quarles himself closed it a long time ago thank you for your time mr penrith he walked by the man and down the passage the way he had come penrith followed him as far as the entrance to the house as if to be certain he was gone when rutledge had reached the street he looked back and pen rith was still standing there hamish said yere a fool if ye drive far again tonight ill go to the flat rutledge answered cranking the car he was caught in london traffic and on the spur of the moment he turned toward the yard in the hope of seeing gibson leaving but no such luck he was looping back toward the west end and as he pulled into the swirl around trafalgar square he saw mrs channing trying to hail a cab it was late a busy evening and she looked tired without thinking he maneuvered the motorcar to the lions nearest where she was standing and called can i give you a lift he would have done the same for his sister frances or for mary anne browning she looked up smiling in recognition ian how lovely yes id be glad of a lift he waited for her to slip in next to him and she said light and dark flitting across her face as he drove on i was at st martininthe fields with friends a memorial service at this hour it was especially arranged for this hour actually an evening concert in his memory the music was wonderful his family arranged itthey do every year on the thursday evening closest to his birthday a rejoicing for his life short as it was he wanted to ask who the friend was but refrained youre on your way home then yes i had a letter from elise theyre having a lovely time thats good to hear the conversation dwindled as he turned toward chelsea as if neither of them knew quite what to say next a few drops of rain spattered on the windscreen mrs channing saw them and said well im doubly grateful to you now ian her last words were lost in a downpour and she laughed its quite like dunster isnt it the thunder soon followed and she moved a little nearer so that her voice would carry one gloved hand pulling her coat closer against the chill of the sudden storm mrs caldwell telephoned me were having lunch together next week i think shes planning a little dinner party for the bridal pair when they return he had forgot elise caldwells father and his invitation to call caldwell was in the same business as james quarles and penrith meredith channing was still speaking and he realized hed missed half of it just ahead was her house and as he drew up to the walk he said i think theres an umbrella somewhere its not far dont bother i should ask you to come in for tea or coffee but im tired tonight another time yes thank you she got out shut her door and with a quick wave dashed to the house her maid was there to let her in almost at once as the door closed behind her he sat where he was the motor ticking over and wished hed asked her where the caldwells lived it wasnt difficult to find out where caldwell amp mainwaring was located in the city and rutledge was there as the doors opened the next morning he sent in his card and caldwell himself came out to greet him this is a pleasant surprise what brings you to our part of the city not murder i hope as a matter of fact it is rutledge said im here about the death of harold quarles caldwell frowned yes ive just heard disgraceful business i hope you find whoever did it and quickly what can i do to help caldwell led him to a corner office where the heavy turkey carpet set off the elegant mahogany desk and the suite of chairs arranged in a half circle near the windows gesturing to rutledge to be seated caldwell rang and asked for tea to be brought then he joined rut ledge pointing to the portrait over the mantelpiece he said my father he was a man youd have liked the son i lost was his image it was like losing my father twice i can imagine how it must have been it was evident caldwell was waiting for the tea to be brought and when they were settled and his clerk had withdrawn he said now to business you must have come for information i hope i have it what do you know about the background of either partner quar les or penrith not much more than everyone else penriths father was a curate in sussex sussex i thought i was told hampshire no sussex it was im nearly certain of that then penrith had lied go on quarles came from somewhere around newcastle coal mining which he was lucky enough to escape according to the accounts he gave i met him several times when he was clerk to mr james the younger there was something about himand this will sound to you quite discriminating on my part but it isntthat didnt seem to march well with his story i had the feeling that there was more to him than met the eye and that was it something in his eyes as if the real person were locked away behind them i had the feeling that he could be quite ruthless if he chose an interesting point yes and i said something to my father about it his reply was that i had no way to measure how rough the mans life had been or how he had managed to escape the fate of his brothers the story was that theyd died in a mining accident and he didnt want to do the same there appears to have been some ruthlessness on his part aside from working his way into a prosperous business rutledge said thinking about cambury nevertheless quarles quickly changed from the rough diamond he claimed himself to be to a rather polished one he married well and he had a reputation for scrupulous honesty even when it came to cumberline ah that was an odd story i think it was seven men who paid dearly for investing in that disaster quarles swore hed put some of his own money into it but i find that hard to believe he was too astute do you know who these seven men were i dont but there should be files of transactions somewhere were required to keep track of such things rutledge saw again in his minds eye the box marked cumberline on the shelf in quarless study at hallowfields what else can you tell me about him nothing im afraid oh there was one thing rather strange i thought at the time but i cant remember why it disturbed me we were standing outside a restaurant in the strand and a young woman came up to us asking if wed like to subscribe a sum for the memorial that was being erected to the men missing on the somme those who were never found we all gave her money toward the causehow could you not all save quarles he turned away from her and said something to the effect that he was not an army man that hed sent in his subscription for the navy dead instead it seems to me the simplest thing was to make a donation and let it go rutledge responded yes but the young woman was asking to write our names down on the subscription list to go into a book they were intending to place in the memorial rutledge could almost hear stephensons voice breaking as it recounted how hed pled with quarles to speak to the army on his sons behalf and quarles refusing to even entertain the idea he was too old for the war hamish said without warning and his son is verra young still both comments were true but rutledge had taken up enough of caldwells time and the teacups were empty courtesy required that he leave is there anything else you can think of no i dont care to speak ill of the dead if you werent a policeman and someone i trust to use the information wisely i would never have told you as much as i have thank you sir for your trust it isnt misplaced they shook hands and rutledge left outside in the street he mulled over the fact that penrith had lied why he found a telephone in a hotel and called a friend of his who had been an anglican priest anthony godalming had lost his faith and retired to his familys home in sussex he rarely went out and seldom spoke to old friends but rutledge reached the mans sister told her it was urgent and in time goldalming came to the telephone his voice was neither friendly nor unfriendlyit seemed to hold neither warmth nor coldness but rutledge could tell his call was not welcomed a reminder of too much that still had to be put behind for sanitys sake anthony thank you for speaking to me im looking for someone a curate in sussex some years ago twenty perhaps longer even his name was penrith he had one son penrith the man on the other end of the line seemed to dredge deep in memory and come up short i dont recall anyone of that name down here are you sure it was sussex before your time then it could be does it matter greatly yes i need to find the father if hes alive and the son as well if anyone knows where he may be london possibly there was a long silence very well tell me how to reach you rutledge gave him instructions to call the unicorn in cambury has this to do with the war ian tell me honestly there was strain in godalmings voice now no to my knowledge neither man was young enough to serve with us this has to do with a murder inquiry thats why im searching for information otherwise i wouldnt have asked you surely the police have ways to find these men i dont think they do you have the only fact ive been able to dig up and thats little enough rutledge heard a grunt that might have been in disagreement thank you anthony not at all there was a click at the other end driving fast as he reached the outskirts of london rutledge headed for somerset his mind sifting through what penrith and caldwell had had to say to him it had been for the most part a very unproductive journey pen riths relationship to quarles had not been worth pursuing or so it seemed and yet that one lie about where his father had been curate still rankled why had he felt the need to lie it doesna mean hamish said taking up the thread of rutledges thoughts that hes a murderer its possible he has his own secrets to conceal his own background was it really penrith who initiated the separation from quar les or the other way around but that didnt make sense a man like quarles would have made it his business to know any secrets that penrith possessed it was in his nature as it was in penriths to bury his head in the sand what had broken up quarless marriage and what had broken up quarless partnership this occupied rutledges mind all the way to somerset and late as it was when he arrived he drove straight to hallowfields and knocked on the door it was several minutes before someone answered his summons mrs downing still in her black dress with the housekeepers keys on a chain at her waist the symbol of her office even in this modern age was not pleased with him its late mr rutledge and youve disturbed the household mrs quarles is not here yes i understand shes gone to rugby i need to look at something in mr quarless study and you dont need her permission to allow me to do that cant this wait until the morning im afraid not reluctantly she let him into the foyer and then when the door was securely locked once more she led him up the stairs charles archer in his dressing gown was rolling down the passage toward them coming from the other wing as rutledge reached the first floor is there trouble he asked anxiously but rutledge shook his head ive something i wish to see in the study mr quarles used here at the house im sorry to call so late but its rather urgent to do with what i thought youd inspected his rooms to do with his business in london ah then i cant help you downing will see to it for you he turned away but stopped and swung around the man who brings the milk and the gossip told the staff you were on the point of taking the baker hugh jones into custody for harolds murder is this true i cant comment on that tonight its nonsense rutledge the mans no killer he has a family to consider then who would you put in his place archer had the grace to look away im not offering you a sacrificial lamb what can you tell me about quarless former partner davis penrith penrith i hardly know him hes been to the house a time or two dining here with his wife at least once he never seemed comfortable in harolds company i always thought that odd since theyd worked together for years they didnt appear to have much in common other than their business dealings thats not unusual is it business seems to attract opposites sometimes its not a requirement to share interests archer turned toward his rooms good night rutledge i hope you find what youre after mrs downing standing silently by and listening to the conversation waited for instructions rutledge said its the study i need to see she led the way took his keys and unlocked the door for him from a passage table she took up a lamp and lit it for him to use it took only a matter of two minutes to locate the first cumberline box and lift it from the shelf he took it to the nearest chair sat down and opened it all that was inside was a thick sheaf of papers and he thumbed through them quickly interested not in what they referred to but in names of investors he found that there were groups of paperwork clipped together to keep them separate and each had a name at the top seven of them no eight he went to the desk found paper and pen and began to jot the names down mrs downing her face disapproving said im not sure this is regular mr rutledge ive had no communication with mr quarless solicitors and mrs quarles is away i cant in good conscience allow you to remove anything from im not removing these papers mrs downing i need the names listed on them he continued to work then doublechecked what he had done to make certain he had all the names down finishing with the file he put it back where hed found it and thanked mrs downing she followed him out of the rooms and she locked them again then returned the keys on the way down the stairs she said young marcus will be here soon with his mother i hope it wont be necessary for the police to be tramping about asking questions and disturbing the family at all hours it wont be good for the boy the police have work to do mrs downing it cant be helped but ill keep in mind that the boy will be in residence they had reached the door and mrs downing opened it for him then as he stepped out into the night she said if you want my opinion its mr brunswick who killed mr quarles i never liked the man he treated his wife something terrible jealous and overbearing and always looking for the worst in people i saw him a time or two prowling about looking to see if he could catch his poor wife in something if he didnt want her here why didnt he put his foot down rutledge stopped you didnt tell me any of this before no and for a very good reason she said hazel brunswick confided in me she took her tea in my rooms not with mr quarles and she talked sometimes about her life i kept her confidences all he wanted to spend money for was music the house was bursting at the seams with it and she was tonedeaf she couldnt hear anything he played thats why she came to work here to provide for herself and the children to come she defied him if you want the truth and mr quarles thought it was all a game but i knew it wasnt he struck her once quarles god save us no it was mr brunswick struck his wife and thats when she decided to find work because she said he would respect her more if she could stand up to him and didnt have to beg for whatever she wanted but once is never the end of it is it once becomes twice and twice thrice and its on its way to being a habit isnt it surely the people at st martins church knew the rector he never hit her in the face you see there was something in her gaze that looked back to another woman and another past i was married to one such i know their ways he was killed in a mill fire and i was glad of it rutledge believed her did you know mrs brunswick was ill she told me what she thought it might be it crushed her all her hopes and plans gone for naught she said he didnt care for sick people that hed turn away from her and wait for her to die do you think brunswick killed her or that her death was a suicide i cant answer that but mr brunswick had the nerve to come here he followed mr quarles home one night just after she died and called him a murderer id been to the home farm to take a lemon cake to mrs masters and i heard them down by the gatehouse he was shouting you couldnt help but hear asking for money to pay for her burial asking for compensation for turning his wife from him what did mr quarles say to that charge he laughed and told mr brunswick not to be tiresome i thought theyd come to blows but just then i saw mr quarles striding up the lane and i went the other way so as he wouldnt think i was eavesdropping ive heard mr brunswick play hes a very fine organist he has to work hard at it hes not gifted hazel told me that was the sorrow of his life and why she pitied him he wanted to play in a cathedral and all he was fit for was st martins church in a small living like cambury i wish youd spoken to me before he said again but she shook her head i had to weigh up what i felt i could say mrs quarles wants to see this inquiry closed quietly for the boys sake and if you arrest mr brunswick hazel brunswicks unhappiness and her suicide will be dragged up again and talked about and the gossip about mr quarles and her being lovers as well it wasnt true hazel brunswick wasnt that kind of woman now my conscience troubles me i should have done more to help her than i did i should have told mr quarles about the beatings or rector and if her husband killed her and then killed mr quarles then justice must be done i hope mrs quarles will understand who met mr quarles in the gatehouse mrs downing someone did you have only to walk through it to guess what its purpose was she gave him a pitying smile it was where he would have brought his mother if shed lived though hed go and sit there sometimes brooding rutledge could hear hamishs voice in the darkness as they had walked through the small tidy rooms respectability there was never a mistress who waited for him there hed have liked the world to think so why wouldnt his mother have lived here in the house if he cared so much for her hed have passed her off as his old nanny no doubt i ask you she replied spitefully he was ashamed of his roots didnt you know he bragged about them and he used them but he didnt want to be what he was hed buried his past so deep even he couldnt remember the half of it she shut the door in his face and rutledge stood there remembering what someone had told him that mrs downing was mrs quar less creature she might not have killed for her mistress but could she be counted on to veil the truth or twist it in a different direction to serve another purpose hed have to keep that in mind still servants were often guilty of snobbery they took their standing and their selfworth from the man or woman they worked for and mr quarles had never lived up to mrs downings standardhow could he when she perceived his social level to be so much lower than her own he turned back to his motorcar feeling the miles hed driven and the lateness of the hour but hamish was saying ye canna leave it her charges against brunswick no but tomorrow is soon enough if he followed him once he followed yon dead man again and again very likely thats why the log was moved and when quarles turned away this time a weapon was to hand rutledge stopped as he was getting into the motorcar listening to the silence of the night and the quiet ticking over of the motor i wonder why brunswick was chosen as her scapegoat because hes guilty or because hes vulnerable hamish was silent rutledge drove back into cambury and left his motorcar in the yard behind the unicorn the hotel was quiet and there was no sign of the night clerk as rutledge turned to the stairs he thought he could hear him snoring gently on his cot behind reception as he reached his room he saw the small message slipped into the brass number on his door anthony godalming had telephoned and asked that rutledge return his call at his earliest convenience rutledge glanced at his watch it was close to midnight he would have to wait until tomorrow rutledge was on his way down to breakfast when constable dan iels met him in the lobby morning sir i think youd better come what is it rutledge asked i was stopped on the street and told the bakery hasnt opened this morning the constable said so i went to have a look for myself bearing in mind what happened to mr stephenson quite right constable as he followed the man out the door he said did you look in the windows the shades are still down sir usually at this hour you can smell the bread baking they were walking briskly down the high street but i dont think the ovens have been fired up under the circumstances he may have chosen to stay home he didnt close the bakery when his girls were born daniels said its most unusual they had reached the shop now and daniels was right the shades had not been raised and the door was firmly closed whats more there were no trays of fresh baked goods in the window rutledge said go to the jones house dont alarm his wife man just find out if hes still at home the constable trotted back the way he came and rutledge moved forward to knock at the door but no one answered hamish said hes no there rutledge used his fist now hammering at the door and behind him he could feel people on the street stopping to see what he was about he had just raised his fist again before walking to the back of the shop when the door moved an inch or two and rutledge could just see joness face in the shadows were closed jones began but recognizing rutledge he opened the door wide and said come in quickly rutledge stepped inside and stopped appalled the once tidy bakery was a scene of chaos flour and sugar were scattered around the shop eggs flung everywhere their broken shells crunching under joness feet as he stepped back handfuls of sultanas and spices and other ingredients were smeared on the walls and a stone jar of lard lay on its side cracked the smell of cinnamon and allspice ginger and nutmeg filled the air almost overwhelming to the senses even the pretty chairs where rutledge and the baker had sat talking had been caked with water and flour gentle god rutledge said someone believes i killed him jones was saying defeat in his voice thats what it must be you cant be sure of that oh yes in all the years ive lived here i never gave short measure to my neighbors whats more they never repaid me like this never he gestured to the destruction of his bakery in the past twentyfour hours he had been through emotional turmoil and he had not expected it to touch his livelihood in this way did you give a statement to inspector padgett i did that i put down the truth and i signed it he shrugged i talked to my wife she made me see reason but the police can still claim i knew gwyneth was coming home and went to hallowfields my word against theirs you know that as well as i do he was speaking of padgett but not by name im not out of the woods and if they try to bring my wife into it ill do what i have to for her sake by backing off i gave her peace of mind for a bit thats all and i darent tell her about this and ask her help clearing away can i who in cambury would come to harold quarless defense i never expected anyone would do that i thought he was roundly disliked he glanced around his shop again its petty this thank god nothing is broken the glass the ovens the trays but my stock there was no way to rescue the ruined spices the flour the sugar the sultanas or the spilled milk and eggs even after cleaning up the bakery would have to close for several days until such things could be replenished and more than one household would go without bread for its meals and cakes for its tea let me send for gwyneth this is work she can do no ill see to it myself there was a knock at the door send them away jones said i havent the heart to face them but it was only the constable returned from the jones house rut ledge let him in i asked the woman come to help his wife clean the carpets if he was at home daniels broke off whistling at his first glimpse of the ruined shop then glanced at his boots as if half expecting them to be ruined as well rutledge righting the stone crock that held lard said the sooner you start the sooner it will be cleared away the chairs can be cleaned the walls and floor as well it will take longer to see to the shelves and the counters but it can be done i dont believe miss ogden would talk if you asked for her help the bookshop is closed for now clear away in aid of what jones asked his voice flat but he went for a broom and bucket then set to work his heart not in it who did this constable daniels asked quietly looking to rut ledge and why we dont know he answered shortly stay here constable keep an eye on the shop and on mr jones i want to have a chat with inspector padgett daniels standing aside to let him pass said its the sort of damage a child might do we dont lock our doors anyone can come and go he hesitated then added the quarles lad marcus constable horton saw the motorcar just after two this morning bringing him home along with his mother if he heard the servants gossiping or the tales flying about just now hes of an age where this sort of thing might help the hurt a little do you know the boy well is he like his father hes away at school i havent seen him much of late rutledge nodded and went out the door it was still too early to telephone godalming in sussex and inspector padgett wasnt in his office rutledge went back to the unicorn and encountered padgett just coming out of the hotels dining room he turned around and followed rutledge to his table sitting in the sunny window rutledge quietly filled him in padgett shook his head when rutledge told him what mrs downing had claimed to have seen and heard much as id like to believe its brunswick you must consider the source like you i wouldnt put it past mrs quarles to get her housekeeper up to this or archer for that matter the family is scrambling to give the man a better reputation in death by seeing this inquiry is over with as soon as possible if its brunswick quarles comes out of the trial as a saint not a libertine i come to bury caesar not to praise him it would also support your theory that brunswick killed his wife rutledge went on and if he killed hazel brunswick the odds are good that he killed quarles ive found a place in the wood opposite the gatehouse where someone waited just out of sight yes well that could have been anyone and at any time we cant prove it was saturday night padgett reached over and helped himself to a slice of rutledges toast heaping a spoonful of marmalade on it it was intended to irritate but rutledge said nothing my wife detests marmalade i never get it at home he wiped his fingers on his handkerchief the chief constable sent down a message that hes awaiting word wed settled on a murderer rutledge dropped the subject of brunswick last night someone wrecked the bakery jones found it this morning when he came in constable daniels is there now padgett swore some months ago jones gave me the names of two boys who had stolen tarts when he wasnt looking i expect they wanted revenge and since the towns gabbling about the mans guilt they must have decided this was as good a time as any ill have a word with them rutledge held his tongue in another ten minutes he could make the telephone call to godalming but padgett sensed something in the texture of the silence and said what are we to tell the chief constable whatever you like rutledge answered and stood up ive got something to attend to then im going back to speak to brunswick suit yourself padgett got to his feet ill be at the station rutledge waited until he had gone out then went to the telephone room to make his call godalming himself answered and rutledge asked did you find our man a curate by the name of penrith had the living for some years in a village northeast of chichester he died of typhoid early in he had one son and no money to educate him the boy went into the army he never came back to see his father whether that means hes dead as well or that he knew his father was no longer living i cant say and thats all youve turned up it isnt enough there was a weariness in the voice coming down the line that had nothing to do with fatigue yes thank you it is i washoping for more yes we all do dont we and the connection was broken a dead end whatever reason penrith might have had for lying about his father it appeared to have nothing to do with quarles there might be other skeletons that filled that particular closet penrith could be illegitimate for one and the curate took him in or because their names were the same davis penrith might have tried to provide himself with more respectable antecedents than a serving girl sacked because someone had tired of her hence the lie to rutledge he had learned through his years in the police that no detail was so small it could be safely ignored and so he put in a call to london to sergeant gibson who was not on duty at the yard that day if he cared to leave a message rutledge did it was brief find out if one davis penrith served in the british army between and if so where and what became of him let them sort it out it would take time and hed already given two hours to the war office on behalf of stephensons son the voice on the other end of the line laboriously writing out the message said and that should be inclusive if it isnt well look again my father was in the boer war the voice said saw a bit of fighting and came home with a lions head mounted for the wall drove my mother mad hanging it where it could be seen coming down the stairs we were the only family on our street with a real lions head i used to charge my mates a farthing a look very good sir ill see he gets the message on monday morning rutledge fished in his pocket for the list hed made in harold quarless study then he put in his third and final telephone call this one to elise caldwells father sir can you tell me anything about these men he asked after caldwells greeting he read the list of eight names i know six of them they made their fortunes from the war butler is dead of coursean apoplexy simpleton went to canada as i recall talbot and morgan live in london as does willard macdonald is in glasgow hester and evering are new to me here are these by any chance a list of investors in cumberline yes they are caldwell chuckled well well ive always wondered if youre thinking of the six i know in terms of the murder of harold quarles then youre barking up the wrong tree while i wouldnt trust them with my purse i can tell you they arent likely to avenge themselves with a spot of murder theyd rather lose a second fortune than admit to investing unwisely and they seldom sue because theres the risk that a canny barrister might find that their own coattails are none too clean would they be likely to hire someone to do the deed for them not likely at all of course i cant speak for this man hester or evering what can you tell me about them hester is from birmingham a manufacturer of woolensi have the name of his firm broadsmith and sons ah hes willards soninlaw you can strike him off the list as well that leaves evering he lives in the scilly isles no firm given dont know him at all youll probably find your murderer closer to home caldwell informed him i wouldnt worry about these eight men thank you sir this has saved a great deal of footwork caldwell said any time ian good hunting rutledge decided to walk to brunswicks house the morning was fair the streets were filled with people doing their marketing and a farmer was bringing in half a dozen pigs their pink backs bouncing down the middle of the street as motorcars and lorries pulled to one side brunswick didnt answer his door and rutledge walked on to the church thinking that the organist might have gone to practice for the sunday morning services in fact as he crossed the churchyard he could hear music pouring out the open door he stepped inside as his eyes adjusted to the dimness he saw that there were two women kneeling by the front of the church arranging flowers in tall vases and somewhere the rector mr heller was deep in conversation with a young man their voices carrying but not their words the church was larger inside than it appeared to be outside with a wagon roof and no columns as rutledge passed by heller caught his eye and nodded but continued with his conversation brunswick in the organ loft paused between hymns but was playing again by the time rutledge had climbed the stairs and come to stand by him im busy brunswick said over the crash of the music rutledges posture was that of a man content to wait through the next five hours if necessary after a time rutledge said my mother was a pianist quite a fine one in fact your interpretation of that last piece was very different from hers with an abrupt gesture of annoyance brunswick lifted his fingers and feet letting the pipes fall silent everyone in the church looked up the two women and the two men as if after the music the sudden stillness was deafening if youve come to take me into custody get on with it otherwise youre breaking my concentration do you wish to talk to me here where everyone can hear or elsewhere brunswick got to his feet stretching his shoulders we can walk in the churchyard they went down to the door and into the sunlight warmer outside after the chill trapped within the stone walls of the church the talk of cambury is that mr jones is your man why should you need to speak to me as they walked among the gravestones rutledge said ive often wondered if a guilty man ever spares a thought for the poor bastard who is sacrificed in his stead if you were the killer would you speak up to set jones free i dont see that this is something i need to consider unless of course you arent confident of your ability to judge who is guilty and who isnt brunswick countered rutledge laughed meanwhile he went on ive learned a great deal more about your relationship with your wife it appears not to have been a very happy one at least for her i thought youd come to cambury to find out who killed quarles not to chastise someone who has already said everything that can be said to himself i wasnt a very good husband if you killed one rutledge put it to him the chances are very good that you killed the other or conversely if you were wrong about one of them then the odds are you were also wrong about the other prove that i killed either one rutledge was silent for ten yards or more i dont think your quarrel with the dead man has anything to do with jealousy i believed you at first and you must have believed it yourself in a way it cant explain all the evidence im looking at and im beginning to believe theres more to this than meets the eye you abused your wife because you were already angry you accused quarles because you knew your wife was vulnerable to kindness after your own behavior and her shocking death made you want to blame her not yourself i think youre relying on the general publics view of harold quarles to call him a monster and excuse yourself from blaming him for all your ills because thats easier than facing the truth i think its time you took a long look in your mirror there was an inadvertent movement beside him the police must look at hard fact what we feel what we think doesnt matter there appears to be enough fact lying about and inspector padgett would like nothing better than to connect one death with the other if your conscience is clear over your wifes suicide then so be it its my responsibility to determine what part you playedif anyin harold quarless murder but once that is done padgett will search for connections and see them where there may be nothing at all all right i wanted him dead i make no secret of that look at it any way you care to why is my own affair touche rutledge thought to himself what you wanted isnt at issue you cant be hanged for that what counts is whether you lifted your hand with a weapon in it and struck harold quarles on the back of his head brunswick turned to look at rutledge his face unreadable i would have watched him die i would have wanted him to see whose hand it was and id have probably throttled him not struck him rutledge said it doesnt always work out that way when the chance arises sometimes the choice of weapon depends on where you are and why you arent prepared ive told you i was in my bed either take me into custody or leave me alone im not giving you the satisfaction of a confession of my sins so that you can sort them out and pick the one that will hang me rutledge said pensively i think quarles pitied your wife its one of the few decent things weve learned about him that he tried to get her to proper medical care brunswick wheeled to face him his voice savage his eyes narrowed with his anger you know nothing about my wife and you know damned little about harold quarles well ive made a study of the man where did he come from do you know i went to newcastle to see for myself theres a quarles family plot right enough but its long since been moved to a proper churchyard some twenty miles away the village where they lived is so black with coal dust its almost invisible roofs fallen in windows gone the mines closed the main shaft damaged beyond repair the owners got as much coal as they could out of it and the miners they employed and simply abandoned both the sons followed quarless father into the mines and died young lung rot and accidents the father was already dead by that time the mother was dead by nobody remembers harold isnt that strange its as if he never existed but one old crone whod lived in the derelict village told me she thought perhaps there was another boy who ran away to join the army and never came home again so who is our harold quarles i ask you and if he doesnt exist how can anyone kill him rutledge took a step back the vehemence of brunswicks attack unexpected hamish busy at the edges of rutledges mind was a distraction as he tried to assimilate what brunswick had told him if penrith hadnt returned home after he joined the armyand now it appeared that quarles might have done the same thingwas that where theyd first met and forged a friendship that took them from lowly beginnings to a very successful partnership in war men were thrown together in circumstances that brought them closer than brothers cutting across class lines age and experience in their case the boer war he and hamish were examples of that men who might have passed each other on a london street without a second glance but in the context of the trenches they had seen each other as comrades in the battle to survive they had learned from each other trusted each other and protected their men in a common bond that in fact hadnt ended with death rutledge said to brunswick its all well and good to make a study of the mans life but that still leaves us with his death theres no one left in the north who cares if he lived or died youve just pointed that out so were back to cambury you arent listening are you did it ever occur to you that harold quarles is a mystery because hes got something to hide there are almost no traces of him anywhere you look he has a wife and a son and ill wager you they know less about him than i do he was a liar he was secretive he used people for his own ends what made him that way thats what i wanted to know he owed me for what happened to my wife and he didnt care rutledge remembered what heller the rector had said to him he repeated it now its not our place to judge the police can only deal with laws that are broken if he has never broken a law then we can do nothing brunswick put a hand to his forehead as if it ached ive always tried to live my life as a moral man and where has it taken me into the jaws of despair if you want to hang someone hang me and be done with it let harold quarles whoever he may be claim one last victim he turned on his heel and walked back toward the church as brunswick went in through the church door squaring his shoulders as if shaking off their conversation rutledge thought stephenson couldnt bring himself to act in his eyes it was an appalling failure this man is ridden by different demons hamish said aye he doesna know what he wants on the contrary i think he may have a taste for martyrdom and hasnt discovered it yet dreamers often do he didna kill his wife im beginning to believe he didnt but thats neither here nor there why was he so obsessed with harold quarless past to excuse his murder by claiming the man was evil to start with the rector was coming across the churchyard toward him a frown on his face what did you say to michael hes sitting there in front of the organ not touching the keys rutledge said its my responsibility to speak to anyone who might have had a reason to kill quarles but michael hasnt killed anyone has he its only because he admits how he felt about the man that you believe he might have inspector padgett has convinced you that michael murdered his wife and therefore he wanted to kill quarles as well but many of us dont see it that way it was a tragedy and he was out of his mind with grief and distress when she died he didnt understand her suicide it was a betrayal to him an admission of guilt it was the only reason he could think of for her to leave him you see that someone had turned her away from him apparently he didnt behave very well toward her when she was alive yes it could be true though i never saw evidence of it i do know they werent very happy together long before hazel went to work for quarles so you see if hed intended to take matters into his own hands and kill harold quarles hed have done it then and there in that confused and bitter state of mind and he didnt thats to his credit dont you see if he didnt intend to kill him why has brunswick spent a good deal of his spare time of late looking into quarless past what good is it heller was surprised has he been doing such a thing hes never said anything about it to me what is he looking for for heavens sake i dont know i dont know that he himself understands what hes after yes well that may be true curiosity got the better of him has he found something very little i dont think quarles wanted his history to be found well enough to boast about its simplicity but not to have the truth about it brought into the open the poor are not necessarily saints and sinners do have some goodness in them isnt that what the church teaches heller took a deep breath back to michael do give him the benefit of the doubt theres much healing left to do ill bear that in mind rutledge answered mildly he turned to walk back toward the church and heller followed him we arent going to solve this dilemma mr heller until we have our killer and to that end i must go on questioning people however unpleasant it must be heller said nothing keeping pace beside him his mind elsewhere as they parted at the corner of the churchyard he broke his silence i will pray for you to be granted wisdom inspector it might be more beneficial to your flock if you prayed for wisdom for inspector padgett as well heller smiled i already do that my boy he glanced upward where a flight of rooks came to perch on the pinnacles of the church tower after a moment he said ive been told that mrs quarles is home again with her son theyre to collect her husbands body and take it north for burial i did wonder why mrs quarles hadnt asked me to preside over a brief service here before her husband was taken north but thats her decision to make of course perhaps here in cambury you know him better than mrs quarles wishes heller sighed i can tell you how it will be once mr quarles has left the village it will be as if he never was well not talk about his irritating qualities because of course hes dead there will be a family bequest to the church and well name something after him and forget him its a poor epitaph for a man who was so forceful in life did you know that quarless partner davis penrith was the son of a curate actually i believe mr quarles brought that up once in a conversation he seemed to find it amusing because it wasnt the truth or because penrith didnt live up to his fathers calling i have no idea but mr quarles did say that he didnt have to fear his partner because the man would never turn against him or to be more precise he said the one person hed never feared was his partner because penrith would never have the courage to turn against him when was this rutledge asked i dont remember just wheni think while mr quarles was living here in cambury for several weeks i was out walking one afternoon and he was coming back from one of the outlying farms he stopped to ask me if he could give me a lift back to town and i accepted we got on the subject of enemies i cant think how thats an odd topic for a casual encounter nevertheless he made that remark about penrith and i commented that loyalty was something to value very highly he told me it wasnt a matter of loyalty but of fact yet penrith had walked away from their partnership and as far as anyone knew quarles hadnt felt betrayed had in fact done nothing to stop him they were an unlikely pair to be friends much less partners rutledge mused yes thats true i thought as much myself from mr quarless remarks but theres no accounting for tastes in business or in marriage is there good day mr rutledge he watched the rector striding toward the church door his head down his mind occupied as heller disappeared into the dimness of the doorway hamish said theres no a solution to this murder theres always a solution sometimes its harder to see thats all oh aye hamish answered dryly the chief constable will ha to be satisfied with that m iss ohara was just coming out her door with a market basket over her arm as rutledge passed her house she hailed him and asked how the jones family was faring well enough he told her we ought to find whoever killed quarles and pin a medal on him they do it in wars why not in peace for ridding cambury of its ogre thats hardly civilized he told her thinking that brunswick might agree with her we arent talking about civilization she drew on her gloves smiled and left him standing there rutledge could still see her slender fingers slipping into the soft fabric of her gloves they had brought to mind the uglier image of harold quarless burned hands the lumpy whorls and tight patches of skin so noticeable in the light of inspector padgetts lamps as the body came to rest on the floor of the tithe barn like the coal mines those hands were a part of the public legend of harold quarles neither rutledge nor padgett had thought twice about them because they had been scarred in the distant past he turned back the way hed come and went on to dr oneils surgery the doctor was trimming a shrubbery in the back garden rut ledge was directed there by the doctors wife and oneil hailed his visitor with relief taking out a handkerchief he wiped his forehead and nodded toward chairs set in the shade of an arbor lets sit down its tiresome trimming that lilac i swear it waits until my backs turned and then grows like jacks beanstalk they sat down and oneil stretched his legs out before him what is it you want to know the undertaker has come for quarles and ive finished my report its on padgetts desk now i should think thank you im curious about those scars on quarless hands you saw them for yourself the injuries had healed and were as smooth as they were ever going to be it must have happened when he was fairly young i did notice that the burns extended just above the wrist and the edges were very sharply defined almost as if someone had held his hands in a fire you usually see a different pattern more irregular think about a poker thats fallen into the fire the flames shoot up just as you reach for it you might be burned superficially but not to such an extent as his because in a split second you realize what youve done drop the poker and withdraw out of harms way what i found remarkable was that quarles hadnt lost the use of his fingers that means he must have had very good care straightaway were there other burns on his body his neck for instance or his back im thinking of bending over a child protecting it with his own body as he runs a gantlet of fire i wasnt really looking for old wounds if hed had other scars like those on his hands surely youd have noticed them yes of course burns do heal with time if not too severe a wet sack over his back might have been just enough to prevent permanent scars where pray is this going curiosity im wondering if there were other enemies besides those we know of in cambury oneil said slowly if someone had held his hands to a fire it would have been quarles who wanted to avenge himself yes thats the stumbling point isnt it rutledge smiled wryly oneil said sorry i cant help you more do you by chance know anything about these cumberline funds that quarles nearly lost his reputation over oneil laughed a village doctor doesnt move in such exalted circles the laughter faded sunday night as i was trying to fall asleep i kept seeing those wings outstretched above the dead man it occurred to me that after someone hit him from behind they desecrated his body the only reason i could think of was that quarles died too easily that perhaps he was expected to die slowly up there with the wings biting into his back terrible thought isnt it onstable horton spent a wet saturday evening in the black and that possibility rutledge thought spoke more to michael brunswick than it did to hugh jones pudding it was not his first choice but his friends drank there from time to time and he went in occasionally for a pint to end his day tom little was courting a girl in the next village but one and full of himself he thought she might say yes if he proposed and his friends spent half an hour helping him find the right words amid a good deal of merriment the landlord had occasion to speak to them twice for being overloud constable horton trying his hand at peacemaking joined the group and steered the conversation in a different direction he was finishing his second glass when a halfheard comment caught his attention he brought his chairs front legs back to the floorboards with a thump and asked tommy little to repeat what hed just said little turning toward him told him it would cost him another round constable horton resigned got up to give his order and when everyone was satisfied little told him what hed seen on the road beyond hallowfields it was too late to rouse inspector padgett but constable horton was at his door as early in the morning as he thought was politic padgett went to find rutledge as soon as hed finished his breakfast heres something we ought to look into horton brought me word before id had my tea at six it seems that one thomas little and a friend were on their way back to her home last saturday evening hes courting a girl from a village not far up the road and shed spent the day with him in cambury this was ninethirty he thinks or thereabouts theyd ridden out of cambury on their bicycles just as the church clock struck nine as they were nearing honeyfold farm thats about two miles beyond hallowfields on your leftthey saw michael brunswick coming toward them on a bicycle he passed without a word and they went on their way laughing because hed looked like a thundercloud unlucky in love they called him and made up stories about the sort of woman he was seeing then they forgot all about him until little made a remark about him last night in the black pudding rutledge standing in reception said that would put brunswick at hallowfields before quarles left the greer house and if hed been away he wouldnt have known that quarles was dining in cambury there wouldnt have been any point in waiting for the man yes id thought about that but where did brunswick go when he reached cambury home to the glovers arms he told me he was in bed and asleep hard to prove hard to disprove the early service this morning isnt for another threequarters of an hour i should be able to catch brunswick before he goes to the church rutledge walked briskly toward brunwicks house and when he knocked the man opened the door with a sheaf of music in his hand he regarded rutledge with distaste and didnt invite him inside what is it now weve just learned that you were seen on the road near honeyfold farm last saturday evening at ninethirty you said nothing about it when we asked your whereabouts the night that quarles was killed why should i have it had nothing to do with his murder where had you been to glastonbury can anyone confirm that i went to dine with a friend who stopped there on his way back to london he was tired the dinner didnt last very long and i came home there was an edge to his voice now if you must know id had more to drink than was good for me and i had spent a wretched two hours listening to this man crowing over his triumphs hes a musician wed studied together i wished id never gone there i wasnt in the best of spirits when i left him which explained the comment that hed looked like a thundercloud when he passed tommy little and the girl he was courting when you reached cambury what did you do i undressed when to bed and tried to sleep harold quarles was the last person on my mind then rutledge thanked him and left its no much hamish said i didnt expect it to be he would have been too early to see quar les leaving minton street and turning toward hallowfields they must have missed each other by a quarter of an hour at the very least if he didna lie theres always that of course but little seems to feel very confident of his times rutledge stopped and turned to look over his shoulder brunswick was hurrying toward st martins his black robe streaming behind him rutledge watched him go would a man in brunswicks state of mind go meekly to bed in the hope of sleeping after being humiliated by a more successful friend especially if hed had a little too much to drink of course there was the long ride to cambury to cool his temper and wear him down but tommy little had seen the mans face and it appeared he was still smarting from the visit looking up at the perpendicular tower of st martins rutledge realized that the rectory overlooked the church on its far side he went back to the unicorn and bided his time until the morning services were over when he reached the rectory an hour after noon rutledge found heller dozing in a wicker chair in his garden a floppy hat over his face he woke up as he heard someone approaching and sat up pulling down his vest and smoothing his hair is this an official call he asked trying for a little humor but the words were heavy with worry rutledge joined him in the shade squatting to pick up a twig and twist it through his fingers its about michael brunswick he said after a moment not looking up at the rector i believe its customary for him to practice your selections for the sunday services on saturday morning do you recall if he did that on the saturday that quarles died he was meeting a friend in glastonbury there might not have been time for him to play beforehand heller was caught without an answer he sat there studying rut ledge then said he did indeed come into practice that morning a little earlier than usual as i recall i was there and heard him we talked about the anthem id chosen its a favorite of mine and so there was no need for him to play the organ that evening after his return heller sighed no need but of course he did the windows were open i could hear him from my study he wasnt playing my selections it was tortured music unhappy music i did wonder if it was his own composition and it ended in a horrid clash of notes followed by silence he looked back at the rectory as if he could find answers there in the stone and glass and mortar hes a wretched man he wants more than life has chosen to give him he plays perfectly well for us during services we are fortunate to have him why should he feel that he needs to reach for more if god had intended for him to be a great organist he wouldnt have brought him to us at cambury would he have there is much to be said for contentment and in contentment there is service rutledge stood up without answering the rector heller said you mustnt misunderstand michael brunswicks music isnt going to drive him to kill its eating at him hes the only victim rutledge said perhaps his music is the last straw in a life full of disappointments what time did he finish playing i dont know perhaps it was twenty past ten if you remember there was a mist coming in hardly noticeable at that time but an hour later it was thick enough that strands of it were already wrapping around the trees in my garden i was worried about michael and looked to see if his house was dark it was and so i went to bed myself if there had been lights on id have found an excuse to go and speak to him to offer comfort if he needed it or if not to assure myself that he was all right he took a deep breath and examined his gardening hat to avoid looking at rutledge you mustnt misconstrue what ive told you it would be wrong it would be wrong to let someone else take the blame for quarless death mr jones has already suffered for his daughters sake yes i heard what had happened at the bakery mr padgett believes it was boys acting out of spite but i think someone is grieving for quarles a woman perhaps who cared for him and believes the gossip about mr jones you warned me once mr rutledge you told me someone might come to me frightened by what theyd done and i must be careful how i dealt with them in return i warn you now rumor has always maintained that harold quarles had a mistress in cambury i dont know if its true or not but if it is shes not one of the women he flirts with in public shes someone he visited quietly i suspect when no one was looking if she exists i say shes had no way to grieve openly while everyone in sight is gloating over quarless death alone lonely she must be desolate and it will turn her mind in time just beware it was an odd speech for a man of the cloth to make to a policeman surely you can guess no ive never wanted to know whose wife or sister or daughter she may be i can do nothing for her until she comes to me this is just a friendly warning thank you rector ill bear it in mind but he thought that heller was intending to turn his attention away from michael brunswick by using village gossip to his own ends he was a naive man in many ways and he might consider a small white lie in gods cause no great problem for his conscience ye ken hamish said he doesna want to lose his organist its why he defends him sae fiercely he turned to walk away but heller stopped him i told you that i refused to judge lest i be judged its good advice even for a policeman but the fact remained rutledge told hamish in the silence of his mind that there was proof now that michael brunswick could have crossed paths with harold quarles to test it he stood on the street just above michael brunswicks door and looked toward the high street the angle was right as hed thought it might be coming home from st martins brunswick would have had a clear view of minton street and the corner that quarles would have turned on his way back to hallowfields the mist hadnt come down then and brunswick needing someone or something on which to expend his anger and frustration might have watched quarles walk up the high street alone he could have cut across the green without being noticed followed at a distance and let the trees shield him on the straight stretch of road that marched with the wall of the estate why did the dead man no go through the gates and up the drive because it must be shorter to come in by the farm gate and cut across the parkland rutledge went to fetch the motorcar and drove out to hallowfields leaving it by the main gate then he paced the distances from there to the house and again from the home farm lane to the house because of the twists and turns of the drive allowing for vistas and specimen trees set out to be admired it was nearly three hundred yards longer if he was tired it would have made sense for harold quarles to choose the shorter distance brunswick might have called to him or challenged him and if quarles had turned away in rejection of what he wanted to say that act could have precipitated the murder listen to me im tired i want my bed you have nothing to say to me that i have any interest in hearing those white stones stood outbrunswick neednt have thought to bring a weaponand in a split second without a word quarles would have been knocked down it was the second blow that mattered had brunswick intended it as the death stroke rutledge could see him still caught up in that fierce need to hurt as hed been hurt stepping back too late shocked by the suddenness of death it would have been easy to convince himself that quarles had brought on the attack by his callous indifference to feel no responsibility for what hed just done and then the slow realization that the man had got off too lightly a quick death compared to hazel brunswicks drowning must have triggered his next actions the facts fit together neatly then why rutledge wondered was he feeling dissatisfied standing there on the lawns of hallowfields looking for holes in his own case he walked on to the house and this time knocked at the door asking for mrs quarles when downing opened it shes with her son come back another day if she could spare me a few minutes id be grateful his words were polite but his voice was uncompromising she went away and in a few minutes conveyed him with clear disapproval to the formal drawing room mrs quarles came in after him dressed in deep mourning she was very pale as if the ordeal of breaking the news to her son had taken its toll against the backdrop of the drawing room pale blue and silver she was almost a formidable figure and he thought she must have intended to impress him after his impudence in demanding to see her what is it you want to know mr rutledge whether ive turned into a grieving widow there are some questions about your husbands past that could have waited i bid you good day he stood his ground i think youre probably the only person who knew your husband well with the possible exception of mr penrith i have no idea what mr penrith thinks or knows about my late husband i have never asked him nor will i there are some discrepancies that id like to clear up weve learned that mr quarles removed the remains of his family from the village where they lived and died to another churchyard but no one who lived in the old village has any recollection of him as a child you have been busy havent you i cant speak for anyone who does or doesnt recall his childhood he did move his family but that was after our son was born or so i was told he never took me north with him it was a painful chapter in his life and i was content to leave it closed we would also like more information about his enlistment in the army did he see action during the boer war or was he posted elsewhere in the empire her face changed from irritation to a stillness that was unnatural was he in that war he never spoke of it to me her voice was crisp dismissive and her eyes were cold was that when he met davis penrith i have no idea it was my impression they met at the firm where they were employed can you tell me anything about the burns on your husbands hands they were quite severe and possibly inflicted by someone else if so they may have a bearing on his murder she moved swiftly reaching for the bell good day mr rutledge behind him downing opened the door and mrs quarles nodded to her rutledge turned to the housekeeper i dont believe weve finished our conversation thank you mrs downing the housekeeper looked to her mistress for guidance but mrs quarles walked past rutledge without a word or a glance and left him standing there he could hear her heels clicking over the marble of the foyer and then the sound of footsteps as she climbed the stairs mrs downing was still waiting he let her show him to the door from somewhere in the house he could hear a boys voice calling to someone and lighter footsteps approaching but the door was shut so swiftly behind him that he didnt see marcus quarles after all walking back to where hed left the motorcar along the road rutledge pondered his conversation with mrs quarles most of his questions had been based on a little knowledge and good deal of guesswork nevertheless the dead mans widow had been disturbed by them oddly enough he was beginning to see a pattern in harold quar less actions the man had removed his family from their original grave site and reburied them in a place where they werent known only the headstones in the churchyard identified them and no one in this other village would have any memory of them or the boy who wasntyetlaid to rest among them and there was the story to explain his burns lending an air of heroism to the other tales hed spun of course there had to be an explanation the scars were obvious to anyone who met him or shook hands over a business agreement but rutledge thought that mrs quarles had a very good idea how hed come by them whatever the rest of the world believed as for the army quarless service had been quietly put behind him either because he hadnt particularly distinguished himself or his service record was dismal and davis penrith had done the same thing with any luck london would have those records for him in another day and a telephone call to yorkshire would confirm the removal of the graves harold quarles had created the face he showed his business associates with great care what was behind the mask brunswick was right something must be there hamish said ye ken hes the victim thats true rutledge answered turning the motorcar back toward cambury but where there are secrets murder sometimes follows or blackmail was that what brunswick had been moving toward take the bookseller stephenson quarles wouldnt tell him why he refused to contact the army on the sons behalf it must have seemed unbelievably cruel to a desperate father and stephenson brooded over it to the point that he wanted to kill the man who else is out there nursing a grudge and waiting for the chance to do something about it a straw in a haystack hamish said yes well the yard is often very good at finding straws but hamish laughed without humor it doesna signify if the murderer here isna the baker nor the bookseller yere left with the man who plays the church organ he hammered on for the next hour as rutledge sat by the long windows overlooking the high street and wrote a report covering everything hed learned so far there were loose ends there were always loose ends murder was never closed in a tidy package who had wrecked the bakery how could anyone prove that brunswick had indeed seen quarles leaving the greer house and turning for home who had argued with quarles there brunswick himself greer rutledge left the sheets of paper on the table and went out again crossing the high street and walking on to knock on brunswicks door the man was haggard and shorttempered as well what is it this time i need to find some answers that are eluding me when you stopped playing the organ that saturday night a week ago when quar les was killed did you leave the church at once or sit there for a short period of time brunswick blinked as if uncertain where rutledge had got his information and what it signified idont recall if you travel from the church to this house for a small part of that journey particularly when youre on foot you have a clear view of minton street at just about the time you might have done that perhaps tenthirty harold quarles was coming out of the house where hed dined between there and where minton meets the high street he encountered someone who argued with him their voices were loud they may have carried this far i need to know the name of that man or woman with him brunswick stood there his gaze not leaving rutledges face it was a turning point and the man was well aware of it if he admitted to seeing quarles he was admitting as well that he could have killed the man he had only to say i must have walked home earlier than that i didnt see quarles at all much less hear him talking to someone on minton street or i didnt leave the church for another quarter of an hour or more i couldnt have seen himthe clock in the tower was striking eleven and it would have been impossible whatever the police suspected to prove otherwise rutledge waited finally michael brunswick said i didnt see quarles you must have heard his voice no hamish said hes afraid to tell ye after a moment brunswick went on if quarles was there hed already gone all right ill accept that the timing wasnt perfect who was still there who had been with him only a matter of seconds before it was davis penrith brunswick had condemned himself with four words davis penrith had been in scotland that weekend staying with his wife rutledge was torn between going to london himself and asking the yard to request a statement from penrith regarding his weekend in scotland in the end he compromised and telephoned the man at his home penrith was distant when he came to take rutledges call but as the reason for it was explained he said here this is ridiculous ive a letter from my wife let me fetch it he came back to the telephone within two minutes its dated the thursday after my return ill read you the pertinent passage mama was so pleased you could come however short the visit and mr and mrs douglas were delighted you were here to dine with them we have become dear friends shall i invite them to stay with us in june when theyll be in town where does your motherinlaw live in annan thats just over the border from carlisle rutledge knew that part of scotland if penrith had been there for the weekend he couldnt have reached cambury and returned to annan without losing the better part of two daysthe journey was close on three hundred miles each way when did you leave for the weekend my staff can tell youi left here thursday evening and i set out from annan just after our luncheon on sunday as you may remember you found me at home on monday morning because i got in so late will you go to sergeant gibson at the yard and give him a written statement to that effect show him the letter as well if it will help to find harolds killer rutledge thanked him and broke the connection sitting there by the telephone he considered his next step he had sufficient evidence for several inquests he could show a very good case for hugh jones stephenson and now brunswick they would undoubtedly be bound over for trial his duty done why of all people had brunswick named penrith to shield someone else or to make a point hamish said he told ye he didna care rutledge crossed the room and opened the door before he answered hamish why did brunswick look into quarless past aye its a sticking point a different kind of revenge to bring the man down and make him watch the dissolution of everything that matters to him it doesna suit the mans temperament rutledge wasnt satisfied in an odd sort of way it does if he thinks theres no chance for a convictiondespite his pleas to be hangedhis name and photograph will be in every newspaper in england as he talks about his wife and his music and what sort of man harold quarles was he could ha tried blackmail and it didna serve hadnt mrs downing said brunswick had come to quarles for money after his wifes death was that why he was so angry that his wife wasnt carrying a child when she died it would have made a better case yon bookseller also asked to be hanged yes because he had nothing to live for brunswicks wife failed him his music has failed him and he would like nothing better than to make someone else pay for his trouble rutledge was walking through reception if wed found brunswick dead id know where to lookat harold quarles the chief constable is waiting hamish answered and old bowels as well there was nothing for it now but to cross the high street and report his findings to inspector padgett padgett was not as pleased as rutledge had expected him to be he was idly making designs on a sheet of paper frowning as he listened his gaze on his pen rather than rutledges face ill speak to the chief constable of course but are you sure he doesnt like a muddled case theres jones the little family notwithstanding and as far as we know he could have wrecked his own bakery in an effort to elicit sympathy you said yourself that nothing of great value was broken did i tell you i did bring in the two most likely vandals and their parents can account for their whereabouts that night i saw his face jones hadnt done it yes well weve looked at this before who grieves for harold quarles not his wife the mistress that everyone would like us to believe in as far as im concerned if she exists you were right about it being the little wife killed quite by accident by her soldier husband ive even asked my wife if she knew who the mistress was and her answer was tellingthat quarles hadnt started the rumor other people had his son the boy was home wasnt he when this happened and fourteen is a wild age emotions hot and temper hotter but i daresay his mother never let him out of her sight if you disagree with my conclusions tell me so its not that i disagree i dont like any murder on my patch and most particularly not one that attracts the notice of london padgett had been vacillating since the beginning rutledge was losing patience then i shall speak to the chief constableand leave you out of it no ill do it i told you whats this business about penrith brunswick named him as the person arguing with quarles outside the greer house im not sure it wasnt for a very good reason no one saw a strange motorcar in cambury that night nor did they see a strange man wandering about rutledge had already considered that question penrith is known to many people in cambury he came here from time to time when he and quarles were partners would they have considered him a stranger i expect they wouldnt yet the evidence is clear he was in scotland padgett capped his pen and threw it down on the desk brunswicks a coldblooded chap that fits the fact that the body was moved and trussed up in that rig its not everyones cup of tea touching someone theyve just killed rutledge said tell me again why you acted so quickly to summon the yard while quarles was still up there in the harness before youd even had time to consider the evidence inspector padgett smiled i wanted to walk away with clean hands the man put me in the wrong with the chief constable twice over third times unlucky no one can say i didnt follow the rules to the letter even his widow i got my own back there im satisfied it was late the day had worn on to the point that clouds had rolled in and the sunset was lost behind them rutledge walked in the churchyard for a time unable to bear his roomwhen he had come back to it it had felt close claustrophobic as if storm clouds were moving in he had left at once and without conscious thought found himself in the grassy paths that wandered among the headstones hamish reflecting his own mood was giving rutledge the rough edge of his tongue reminding him that barely a year before hed been a broken man in the clinic to which his sister frances had removed him rutledge couldnt recall much of that change the new surroundings had confused him and dr fleming looking for a handhold on his new patients sanity was probing into things best left buried deep and covered over with layer upon layer of excuses he hadnt expected to survive he hadnt cared much either way except when he saw his sisters troubled face the strain and exhaustion almost mirroring his own as she sat with him hour after hour day after day seldom sleeping sometimes taking his hand or when he couldnt bear to be touched talking softly to him about the distant past about anything but the war or jean who had walked away and never looked back now he was pacing a somerset churchyard debating his own wisdom to rutledges surprise padgett hadnt taken brunswick into custody still he was preparing to present their findings in the case to the chief constable in the morning and ask for an inquest to be held and afterward rutledge would be free to leave for london rutledge cut across what hamish was saying the soft scots voice heavy with accusation and condemnation finally falling silent who wrecked the bakery id feel better about the case if that had been cleared up there was no answer from hamish there has to be a reason for it a hand behind it but whose silence no ones shed a tear for the man but that was wrong one person had the maid betty who cleaned quarless rooms and kept the gatehouse tidy who had been left a bequest of money when all she wanted from her employer was the promise of a roof over her head when he died rutledge had almost forgot her she was a pale figure on the fringe of the group of servants a tired woman folding the sheets feeling her years wondering what was to become of her rutledge turned back to the unicorns yard and retrieved his motorcar as he did a few drops of rain splashed the windscreen leaving dusty blotches by the time he reached hallowfields it was coming down in earnest and a rumble of thunder sounded in the distance he dashed through the rain to the door and knocked loudly the footman who answered seemed not to know what to do about the policeman on the steps and rutledge said im here to see one of the maids take me to the servants hall if you please the man stepped back and let him enter rutledge walked briskly toward the door leading to the servants stairs and found the staff gathered in mrs downings sitting room listening to the sunday evening reading from the bible heads turned as he stood in the doorway mrs downing said were at prayers ill wait in the passage he shut the door and walked a dozen steps away listening to the soft murmur of voices after five minutes or so mrs downing came out of her sitting room her face severe what is it this time id like to speak to betty the woman who took care of mr quarless yes i know who she is give me a minute she went back into her parlor and dismissed the staff keeping betty with her when they had gone about their duties she herself left the room and held the door open for rutledge to enter betty was waiting apprehension in her face rutledge asked her to sit down then told her they had very likely found her employers murderer it would be only a matter of days before it was official her hands clenched in her lap she said who is it im not at liberty to tell you that but it isnt hugh jones the baker he could read her emotions as they flitted across her face surprise bewilderment shame they were talking in the servants hall she said the man who brings the milk told the scullery maid that hed confessed mr jones gave the police a statement it wasnt a confession he wont be arrested why are you telling me this and not the others because i think you know did you go to the bakery in the middle of the night was it you who destroyed everything you could lay hands to tears filled her eyes but didnt fall hes been good to me mmr quarles no one else cared but i did i wanted to punish whoever had killed him i wanted to make him as wretched as i was you succeeded in making mr jones wretched he didnt deserve it but they talk the servants i hear them his daughter had come home and he was distraught everyone said he was the only one who could have put mr quarles up in that wicker cage they said hed done it to show that mr quarles was no angel that hed tormented the jones family until they couldnt stand it any longer yes i know the police nearly made that same mistake but it wasnt true you owe him an apology and restitution how can i pay for what ive done i only have my wages she was gripping her hands together until the knuckles were white and then she looked at rutledge he said terrible things about mr quarles when he sent his daughter away what does he owe for that you arent mr quarless defender he has a wife and a son to protect his good name his wife hated him as much as the rest did but the boy marcus is a good child he would have made his father proud its hard to think of him fatherless if they hang this man youve decided killed mr quarles id like to be there why do you think his wife turned against him it was a happy marriage for some time or so i was led to believe and so it was i was never told what it is she holds against him but she said once when she didnt know i was there if she knew a way shed wash the very blood out of master marcuss veins if it would do any good mr archer called that a cruel thing to say but she answered him sharply you cant imagine what cruelty is charles i cant sleep at night for remembering what was done youve known mr quarles for some years what was his wife talking about he was a hard man but not half the things said about him are true i think she wanted an excuse to live with mr archer to make it right in her own eyes i think she believed hed feel better about living under her roof if he thought she was married to a monster she wiped her eyes with the back of her hand he was good to me thats all i know no one else ever was the next morning as rutledge was packing his valise he was summoned to the telephone it was sergeant gibson ive had a bit of luck sir remember the constable you spoke with on saturday when you left me a message yes i do the lions head and a small boy charging his mates a few farthings to look at it that was constable wainwright sir over the weekend he spoke to his father about fighting the boers his father saw a good deal of action and he remembers private penrith described him as a fair slender chap a quiet one keeping to himself for the most part said he was reminded of the young prince of wales sir this was in cape town just before corporal wainwright was to sail home penrith was quite the hero according to wainwright he walked miles back to a depot for help after the boers ambushed the train he was taking north there was talk of a medal but penrith himself quashed that idea he says he was too late all the men were dead by the time rescue reached them he blamed himself he was the sole survivor according to wainwrights account yes sir he was knocked about when the train came to a screeching halt and dazed but his rifle had been fired though he couldnt remember much about the action hardly a record to be ashamed of no sir shall i go on looking at mr penriths military career no yes when did he leave the army and where else did he serve did corporal wainwright mention one harold quarles i dont believe he did sir include him in your search and gibson i want to be sure who and what this davis penrith is one source has told me his father lived in hampshire another that his father lived in sussex i want that cleared up yes sir i believe one davis penrith came in this morning to make his statement about a journey to scotland is this the same man sir it is wouldnt it be simpler to send a constable around to ask him these questions rutledge said hes already answered one of them but not to my satisfaction sergeant gibson said neutrally indeed sir rutledge broke the connection absently rubbing his jaw with his fingers so penrith was apparently all he claimed to be no one however had so far explained the confusion between hampshire and sussex but it might be nothing more mysterious than being born in one county and growing up in the other for the moment he put penrith out of his mind and went in search of hugh jones the bakery was still closed on this monday morning but it was ready for use as soon as fresh supplies arrived jones said as rutledge came through the door i managed to bake bread this morning for my regular customers only twenty loaves but a start it was all the flour i had i think ive found the person who did this damage an elderly maid at hallowfields shed served quarles seen only his best side apparently and she was told that you had killed him hence the vandalism jones sighed he still makes trouble for me even in death im grateful mrs quarles took him away from here to bury him else id fear to walk through the churchyard of a night inspector padgett is satisfied that weve found quarless killer hell be taken into custody sometime this morning who is it youll hear soon enough the evidence points strongly to michael brunswick another family quarles destroyed ah well im sorry for him hes a man haunted by disappointment but i never saw him as a murderer inspector padgett believed brunswick could have killed his wife there was a lot of talk at the time no one paid much attention to it thank you for telling me about what happened here rutledge left the baker and walked on to the police station padgett had just returned from his meeting with the chief constable he agrees theres enough evidence to make an arrest well see what the lawyers can make of it now i expect youre wanted back in london ill deal with brunswick hes at the church playing the organ i spoke to rector on my way in and he told me he wants to be present i think hes afraid brunswick will do something foolish i dont see it that way rutledge went there himself and stood in the open door at the side of st martins listening to the music for a time brunswick was practicing an oratorio struggling with it going over and over the more complicated sections until he got it right and locked into his memory it was a long and frustrating session when hed finished he launched into a hymn he knew well and the difference in the two pieces was telling brunswick had ability but not the soaring skill that great musicians strove for hearing voices approaching rutledge went back to the hotel to fetch his valise coming down the stairs again he stopped by reception hunter was there to bid him farewell and a safe journey half an hour after hed driven out of cambury the telephone in the small parlor beyond the stairs began to ring the staff was busy with the noonday meal and no one heard it it was an uneventful drive to the city rutledge arrived late and went directly to his flat the next morning he called on davis penrith at his home weve found your former partners murderer he was taken into custody yesterday and charged the inquest will find enough evidence to bind him over for trial penriths face was still who is he the organist at st martins he believed his late wife had an affair with quarles she killed herself penrith searched for something to say im sorry to hear it theres one small matter to clear up with you penrith smiled wryly i told you my father was curate in hampshire only for five years before moving on to sussex my mother was alive then it was a happy time the living in sussex was cramped and wretched i tend not to think of it if i dont have to i hope it didnt cause you any trouble none at all rutledge answered blandly well then thank you for telling me about this man brunswick im glad the matter is cleared up for the sake of mrs quarles and marcus penrith prepared to show rutledge out walking to the study door actually that wasnt the matter i wished to bring up surprised penrith stopped his hand on the knob i cant think of anything else that needs to be clarified i made my statement youll find it at the yard thank you no what i wanted to clarify are several names i have here on my list mr butler is dead i believe mr willard and mr hester mr morgan and mr simpleton and mr macdonald were investors in the cumberline fiasco wary penrith said where did you find those names they were in a box marked cumberline in harold quarless study he could see the anger and frustration in penriths face indeed and what else of interest did you find in his study very little weve managed to look at these seven men and determine that they had no reason to attack and kill mr quarles no of course they wouldnt they are men of some reputation they value their privacy and they arent likely to wait almost two years for a paltry revenge if you consider murder paltry thats not what i meant im sure they would have preferred taking the matter to court ruining us and making harold quarles and myself laughingstocks they are ruthless businessmen its the way they settle matters such as cumberline but they saw that in taking our firm to court their own business practices might come under scrutiny i can tell you that these men lost no more than they could afford to lose they knew from the start that it was a risky investment but they also had cecil rhodes in their sights and their greed won over their common sense was this other investor a man named evering penrith must have been prepared for the question but it still nearly splintered his carefully preserved calm evering was one of harolds clients he made the decision to include the man was cumberline the reason you broke with quarles penrith fiddled with the fob on his watch chain all right yes it was i thought cumberline was risky from the start i thought quar les was taking a direction wed never taken before with the firm i thought his judgment was failing him but he had his reasons for offering cumberline he said and it would do us no harm financially he was right though it was a closerun thing i felt that the good name of the firmand more important the good will of james quarles and penrithwas tarnished what was his reason did he ever tell you not in so many words most of these men had made their money in the war cutting corners shoddy goods whatever turned a penny he said the poor sods in the trenches didnt count for anything if a shilling could be made from their suffering and it was the same greed that made cumberline so attractive to such men was evering also profiting from the war i have no idea youd have to ask quarles and hes dead penrith took out his watch i really must go i have matters to attend to in my office he held the door for rutledge and there was nothing for it but to thank penrith and leave rutledge drove to the yard and reported to chief superintendent bowles who appeared to be less than happy to hear there was a successful conclusion to the inquiry it was two hours later when sergeant gibson came to his office and said the penrith in south africa was born in hampshire his father lost his living there and went on to sussex where he didnt prosper his son joined the army for lack of funds for a proper education and served his time without distinction save for one heroic act when the train was attacked what else thats the lot he never went back to sussex instead he made his way in the city and most recently set up his own investment firm after leaving james quarles and penrith and quarles almost the same story survived the attack was badly injured and didnt go back to his unit until they were ready to sail he was from yorkshire but like penrith settled in london both men served their time and that was that all right leave your report on my desk a wildgoose chase why hamish wanted to know did penrith deny theyd served atall or knew each ither before london rutledge reached for the report and went through it again looking for what injuries had sent quarles to hospital for such a long recovery he found it a short notation in gibsons scrawl burned in attack nearly lost hands mrs quarles must have discovered this as well if she hadnt already known about her husbands service in south africa hardly sufficient reason to demand a separation and even if brunswick had learned of it few people would care even if he shouted it from the rooftops hamish said it doesna signify let it rest rutledge turned to the paperwork on his desk concentrating on the written pages before him in his absence there were a number of cases where he would be expected to give testimony and he marked his calendar accordingly then he read reports of ongoing inquiries where the sergeants in charge were collating evidence and passing it on for a superior to inspect he made comments in the margins and set the files aside for collection three hours later hed come to the bottom of the stack and the report that sergeant gibson had prepared about the military backgrounds of quarles and penrith the sergeant had summarized the material in his usual concise style and his oral report had matched it rutledge tossed the folder back on his desk for collection and filing and sat back in his chair rubbing his eyes hamish was restless his voice loud in the small office rattling the windows with its force rutledge warned theyll hear you in the passage before he realized he was speaking aloud but hamish was in no mood to be silent rutledge reached for a folder again realized it was gibsons report and tried to read it word for word in an effort to shut out hamishs tirade gibson in his thoroughness had attached a copy of penriths military service record to support his notes it was nearly impossible to concentrate and rutledge shut his eyes against the thundering noise in his head the last line on the page seemed to burn into his skull and he flipped the folder closed shutting his eyes and trying to concentrate it was several minutes before his brain registered anything more than pain he wasnt even certain hed seen it but he lifted the report a last time and tried to find it first in the summation and then in the military record itself and almost missed it again lieutenant timothy barton evering the name of the officer in charge when the train was attacked gibson for all his thoroughness had had no way of knowing that it mattered rutledge had been searching for different information and it was only because the sergeant was not one to leave any fact undocumented that the name was even included rutledge stood up the sheet of paper still in his hand and went to find gibson but the sergeant had gone out to interview a witness for one of the other inspectors rutledge went back to his desk took up the file reached for his hat and left the building he found davis penrith in his office brushing aside a reluctant clerk rutledge opened the door instead and strode in without waiting for penrith to take in his abrupt appearance rut ledge said i thought you told me you didnt know an evering that he was quarless client i dont the officer in charge of the train ambushed out on the veldt was timothy barton evering penriths mouth dropped open it took him several seconds to recover then he fell back on anger what are you doing searching through my past im neither the murder victim nor a suspect in his death youll speak to my solicitor inspector and explain yourself timothy barton evering hes dead man there were no other survivors then who is ronald evering his son i dont know any ronald evering i told you the investors in cumberline were quarless clients not mine now get out of my office and leave me alone rutledge turned on his heel and left back at the yard he left a message for chief superintendent bowles that he would not be in the office for the next three days went to his flat and packed his valise it was a long drive all the way to cornwall rutledge had sufficient time to wonder why it mattered so much to tie up a loose end that in no way affected the outcome of a case that was already concluded all the same action had improved his headache and that in itself was something penrith had given incomplete answers three times once about where his father had been curate once about quarless background and again about evering whatever it was that mrs quarles knew and brunswick had been determined to ferret out davis penrith must know as well there was a secret somewhere and whether it had a bearing on this murder or not it connected three people who on the surface of things had nothing in common hamish said do ye think the three acted together if so yere a fool why has penrith felt compelled to lie to me if id gone to hampshire looking for his past id have found only a fiveyearold boy if id gone to sussex id have discovered that the grown man had served in the army and there was nothing in the legend of harold quarles about his military career short as it was hed have used it if it had in any way served his purpose they were no deserters they didna need to hide precisely constable wainwrights father called penrith the sole survivor of that massacre on the train yet quarles survived as well it was penrith who was pointed oot to him yes the handsome young soldier who reminded wainwright of the prince of wales slender and fair and a hero what was quarles doing while penrith was being a hero why wasnt he one as well his wounds were serious enough to keep him in hospital for a long time and back in london why didnt penriths heroics become as famous as quarless escape from the mines it would have stood him in good stead in many quarters he drove on what will one ronald evering have to say about his own investment in the cumberline stocks and his fathers dealings with penrith and quarles the sea was rough and the mail boat bucketed through the waves like a live thing fighting the water every foot of the crossing rutledge shouting to the master over the noise of the sea and the creaking of the boat asked him to point out st annes that one you can barely see the top of it from here its our third port do you know the everings these many years visiting are you an unexpected guest rutledge said watching the little island take shape but it was another hour and threequarters before they reached the tiny bay that was st annes harbor and their voices were suddenly loud as the wind dropped and the seas smoothed in the lee of the land evering must not have got word you were coming today the master said lighting his pipe the house usually sends down a cart for visitors are there often visitors not often ronald everings the last of the family and not much for entertaining rutledge watched as the man maneuvered the small craft toward the stone quay and efficiently secured it to the iron rings that held it against the fenders off you go he said to rutledge nodding to the path that ran down to the harbor up there cross the road and when you see the arbor follow the path to the house would you mind carrying up the mail it would save me a trip rutledge took the packet that was held out to him will you be going back today most likely then ill come for you rutledge stepped out onto the quay and waved to the departing mail boat as he reached the path it ran up the sloping hillside in looping curves as if a goat had been the first to climb here as he went the wind reached him again and he carried his hat in his hand to keep it from flying off halfway up he could see the scilly isles spread out before him like a map the four or five larger ones showing signs of habitation the smaller ones dotting the sea like afterthoughts on the northern exposures the bare rocky slopes of the nearest islands were covered with what appeared to be heather while the sunnier southern parts of the islands were green it was a very different world from london or indeed from cornwall the sun began to break through the clouds watery and halfhearted as rutledge reached the road and crossed it to the evering house it was beautifully situated facing the south and protected from the north by a higher slope than the one on which it stood he came to the arbor opened the lovely swanneck gate and took the shell path up to the door the master of the mail boat told him that there had been shipbuilding on the largest island in the last century but here on st annes were fields of flowering bulbs and perennials he could see that the daffodils were already dying back their yellow and green leaves covering long beds the brass knocker on the door was shaped like a pair of swans like the top of the gate in the arbor a middleaged woman came to answer the door she seemed surprised to see a stranger there and craned her neck to look beyond him toward the harbor the mail boat was just rounding the headland ronald evering please my name is ian rutledge she stepped aside to let him come into the foyer and said doubtfully ill ask if mr evering will see you disappearing down a passage she glanced over her shoulder as if to see if he was real or had vanished when her back was turned after several minutes she led him into a small parlor that overlooked the sea which he thought every room in this house must save for the kitchen quarters evering was standing by the cold hearth and regarded rutledge with some interest do i know you we seldom have visitors on st annes but sometimes people come to see the seals or watch the birds we let them camp near the headland im here to ask you about your father my father evering was at a loss yes lieutenant timothy barton evering ronald evering said without inflection my elder brother hes dead why should you be interested in him because he served in south africa can you tell me the circumstances surrounding his death they are painful to me i prefer not to discuss them why are you interested in him he asked again are you writing a book on that war if so my brothers death was a footnote no more there is more interesting material to be found im sure rutledge changed his ground its my understanding that you were one of the investors in the cumberline stock scheme is that true evering was very still who are you and what do you want here im inspector ian rutledge from scotland yard mr evering he held out his identification harold quarles has been murdered evering turned away toward the mantelpiece his hands gripping the mahogany edge his head bowed i hadnt heard im sorry when did this happen where in somerset where his country house is located some ten days ago evering took a deep breath i hope youve found his killer yes hes already in custody it was when i was searching mr quarless rooms that i came across your name in connection with cumberline in his study he kept a file on the transactions evering turned to face rutledge and how did you learn about my brother we were looking up harold quarless service records in an effort to find out what role if any his past played in his death i cant see how south africa matters or the cumberline stocks surely neither of those could be connected to murder not to my knowledge but it pays to be thorough mr evering how long have you known mr quarles not very long i invested a sum of money with him and it didnt prosper did you know when you invested your money that quarles had served under your brother in the boer war evering glanced toward the windows where a shaft of errant sunlight had turned the sea from gray to deep green the war department gave us very little information about my brothers death he died on active duty and served his country well thats what my father was told in the telegram i was very young at the time and if he learned more he never spoke of it and so it was quite by chance that you should choose an investment offered by two men who served in your brothers company neither mr quarles nor mr penrith ever mentioned the fact if they recognized the name or knew my relationship to timothy i didnt realize it did you deal with both partners penrith and quarles yes i talked to mr quarles first and then he brought in mr penrith it sounded straightforward told without hesitation or attempt to conceal is that all you came to ask me mr rutledge im informed that penrith and quarles were the only survivors of the boer attack do you know if thats true ive told youi know very little about how timothy died the fact of his death was enough my parents never recovered from the shock yes i can understand were you in the great war mr rutledge if you were you can appreciate that many details of what happens in a battle are not reported my brothers commanding officer wrote a very fine letter to my father and it said very little beyond the fact that timothy died bravely and didnt suffer that he was an honor to his regiment showed great promise as an officer and would have had a fine career in the army if hed lived how many such letters does an officer write he could say the same thing to a dozen grieving families and who would be the wiser it is meant well sometimes the details aredistressing yes im sure that must be true for my mothers sake i was grateful she died not knowing whether he suffered or not which is what really mattered in the end evering gestured to the chairs that stood between them wont you sit down mr rutledge ill ring for tea it will be some time before the boat returns thank you rutledge took the chair indicated and waited until evering had given the order for tea to the woman whod answered the door one of the reasons im following up on the south african campaign is that something that happened in harold quarless service out therehe served nowhere else you seedisturbed his wife to such a degree that there was a serious breach with her husband it lasted until his death evering considered rutledge for a moment and then said i dont know what to say ive never met mrs quarles or spoken to her does she think thiswhatever it washad to do with my brother i have no way of knowing what it is im here to learn as much as i can about the only serious action quarles saw during the war its a mystery to me but if she tells you anything that i ought to know please send me word id be grateful the tea came and they drank it in silence rutledges mind was occupied and evering seemed to have little conversation as if living alone in this empty silent house had shaped his spirit but as he set his teacup down rutledge asked and so as the only surviving son you inherited this house my fathers family was one of the earliest settlers here generations ago we are as close to native here as anyone can be you either love or hate it my brother joined the army because he wanted adventure and excitement both in short supply here on st annes my mother called it a need to be a man and persuaded herself that in due course hed come home marry and settle here for the rest of his life as the elder son thats what was expected of him instead he died in a place none of us had ever heard of and couldnt find on a map look theres the mail boat no passengers to hold it up today you should be there when it comes in mr rutledge i almost forgot rutledge reached into his pocket and brought out the packet of mail i was to give you this he glanced at the return address on the top envelop but said nothing evering thanked him and sent for the maid to bring rutledges coat and hat im afraid it will be a wet crossing those clouds on the horizon spell rain thank you for coming mr rutledge im sorry i couldnt be more helpful but rutledge as he went out into the wind smelling now of rain thought that on the whole ronald evering had not been sorry at all by the time the boat reached the mainland they were caught in a downpour and in spite of his useless umbrella rutledge managed to start his motorcar without drowning cutting across cornwall in the direction of dunster rutledge spent the night there with the maitlands newly returned from their wedding trip and delighted to see him they would have kept him longer but he was up before dawn the next morning and by first light was well on the road again heading for cambury he drove straight through the village when he reached the high street and out to hallowfields mrs quarles was in mourning he was told and not seeing anyone tell her i know about evering he said and in three minutes he was facetoface with harold quarless widow in the formal drawing room she was not happy to see him and the two small dogs at her feet growled as he entered i thought we were fortunate in not having to deal with scotland yard any longer she told him shortly and here you are again she didnt ask him to sit down im afraid that im rather tenacious when it comes to making certain that the man i hang is indeed the killer i was looking for you have doubts about brunswick but i was told he confessed for reasons of his ownwhich may or may not be the right reasons its evering im interested in and how he died who told you about evering was it penrith if you tell me it was i wont believe you penrith would as soon keep the matter quiet hes lied to me enough to make me suspicious and that wasnt very clever of him then youll hear nothing from me mrs quarles im very close to stumbling on the truth if you know everings name then you know what it is im after and i warn you its very likely that michael brunswick knows more than i do and that hell use what he knows at his trial to disgrace your husband publicly theres no way brunswick could know anything i wouldnt have learned the truth myself if harold hadnt been so drunk one night that he talked in his sleep it was as if he were having a waking nightmare ive never seen anything before or since to match it the next morning i confronted him with it and at first he told me i was imagining things and then he swore hed see me dead if i said anything to anyone i knew then that it was true and i left him because i couldnt stand to be in the same room with him or feel those hands she broke off you might as well tell me mrs quarles i wont walk away until i know the whole truth about your husband if it has nothing to do with his murder i will never speak of it you can trust my word on that she stared at him what use to me is your word its better that i find out than someone else trying to pry into the past walking past him to the door maybelle quarles opened it quickly as if expecting to find mrs downing there with her ear pressed to the panel but the passage was empty she closed it again and went to the window looking out when she spoke she had pitched her voice low so that it barely reached his ears you are a persistent man mr rutledge very well i will tell you what you want to know not because of the persistence but because by your digging its possible that other people will get wind of the truth and we will never have peace in this family again turning back to him she said baldly my husband burned lieutenant evering alive after shooting the wounded on that train gentle god rutledge said softly in heavens name why i dont know i wish i did it would make my own nightmares easier to bear does penrith know surely he must know the soldiers who reached the train misread what they saw and penrith made no move to correct them they must have thought harold was burned trying to save the lieutenant they believed the boers had come into the train and killed the wounded my husband was delirious he couldnt tell them what had happened after penrith went for help it could well be true in that nightmare he relived listening to evering die he relived shooting the wounded he lay there writhing on the bed and begged god to help him after hed burned his hands to make it appear hed done his best hed kept that secret so long that it was tormenting him and that night he confessed to god or the devil i dont know which and i sat there afraid to call for help listening to it all rutledge had only to look at the torment in her face to believe her to understand why she hated the man shed married and couldnt bear to live with him and yet shed never divorced him why did you stay with quarles i have a son harold would have taken him from me if id told anyone else im not a fool mr rutledge i knew the danger of living under the same roof with a murderer but i did it for marcus and god saw fit on that saturday night to release me from my prison and i have thanked him on my knees for it why didnt you consider killing him yourself if you felt afraid and leave my child without a father or a mother i think not he left soon after there was nothing more he could say to the woman standing by the empty grate staring down into flames that she could see only in her mind and there was no comfort he could give her it was beyond any words he could utter and it would be patronizing to try hamish said as rutledge pointed the bonnet of the motorcar down the drive it doesna change the murder or who did it quarles was a strange man a killer at heart ruthless and coldblooded and yet he could be kind as well what was it miss ohara said that someone should be given a medal for ridding cambury of the ogre all at once he could hear shouting in the distance and stopped the car to listen it appeared to be coming from the home farm he got out walked a little way across the lawns and saw that masters and one of his men were wading into the pond just beyond the barns and outbuildings something was in it a long blue streak in the middle of water already turning muddy from the hurried thrashing of their feet he raced toward the farm watching the scene play out like a drama on a stage masters was close now to what appeared to be a blue gown and he was reaching out trying to drag it nearer then trying to right the figure as it began to lash out wildly it was a woman and she wasnt trying to cling to her rescuers she was struggling to free herself rutledge out of breath got to the waters edge just as masters succeeded in dragging the woman to shallower depths it was betty richards the elderly woman who had served quarles and in his name tried to destroy the bakery her hair was down gray streaked and straggling half covering her face and she was crying trails of tears spreading into the muddy stream running from her hair and into her eyes masters his breathing tumultuous was shaking her demanding to know in broken sentences what the hell she thought she was doing rutledge said she was trying to drown herself man get her inside and fetch some blankets tea as well and towels to dry her hair masters let her go turning to rutledge what are you doing here i thought youd found your killer in more ways than one he reached out and put a hand on bettys shoulder comforting her as best he could there was nothing else i could do she said sobbing into the wet skirt she held to her face i had nowhere else to go nothing left rutledge asked sharply did mrs quarles give you notice she tried to shake her head but her hair was a heavy mass down her back it was mrs downing she said theyd be cutting back staff now and id not be needed any longer mr archer told her i could take care of his rooms but she said it would be up to mrs quarles and i mustnt hold out any hope rutledge swore hadnt they read the will hadnt they seen the bequest to this poor wretch as if in answer betty said mrs downing never liked it that i wasnt under her but i wasnt and never was meant to be she was told that from the start mrs masters had come with blankets and they wrapped betty in them as water ran from her clothes and she began to shiver rutledge let mrs masters take over guiding betty toward her kitchen making soothing noises masters said i never liked that woman betty not betty i hardly knew her no mrs downing she creeps around the house listening at doors and spreading gossip i dont know how mrs quarles can stand her i dont think she sees that side of her housekeeper will betty be all right with your wife he watched mrs masters close the kitchen door behind them shell see that betty is taken care of ive half a mind to take her on myself to get her out of mrs downings clutches but i dont need more staff then you might spread a little gossip of your own harold quarles left a sizeable bequest to that housemaid shell never want for anything again why on earth should he do that i dont know but i think mrs downing might ill have a word with her rutledge walked back the way hed come and leaving the motorcar where it was he went on to the house and knocked again at the door mrs downing opened it to him and he stepped inside before she could prevent him has there been a reading of the will he asked and her eyes flickered it was read privately the staff wasnt invited to hear afterward we were told by mrs quarles how we were to be provided for was nothing said to you about a bequest to the woman who had served mr quarles by taking care of his rooms not to me i wasnt told anything at all but you overheard something didnt you when mrs quarles spoke privately to betty she never did rutledge said bring her down here to me i want to speak to mrs quarles i cant but he ignored her and called mrs quarless name she came to the top of the stairs her face flushed with her anger what do you think youre doing come down here or ill come up there without a word she came down the stairs and walked past him to the small sitting room he followed what is it you want she stood there cold and straight as if nothing more could touch her there was a bequest in your husbands will to the housemaid who looked after him betty richards what business is that of yours she was never told after the will was read i want to know why i didnt think it was an appropriate bequest shes not capable of handling that much money tell me the truth or ill see to it that youre taken into cambury police station for theft its not theft she retorted its my husbands money and he left it to that woman that woman as you put it is his widowed sister he kept her here as a maid and let the world think he was kind to take her on but he did it to keep the rest of us out of his rooms and his affairs he knew he could trust her shes not fit to be my sons aunt and i wont have her in this house any longer then give her the money he left to her and let her go for all i care she can starve shes a quarles and i hate them all she went past him out of the room slamming the door behind her any sympathy hed felt for her had vanished he pulled open the door and called to mrs downing youll pack betty richards things and send them to cambury to the house of miss ohara shell be staying there until someone from the solicitors office can be summoned i want them there within the hour do you hear me mrs downing said ill see to it but he was out the door as he looked back at the house on his way to his motorcar he saw a face staring at him from the window a boy he realized in harold quarless rooms it was marcus quarles a bewildered frightened expression on his face rutledge drove to the home farm and asked tom masters and his wife to send betty richards to cambury as soon as shed recovered shes sleeping now poor thing mrs masters told him let her rest it will be soon enough to take her there tomorrow you may find yourself in trouble if you take her in he warned ill go ahead and tell miss ohara that shes to have a guest miss ohara frowned when he told her im not a boardinghouse but if you insist then ill keep her safe she wont be staying long youll be hearing from mr hurley a solicitor hell have instructions for her yes well that may be you owe me another dinner then rutledge smiled ill remember he didnt stop at the police station he had nothing to say to inspector padgett but on his way to speak to miss ohara hed noticed the board outside st martins church someone had covered the name of michael brunswick organist in london rutledge went directly to the house of davis penrith he said to the man as he was shown into the study you have lied to me more times than i care to count about your father about quarles about evering i know about south africa now almost the entire story you cant possibly know about evering burning alive about the wounded who were shot about the fact that you never turned quarles in to the authorities i had no proof of course you did you knew how many wounded there were or youd have never walked across the veldt alone to find help you and quarles would have left that train together to find help because there was nothing the boers wanted from it then but he stayed behind i want to know why i tell you i didnt know what was it cowardice did you and quarles get cold feet when the boers attacked and hide under the carriages was that why you survived they were dead shots the boers how was it that neither you nor quarles was wounded and yet everyone else on that train died i dont remember when the train was stopped i was knocked down i dont remember how did quarles burn his hands if he was in that carriage with evering why were only his hands burned i wasnt there but you knew when you walked away and left quarles therewith no wounds mind youthat evering was alive wounded perhaps but alive the boers didnt burn men to death it was the lantern in the last carriage it was hit and broken i dont know why it burned but it did you surely knew ronald evering was the brother of the man quarles killed why did he come to you to invest his money i cant answer that coincidenceone in a thousand odds i think he must have learned something and he came to you to find out the rest it was a battering of questions and rutledge could tell that penrith couldnt sustain it he couldnt have known anything no one did we never told anyone wed been in the army not even mr james what were you trying to hide if it wasnt cowardice we were hiding nothing nothing why did you write a letter to ronald evering just in the last few days it arrived on st annes the same time i did and i carried it to the house myself ihed said something about wanting to invest with me again i told him that the opportunities he spoke of had not turned out the way hed hoped and i thought he would be wise to look elsewhere how odd that after cumberline he would wish to trust you again with any sum of money yes i thought the same penrith broke off thats to say i found it odd myself youve lied to me about many things why did you lie to me about scotland it came out of nowhere a shot in the dark from rutledge that shook penrith to the core i was in scotland i swear to you i was theres the letter from my wife but not that whole weekend she says something about it being such a brief visit and that youd arrived just in time to dine with the douglases i think you reached scotland on sunday afternoon not on friday and youre letting an innocent man hang in your place you were in cambury on that saturday night you quarreled with your former partner first on minton street where youd followed him from hallowfields and then you went ahead of him knowing he was on foot and you killed him because you were afraid of him and what he knew about your past he was doing things that you didnt approve of that you feared would ruin both of you the cumberline stocks his outrageous behavior in cambury refusing to listen to you it wasnt that way youve got it wrong why did you strike your partner down and then carry his body to the tithe barn and hoist him to the ceiling in that angels harness where no one would think to look for him did you hope that this would give you time to reach scotland before anyone could accuse you of killing him i never put him in that harnessyoure lying but thats how he was found and someone did it if it wasnt you then who would do such an ugly thing i never put him in anything an innocent man is going to hang rutledge said again and it will be on your conscience perhaps you werent there when quarles shot the woundedor when he burned evering alive it may be that youve nothing on your conscience but protecting a friend but this death is on your hands when brunswick hangs it will be you who slides the hood over his head and the rope tight around his neck stop it penrith put his hands over his ears trying to shut out rutledges unrelenting voice i am not guilty ive never killed anyone harold quarles was still alive when i left him you wouldnt have left quarles alive not if he knew it was you who struck him he was a bad enemy a dangerous man you had proof of that whatever you want to deny about south africa i did i wasnt afraid of him i told him that i knew why hed tried to make everyone think hed slept with my wifeit was because id left the partnership he always punishes anyone who gets in his way and that was my punishment i hit him when he turned away because he called me a liar he said hed never gone near my wife i told him he was the one lying penrith stopped appalled he sank down in the nearest chair his head in his hands oh my god what have i done rutledge thought at first that penrith was horrified that hed been tricked into confessing then he realized that the man had stared into something only he could see and discovered the truth what is it rutledge asked penrith shook his head i cant believe look i never put him in that harness i was so angry i couldnt have touched him i left him there in his own blood still breathing it must have been someone from the house who put him in that barn it wasnt me i swear to youit wasnt me youve lied one time too many rutledge said it doesnt serve you anymore but its the truth he was alive there on the grass by the gatehouse i didnt murder harold quarles if you didnt then you must know how michael brunswick feels waiting to be tried he told me the truth and i didnt believe him i accepted your word that you were in scotland and you gave it knowing it was a lie no you must listen to meall right i struck him twice he was walking away laughing and i knocked him down to his knees to stop him and then before i quite knew what i was doing i hit him a second time because i was so angry with him but i could hear him breathingi hadnt killed him werent you afraid that leaving him alive was dangerous that hed tell the police what youd done nohe wouldnt dare besides i thoughti hoped that if no one found him right away he might not remember what had happened you hoped he would die davis penrith i am arresting you on the charge of willfully murdering your former partner harold quarles you cant do this i havent killed anyone i was tricked rutledge shook his head its finished will you go with me now or must i send for constables to bring you in you dont understand i was misledit was ronald evering who told me that quarles had slept with my wife and i believed him because it was the sort of thing quarles would do he punished his wife by having affairs with every woman in cambury he could seduce why not my wife to punish me dear god dont you see it must all have been a lie it was inspector padgetts nature to gloat as rutledge sat in the mans office and reported the arrest of davis penrith and the evidence that supported it padgett smiled it was nearly a sneer didnt i tell you from the start that it was someone in london and you so certain the killer was among us here in cambury it was the way the evidence pointed davis penrith told us half truths about scotland he was therebut hed driven through the night like a bat out of hell to make certain he was in time for the dinner his wife and he had been invited to attend and her letter was equally unenlightening yes one of the problems of not being on the spot wouldnt you say rutledge heeding the succinct advice hamish was pouring into his ear held on to his temper with a firm grip penrith swears he was tricked that hed deliberately left london early in order to discuss a business matter with ronald evering and instead it turned out to be a trap im on my way to the scilly isles to look into it never been there never had a reason to go and never expect to im not the best of sailors where was penrith all the while on that saturday evening hed intended to go directly to the house to confront quarles but just as he neared the gates quarles was getting into the motorcar driven by mr nelson who was joining quarles and mr greer at dinner they sat talking and so penrith didnt stop he went as far as the next village waited a decent interval then drove back the motorcar was gone and so was quarles he turned in at the main drive in front of the gates and waited again for some time in fact not sure what to do on the chance that quarles might have taken his visitor into cambury to dine penrith walked into cambury to look for nelsons motorcar by now penrith was impatient and worried about his timetable but he found the vehicle by greers house and hung about out of sight angry and frustrated he didnt want to return to hallowfields hed have to explain why his business couldnt wait until morning then quarles obliged him by leaving the dinner early penrith stopped him they had words but quarles was in no mood to entertain penriths suspicions he walked on home and penrith had no choice but to followthe high street was hardly the place to discuss his wifes fidelity he caught up to quarles again on the road and again quarles gave him short shrift penrith thought quarles was taunting him and as they went past the gatehouse at the lane turning into the home farm he was so angry he picked up one of those white stones and struck quarles from behind penrith only remembers two blows and he says quarles was alive when he got the wind up and ran for his motorcar he flatly denies carrying the body to the tithe barn i thought you said you had a full confession we do as far as it goes the question becomes is penrith still lyingthis time about the apparatus in the tithe barnor is he finally telling the truth he doesnt strike me as a man of courage but if he didnt move the bodywho did mrs quarles how did she know it was lying there i dont see her taking nightly strolls around the grounds and stumbling over her husbands corpse in the course of one of them jones or even brunswick for that matter when you consider the point its rather difficult to beard quarles in his denits a house full of servants and potential witnesses waiting for him to come to you outside the gates can be hit or miss it was sheer luck that penrith saw him with nelson but jealousy that made him persist brunswick guessed that quarles was somewhere about when he saw penrith come out of minton street he wasnt likely to follow the two of them the question now is who did brunswick who else brunswick had no reason to believe penrith was about to kill quarles and thats true ofjones but someone was expecting it and thats the man i intend to call on when i leave here hes the one who told penrith that his wife was having an affair and penrith must have left him in a fury evering might have followed to see what would happen why else would he tell penrith such a thing true or not it led to quarless death padgett said you dont give up easily do you its a matter ofjustice you see even justice for an ogre rutledge left soon after and drove on to cornwall spending the night just across the tamar and arriving at his destination in time to meet the mail boat on its return from the first crossing of the day the sea was calm the skies clear rutledge had an opportunity to speak to the master as he stood at the wheel the man remembered bringing penrith he was in something of a state when i met him on the quay ready to return to the mainland he thought the fog bank on the horizon was going to swallow us and lead to catastrophe on one those skerries out there did evering leave the island that same morning if youre asking if i picked him up on the next run no nor the next day for that matter does he have a boat of his own he does and hes handled it in these waters all his life where would he leave it on the mainland wherever he chose to put in there are a dozen coves not to mention fishing ports where he could tie up what about a vehicle once he did he keeps his motorcar on the cornish mainland its no use to him on st annes rutledge nodded and changed the subject they came alongside the quay at st annes and rutledge helped the master tie up there was no mail for evering this trip and rutledge walked up the hill with his mind on what he was about to say but before walking through the arbor gates rutledge took a brief tour around the small island following the road until it became a lane and then a path the evering family graves were tucked in a fold in the hillside protected from the prevailing winds and covered with flat stone slabs rather than the more conventional stones when the winter gales washed across the island they were less likely to erode he moved slowly among them looking at the datesgoing back to the seventeen hundreds weathered but still legibleand took note of one in particular a small memorial chapel stood just beyond the graves and inside he found pews an altar and a memorial window set in the thick wall high above it it showed a young soldier in khaki standing tall and unafraid against the backdrop of the veldt his rifle across one knee his gaze on the horizon the commissioning date on the brass plaque below it was leaving the chapel rutledge followed the path down a hillside toward a tiny cove here was everings sailboat and a strip of sand beach protected from the wind the sun touched the emerald green water as it ebbed and it was shallow enough to see the bottom there was almost a subtropical climate in these sheltered slopes rutledge could easily understand why flowers bloomed here before they did on the mainland these islands were britains most westward outpost and as he looked out at the cluster of st annes neighboring isles he found himself wondering what lay submerged between here and cornwall the south coast was full of tales about vanished lands swallowed up by the sea there were half a dozen small cottages on the island as well as the main house tucked beneath another fold in the land and he could see the wash blowing on lines in the back gardens staff or the families who worked on the estate from the sea these cottages would be invisible the ancient protection of island dwellers the world over from the depredations of pirates and raiders but neither could they see the evering house from here or the cove or even the docking of the mail boat evering could be sure there were no witnesses to his comings and goings satisfied rutledge walked back to the house and lifted the knocker on the door the middleaged maid again answered his summons and left him to wait in the parlor for evering to join him you might be interested to hear rutledge said as soon as ever ing walked into the room that it was davis penrith who killed his partner harold quarles i am interested that was an odd pairing if ever i saw one he gestured to a chair i cant imagine that you came all the way out here to tell me that penrith told me that on his most recent visit here you reluctantly informed him that quarles was having an affair with penriths wife did i i hardly think so i dont travel in the same circles if there has been gossip i would be the last person to hear it or the first person to make it up evering laughed easily why should i care enough about these two men to make up anything because they let your brother burn alive when they could have saved him becauseaccording to penrithit was even possible that quarles had engineered his death i dont know why but having spent four years in the trenches i find myself wondering why the two most inexperienced soldiers in that company survived when no one else did unless they were hiding and evering threatened to have them courtmartialed for cowardice apparently the army went so far as to make certain penriths rifle had been fired im afraid i dont know what youre talking about i dont know how my brother died i believe you do someone brought his body home its there among the family graves the stone was set over an empty grave to please my grieving mother youll find no bones beneath it we can order an exhumation to find out but it would be simpler to wire south africa and ask the authorities if your brother still lies where he was buried at the time of his death there will be a paper trail we can follow signatures yes all right i was in south africa for a time and i made the arrangements for my mothers sake it was not an experience i care to remember but i learned nothing from the military authorities there possibly to spare my feelings you knew when you first went to james quarles and penrith exactly who these two men were and they were well aware that you knew i think thats why they allowed you to invest in cumberline to teach you a lesson he sighed that well may be on their part i couldnt say i think you deliberately told penrith lies about his wife and harold quarles knowing that would be the one thing that would set them at each others throats i think you didnt really care which one killed the other it was revenge you were after this is a very unlikely story not one you can prove certainly its my belief that you followed penrith to hallowfields and watched him kill quarles and then it was you who put quarless body into the rig in the tithe barn i dont know how you learned that it was there but youve been planning your revenge for some time you might have heard the story of the christmas pageant from anyone it would be interesting to take you back to cambury and see how many people there recognize you as an occasional visitor it would be rather stupid of me to visit cambury dont you think strangers stand out in small villages people are curious about them no if i went to the mainland it was only to hear news that never reaches us here on st annes but save yourself the trouble you can ask the master of the mail boat i didnt leave the island you have your own boat your staff would know whether you were here or on the mainland while youre here you must ask them which meant rutledge was certain that they would lie for him or were paid well to do so its going to be very difficult i agree but i know the truth now youll be summoned to give evidence at penriths trial will you call him a liar under oath will you deny ever telling him about his wife and quarles evering walked to the cabinet that stood between the windows opening the glass doors he reached in to align the small figure of a man seated in a chair his yellow waistcoat tight across his belly one hand raised as if in salute i have nothing to fear ill gladly give testimony under oath its far more likely that penrith knew about that contraption you speak of not i he closed the cabinet door and this time turned the key in the lock evering unlike penrith was not likely to break rutledge said does it bother your conscience that quarles was murdered and penrith will hang and that you are very likely responsible i hardly know them i wont lose sleep over their fates id like to offer you tea again mr rutledge but i think perhaps youd prefer to await the mail boat down at the quay it is as you can see one of our best days the water in fact is beautiful admiring it will pass the time there are a number of interesting birds on the islands you might spot one of them rutledge picked up his coat and his hat thank you for your time he walked past evering to the door and there he stopped quarles has a sister you know and he has a son penrith has a family as well you are the last of your line you may have found a way to destroy your brothers killers but revenge is a twoedged sword survivors are sometimes determinedas you well knowand somehow may find a way to finish what you began evering said i have no interest in vendettas or vengeance i can tell you that my mother was of a different temperament and would have stood there below the gallows to watch penrith die there are many kinds ofjustice mr rutledge as a policeman you are concerned with only one do speak to mariah on your way out shell confirmin writing if need bethat i never left st annes rutledge did speak to the maid she gave her name as mariah pendennis and she told him without hesitation or any change of expression that it was true mr evering had been on st annes for a fortnight or more as was his custom this time of year the mans guilty rutledge told hamish as he leaned against a bollard waiting for the mail boat as surely as if he took that stone and killed quarles himself but ye canna prove it guilty or no overhead the gulls swooped and soared curious to see if this stranger intended to offer them scraps or not their cries echoed against the hillside behind rutledge he turned and looked back toward the house hed just left he could feel everings eyes on him watching to be certain he left with the boat when it came in where had evering learned such cunning and why had it taken so long to wreak havoc among his enemies hed been young yes when his brother died but nearly twenty years had passed since tragic news had reached the anxious household at the top of the hill hamish said sourly he waited for a way that didna compromise him rutledge watched the mail boat pull around the headland the bow cleaving the waves and throwing up a white v as it moved toward the quay it was a long twentyeight miles across to cornwall rutledge had time to think and at the end of the journey he was no closer to a solution but as he turned his motorcar east he suddenly realized that the answer had been staring him in the face since the beginning but because it was so simple it had gone undetected inspector padgett was startled to find rutledge waiting for him in his office when he returned from a late tea with his family i thought id seen the last of you yes well sometimes wishes are granted and sometimes not i went to see this man evering i think he set in motion the train of events that led to the murder of harold quarles but he knows very well that it cant be proven hes as guilty as penrith in my view more perhaps for using a weak man as his tool and finding the right fear to provoke him but thats beside the point you know as well as i do that policemen often have suspicions they arent able to prove youll have to live with this one possibly a bit of news at this end mrs quarles came to cambury in person to apologize to betty richards she also brought a bank draft for the sum that quarles left the woman in his will i dont think betty quite knew what to make of it all miss ohara tells me that she sat in her room and cried for an hour afterward tears according to miss ohara of relief rather than grief i dont know that she cared for her brother as much as she cared for the money he left her she was frightened about the future its secure enough now which brings me back to something we never resolved not with brunswick and not with penrith how the body of harold quarles was moved from the scene of his murder to the tithe barn to be strung up in that cage i was convinced that evering must have done it to humiliate the man in death but the more i considered the matter the more impossible it seemed i know penrith left his motorcar in the drive where it wasnt visible from the house but what did evering do with his we found no tracks to explain what happenedand thats a long way to carry a dead man ive told you my opinionmrs quarles borrowed charles archers wheeled chair yes but what brought her in the middle of the night down to the gatehouse just minutes after her husband was murdered she heard something the barking dog remember shed have sent one of the staff padgett said smiling broadly you cant have it both ways but i can the only vehicle that had driven down the tithe barn lane was yours whether you heard that dog barking and came in to investigate or something else caught your eye you found quarles dead and it was your need to make him a laughingstock that gave you the idea of putting him up in the cage you drove him there a piece of cloth or chamois around his head and because you knew where the apparatus was and how it worked you could strap him in very quickly a stranger would have had to learn how the buckles and braces worked then you went in to cambury alerted your men sent for me and waited until i got there to remove quarles so that someone else was in charge of the inquiry youve already admitted that much but it explains why we never found tracks to indicate who else had been there in the lane and driven or dragged quarles to the barn you cant prove it padgett said his face grim whatever you suspect you cant prove it thats true because youve had time to remove any bloodstains from your motorcar and burn that rag thats why you left your motorcar with constable jenkins because your evidence was in the boot i did no such thing but you did the tracks were yours and only yours until your constables got there and then the doctor came after i arrived i shall have to tell the chief constable padgett you tampered with the scene of a crime with the intent to confound the police and you did just that ill deny it i think you will but hes had other reports against you this will probably be the last straw im a policeman i had a right to be in that lane i had the right to decide if this murder was beyond the abilities of my men and you spent most of your time trying to derail my investigation i was no wiser than you when it came to finding out who killed quarles didnt it occur to you that the killer might still be somewhere there out of sight or that quarles might still have been alive barelywhen you got to him why didnt you shout for help or blow your horn but thats easier to explain you hadnt seen penriths motorcar as it left so you must have believed that someone from hal lowfields had murdered quarles it was safer to let him die and bring down mrs quarles with him i did nothing of the sortoneil himself said the second blow was fatal that there was no help for it he was unconscious and dying as soon as it was struck padgetts voice was intent his gaze never leaving rutledges face you couldnt have known that at the time could you padgett swore youve been after my head since i was rude to mrs quarles on our first visit well shes a piece of work i can tell you that and neither wanted nor needed our sympathy it was you who let slip to someone the fact that quarles had been trussed up like the christmas angel it didnt serve your purpose to keep that quiet the sooner he became a subject of ridicule the happier you were you cant prove any of this you also saw to it that i suspected michael brunswick because you believed him guilty of his wifes death it was you manipulating the truth behind the scenes just as evering had done and because you were a policeman your word was trusted rutledge stood up preparing to leave where are you going to the chief constable its my duty padgett what you did was unconscionable padgett shouted after him as he went down the passage you were a damned poor choice for scotland yard to send me talking to yourself when no one is looking ill bring you down with me see if i dont his voice followed rutledge out the door and to his motorcar a poor enemy hamish warned him hed have killed quarles himself if hed dared i rather think what he did do gave him even more pleasure than he realized in the fe verishness of the moment quarles has become a ninedays wonder rutledge drove to miss oharas house and knocked at the door it was betty richards who answered and led him to the parlor i didnt go to the funeral she told him before announcing him i wasnt asked but its just as well i never wanted to see that village again i made a bad marriage to escape it we went into service together and that was worse he drank himself to death finally leaving me not a penny and when i was turned out it was harold who rescued me and brought me to hallowfields though i wasnt to tell a living soul i was his sister i paid for my freedom and now i have money of my own i still have nowhere to turn i dont know how to live except at someone elses beck and call you must find a home of your own and learn to be your own mistress yes i must mustnt i she said doubtfully then announced him to miss ohara you keep turning up like a bad penny whats this visit in aid of now tidying away loose ends that doesnt sound to me like an invitation to dinner rutledge smiled another time i have other calls i must make i hear mrs quarles has made restitution yes that was the oddest thing i was never so shocked as i was when i found her at my door its betty who worries me i told her i would keep her on here until she can decide what she wants to do with herself but shes been so browbeaten all her life she doesnt seem to have tuppence worth of backbone its really quite sad i shall miss you ian when youve gone back to london perhaps i can arrange a murder or two to bring you here again yes do that he said goodbye and left while hamish rumbled in the back of his head telling him to be careful after calling on the chief constable at his house in bath rutledge turned back toward london he had some explaining to do when he got there chief superintendent bowles was not pleased about his absence why couldnt this inquiry have been wrapped up sooner because there was misinformation from the start and there were people to whom it was advantageous to muddy the waters this man padgett what possessed him a policeman pride and what about evering what are we to do with him theres not much we can do he didnt touch harold quarles he in no way encouraged davis penrith to kill the man he simply told him a lie bowles said a lie can be as deadly as the truth see to your desk theres more than enough work on it to keep you busy awhile i dont hold with this running about leave it to the lawyers now dismissed rutledge went to his office and sat down in his chair turning it to look out at the spring shower washing the london air clean his mind far away from the papers in front of him all he could see was a hot dry morning in the bush and a train burning while a man screamed four days later he was dispatched to cornwall a body had come ashore off lands end and in the dead womans pocket was a waterlogged letter they could make out rutledges name and scotland yard much of the rest was indecipherable he left london as soon as he could and reached penzance late in the evening a young constable at the police station greeted him and said im to take you directly to inspector dunne he lives in that small farmhouse you passed on your way in it was no longer a working farm where the inspector lived but the gray stone house built in the distant past its slate roof heavy on the beams had a charm that was very obvious the outbuildings had for the most part been cleared away save for the barn and the large medieval dovecote as they pulled into the yard rutledge could hear doves fluttering and calling unsettled by the brightness of his headlamps dunne was a middleaged man graying at the temples he had waited up for rutledge but hed already replaced his boots with slippers and shuffled ahead of them as he led rutledge to the room where he worked when at home you dont often find a victim of drowning with scotland yards address in her pocket we thought you might want to have a look i appreciate that no idea who she was none thats what were hoping you can tell us rutledge had an odd feeling that it was mariah pendennis who was the only person who could swear that evering wasnt in his house on the night that quarles was murdered his spirits rose there might yet be a way to catch evering even as he thought about it he had to accept the reality of winds and tides it would be nearly impossible if shed drowned off st annes for her to be found off lands end hamish said he would ha taken her out to sea else she might wash up in the isles dunne was telling rutledge the circumstances of finding the body fishermen spied her on the rocks thats where a good many drowning victims turn up know anyone living in this part of cornwall dealt with a crime in our fair duchy have you only one and that was some time ago nearly a year and farther north above tintagel not my patch thank the lord want to have a look at her tonight or wait until the morning id be glad to put you up the house is empty at the moment my wifes gone to exeter a christening rutledge accepted his invitation and the next morning dunne took him to see the body of the drowned woman her face had suffered from the waves tumbling her against the rocks but shocked as he was rutledge had no difficulty identifying her what he couldnt grasp was why betty richards should have drowned herself off cornwall a sad end he thought moved by pity he reached out gently touching the cold sheetclad shoulder nearest him rutledge said to dunne you were right to summon me her name is betty richards she was the sister of someone who was killed in somerset recently id like to see the letter it may be important they brought him the stiff almost illegible pages and he tried to read them using a glass that someone found for him even so even magnified the ink had run to such an extent that rutledge could decipher only one word in three something about money and her duty and at the end her gratitude for what hed done for her but it hadnt been enough shed tried to kill herself before and this time shed succeeded why here she couldnt have known hed told no one but padgett he turned to inspector dunne i must find a telephone its urgent dunne took him across to the hotel and there in a cramped room rutledge put in a call to the unicorn he recognized hunters quiet voice as the man answered rutledge identified himself and said can you find miss ohara and bring her to the telephone its pressing business it will take some time will you call back in a quarter of an hour rutledge agreed and hung up the receiver inspector dunne said mind telling me what this is about im not sure he looked at his watch can someone hold the mail boat to the scilly isles we should be on it but first ive got to wait for my call to go through the scilly isles she wouldnt have come from there trust me i know the currents in this part of the world nevertheless dunne sent a constable peddling to hold the boat rutledge paced reception mentally counting the minutes where was miss ohara had anything happened to her he swore under his breath the hands on the tall case clock beside the stairs moved like treacle their tick as loud as his heartbeats and his patience was running out hamish was there thundering in his mind telling him what he already suspected calling him a fool reminding him that he had thought it was finished and reiterating a handful of words until they seemed to engulf him is this no what ye wanted to happen is it no what would balance the scales murder never balances the scales he almost spoke aloud and turned away to keep dunne from reading the fear in his face ten minutes still to go five and then it was time rutledge put in the call and waited for hunter to answer on the fourth ring he did saying rutledge are you there i have miss ohara with me thank god she was safe and then miss oharas voice strained and tired what is it where are you calling from whats happened its betty richards shes killed herself oh no oh god keep her there was a brief silence then she said she left two days ago in the night there was a message he could hear her fumbling with a sheet of paper and then hunters voice in the background here let me and miss ohara again dear miss youve been awful kind to me but theres something i must do its about my brother i dont know what to do with all this money so i might as well use it for my own self whats left will you see that it goes to young marcus why didnt you call me he demanded when she ended her reading i thoughtshed said something about her brother i thought she might have decided after all that she wanted to see his grave thats all that made sense to me because she didnt know what padgett had known did betty leave the house the day before she went off i sent her to market for me she wasnt gone very long but she seemed upset when she came backsilent and distressed when i asked her what had happened she said someone just walked over my grave rutledge swore then with feeling padgett had taken it upon himself to tell betty richards that the law couldnt touch the man behind her brothers death rutledge would have given any odds that padgett had intentionally done so just as hed let the gossips have the information about the way theyd found quarles in the tithe barn and half a dozen other bits of troublemaking it was the only explanation for betty richards being here in cornwall nobody else knewno one wheres inspector padgett now do you know he could hear miss ohara speaking to hunter then she was on the line again the chief constable sent for him i dont think hes come back it doesnt matter the damage is done i thought her voice down the line was very disturbed its my fault i should haveshe never gave me any reason to suspect that she was going somewhere to die i knew the money overwhelmed her it sounded as if she didnt want it after all there was nothing you could do it was out of your hands someone wanted to hurt her and he succeeded thank you i must go someone padgett i always thought him an unparalleled idiot i didnt know he was also a cruel bastard she put up the receiver as he turned to dunne we need to be on that boat to st annes the two men ran to the harbor where the mail boat was bobbing on the turning tide the master had the ropes off before their feet hit the deck rutledge said to him did you take a visitor to st annes in the last several days an unremarkable woman wearing a black dress and a black coat yes i did as it happened she wasnt there longshe was waiting for me at the quay when i swung back round to st annes to see if she was going back then or later she said the people shed come to see werent at home thank god rutledge felt a wave of relief wash over him if she had killed herself it was because she hadnt succeeded but hamish said ye canna be sure its suicide yon evering might ha killed her to be rid of her theres the letter in her pocket he watched as the distant isles grew larger almost incrementally until the smudge divided itself into many parts and then the individual isles were visible spread out before him on the sea ive never been out here dunne said theres hardly any crime a constable looks in from time to time as a matter of course but its not really our patch pretty arent they like the ruins of the ancient kingdom of lyonesse there are stories along many parts of the english coast about church bells ringing out to sea where theres nothing to be seen even as far as essex i think but rutledge was urging the boat forward forcing himself to sit still and wait at last they reached the small harbor and touched the quay as the master brought the boat in close wait here dunne ordered him as he leaped on the quay after rutledge the two men took the track leading up to the road at a forced pace and finally dunne said here slow down im half out of breath rutledge waited for him to catch him up and then turned toward the house thats the evering place yes see the roads just ahead we cross that and follow the shell path beyond the arbor rutledge could hear his own heart beating the sound was loud in the stillness peaceful isnt it dunne said as he turned back to look at the panorama behind him and that viewyoud never tire of it beats the farm im afraid and i thought nothing could rutledge was ahead of him moving fast through the open arbor gate without seeing it his mind already walking through everings front door by the time dunne had caught up with him rutledge had lifted the knocker and let it fall he realized he was holding his breath as he waited no one came to answer his summons hes taken the boat out he went after her the housekeeper mariah pendennis must have family in the village well try there he led the way again and as they passed the small burial ground of the everings he said to dunne thats the stone for the son killed in the boer war burned to death did you say horrid way to die ah i spy a rooftop that must be the village but rutledges gaze had gone to the small cove he could just see the mouth of it from here another fifty feetand there was everings boat swinging idly on its anchor you go on to the village and ask for the woman who works for evering mariah pendennis im going back to the house what if shes not there bring back a responsible man well need him dunne nodded and set off without another word rutledge thought hes a good man he turned back past the burial ground and the chapel down the road to the path to the house the last hundred yards he was trotting though he knew it must be too late this time as he went through the open gate he stopped to look at it the lovely piece that had formed the top of it was missing the swans with curved necks he didnt bother to knock again he tried the door and it was off the latch for an instant he hesitated on the threshold dreading what he knew now must be here he walked into the parlor and it was empty the dining room too echoed to his footsteps the bare boards creaking with age as he crossed to the window and looked out the study was next a handsome room with photographs of the various islands hung between the windows the shelves across the way filled with a variety of mechanical toys rutledge barely glanced at them evering lay in front of the desk crumpled awkwardly the handle of a kitchen knife protruding from his chest and in his hands as if shoved there as an afterthought were the swans from the gate bloody now rutledge knelt to feel the mans pulse but there was no doubt he was dead he had been for some time hamish said when she came he didna think she was sae angry a plain woman in a plain bonnet ye ken he must ha thought she was no match for him and the knife in the folds of her skirt it could have happened that way rutledge thought it very likely had he went on to search for the servants quarters and there he found mariah pendennis dead as well this time the knife in her back as she prepared the tea things sugar and tea had spilled on the work table and down her apron and a cup was smashed on the stone floor beside her another overturned on the table the kettle on the hob had boiled dry blackened now above the cold hearth rutledge went through the rest of the rooms but mariah penden nis had been the unlucky one unwittingly answering the door to a murderess he couldnt find any other servants in the house ronald evering must have lost more money to the cumberline fiasco than he could afford still one man didnt require a houseful of servants mariah had been sufficient for his needs with perhaps someone to help with meals and the heavier cleaning chores and someone to take his wash and bring it back again his needs were few and he had got by rutledge could hear dunne calling to him from the foyer he came down the stairs and said there are two dead here evering and the woman who took care of him the man standing behind dunne sharply drew in a breath dunne said i wouldnt have thought he left the sentence unfinished she managed it because they didnt suspect her evering had no way of knowing who she was or why she was here a poor woman harmless he led the way to the study whats that in his hands dunne asked crouching down for a closer look its from the gate outside the man with him said whatever is it doing here the closest she could come to the angel in the tithe barn aloud he said a gesture of some sort what are these dunne gestured to the collection of toys behind rutledge odd things to have in a study my grandson has one like that he gestured to a small golden bird on an enameled box hes allowed to play with it of a sunday with his grandmother watching mr evering was that fond of all manner of mechanical things the man from the village answered him when he got a new one he was like a child playing with it by the hour wheres mariah then rutledge directed them to the kitchen he stood where he was looking down on evering it had come full circle what this man had set in motion with a few lies now he was dead and betty richards with him she would be buried beside the brother who never acknowledged her and if mrs quarles read the brief account in a newspaper of a drowning in cornwall she might guess why there were no more everings the cycle would end here in this house overlooking the sea but there was padgett still to be dealt with ye can no mair take him in than ye could this one hamish told rutledge their hands are bloody but ye canna prove it he sent that poor woman here to confront evering as surely as if he brought her to the door hamish said if she wasna her brothers blood she wouldna ha come here she would ha stayed with yon irish lass until she was settled in her own mind what to do with hersel the seeds of these murders had been sown in the way betty richards had gone to the bakery and done as much damage as possible with her bare hands and the seeds of her death were sown when in despair she threw herself into the pond at the home farm i dont think she was avenging her brother rutledge said slowly i think it was avenging the life she was most comfortable with that died with him hamish said grimly its too bad she didna include yon inspector in her vengeance the scots who for centuries had raised blood feuds to a fine art were not as shocked by them as the more civilized english hell bring himself down he wont need a betty richards for that back in london rutledge went to see davis penrith in prison where he was awaiting trial fighting against the sense of the walls closing in on him rutledge told the man what had become of evering i cant say im heartbroken penrith told him the law couldnt touch him and im to hang because of him hardly that you neednt have acted on his information yes he said bitterly it always comes down to that doesnt it a choice the fact is no one ever chooses well in the throes of jealousy and anger why did quarles burn lieutenant evering alive its the one piece of the puzzle ive not uncovered i wont burden my wife and children with that i didnt kill the man i just didnt report what i suspected i gave quarles the benefit of the doubt i wasnt even there when it was done i didnt see his hands until months later when they were healing whatever it was that drove him he paid for it in pain and suffering let there be an end to it in spite of his denials he looked away as if ashamed something happened on that train and whatever it was died with the men on it now quarles is gone i will be soon it was all that penrith could be brought to say leaving the prison walking out through the gates and into the bright air rutledge found himself in a mood that he couldnt shake hamish was railing at him dragging up the war unrelenting in his fury it was a symptom of rutledges own emotional desolation his head seemed to be close to bursting with the sound of that soft scots voice and memories that rose to the surface unbidden as clear as if he were in france again and seeing what he had hoped never to see then or now he drove aimlessly for a time only half aware of what he was doing until he found himself in chelsea in the next street was the house where meredith channing lived rutledge went there got out of the motorcar and walked to the door standing in front of it his hand raised to the brass knocker he thought i should go and find frances but she would ask too many questions and the blackness coming down wouldnt wait the door opened and he heard meredith channing say why ian what she stopped come in whats wrong how can i help will you drive with me anywhere kew windsor great park richmond i dont care justsit there and say nothing i dont want to be alone just now let me fetch my coat she was gone less than a minute but he had already decided hed made a mistake in coming here he was turning away when she took his arm and said im here shall i drive he couldnt have said afterward where they had gone or for how long when the black clouds of despair began very slowly to recede rutledge found he was embarrassed and turned his head to look at the passing scene wondering what he could say that could possibly explain what he had done in coming to this woman of all people she seemed to sense a difference in the silence that filled the motorcar and she took the first step for him i should very much like a cup of tea the panacea for everything the english had to face grateful to her he said yes not a bad idea it was one of the worst spells hed had in a very long time he wasnt sure whether it was the claustrophobia that had surrounded him in penriths narrow cell or the blow on the head when his motorcar had missed the bend in the road but when did hamish need an excuse it was always rutledge himself who looked for one who tried to pretend there had to be a reason for madness there was a tearoom in the next village and they stopped rutledge found he was hungry and ordered a plate of sandwiches as well as their tea taking off her coat and settling it on the third chair at their table meredith channing said elise told me youd stopped in for one night on your way to somewhere else in somerset yes they put me up her father was looking for you elise didnt know at the time he missed you at your hotel rutledge frowned when was this i dont know apparently no one answered the telephone and so there was no opportunity to leave a message ill make a point of getting in touch she changed the subject talking about the weather pouring the tea when it came offering nothing more demanding than quiet conversation never expecting him to say more than he felt like saying it was a kindness when they left the tearoom he found the courage to say i must apologize for what happened today sometimes he broke off and shook his head unable to explain to her to anyone she smiled im glad i was there would you like to drive now he took the wheel and in another half hour they were back in chelsea he had no memory of how hed got there earlier or how for that matter he had negotiated the streets of london without hitting something or someone it was a frightening thought when he had seen her to her door he looked at his watch and decided he just might catch caldwell at his office the war had receded it would be all right caldwell was preparing to leave for the day when rutledge was shown in he said you look worn out is it another case i suspect you are a better judge of the answer to that i understand you tried to reach me in somerset was this to do with the cumber line venture i was curious about this man evering i have a few contacts here and there it took some time but i found out more than i felt comfortable knowing i wasnt aware that evering had a brother nor that both penrith and quarles fought off the boers in an action where the elder evering was killed i had no idea either penrith or quarles had been in the army much less south africa it was quite a surprise i couldnt be sure youd discovered any of this thats why i called somerset i felt rather foolish after telling you that you could safely ignore this man evering i was able to piece together some of the story rutledge replied carefully sometimes the past has a long reach ronald evering is dead he was killed by harold quarless sister who then took her own life dear god i saw that youd taken up penrith for quarless murder i would never have expected him to be a killer it seemed so contrary to his nature he was always in quarless shadow ever since the war apparently with the right goad even people like penrith can kill rutledge answered neutrally theres more to this business of quarles and penrith since my telephone call to you i was told something by a friend in strictest confidence i trust youll treat it as such there was a fair sum of money going up the line the day the boer attacked im not privy to why it was on the train just that it was it was burned when the carriages caught fire after the attack there was some question in the doctors minds whetherjudging from the nature of his woundsquarles was trying to save the money or lieutenant evering the army kept an eye on him but after quarles got back to london he was poor as a church mouse and so after a time the army lost interest in him a man of that sort they reckoned would have spent every penny in months if not weeks on whatever whims took his fancy instead he worked hard in the firm that hired him rose through their ranks on his own ability and led an honest life it explained why penrith wouldnt talkhe had been given a share of that money it explained why lieutenant evering had to diehe would have told everyone if quarles had taken the money it explained why the carriages had to be burnedotherwise the army would have searched for the missing currency and still they had been suspicious but quarles had outwaited them clever man that he was it had all begun with greed with money that could be had for the taking if one had no qualms about committing murder rutledge said thank you for telling me it will go no further just as well caldwell said it will only hurt the survivors but i thought it might be useful to you pray god rutledge thought michael brunswick never learns the truth or if he does never acts on it or the killing will go on and marcus quarles might prove to have more of his father and his aunt in him than his mother ever imagined
