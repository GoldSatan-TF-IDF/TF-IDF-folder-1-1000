jeffery deaver praying for sleep no beast so fierce like a cradle the hearse rocked him gently the old vehicle creaked along a country road the asphalt cracked and roothumped he believed the journey had so far taken several hours though he wouldnt have been surprised to find that theyd been on the road for days or weeks at last he heard the squeal of bad brakes and was jostled by an abrupt turn then they were on a good road a state road and accelerating quickly he rubbed his face across a satiny label sewn inside the bag he couldnt see the label in the darkness but he remembered the words elegantly stitched in black thread on yellow cloth union rubber products trenton nj made in usa he caressed this label with his ample cheek and sucked air through the minuscule opening where the zipper hadnt completely seated the smoothness of the hearses transit suddenly troubled him he felt he was falling straight down to hell or maybe into a well where hed be wedged immobile head down forever this thought aroused a piercing fear of confinement and when it grew unbearable he craned his neck and drew back his thick lips he gripped the inside of the zipper with lengthy teeth yellow and gray as cats claws and with them he struggled to work the mechanism open one inch two then several more cold exhaustscented air filled the bag he inhaled greedily the air diminished the bristle of claustrophobia the men who took away the dead he knew called what he now lay in a crash bag but he couldnt recall these men ever taking away anyone dead from a crash the dead ones died by leaping from the top of the stairwell in e ward they died from severed veins in their fat forearms they died facedown in toilets and they died like the man this afternoona strip of cloth wound round and round and round his neck but he couldnt recall a single crash his teeth rose from his lips again and he worked the zipper open further eight inches ten his round shaved head emerged from the jagged opening with his snarling lips and thick face he had the appearance of a bearthough one that was not only hairless but blue for much of his head was dyed that color finally able to look about he was disappointed to find that this wasnt a real hearse at all but merely a station wagon and it wasnt even black but tan the back windows werent shaded and he could see ghostly forms of trees signs power towers and barns as the wagon sped pasthis view distorted by the misty darkness of the autumn evening in five minutes he began on the zipper again angry that his arms were pinioned helpless by he muttered in frustration damn good new jersey rubber he opened the crash bag another four inches he frowned what was that noise music it came from the front seat separated from the back by a black fiberboard divider he generally liked music but certain melodies upset him greatly the one he now heard a countrywestern tune for some reason set off within him bursts of uneasiness i hate this bag he thought its too damn tight then it occurred to him that he wasnt alone thats itthe bag was filled with the souls of crashed and shattered bodies the jumpers and the drowners and the wrist slitters he believed that these souls hated him that they knew he was an impostor they wanted to seal him up alive forever in this tight rubber bag and with these thoughts came the evenings first burst of real panicraw liquid cold he tried to relax by using the breathing exercises hed been taught but it was too late sweat popped out on his skin tears formed in his eyes he shoved his head viciously into the opening of the bag he wrenched his hands up as far as theyd go and beat the thick rubber he kicked with his bare feet he slammed the bridge of his nose into the zipper which snapped out of track and froze michael hrubek began to scream the music stopped replaced by a mumble of confused voices the hearse rippled sideways like an airplane in a crosswind hrubek slammed his torso upward then fell back again and again trying to force his way out of the small opening his massive neck muscles knotting into thick cables his eyes bulging he screamed and wept and screamed again a tiny door in the black partition flew open and two wide eyes stared into the back of the vehicle surrendering to the fear hrubek neither saw the attendant nor heard the mans hysterical shout stop stop the car christ stop the station wagon careened onto the shoulder amid a staccato clatter of pebbles a cloud of dust surrounded it and the two attendants wearing pastel green jumpsuits leapt out and ran to the back of the hearse one tore open the door a small yellow light above hrubeks face popped on frightening him further and starting another jag of screaming shit hes not dead said the younger of the attendants shit hes not dead its an escape get back hrubek screamed again and convulsed forward his veins rose in deep clusters from his blue skull and neck and straps of tendon quivered flecks of foam and blood filled the corner of his mouth the belief and hope that he was having a stroke occurred simultaneously to each attendant settle down you shouted the youthful one youre just going to get in more trouble his partner said shrilly and added with no threat or conviction whatsoever weve caught you now so just settle down were going to take you back hrubek let go a huge scream as if under the power of this sound alone the zipper gave way and metal teeth fired from the crash bag like shotgun pellets sobbing and gasping for air hrubek leapt forward and rolled over the tailgate crouching on the ground naked except for his white boxer shorts he ignored the attendants who danced away from him and rested his head against his own distorted reflection in the pitted chrome bumper of the hearse all right thats enough of that the younger attendant growled when hrubek said nothing but merely rubbed his cheek against the bumper and wept the attendant lifted an oak branch twice the length of a baseball bat and waved it at him with some menace no the other attendant said to his partner who nonetheless swung at the massive naked shoulders as if taking on a fastball the wood bounced off with hardly a sound and hrubek seemed not to notice the blow the attendant refreshed his grip son of a bitch his partners hand snagged the weapon no thats not our job hrubek stood his chest heaving and faced the attendants they stepped back but the huge man didnt advance exhausted he studied the two men curiously for a moment and sank once more to the ground then scrabbled away rolling into the grass by the road oblivious to the cold autumn dew that lacquered his body a whimper came from his fleshy throat the attendants eased toward the hearse without closing the back door they leapt inside and the wagon shot away spraying hrubek with stones and dirt numb he didnt feel this pummeling and merely lay immobile on his side gulping down cold air that smelled of dirt and shit and blood and grease he watched the hearse vanish through a blue cloud of tire smoke grateful that the men were gone and that theyd taken with them the terrible bag of new jersey rubber filled with its ghostly occupants after a few minutes the panic became a stinging memory then a dark thought and then was nearly forgotten hrubek rose to his full sixfoot fourinch height and stood bald and blue as a druid he snatched up a handful of grass and wiped his mouth and chin he studied the geography around him the road was in the middle of a deep valley bony ridges of rock rose up on either side of the wide asphalt behind him in the westwhere the hearse had come fromthe hospital was lost in darkness many miles away ahead lay the distant lights of houses like an animal released from his captors he circled in an awkward cautious lope uncertain of which direction to take then like an animal finding a scent he turned toward the lights in the east and began to run with an ominous grace and at a great speed above them the sky had gone from resonant gunmetal to black whats that there the woman pointed to a cluster of stars above the distant line of alder and oak and occasional white birch that marked the end of their property the man sitting beside her stirred setting his glass on the table im not sure cassiopeia ill bet her eyes lowered from the constellation to gaze into the large state park that was separated from their yard by the inky void of a dim new england lake could be theyd sat on this flagstone patio for an hour warmed by a bottle of wine and by unusually congenial november air a single candle in a blue fishnet holder lit their faces and the scent of leaf decay ripe and too sweet floated about them no neighbors lived within a half mile but they spoke in near whispers dont you sometimes she asked slowly feel something of mother around here still he laughed you know what i always thought about ghosts theyd have to be naked wouldnt they clothes dont have souls she glanced toward him his gray hair and tan slacks were the only aspects of him visible in the deepening night and made him she reflected if anything ghostlike i know therere no ghosts thats not what i mean she lifted the bottle of california s finest chardonnay and poured herself more she misjudged and the neck of the bottle rang loudly on her glass startling them both her husbands eyes remained on the stars as he asked is something wrong no nothing at all with long ruddy and wrinkled hands lisbonne atcheson absently combed her short blond hair shaping the strands but leaving them as unruly as before she stretched her limber fortyyearold body luxuriously and looked momentarily at the threestory colonial house rising behind them after a moment she continued what i mean about mother its tough to explain but as a teacher of the queens language lis was bound by the rule that difficulty of expression is no excuse for not expressing and so she tried once more a presence thats what i mean on cue the candle flickered in its cerulean holder i rest my case she nodded at the flame and they laughed what time is it almost nine lis slouched down into the lawn chair and pulled her knees up tucking her long denim skirt around her legs the tips of brown cowboy boots tooled with gold vines protruded from the hem she gazed again at the stars and reflected that her mother would in fact have been a good candidate for ghosthood shed died just eight months ago sitting in an antique rocking chair as she looked out over the patio where lis and owen now sat the elderly woman had leaned forward suddenly as if recognizing a landmark and said oh of course then died in a very peaceful second this house too would have been a good site for a haunting the dark boxy structure contained more square footage than even a fertile eighteenthcentury family might comfortably fill it was sided with weatherstained cedar shakes brown scalish rough the trim was dark green once a revolutionary war tavern the house was divided into many small rooms connected by narrow hallways beams dotted with powderpostbeetle holes crisscrossed the ceilings and liss father had claimed that several fingersize perforations in the walls and posts were from musket balls fired by rebel militia as they fought the british from room to room hundreds of thousands of dollars had been sunk into the interior design of the house over the past fifty years but for some reason her parents had never properly wired the place lamps with lowwattage bulbs were all that the circuits could bear from the patio tonight these lights shone through the small squares of rippled panes like jaundiced eyes lis still thinking of her mother said it was like the time near the end when she said i just talked to your father and he said he was coming home soon that conversation would have been a tricky one the old man had been dead for two years at that point she imagined it of course but the feeling was real to her and their father lis wondered momentarily no lauberget père was probably not present in spirit hed dropped dead in a mens room in heathrow airport as he tugged angrily at a reluctant papertowel dispenser superstition owen said well in a way he did come home to her she died a couple days later still i guess im talking about what you feel when people are together again people who knew someone whos gone owen was tired of speaking about the spirits of the dead he sipped his wine and told his wife hed scheduled a business trip for wednesday he wondered if he could get a suit cleaned in time for his departure ill be staying through sunday so if wait did you hear something lis turned quickly and looked at the dense mesh of lilacs that cut off their view of the back door of the house no i dont think i his voice faded and he held up a finger he nodded she couldnt see his expression but his posture seemed suddenly tense there she said there it was again it seemed like the snap of footsteps approaching the house from the driveway that dog again lis looked at owen the busches no hes penned in i saw him when i went for my run deer probably lis sighed the local herd had feasted on over two hundred dollars in flower bulbs over the course of the summer and just last week had stripped bare and killed a beautiful japanesemaple sapling she rose ill give it a good scare you want me to no i want to call again anyway maybe ill make some tea anything for you no she picked up the empty wine bottle and walked to the house a fiftyfoot trip along a path that wound through topiary pungent boxwood and the bare black lilac bushes she passed a small reflecting pond in which floated several lily pads glancing down she saw herself reflected her face illuminated by the yellow lights from the first floor of the house lis had occasionally heard herself described as plain but had never taken this in a bad way the word suggested a simplicity and resilience that were to her aspects of beauty looking into the water tonight she once again prodded her hair into place then a sharp gust of wind distorted her image in the water and she continued toward the house she heard nothing more of the mysterious noise and she relaxed ridgeton was among the safest towns in the state a beautiful hamlet surrounded by wooded hills and fields that were filled with kellygreen grass huge boulders horses bred for running picturesque sheep and cows the town had been incorporated even before the thirteen states considered unionizing and ridgetons evolution in the past three hundred years had been more in the ways of earthly convenience than economics or attitude you could buy pizza by the slice and frozen yogurt and you could rent rototillers and videos but when all was said and done this was a walled village where the men were tied to the earththey built on it sold it and loaned against itand the women marshaled children and food ridgeton was a town that tragedy rarely touched and premeditated violence never so tonight when lis found that the kitchen door latticed with squares of turquoise bottle glass was wide open she was more irritated than uneasy she paused the wine bottle in her hand slowly swinging to a stop a faint trapezoid of amber light spread onto the lawn at liss feet she stepped around the thicket of lilacs and glanced into the driveway no cars the wind she concluded stepping inside she set the bottle on the butcherblock island and made a perfunctory search of the downstairs no evidence of fat raccoons or curious skunks she stood still for a moment listening for sounds within the house hearing nothing lis put the kettle on the stove then crouched to forage through the cabinet that contained the tea and coffee just as she placed her hand on the box of rosehip tea a shadow fell over her she stood gasping and found herself looking into a pair of cautious hazel eyes the woman was about thirtyfive she had a black jacket over her arm and wore a loosefitting white satin blouse a short shimmery skirt and laceup boots with short heels over her shoulder was a backpack lis swallowed and found her hand quivering the two women faced each other for a moment silent it was lis who leaned forward quickly and embraced the younger woman portia the woman unslung the backpack and dropped it on the island next to the wine bottle hello lis there was a moment of thick silence lis said i didnt i mean i thought you were going to call when you got to the station wed pretty much decided you werent coming i called you and got your machine well its good to see you she heard the nervous outpouring of her words and fell silent i got a ride figured why bother them it wouldnt have been a bother where were you guys i looked upstairs lis didnt speak for a moment but merely stared at the young womans face her blond hairexactly liss shadeheld back by a black headband portia frowned and repeated her question oh were out by the lake its a strange night isnt it indian summer in november have you eaten no nothing i had brunch at three lee stayed over last night and we slept late come on outside owens out there youll have some wine no really nothing they headed back down the path thick silence filling the short distance between them lis asked about the train ride late but it got here whod you get a ride with some guy i think i went to high school with his son he kept talking about bobbie like i should know who bobbie was if he didnt give me his last name bobbie kelso hes your age his fathers tall bald i think portia said absently looking out over the black lake lis watched her eyes its been so long since youve been here portia gave a sound that might have been a laugh or a sniffle they walked the rest of the way to the patio in silence welcome owen called standing up he kissed his sisterinlaws cheek wed about given up on you yeah well one thing after another didnt get a chance to call sorry no problem were flexible out here in the country have some wine she got a ride with irv kelso lis said then she pointed to a lawn chair sit down ill open another bottle weve got a lot of catching up to do but portia didnt sit no thanks its still early enough isnt it why dont we get the dirty work over with in the ensuing silence lis looked from her sister to her husband then back again well portia persisted unless itd be a hassle owen shook his head not really lis hesitated you dont want to sit for a few minutes weve got all tomorrow naw lets just do it she laughed like the ad says owen turned toward the younger woman his face was in shadow and lis couldnt see his expression if you want everythings in the den he led the way and portia with a glance at her older sister followed lis remained on the patio for a moment she blew the candle out and picked it up then she too walked to the house preceded by sparkling dew lifted off the grass and flung from the tips of her boots while above her in the night sky cassiopeia grew indistinct then dark then invisible behind a wedge of black cloud he walked along the gritty driveway passing through pools of light beneath the antiquated hoopy lamps sprouting from the uneven granite wall from high above a woman known to him only as patient keened breathlessly mourning the loss of something only she understood he paused at a barred wooden door beside the loading dock into a silver plastic boxincongruous in this nearly medieval settingthe middleaged man inserted a plastic card and flung the door open inside a half dozen men and women wearing white jackets or blue jumpsuits glanced at him then they looked away uncomfortably a whitejacketed young doctor with nervous black hair and large lips stepped quickly to his side whispering its worse than we thought worse peter dr ronald adler asked vacantly as he stared at the gurney i dont know about that i expect pretty bad he brushed his uncombed sandygray hair out of his eyes and touched a long finger to a thin fleshy jowl as he looked down at the body the corpse was huge and bald and had a timesmeared tattoo on the right biceps a reddish discoloration encircled the massive neck his back was as dark with sunken blood as his face was pale adler motioned to the young doctor lets go to my office why are all these people here shoo them out my office now vanishing through a narrow doorway the two men walked down the dim corridors the only sounds their footsteps and a faint wail which might have been either patient or the wind that gushed through the gaps in the building which had been constructed a century ago the walls of adlers office were made from the same red granite used throughout the hospital but he was its director so the walls were paneled because this was a state hospital however the wormwood was fake and badly warped the office seemed like that of a bail bondsman or an ambulancechasing lawyer adler flicked the light on and tossed his overcoat onto a buttonstudded couch the summons tonight had found him between the legs of his wife and hed leapt off the bed and dressed hastily he noticed now that hed forgotten his belt and his slacks hung below his moderate belly this embarrassed him and he quickly sat at his desk chair he gazed momentarily at the phone as if perplexed it wasnt ringing to the young man his assistant adler said lets have it doctor dont hover sit down and tell me details are pretty sketchy hes built like callaghan peter grimes aimed his knobby hair toward the body in the loading dock we think he adler interrupted and he is the one who escaped michael hrubek number go on adler fanned his fingers gingerly and grimes placed a battered white file folder in front of the director hrubek it seems he was the big fellow didnt think he was a troublemaker never was until today grimes kept retracting his lips like a fish chewing water and exposing little even teeth adler found this repugnant and lowered his face to the file the young doctor continued he shaved his head to look like callaghan stole a razor to do it then he dyed his face blue broke a pen and mixed the ink with adlers eyes swung to grimes with a look of either anger or bewilderment the young man said quickly then he climbed into the freezer for an hour anybody else wouldve died just before the coroners boys came by to pick up callaghan hrubek hid the corpse and climbed into his body bag the orderlies looked inside saw a cold blue body and a barked laugh escaped from the directors thin lips on which to his shock he detected the scent of his wife the smile faded blue incredible blue callaghan had died grimes explained by strangulation he was blue when they found him this afternoon then he wasnt blue for long my friend as soon as they cut the sheet off him he was unblue didnt the fucking orderlies think of that well peter grimes said and could think of nothing to add did he hurt the meatwagon boys adler asked at some point tonight hed have to total up how many people might sue the state as a result of the escape nope they said they chased him but he disappeared they chased him im sure adler sighed sardonically and turned back to the file he motioned for grimes to be quiet and began to read about michael hrubek dsmiii diagnosis paranoid schizophrenic monosymptomatic and delusional claims to have been committed in seventeen hospitals and escaped from seven of them unconfirmed adler glanced up at his assistant escaped from seven hospitals before the young man could answer the question to which there really was no answer the director was reading once more committed indefinitely pursuant to section of the state mental health law hallucinatory auditory nonvisual subject to severe panic attacks during which pt may become psychotically violent pts intelligence is averageabove average difficulty processing only the most abstract thought believes he is being persecuted and spied upon believes he is hated by others and gossiped about revenge and retribution often in biblical or historical contexts seem to be integral parts of his delusion particular animosity toward women adler then read the intake residents report about hrubeks height weight strength general good health and belligerence his face remained impassive though his heart revved up a few beats and he thought with dread and clinical admiration the son of a bitch is a killing animal jesus lord presently controlled by chlorpromazine hydrochloride mgsdaily po in divided doses is this for real peter yes im afraid so three grams of thorazine fuck adler whispered about which the assistant rocked against the desk with his thumbs pressed on a stack of books the digits growing bright red under the pressure lets have it all of it hes been cheeking his meds adler felt a bristle of heat course over his face he whispered tell me there was a movie a movie grimes clicked together two untrimmed nails an adventure film and the hero pretended to take some drug or something you mean in the rec room what are you telling me an adventure film but he didnt really take them the pills he pretended to but he cheeked them and spit em out later harrison ford i think a lot of patients did that for a few days afterwards i guess nobody thought hrubek was that cognitively functional so they didnt watch him that closely or maybe it was nick nolte adler exhaled slowly how long was he off the candy four days well make that five flipping through his ordered mind adler selected the psychopharmacology file cabinet and peeked inside psychotic behavior in schizophrenics is controlled by antipsychotic medication theres no physical addiction to thorazine as with narcotics but going cold turkey off the drug would render hrubek nauseous dizzy sweaty and intensely nervous all of which would increase the likelihood of panic attacks and panic was what made schizophrenics dangerous off their thorazine patients like hrubek sometimes fly into psychotic rages sometimes they murder sometimes voices tell them what a good job they did with the knife or baseball bat and suggest that they go out and do it again hrubek adler noted would also experience severe insomnia which meant that the man would be wide awake for two or three daysample opportunity to spread his mayhem about quite generously the moaning grew louder filling the dim office adlers palms rose to his cheeks again he smelled his wife again he wished he could turn back the clock one hour again he wished hed never heard of michael hrubek howd we find out about the thorazine one of the orderlies grimes explained chewing water again he found it under hrubeks mattress who stu lowe who else knows about him cheeking the candy him me you the chief nurse lowe told her oh thats just great now listen to me tell lowe tell him its his job if he ever repeats that not a single fucking word wait a troubling thought occurred to adler and he asked the morgues in c ward how the hell did hrubek have access to it i dont know well find out this all happened very fast extremely fast the flustered assistant blurted we dont have half the information we need im getting files calling people dont call people im sorry adler snapped dont call anybody about this without my okay well the board jesus man especially the board i havent yet said grimes quickly wondering what had become of his cockiness good god adler exploded you havent called the police yet no no of course not this was a call hed been about to make just as adler arrived at the hospital grimes noticed with alarm how violently his own fingers were quivering he wondered if hed have a vagusnerve lapse and faint or pee on his bosss floor lets think about this shall we adler mused hes sure to be wandering around out near where was it stinson adler repeated the name softly then touched the file under eight firm fingertips as if preventing it from rising into the inky stratosphere of his victorian asylum office his mood lifted slightly who were the orderlies who schlepped the body from the morgue to the hearse lowe was one i think frank jessup was the other send em up to me forgetting his illfitting slacks adler stood and walked to the grimy window it hadnt been washed in six months youre responsible adler said sternly for keeping this absolutely quiet got it yes sir grimes said automatically and goddamn it find out how he got off e ward yessir if anyone tell the staff if anyone leaks anything to the press theyre fired no police no press send those boys up here its a hard job weve got here isnt it dont you agree get me those orderlies now ronnie are you feeling better im okay the young heavyset man snapped so what i mean whatre you going to do about it honestly dr richard kohler felt the cheap bedsprings bouncing beneath ronnies weight as the patient scooted away from him moving all the way to the headboard as if kohler were a molester ronnies eyes flicked up and down suspiciously as he examined the man whod been his father brother friend tutor and physician for the past six months he carefully studied the doctors curly fringe of thinning hair his bony face narrow shoulders and thirtyoneinch waist he seemed to be memorizing these features so he might have a good description in mind when he reported kohler to the police are you uncomfortable ronnie i cant do it i cant do it doctor i get too scared he whined like a wrongly accused child then suddenly growing reasonable he said conversationally its the can opener mostly was it the kitchen all the work in the kitchen no no no he whined the can opener its too much i dont see why you dont understand it kohlers body was racked by a yawn he felt a painful longing for sleep hed been awake since am and had been here at the halfway house since kohler had helped the patients make breakfast and do the dishes at he shuttled four of them to parttime jobs conferring with employers about his patients and mediating little disputes on their behalf the rest of the day he spent with the remaining five patients who werent employed or who had today sunday off the young men and women each had a psychotherapy session with kohler and then returned to the mundane chores of running a household they divided up into project groups that did what to healthy people were absurdly simple tasks peeling potatoes and washing lettuce for dinner cleaning windows and bathrooms separating trash for recycling reading aloud to each other some lowered their heads and completed their assignments with furrowedbrow determination others chewed their lips or plucked out eyebrows or cried or came close to hyperventilating from the challenge eventually the work got done then catastrophe just before dinner ronnie had his attack a patient standing beside him opened a can of tuna with the electric opener and ronnie fled screaming from the kitchen triggering a chain reaction of hysteria in several other patients kohler had finally restored order and they sat down to dinner kohler with them the food was eaten dishes washed the house straightened games played television programs hashed out a cheers rerun was the majority selection of the evening and the mash minority abided grudgingly by the decision then meds were taken with juice or the orangeflavored liquid thorazine was chugged and it was bedtime kohler had found ronnie hiding in the corner of his room what would you like to do about the noise kohler now asked i dont know the patients voice was dull as he chewed his tonguean attempt to moisten a mouth painfully dry from his proketazine adaptation causes stressthe hardest thing for schizophrenics to cope withand kohler reflected ronnie had plenty to adapt to here in the halfway house he had to make decisions to consider the likes and dislikes of the other people living with him he had to plan ahead the safety of the hospital was gone here he was confronted daily with these matters and a downhearted kohler could see the young man was losing the battle outside vaguely visible in the darkness was a lawn that had been kept perfectly mowed by the patients all summer long and was now handstripped of every leaf that made the mistake of falling upon it kohler focused on the window and saw his haggard face in the black reflection his eyes socketlike his chin too narrow he thought for the thousandth time that year about growing a beard to flesh out his features tomorrow kohler said to his unhappy patient well do something about it tomorrow thats just great i could be dead tomorrow and so could you mister dont forget it snapped the patientsneering at the man to whom he owed not only such peace of mind as he possessed but probably his life as well even before hed decided to attend medical school richard kohler had learned not to take personal offense at anything schizophrenic patients said or did if ronnies words troubled him at all it was only because they offered a measure of the patients relapse this was one of kohlers clinical errors the patient involuntarily committed at marsden state hospital had responded well to his treatment there after many trials to find a suitable medication and dosage kohler began treating him with psychotherapy he made excellent progress when one of the halfwayhouse patients had improved enough to move into an apartment of her own kohler placed ronnie here immediately though the stresses accompanying communal living had brought out the worst of ronnies illness and hed regressed growing sullen and defensive and paranoid i dont trust you ronnie barked its pretty fucking clear whats going on here and i dont like it one bit and theres going to be a storm tonight electric storm electric can opener get it i mean you tell me i can do this i can do that well its bullshit into his perfect memory kohler inserted a brief mental notation about ronnies use of the verb can and the source of his panic attack tonight it was too late in the evening to do anything with this observation now but hed review the young mans file tomorrow in his office at marsden and write up a report then he stretched and heard a deep bone pop would you like to go back to the hospital ronnie he asked though the doctor had already made this decision thats what im getting at there isnt that racket there no its quieter i think id like to go back doctor i have to go back ronnie said as if he were losing the argument there are reasons too numerous to list well do it then tuesday you get some sleep now ronnie still dressed curled up on his side kohler insisted that he put on his pajamas and climb under the blankets properly which he did without comment he ordered kohler to leave the light on and did not say good night when the doctor left his room kohler walked through the ground floor of the house saying good night to the patients who were still awake and chatting with the night orderly who sat in the living room watching television a breeze came through the open window and enticed by it kohler stepped outside the night was oddly warm for november it reminded him of a particular fall evening during his last year of medical school at duke he recalled walking along the tarmac from the stairs of the united that year the trip between la guardia and raleighdurham airports had been like a commute for him hed logged tens of thousands of miles between the two cities the night he was thinking of was his return from new york after thanksgiving vacation hed spent most of the holiday itself at murray hill psychiatric hospital in manhattan and the friday after it in his fathers office listening to the old man argue persuasively then insist belligerently that his son take up internal medicinegoing so far as to condition his continuing financial support of the young mans education on his choice of specialty the next day young richard kohler thanked his father for his hospitality took an evening flight back to college and when school resumed on monday was in the bursars office at am applying for a student loan to allow him to continue his study of psychiatry kohler again yawned painfully picturing his homea condominium a half hour from here this was a rural area where he could have afforded a very big house and plenty of property but kohlers goal had been to forsake land for convenience no lawn mowing or landscaping or painting for him he wanted a place to which he might escape small and contained two bedrooms two baths and a deck not that it didnt have elements of opulencethe condo contained one of the few cedar hot tubs in this part of the state several kostabi and hockney canvases and what was described as a designer kitchen but arent all kitchens he had slyly asked the realestate broker designed by somebody and enjoyed her sycophantic laughter the condo which was on a hilltop and looked out over miles and miles of patchwork woods and farmland during the day and the sparkling lights of boyleston at night wasquite literallykohlers island of sanity in a most insane world yet tonight he made his way back into the halfway house and climbed the creaking stairs to a room that measured ten by twelve feet and was outfitted only with a cot a dresser and a metal mirror bolted to the wall he stripped off his suit jacket and loosened his tie then lay on the cot kicking off his shoes he looked out the window at a dull spray of stars then lowering his eyes saw a ridge of clouds in the west slicing the sky in half the storm hed heard it was supposed to be a bad one although he himself liked the rain he hoped there wouldnt be any thunder which would terrify many of his patients but this concern passed immediately from his mind as he closed his eyes sleep was all he could think of now he could taste it he felt the fatigue ache in his legs he yawned cold tears into his eyes and in less than sixty seconds he was asleep they signed their names a dozen times and became millionaires a hundred sheets of paper filled with scrolly writing peppered with words like whereas and hereby sat on the desk before the two women affidavits receipts tax returns releases powers of attorney owen stern and looking very much the lawyer circulated each document and said duly executed every time a signature was scratched upon a sheet hed squeeze his notarial seal and sign his own name with a mont blanc and then check off another item on his closing sheet portia seemed amused at his severity and on the verge of needling him about it lis on the other handafter six years

massive black mahogany desk that liss father had bought in barcelona in the sixties for this occasionthe closing of his estatelis had unearthed a shellacked découpage poster that she herself had made

a yellow postit tag marked with his boxy writing ill have copies made for you portia keep them safe lis warned portia tightened her mouth at the motherly tone and lis winced looking for a way to apologize but before she could find the words owen lifted a bottle of champagne to the desk and opened it he poured three glasses heres to lis began and noticed the others gazing at her expectantly she said the first thing into her mind father and mother glasses chimed together practically speaking owen explained thats the end of the estate most of the transfers and disbursementsve been made we have one account still open thats for the outstanding feesthe executrix law firm and accountant oh and for that other little matter he looked at lis did you tell her lis shook her head portia kept her eyes on owen tell me what we just got notice on friday youre going to be sued what a challenge to the bequests no who that problem with your fathers will what problem there a fuckup someplace portia looked at owen with amused suspicion not from me there wasnt i didnt draft it im talking about the problem with his school doesnt this ring a bell portia shook her head and owen continued explaining that when andrew lauberget passed away hed left his entire estate in trust for his wife when she died the money went to the daughters with a small bequest going to his alma mater a private college in massachusetts oh bless me for i have sinned portia whispered sarcastically and crossed herself their father had often reminiscedreverently and at great lengthabout his days at kensington college the bequest was for a thousand so what let em have it owen laughed oh but they dont want that they want the million he was going to leave them originally a million about a year before he died lis continued the school started admitting women that was bad enough but it also adopted a resolution banning gender and sexualorientation discrimination you must know all this portia she turned to her husband didnt you send her copies of the correspondence please lis a little credit shes a beneficiary she had to be copied i probably got it but you know if its got a lawyers letterhead on it and theres no check inside who pays any attention lis started to speak but remained silent owen continued your father did a codicil to his will cutting his bequest to the school to a thousand in protest the old shit portia when he wrote the chancellor telling him about the change he said he wasnt im pretty much quoting he wasnt against women and deviates he was simply for tradition i repeat what a shit the schools challenging the codicil what do we do basically all we have to do is keep an amount equal to their original bequest in the estate account until its settled you dont have to worry well win but we still have to go through the formalities not worry portia blurted its a million dollars oh theyll lose owen announced he did execute the codicil during that spell when he was taking percodan pretty regularly and lis was spending a lot of time at the house thats what the schools lawyers going to argue lack of capacity and undue influence by one of the other beneficiaries why do you say they wont win grimfaced lis sipped her champagne i dont want to hear this again her husband smiled im serious owen he said to his sisterinlaw the lawyer for the school i did a little investigating turns out hes been negotiating contracts on behalf of the school with a company his wifes got a major interest in big conflict of interest and a felony by the way im going to offer him four or five to settle lis said to portia he makes it sound like a legal tactic to me its blackmail of course its blackmail portia said so but you think this lawyerll talk the school into settling hell be persuasive im sure owen said unless he wants an address change to the bridewell mens colony so basically hes fucked portia laughed she held up her glass good job attorney owen tapped his glass to hers portia drained her champagne and let owen pour her more to her sister she said i wouldnt get on this boys bad side lis he might do to you what he does unto others owens stony façade slipped and he laughed briefly lis said i guess i just feel insulted i didnt even know the school was getting any money in the will i mean can you imagine father even talking to me about it undue influence i say let them sue well i say let our lawyer handle it with her workinggirl hair rimmed by the black lace headband portia seemed miraculously transported back to six or seventhe age at which it first was clear that the sisters would be such different people this process seemed to continue by inches and miles lis sensed even tonight owen poured more moët never wouldve been a problem if your fatherd kept his money to himself and his mouth shut thats the moral no good deed goes unpunished your services expensive owen portia asked wryly never at least not for beautiful women its in my retainer agreement lis stepped between these two people bound to her one by blood and one by law and put her arms around owen see why hes such a rainmaker cant make much rain if he doesnt charge i didnt say im free owen looked at portia i just said im not expensive you always have to pay for quality lis walked to the stairway portia come here i want to show you something the sisters left owen stacking the papers and climbed upstairs the silence again grew thick and lis realized that it was her husbands presence that had made conversation possible between the sisters here we go she stepped in front of portia and then pushed open the door to a small bedroom sweeping on the overhead light voilà portia was nodding as she studied the recently decorated room lis had spent a month on the place making dozens of trips to ralph lauren and laura ashley for fabrics and wallpaper to antique stores for furniture shed managed to find an old canopy bed that was virtually identical to the one that had been portias when this was her room years ago what do you think taking up interior decorating are we thats the same curtain material amazing that i found it maybe a little yellower is all remember when we helped mother sew them i was what fourteen you were nine i dont remember probably lis looked at the womans eyes what a job portia offered walking in a slow circle on the oval braided rug incredible last time i was here it looked like an old closet motherd just let it go to hell then why dont you like it lis wondered silently she asked remember pooh and nodded at a mangy steiff bear whose glassy eyes stared vacantly at the corner of the room where a shimmery cobweb had emerged since lis had last cleaned the place twentyfour hours ago portia touched the bears nose then stepped back to the door and crossed her arms whats the matter lis asked its just that im not sure i can stay what do you mean i wasnt really planning on it youre talking about tonight portia really its too late to go therere trains all night liss face grew hot i thought youd be here for a couple of days i know we talked about it i i guess id really rather just get the train back i shouldve told you you dont even call and say youll be late you dont even tell us youve gotten a ride you just show up get your money and leave lis but you cant just sit on a train for two hours and then turn around and go back its crazy lis walked to the bed she reached for the bear then thought better of it she sat on the chenille spread portia we havent spoken in months weve hardly said a damn word since last summer portia finished her champagne and put the flute on the dresser a questioning look started to cross her face you know what im talking about lis said right nows tough for me to be away lee and ire going through a hard time whenll be a good time portia waved her hands at the room im sorry you went to all this work maybe next week a couple weeks ill come out earlier spend the day the silence was suddenly broken by owens voice calling sharply for lis startled she looked toward the door then back to her lap and found that shed picked up the bear after all she stood abruptly setting the toy back on the pillow lis came owens urgent voice come down here coming then lis turned to her sister she said lets talk about it and before portia could open her mouth to protest walked out of the room this smells of being whipped well id guess before the two men lay a sharp valley that rose fifty feet above them filled with black rocks and tangles of vine and barkless branches many dead and rotten moisture glittered on undergrowth like a million snake scales and the dew stained their jumpsuits the same dark blue the uniforms turned when they worked the piss n shit ward look at that how dwe even know its his footprint because its size fourteen and hes barefoot who the hells do you think it is now shut up the moon was fading behind clouds and in the growing darkness each man thought the scene before him was straight out of a horror film say meaning to askyou bumping uglies with psaltz adlers secretary stuart lowe snickered like thatd be a real smart thing to do im really thinking we shouldve bitched more didnt either of us have to come we aint cops the men were largeboth muscular and talland sported crew cuts lowe a blond frank jessup was dark they were easygoing and had neither hatred nor love for the troubled men and women under their care their job was a job and they were pleased to be paid decent money in an area that had little money for any work they were not however pleased about this assignment tonight was a honest mistake lowe muttered whodve guessed hed do what he done jessup leaned against a pine tree and his nostrils flared at the aroma of turpentine how bout mona you fucking her who mona cabrill mona the moaner the nurse from d ward oh right no are you not yet jessup said i myselfd slip her a dose of thiopental and jump her bones the minute she conked out lowe grunted disagreeably lets stay focused here frank wed hear him big fellow like that cant walk past without knocking something down she didnt wear a bra last week tuesday the head nurse sent her home to get one but it was tit city for a while there was a faint scent of campfire or woodstove smoke in the damp air lowe pressed a thick palm into each of his eye sockets while he examined exactly how scared he was my point is they pay cops for this kind of stuff shhh jessup hissed abruptly lowe jumped thenat the bark of laughterhit his partner very hard on the arm you son of a bitch they sparred for a moment rougher than they meant to be because they were bleeding off tension then they started up the valley once more the men were spooked true but it was more the setting than the escapee both men knew michael hrubek lowe had supervised him for most of the four months the patient had been incarcerated at marsden state hospital hrubek could be a real son of a bitchsarcastic picky irritatingbut he hadnt seemed particularly violent still lowe added im thinking we deepsix it and call the cops we bring him back we keep our jobs they cant fire us for this how was we to know they cant fire us jessup snorted youre dreaming boy you and mere white men under forty they can fire us cause they dont like the way we crap lowe decided they should stop talking they proceeded in silence thirty yards up the cold suffocating valley before they noticed the motion it was indistinct and might have been nothing more than a discarded grocery bag shifting in the breeze but there was no breeze maybe a deer but deer dont walk through the forest humming singsong tunes to themselves the orderlies glanced at each other and took stock of their weaponryeach had a container of mace and a rubber truncheon they adjusted their grips on the clubs and continued up the hill he doesnt want to hurt anybody lowe announced then added ive worked with him plenty im pleased about that jessup whispered shut the fuck up the moaning reminded lowe who was from utah of a legtrapped coyote that wouldnt last the night its getting louder he said unnecessarily and frank jessup was far too spooked by now to shush him again its a dog lowe suggested but it wasnt a dog the sound came straight from the thick throat of michael hrubek who with an astonishingly loud crash stumbled into the midst of the path twenty feet in front of the orderlies and froze like a fat statue lowe thinking of the many times hed bathed and coddled and reasoned with hrubek suddenly felt himself the team leader he stepped forward hello michael how are you the response was mumbled jessup called hey mr michael my fave patient you all right except for muddy shorts hrubek was naked his face was outlandishly alienwith its blue tint pursing lips and possessed eyes arentcha cold lowe found the voice to say youre pinkerton agents you fuckers no its me its frank you remember me michael from the hospital and you know stu here were the fuckina orderlies from e ward you know us man hey he laughed goodnaturedly what are you doing without any clothes on what are you doing hiding in yours fucker hrubek retorted with a sneer suddenly the reality of their mission struck lowe with a jolt my god they werent in the hospital they werent surrounded by fellow staffers there was no telephone here no psychiatric nurses nearby with two hundred milligrams of phenobarb he grew weak with fear and when hrubek gave a shout and fled up the valley jessup not far behind lowe remained where he was frank hold up lowe called but jessup didnt wait and reluctantly lowe too started after the huge bluewhite monster who was leaping along the trail hrubeks voice echoed in the damp valley begging not to be shot or tortured lowe caught up with jessup and they ran side by side the orderlies crashed through the undergrowth swinging their truncheons like machetes jessup panted jesus on these rocks how can he run on these rocks a memory suddenly came to lowethe image of hrubek standing behind the hospitals main building his shoes around his neck walking barefoot on gravel over and over muttering as if speaking to his feet and encouraging them to toughen up that had been just last week frank lowe wheezed theres something funny about this we oughta and then they were flying sailing through the black air trees and rocks tumbling upside down over and over with identical screams they plunged into the ravine that hrubek had easily leapt over the orderlies smacked against the rocks and branches on their way down and their spinning bodies slammed into the ground with vicious jolts an icy cold began to radiate through lowes thigh and arm they lay motionless in the gray ooze of the mud jessup tasted blood lowe examined his bent fingers attention to which flagged when he wiped the mud from his forearm and found that it wasnt mud at all but a wide footlong scrape where skin used to be cocksucker he wailed im gonna hurt that asshole bad its the last thing i do oh shit im bleeding to death oh shit lowe rolled into a sitting position and pressed the scrape feeling in horror his own hot torn flesh jessup was content to lie unmoving in the methanescented mud and breathe a few cubic centimeters of air the most his stunned lungs would accept he gasped wetly after a moment he was able to whisper i think lowe never found out what was on jessups mind because at that moment hrubek strode into the middle of the ravine he casually bent down pushing stuart lowe aside and plucked the mens teargas canisters from their belts flinging them deep into the woods he turned abruptly back to lowe who looked up into hrubeks leering face and began to scream stop that hrubek screamed in return stop that noise lowe did and using the advantage of hrubeks own panic scrabbled away jessups eyes closed and he began muttering incoherently lowe lifted the truncheon youre from pinkerton hrubek barked pinkerton im in the pink mr fuckina orderly your arm looks pretty pink and tender nice try but you shouldntve come after meive got a death to attend to the rubber stick in lowes hand remained poised for a moment then with a gushing sound landed in the mud at his feet he took off running blindly through the woods his courage suddenly as flimsy as the grass and saplings that bent beneath his pounding feet oh dont leave me stu jessup cried into the mud at his lips i dont want to die alone hrubek watched the disappearing form of stuart lowe then knelt on top of jessup pushing his head further into the ground the orderly tasted dirt and grass the flavor of which reminded him of his childhood he began to cry you dumb fucker hrubek said then he raged and i cant wear your clothes either he poked sharply at the stitched label marsden state mental health facility on jessups jumpsuit what good are you he began to sing good night ladies good night ladies im going to see you cry will you let me go please michael you found me out and what im doing has to be a surprise good night laaaaaaadies im going to see you die i wont tell nobody michael please let me go oh please i got a wife oh is she pretty do you fuck her often do you fuck her in unpleasant ways say whats her address please michael sorry hrubek whispered and leaned down the orderlys scream was very loud and very brief to michael hrubeks unbounded pleasure it set in flight an exquisite owl curiously golden in the ravines blue light which soared from a nearby oak tree and passed not five feet from the huge mans astounded face repeating the national weather service has issued an emergency storm warning for residents of marsden cooper and mahican counties winds in excess of eighty miles an hour tornadoes and severe flooding in lowlying areas are expected the marsden river is already at flood level and expected to rise at least three more feet cresting around one or two am well bring you bulletins as more information is available portia found them in the den leaning over the teak stereo cabinet both grim classical music resumed and owen shut the radio off portia asked what the problem was storm he turned to look out the window the marsdenits one of the rivers that feed the lake we were getting estimates on building up the shoreline lis said but we didnt think thered be any flooding till the spring lis left the den and walked into the large greenhouse looking up at the sky murky but still placid her sister saw her troubled face and glanced at owen theres no foundation he explained to her the greenhouse your parents built it right on the ground if the yard floods itll be the first to go lis said not to mention she thought what the fiftyfoot oak tree hovering overhead might do to the thin glass panes of the greenhouse roof she glanced at the brick wall beside her and absently straightened a stone gargoyle who grinned mischievously as he stuck out his long curly tongue damn she whispered are you sure itll flood portia asked she sounded irritatedbecause lis supposed her escape from the lauberget manse tonight was looking complicated if it goes up three feet lis said itll flood itll come right into the yard it happened in the sixties remember washed away the old porch that was right here where were standing portia said she didnt recall lis looked at the windows again wishing they had time to put plywood on the roof and sides theyd be lucky to build up the lakefront by two feet and tape half the windows before the storm hit so she said sighing we tape and sandbag owen nodded lis turned to her sister portia could i ask you to stay the young woman said nothing she seemed less irritated than daunted by a conspiracy to keep her there we could really use your help owen looked from one sister to the other frowning werent you going to stay for a few days im really supposed to get back tonight supposed lis wondered and who had dictated that the hardtimes boyfriend ill take you to the station tomorrow first thing you wont miss more than an hour of work portia nodded okay listen lis said sincerely i appreciate this she hurried outside to the garage giving a short silent prayer of thanks for the weather that would keep her sister here at least for the night suddenly however this benediction struck lis as a token of bad luck and superstitiously she retracted it she then went to work assembling shovels and tape and burlap bags three in two years the tall man in the smart gray uniform rubbed his matching gray mustache and added they run away from you all here licketysplit dr ronald adler fiddled with his waistband with a monumental sigh meant to put himself on the offensive he said arent there more valuable ways to use this time captain don ill bet there are the state trooper chuckled how come you didnt report it we reported callaghans uhm death adler said you know what im saying doctor i thought we could get him back without any fuss how exactly by one orderly getting his arm exorcised around backwards and the other one crapping in his jumpsuit he is not essentially a dangerous man peter grimes offered incidentally reminding both adler and the state trooper that he was in the room a fact they had forgotten any competent staff member wouldve handled it differently they were playing cowboy they fell off the cliff and were injured fell uhm you boys here tried a coverup and that dont sit well with me theres nothing to cover up i dont call you every time joe patient wanders off the grounds dont go scratching me between the ears adler we almost got him butcha didnt now whats he look like hes big grimes began before his voice froze in fear of careless adjectives how the hell big come on gemmuns times awasting adler gave the description then added he shaved his head and dyed his face blue dont ask he just did he has brown eyes a wide face dirty teeth and hes twentyseven years old captain don haversham a man twice hrubeks age jotted notes in even script okay we got a couple cars headed up to stinson i see that doesnt appeal to you adler but its gotta be done now tell me how dangerous will he come jumping outta trees no no the director said glancing at grimes who poked into his mushroom crown of black hair adler continued hrubek hes likewhat would you saya big lovable dog this escape hes playing a game woof woof the captain said seem to recall he was the one involved in that indian leap thing thats not lovable and thats not a dog then why adler inquired did the captain ask his opinion if the trooperd already diagnosed hrubek i want to know if hes still dangerous after hes been in the care of you sawbones all these four months id guess he is though what with that fellow you got on the slab tonight tell me hrubek he taking his pills like a good boy yes he is adler said quickly but wait a minute callaghan was probably a suicide suicide grimes again looked toward his boss and tried to match round words and square facts the coronerll tell us for sure adler continued im sure he will haversham said cheerfully kind of a coincidence though wouldnt you say this callaghan kills himself then your cuddle puppy hrubek skedaddles in his body bag uhm adler pictured locking haversham into the old hose room with billie lind prescott who would off his stelazine masturbate while howling at the top of his lungs for hour after hour after hour grimes said the thing is and as both men turned to him stopped speaking adler filled the void young peter was going to say that in the months hrubeks been with us hes been a model patient he sits quietly doesnt bother anyone hes like a vegetable a wet laugh burst from havershams throat he said to grimes vegetable was a dog a minute ago must be getting worse tell me now what kind of crazy is he exactly hes a paranoid schizophrenic schizo split personality i seen that flick no not multiple personalities schizophrenic it means he has delusions and cant cope with anxiety and stress he stupid a retard the professional in adler bristled at the word but he remained placid no hes got a medium to high iq but hes not calculating the captain snickered hed have to be kinda sorta calculating wouldnt you think to get clean away from a hospital for the criminally insane adlers lips vanished momentarily as he turned them inward in contemplation the taste of his wife returned and he wondered if hed get an erection he didnt and he said to haversham the escape was the fault of the orderlies theyll be disciplined seems to me they have been at least the one with the broken arm listen don can we do this one quietly the captain grinned why scared of a little publicity mr three in two years adler paused then spoke in a low voice that barely broke above the ghostly wail that still filled the halls now listen to me captain you quit jerking my chain ive got close to a thousand of the most unfortunate people in the northeast in my care and money to treat about one quarter of em i can all right now i can make some of their lives better and i can protect the general populace from them im doing the fucking best i can with the fucking money ive got dont tell me that you havent had troopers cut back too well i have thats a fact if this escape becomes a big deal some prick of a reporters going to run with it and then maybe there goes more money or maybe the statell even look into closing down this place adlers arm swept toward the wards filled with his hapless chargessome asleep some plotting some howling some floating through nightmares of madness or perhaps even dreaming dreams of sanity if that happens then half those peoplell be wandering around outside and theyre going to be your problem not mine simmer down now doc haversham whose lawenforcement career like most senior officers was informed more by his skills at selfpreservation than detection said tell me the gods truth you say a lowsecurity patient wandered away thats what ill go with but you tell me hes dangerous itll be a whole different ball game whats it gonna be adler hiked up his waistband he wondered if his wife was at home masturbating as ardently as billie lind prescott hrubeks halfcomatose adler spoke directly into the eyes of peter grimes the young assistant nodded numbly and added hes stumbling around in a daze like a gindrunk fool and wondered what on earth possessed him to say that okay haversham said with finality ill send it out as a missingpatient notice you got some fellow wandered off and youre worried about his welfare thatll make sure its not scannerfeed these boys and girls they call reporters round here wont even notice it not with a storm gonna take off roofs i appreciate this don now let me ask you got some bucks to spend hows that theres somebody im thinking might be a help but he aint cheap were a state hospital adler said we dont have much money that may be true but one thing you do have is an escaped nutzo who happens to look like attila the effing hun so what about it you gonna hear me out oh by all means captain by all means a cold and anxious michael hrubek stood on broad naked feet in the center of a large rectangle of ruined grass his hands gripped the waistband of his muddy and dewstained shorts and he stared at the shabby building before him the small shoptaxidermy trapping and hunting supplieswas surrounded by chicken wire suspended from rusted posts with baggie twist ties much of the mesh was squashed to the ground in a way that for some reason depressed hrubek profoundly he had run all the way from the site of the attack on the orderlies to this cluster of lights ghostly in the fog a truck stop which contained this shop a diner a gas station and an antique store positive he was being pursued by the secret service hrubek wanted to keep moving but as hed announced aloud to himself a naked mand be too damn obvious make no mistake about that hed then noticed a window in this outdoors shop and that had decided the matter he now stood in the exact spot where hed been frozen in place for the past few minutes gazing into the store at seven tiny animal skulls boiled and bleached white as clouds oh look there look at that seven was an important number in the cosmology of michael hrubek and he now leaned forward counting them aloud and enjoying the sound of the numbers in his mouth seven skulls seven letters michael make no mistake he thought this is a special night much of hrubeks thinking was metaphoric and the image now occurred to him that he was waking up he liked to sleep he loved to sleep hours and hours in bed his favorite position was on his side with his knees drawn up as far as his massive legs and thick chest and belly would allow most of his waking hours too were a type of sleepa slippery succession of chaotic dreams a jumble of disconnected faces and scenes that fished past him products of both his troubled mind and various medications awake he bent down and in the dirt at his feet wrote with his stubby finger i as i am awake tonight awake he made his way around the store noting a sign that said the owner was on vacation he kicked in the side door and entered avoiding a tall black bear mounted in a rearing position he made a circuit of the shop he inhaled deeply and smelled musk and boiled game flesh his hands shaking with exhilaration he noticed shelves containing clothing and he rummaged through the piles of shirts and coveralls until he found several items that more or less fit then socks and finally an irishtweed cap that he liked very much he placed it on his head very fashionable he whispered looking into a mirror hrubek continued searching until he located a pair of engineers boots and struggled to pull them on they were tight but not painful john worker he muttered running his hands over his clothes with approval john worker he poured cleaning fluid onto a rag and scrubbed hard at his face to remove the blue ink from his cheeks and forehead he solemnly placed the seven skulls into a green canvas backpack he found in the shop then keeping a suspicious eye on the rearing bear hrubek crossed the floor to the sales counter where hed noticed a display of cellophane packs of beef jerky he ripped them open with his teeth one after another and chewed down the salty meat all eight packages he was about to leave when he glanced down beneath the counter and his face broke into a huge grin a present from jesus cryist our weeping lord the pistol was a longbarreled colt revolver hrubek lifted it to his face and smelled it and rubbed the cold blue metal on his cheek grinning like a boy whod just pocketed a tendollar bill he put the gun in his backpack and once more sizing up the bear slipped from the door a wedge of light suddenly filled the grass accompanied by the clatter of an aluminum door hrubek stepped quickly into a large open shed behind the shop and pulled the pistol from the backpack a mans voice cut through the night you left it out there you go pick it up its rusted ill tan your hide young man the man was speaking from a dingy but brightly lit onestory house from whose chimney drifted wood and trash smoke it was about thirty yards from the shop a boy about eight or nine walked sullenly past the shed without looking inside he disappeared behind the shop a moment later he started back toward the house holding a long hammer close to his eyes inspecting it and scratching hopelessly with his thumbnail at dots of rust a noise nearby startled hrubek a fat raccoon was in the shed scuttling over the concrete floor it hadnt seen him and was nosing obliviously among garbage bags the boy had heard the scratching of claws on concrete and stopped holding the rusted hammer like a club he stepped to the shed door and peered into inky darkness hrubeks heart began to pulsate violently as he wondered what to do if the boy confronted him what will i tell him i knowi will tell him that i am william tell i will shoot him in the head hrubek said to himself and tried to control his panicked breath the raccoon paused cautiously as it heard the boys footsteps its head turned and seeing hrubek the animal tensed baring its fangs it panicked and leapt at the madmans leg in a short portion of a second hrubek lunged seizing the big animal by the neck even before the needlelike claws lashed out hrubek snapped its spine with a quiet pop nice try he thought no such luck the animal quivered once and died the boy stepped closer to the doorway and listened when he heard nothing else he walked slowly back into the house the backyard spotlight was extinguished hrubek calmed as he absently stroked the fur of the raccoon for a moment then arranged the animal very carefully on its stomach with its rear legs and tail spread out behind its front paws reaching forward salivating with lust hrubek picked up a screwdriver from a workbench and drove it deep into the back of the animals skull then he extracted the tool and threw the limp corpse into the corner of the garage as he was about to leave he looked above his head and saw a row of six animal traps hanging from pegs well look at this more presents thesell slow em up make no mistake slipping three of the traps into his backpack hrubek stepped outside he paused in the middle of a dusty patch behind the shop and smelled his hands mixed with the gasoline was a musky scent from the raccoon he held his fingers close to his face and inhaled this smell on the woodfireladen air deep deep so deep that his lungs hurt as if the air overflowed into his groin he went almost immediately erect he guided his penis out of his overalls and stroked himself absently using the slick blood from the screwdriver to lubricate the motion eyes closed he swiveled his head sideways keeping time with his right arm feeling the pitch intensify growing more and more dizzy as he hyperventilated he moaned an unearthly sound as he ejaculated amply and hard upon the dark earth hrubek wiped his hands on the grass then he adjusted his irish hat square on his head slipping into a stand of bushes he crouched down and made himself comfortable there was only one more thing he needed right now and he knew in his heart god was about to send it to him owen atcheson pulled a large pile of burlap bags from a shelf in the greenhouse theyd made good progress on the shoreline and had already built up one lowlying portion of lawn with several feet of sandbags his muscles ached and he stretched hard thinking of a meeting he had scheduled for tomorrow his trip later in the week he glanced outside and saw lis beside the lakefront filling bags with sand moving silently down the aisle he passed plants whose names he neither knew nor cared to know a timed watering valve clicked open and filled portions of the greenhouse with clouds of mist that obscured plants and the stone basreliefs that hung on the brick at the far end of the space he stopped portia looked up at him with her hazel eyes i thought i saw you in here he said first aid she pulled her skirt high turning away from him and revealing on her thigh a small smear of blood a foot above the back of her knee what happened came down for a new roll of tape i bent over and a fucking thorn got me in the ass part of its still in there i can feel it doesnt look too bad doesnt it hurts like hell she turned around and looked him up and down then gave a short laugh you know you look like a lord of the manor very medieval sort of like sir ralph lauren her voice seemed laced with mockery but immediately she smiled in a way that seemed to include him in a private joke her face contorted as she dug into the tiny wound with a fingernail lacquered red as the blood that dotted her skin four silver rings were on each hand and a complicated spiral earring dangled from one lobe the other was pierced by four silver hoops portia had refused liss offer of more practical clothing she still wore her shimmering goldandsilver skirt and loose blouse the greenhouse was chill and it was clear to owen that she wore no bra beneath the satiny white cloth he scanned her figure briefly reflecting that while his wife with her boyish figure might be called striking or handsome her sister was a purely voluptuous creature at times it amazed him that they shared the same genes let me look at it he said again she turned her back and lifted her skirt he clicked on a table lamp and shone it on her pale leg then knelt to examine the wound would it really float away she asked the greenhouse probably portia smiled what would lis do without her flowers do you have flood insurance no the house is below flood level they wouldnt write the policy i dont imagine the rosebushesd be covered anyway it depends on the policy thats a bargained risk once a lawyer always a lawyer portia said he looked up but again could not tell if she was taunting him she continued that porch lis mentioned on this part of the yard i think shes wrong i dont think it got washed away i think father tore it down to build mother the greenhouse portia nodded toward a display of tall orangered rosebushes lis acts like its a holy site but mother didnt even particularly want it i thought that ruth lived for her flowers thats the way lis tells it but nope it was father who insisted my own theory is that it was to keep her lets say occupied while he was away on business your mothers name and mischief arent words id ever put together owen dabbed away a dot of blood and peered into the wound one never knows still waters and all but then was father paranoid or what i wouldnt know i never liked him very much ooo that hurts she whispered as he probed and lowered her head when we were young we had sunday dinner on that old porch two pm sharp father rang a bell and we had to be there on the button roast potatoes green beans wed eat while he lectured about literature or business or space flights politics sometimes mostly he liked astronauts its really in there the thorn just the tip i can see it hurts like hell can you get it out ive got some tweezers he pulled out a swiss army knife she dug into her pocket and handed him a bic lighter here when he looked blank she laughed and said sterilize it living in new york you learn to be careful about what you put into your body he took the lighter and ran a flame over the end of the tweezers a swiss army knife she said watching him does it have a corkscrew on it and everything little scissors a magnifying glass you know portia sometimes its hard to tell if youre making fun of somebody its probably my abrasive bigcity attitude it gets me into trouble sometimes dont take it personally portia fell silent and turned away lowering her face to a rosebush she inhaled deeply i didnt know you smoked he returned the lighter to her i dont not cigarettes and then after wed have our dessert which was accompanied by i have no idea port owen said he should have guessed do you like port owen no i dont like port ow jesus that hurts sorry he put his large hand on the front of portias thigh and held it firmly as he pressed the tiny blade of the tweezers against the base of the thorn keep your hem up so it doesnt get blood on it she hiked her skirt slightly higher and he caught a fast view of the lace trim on red panties he pressed harder with the tweezers her eyes were closed and her teeth seated no i cant stand port either but i am an expert on the subject i paid attention during dear fathers dinnertime speeches nineteen seventeen was as good a year as the benchmark year which was she raised a querying eyebrow when he didnt respond she exhaled against the pain and said why of course i thought all of you uppercrust gentlemen farmers knew that i dont like to farm any more than i like port well garden then he felt her thigh quivering in his hand he gripped it tighter portia continued a really good port has a bouquet thats reminiscent of tobacco sunday nights after the portand fathers lecture about port or nasa or litrature or god knew whatand after our bolos levados and jam we kids had nothing to do she inhaled deeply then asked owen i didnt really have to be here did i i couldve signed everything in new york had it notarized and mailed to you right he paused you could have yes so what does she really want youre her sister does that mean im supposed to know why she asked me or does it mean she wants my company she hasnt seen much of you portia laughed breathily you got that little sucker yet its almost out owen glanced at the doorway at which his wife if inclined to enter the greenhouse at this moment would catch them at whatever it was that they were doing he probed again with the tweezers felt her shiver she bit her lip and remained silent then he lifted out the thorn and stood still holding her translucent skirt portia turned owen caught another flash of panties then held up the tweezers the tip bright with her blood youd think itd be bigger she said thanks youre a man of many talents its not too bad just a pinprick but you should put something on it bactine peroxide you have anything in the bathroom upstairs he answered the one next to our bedroom she dabbed a kleenex on the wound and examined the tissue damn roses portia muttered and dropping her hem she started toward the stairs he encircled her with his arms and pressed his mouth against hers it was not a gentle kiss her fingers found his solid biceps and pulled him closer against his bare chest she rubbed her breasts covered by only the thin cloth of her blouse im out of control owen thought out of goddamn control he closed his eyes and kissed her again his tongue slipped between her lips and played with hers she gripped his lower lip between her teeth and sucked it into her mouth then she hesitated and turned away uneasy no he commanded kiss me what if she sees us owen shushed her observing that her protest was halfhearted it was as if the risk of being caught was part of her passion perhaps most of it his hands dropped to her blouse she shuddered as a button popped off and fell at their feet but she gave no other resistance the garment separated and the backs of his hands brushed her exposed breasts are you she began but he kissed her again and spread his large hand so that a thumb and little finger each touched a nipple his other hand curled around the white flesh of her back and pulled her closer his hand yanked her skirt high and stuffed the hem of the cloth into her waistband exposing pale skin she lifted her hips but he stroked her taut silk panties once and then didnt touch them again instead he took her hand unzipped his trousers and pulled himself out closing her fingers around him roughly silently instructing her to stroke hard so hard he was nearly in pain when she flagged he ordered no harder and she did a moment later he stopped her urgently gripping her shoulders and turning her around so that her back was to him he rested his palm on the back of her hair and pushed her forward then tugged the panties down with both hands on her hips he entered her hard and instantly lost whatever selfrestraint remained he slammed against her his hands clutched her breasts and he pulled her into him her breath popping from her mouth in small bursts he lowered his teeth to the back of her neck and closed them on the nape biting hard tasting sweat and perfume she squirmed and pressed back against him whimpering the sound triggered him he slipped out and amid fierce spasms left a glistening stream down the inside of her thigh he let his weight sag onto her back gasping then he was aware of motion and he realized that shed been stroking herself all along his hands slid around to her breasts once more and he pulled on her nipples a few moments later he could feel her legs tense and as she called his name in a highpitched moan once then again her body shivered hard she remained still for a moment then eased forward and rolled onto her back he rested beside her on his knees inches apart not touching as if words were wrong as if words would give away this secret he said nothing but leaned over and kissed her cheek in a formal brotherly gesture she squeezed his hand once then owen hefted his shovel and disappeared down the culvert leaving his wife to lie like a trysting college girl beside the dark lake on a neatly stacked row of sandbags lis atcheson watched the dull clouds overhead and glanced uneasily at the house to see if portia might have witnessed their exhibition the water lapped on rocks only feet from her head but seemed despite the rising level quite peaceful she breathed deeply a number of times and closed her eyes momentarily what on earth had brought that on she wondered owen was a man with an appetite stronger than hers that was true but he had a moodiness too sex was the first thing to die when he turned sultry or preoccupied it had been three or four weeks since hed eased over to her side of the bed and the last time theyd found a more adventurous venue the kitchen the cherokee outdoors well she couldnt remember months many months hed come up to her ten minutes before carrying a load of burlap bags from the greenhouse her back had been to him and shed been bending down to muscle a sandbag into place on the levee when she heard the stack of empty bags fall nearby and felt his hands on her hips owen what are you doing she laughed and felt herself being pulled against him he was already erect no we dont have time for this my god portias doing the upstairs windows she can look right out silently he closed his hands over her breasts and kissed her hotly on the back of the neck owen no she turned around shhh was all he said and his unyielding hands moved up under her skirt owen are you nuts not now yes he said now and from behind too a position he generally didnt like he preferred to pin her on her back helpless and watch her face as he pulsed on top of her what had gotten into him maybe above the clouds theres a full moon maybe its the water lapped with the rhythm of the blues the cowboy boots she glanced at the yellow windows of the housewindows from which she was now fully if dimly visible had portia seen and if she had lis wondered well so be it hes my husband after all she closed her eyes and was astonished to find herself drowsydespite the adrenaline that still coursed in her bloodstream despite the urgency to finish the sandbagging well heres the miracle of the evening oh my god forget about floods forget about orgasms out of doors i think im falling asleep lis atcheson suffered from insomnia she might go twentyfour hours without sleep sometimes thirty thirtysix hours spent wholly alert completely awake the malady had been with her for years but had grown severe not long after the indian leap incident last may the nightmares would start fifteen or twenty minutes after shed slipped underdreams filled with black caverns blood eyes that were dead eyes that begged for mercy eyes that were cruelly alive like a whipcrack shed be awake eventually her heart would slow the sweat on her temples and neck would evaporate and shed lie in bed a prisoner of consciousness growing ill with fatigue and teased by hallucinations hour after hour after hour gazing at the bluegreen digital numerals that flicked ever onward these numbers took on crazy meanings seemed snide the shape of was comforting was a barricade if she didnt cross it asleep she knew shed lost the battle for that night she could recite all sorts of facts about sleep einstein needed ten hours a day napoleon only five the record holder for not sleeping is a californian who was awake for hours the average person sleeps between seven and a half and eight hours a tomcat sixteen there was a fatal type of insomnia a type of prion disease that destroyed the thalamus region of the brain lis owned exactly twentytwo books on sleep disorders and insomnia sometimes she recited their titles in lieu of counting sheep its just a way to avoid the nightmares liss doctor had told her you have to tell yourself theyre just dreams try repeating that theyre just dreams they cant hurt me theyre just dreams they cant hurt me she did as instructed but the awkwardness of this tonguetwisting mantra tended to waken her even further yet tonight lis atchesonlying outside barebreasted and skirt to her thighfelt sleep closing in fast she grew more and more relaxed as she gazed at the greenhouse the lights glowing ultramarine blue she heard owen slam the shovel onto a sandbag with a ring she saw portias shadow in an upstairs bedroom odd images began to dance in her mind she recognized this as lucid dreaming she saw faces melting people becoming dark shapes vaporous forms flowers mutating lis pictured a darkred a bloodred victorian john armstrong rose and that was the last image in her mind before she slipped under it was perhaps no more than ten seconds later that a branch snapped loud as a gunshot lis her ruddy hands folded scrupulously on her chest like the effigy of a longdead saint sat up instantly and irrevocably awake drawing closed her blouse and pulling down her skirt as she stared at the dark form of the man who appeared from a row of hemlocks and trod forward easing the chevy pickup off the back road onto route he goosed the lazy ticking engine until the truck climbed to seventy he heard what he diagnosed as an ornery bearing and chose not to think about it further trenton heck sat nearly reclining his left foot on the accelerator and his right straight out resting on the bench under the saggy flesh of a fouryearold male dog whose face was full of lamentation this was the way heck drovewith his leg stretched out not necessarily with a hound atop itand hed bought a vehicle with an automatic transmission and bench seat solely because of this practice exactly thirtytwo years older than the dog trenton heck was sometimes referred to as that skinny guy from hammond creek though if people saw him with his shirt off revealing muscles formed from a life of hunting fishing and odd jobs in rural towns theyd decide that he wasnt skinny at all he was lean he was sinewy only in the past month had his belly started to roll past his waistband this was due mostly to inactivity though some of it could be traced to chaindrinking budweisers and to single suppers of twin tv dinners heck tonight massaged a spot on his faded blue jeans under which was a glossy mess of old bullet wound dead center in his right thigh four years old coming up on the anniversary he reflected the wound still pulled his muscles taut as cold rubber bands heck passed a slowmoving sedan and eased back into his lane a big plastic milk bone swung from the trucks rearview mirror it looked real and heck had bought it to perplex the dog though of course it didnt emil was a purebred blood heck drove along the highway at a good clip whistling a tuneless tune between uneven teeth a roadside sign flashed past and he lifted his foot off the accelerator and braked quickly causing the hound to slide forward on the vinyl seat grimacing heck eased into the turnoff and drove a quarter mile down a country lane of bad asphalt he saw lights in the far distance and a few shy stars but mostly felt an overwhelming sense of solitude he found the deserted roadside standa shack from which a farmer had years ago sold cheese and honey heck climbed out of the truck leaving the engine running and the dog antsy on the seat hecks outfit tonight was what he always wore unless the temperature was crackling cold a black tshirt under a workshirt under a bluejean jacket covering the curly brown hair that dipped over his ears was a cap emblazoned with the logo of the new york mets the cap had been a present from a woman who could recite all the vital statistics of the flushing meadow sluggers going back fifteen years jill had a great knuckleball herself but he didnt care for the team and wore the tattered hat only because it was a present from her he looked around uneasily and wandered in a slow circle through the dusty parking area he glanced at the idling truck and concluded that it was too much of a beacon he shut off the engine and lights enveloped in darkness he resumed his pacing rustling sounded nearby heck immediately recognized the sound of a raccoons footfalls moments later he identified a residue of musk on a skunks ass fur as the animal passed silently behind him these creatures werent a threat yet as he paced he kept his hand on the black bakelite ribbed grip of his old automatic pistol dangling from an even older cowboy holster complete with rawhide leg thongs clouds filled the sky the storm was overdue rain if youve gotta he spoke silently though not heavenward but keep that wind away for another few hours lord i could use some help here and i could use it bad a twig snapped behind him loud and he turned fast coming close to drawing down on a conspicuous birch tree he knew of few animals in the wild that would snap twigs this way he recalled only a towering moose lumbering along with her calves and a sevenfoot grizzly bear gazing at heck hungrily from the amiable haze of his protectedspecies status maybe its a drunk deer he thought to cheer himself up heck continued to pace then lights filled the parking lot and the car arrived it parked with a leisurely squeal of brakes upright as a bootcamp sergeant the graysuited officer walked over the damp ground to where heck stood don heck offered a limp salute trent glad you were free good to see you that storms on its way heck said that emil of yours could scent through a hurricane i thought that may be he told haversham but he wasnt inclined to get himself lightningstruck now whos the escapee that psycho they got at indian leap last spring you remember it who dont round here snuck off in somebodys body bag tonight haversham explained about the escape crazy maybe but that shows some smarts hes over near stinson so he drove a ways this nutzo yup the coroners boy the one who was drivings over there now sos charlie fennel and a couple troopers from j hes got his bitches with him the troops dogs werent true trackers but hunting dogs labradors occasionally drafted for scenting they had fair noses and being spayed bitches they stayed clear of posts and trees and werent easily led astray but they did get distracted emil was a tracksure dog when he was on scent hed walk right over a rabbit sitting in his path and ignore it and the only sound youd hear was the rasp of his anxious breath as he charged along the trail the girls on the other hand were trackhappy and spent much of the time quartering with sloppy enthusiasm and yelping still when you were after a dangerous escapee it was good practice to go with a pack he asked haversham what they could use to scent on skivvies the captain handed over a plastic bag heck was confident that haversham knew how to handle scent articles hed have made sure that the underwear hadnt been laundered recently and that nobody had touched the cloth with their fingers the trooper added hes running mostly naked near as we can tell heck thought the captain was joking no sir hes a big fellow got lots of padding on him adler that doctor at marsden he was telling me these schizos dont feel cold like normal people its like theyre pretty numb they dont feel pain either you can hit em and they dont even know theyre hit ooo thats good to know don tell me does he fly too haversham chuckled then added they say hes pretty harmless he does this a lot adler says hes escaped from seven hospitals they always find him its like a game for him the bag he snuck out in the fellows it was was a suicide harmless didnt they read about indian leap heck snickered and nodded down the road toward marsden hospital whos crazy in there and who isnt heck was suddenly unable to look at haversham say over the phone you mentioned five hundred for my fee and the reward ten thousand that right don ten yessir the fees from my assistance fund just like normal the rewards from the state from adlers budget hes pretty anxious to get this fellow i dont suppose he put it in writing adler nope but hes really anxious to see this boy caught you collar him youll get your money trent and youre the only civvy on the case my boys cant take a penny well get him the captain looked off into the night and seemed to be debating finally he said trenton i know i told you he wasnt dangerous but keep that close to you haversham indicated the pistol on hecks hip i gotta tell youwas probably an accident from what adler says but hrubek mightve attacked a couple orderlies cracked one of ems arm like a toothpick couldve died if nobodyd found him well is he dangerous or aint he heck asked all im saying is keep your eye out say what is that piece that old p of mine heck patted his holster remembering in detail the day he handed his glock service automatic over to this very man hecks eyes frozen on the black gun as he turned it in grip first clip out slide locked open the badge and the id card followed heck had bought the uniform himself so they let him keep that though he had to sign a form that said hed never wear it in public and his face was red with anger and shame as he set his name to paper they still sell ammunition for that old thing ninemillimeter parabellum is all it is haversham stuck his head through the passenger window and stroked the hounds head the dog sat insensible and bored staring at the motion of the captains gray hair all right emil go do us and your master proud you hear you go catch us a crazy man good boy good boy haversham turned to heck isnt he a good old boy and trenton heckwhod midwived bitches and nursed pups with eyedroppers and sucked snake venom out of the shoulders of retrievers and sped to vets at ninety mph to save dogs that could be saved and shot them remorselessly with a merciful bullet when they could not who didnt speak to dogs except to command themtrenton heck just nodded at the captain with a cautious smile better be going fore that track gets cold how the hell did it happen owen barked hes a madman he cant escape did they leave the sonofabitch door open some mixup of some kind they were kind of you know sketchy on details stanley weber duly elected sheriff of the incorporated village of ridgeton turned out to have been the intruder whod wakened lis from her brief sleep hed passed by without even noticing her directed by portia down to the culvert where owen was working his news was far more disturbing than his unexpected arrival my god stan lis said its a hospital for the criminally insane dont they have bars she was remembering eyes set deep in the moonish jolly mad face teeth yellow his howling voice sic semper tyrannis lisbone hello lisbone theres no excuse for it owen paced angrily he was a large man strong in many ways and he had a temper that scared even lis the sheriff crossed his arms defensively and leaned into the anger when did it happen owen continued do they know where hes going within the last couple hours i was on the radio he pointed to his squad car as if trying to lead owens fury off track i was speaking to don haversham with the state police he added significantly hes a good man hes a captain oh a captain my lis found herself staring at the sheriffs feet in his heavy dark boots he appeared less a civil servant than a man of combat on a combat mission a breath of air stirred reaching damply into her blouse she watched a dozen leaves fall straight from the branches of a towering maple as if seeking cover before the storm arrived lis shivered and realized the kitchen door was ajar she closed it footsteps sounded suddenly and lis glanced at the doorway to the living room portia paused then entered the kitchen still dressed in her thin sexy outfit her abundant breasts provocatively defined by the white silken cloth of her blouse the sheriff nodded at the young woman who smiled indifferently the lawmans eyes dipped twice to her chest portias discman was stuffed into the pocket of the skirt and a single earplug was stuck in one ear a tinny chunkachunka sound came from the dangling plug hrubeks escaped lis told her oh no the second earplug was extracted and she flung the wire around her neck the way a doctor wears a stethoscope the raspy sound of rock music was louder now shooting from both tiny plugs say could you shut that off lis asked and portia absently complied lis owen and portia stood on glazed terracotta tile as cold as the concrete stoop outside all in a line arms crossed their formation struck lis as silly and she broke ranks to fill a kettle coffee or tea stanley no thankya hes just wandering around lost they say he got away in stinson nearly ten miles east of the hospital and fifty miles east of where they now stood lis thought like having a full gas tank or two twentydollar bills in your pocket this was a comfortmaybe insubstantial maybe useless but a comfort nonetheless so portia said hes heading away from here seems to be lis was remembering the madman bursting to life hand and foot shackles jingling his eyes molesting the trial spectators and she was the person he undressed most eagerly lisbone lisbone lis had cried thenin junehearing his hyenapitched laugh fill the courtroom and she wanted to cry now she clamped her teeth together and turned to the stove to make a cup of herbal tea owen was still firing angry questions at the sheriff how many men are out looking for him do they have dogs did he take any weapons the sheriff endured this crossexamination gamely then responded the fact is theyre not doing a whole lot about it it went out as an information bulletin only not an escapeassistance request i myselfd guess theyve pretty much cured him shocked him probably like they do with those electrode things hes out wandering around and theyll pick him up owen waved his hand and started to speak but lis interrupted if nobodys worried about it stan what are you doing here well i come by to ask if you still got that letter thought it might give em a clue where hes got himself to letter owen asked lis however knew exactly which letter he was referring to itd been her first thought this evening when the sheriff had said the word marsden i know where it is she said and went to get it mrs lisbone atcheson i am in this room i cant breathe i cant hear i am held here unfairly and they yes they are stopping me from what i must do this is very important they are holding me and have told lies about me to washington and the entire world they think that i am dangerous etc but this is their excuse and everybody believes it that is believes them they are very strong we must fear them they are everywhere it is a conspiracy con s piracy and i know you are in it revenge is mine it is not the lords because the lord knows what i have done and will not let me rest he shoots me in the head every night i accept my fate and you who are beautiful must too come to me for eternal rest forever everywhere forever revenge eve the woman come to me i your lover michael hrubeks penmanship featured green black and blue ink and for her name and his signature red the sheriff sucked air between shiny white teeth in a loud irritating way does any of this make sense to you he addressed the question to owen lis answered its just babble owen glanced at her then added we talked about it when it came but we thought it was a kids prank lis taught sophomore english at ridgeton high school im a tough grader she laughed wanly ive been on my share of sixteenyearolds shit lists i your lover the sheriff hitched at his gun belt he stared at the letter for a moment return address lis flipped through the manilla folder where shed filed itin the letters miscellaneous slot just past she now noted last will and testamentowen and lis she found the envelope there was no return address the postmark was gloucester thats nowhere near marsden she pointed out let me make a call the sheriff glanced at owen who nodded at the phone as she leaned against the counter sipping the rosehip tea lis remembered a hot saturday in september replanting a bush of hybrid tea roses lemon yellow sweat was running along her nose with a tickle owen had been working all day and had just returned about pm the sun low and wan he stood in the doorway his large shoulders slumped a piece of paper in his hand lis glanced up at him and the plant sank through her fingers a thorn piercing her skin because of the sallow grave expression on her husbands face she hadnt at first noticed the pain lis looked down a second later and saw a sphere of blood on her finger she set the plant on the ground owen handed her this very letter and she took it from him slowly leaving a bloody fingerprint on the envelopelike an oldtime wax seal portia now read it she shrugged and announced to lis ive got some stuff with me stop by the room you want it might relax you lis blinked and forced herself to appear blasé only her sister she reflected from an emotional distance would offer a joint with onefifth of the towns constabulary standing nearby his squad cars bumper proclaiming ridgeton says no to drugs this was vintage portiaplayful cunning perverse oh portiathe hip pale frenchbraided younger sister with her discman and her stream of thinfaced boyfriends shed been forced to endure an evening in the country and she was blowing lis one of the cold kisses her older sister remembered so well lis did not reply the young woman shrugged and with a glance at owen wandered out of the kitchen the sheriff who hadnt heard portias proposition and probably wouldnt have understood it if he had hung up the receiver when he spoke it was to owen well the long and the short of it is that she doesnt have anything to worry about she lis repeated to herself was this me her face burned and she sensed even oldworld owen shift uncomfortably at the sheriffs patronizing attitude they said it didnt mean nothing hrubeks a schizothey dont do well by people facetoface too nervous to talk or something so they write these long letters thatre just nonsense mostly and when they do make a threat theyre like too scared to act on it the postmark lis asked firmly gloucester oh about that i asked he may stillve sent it he got sent to this hospital there for some tests the first week in september its pretty lowsecurity he mightve slipped away and mailed a letter but what i was telling you before hes headed east away from here the sheriff and lis both looked at owen who because he was the largest person in the room and the most grave seemed to be in charge what if he isnt hell hes on foot owen the doctor said theres no way he can drive a car and whos going to give him a ride a big crazy like that im just asking you owen said what if he isnt going east what if he changes his mind and comes here here the sheriff asked and fell silent i want you to put a man on the house im sorry owen no can do weve got stan this is serious that storm coming up its supposed to be a whopper and fred bertholders in bed with the flu sick as a dog whole family has it one man just until they catch him look even the state boysre spread pretty thin theyre on highway detail mostly because of the fucking storm owen spat out he rarely swore in front of people he didnt know well he considered it a sign of weakness lis was momentarily shocked at this lapsenot at the cussing itself but the anger that would be behind it we got our priorities come on dont go looking that way owen ill check in with haversham every so often if theres any change ill be over here like greased lightning owen walked to the window and looked out over the lake he was either paralyzed with anger or deep in thought why dont you go to a hotel for the night the sheriff suggested with a cheerfulness that lis found immensely irritating hey that way youll get yourselves a good nights rest and not have to worry bout nothing good nights rest lis muttered sure believe me folks you got nothing to worry about he glanced out the window into the sky perhaps hoping for a searing streak of lightning to justify his deployment of deputies this evening ill stay on top of it yessir the sheriff offered a rueful smile as he stepped to the door only lis said good night owen paced beside the window gazing out to the lake he said matteroffactly i think we ought to do that a hotel i mean well get a couple rooms at the marsden inn a quaint little bedandbreakfast lousy owens word with dried flowers shaker furniture country wreaths and dreadfully sincere paintings of live horses dead birds and glassyeyed nineteenthcentury children not exactly the best hideout from a crazy man would you say it doesnt sound like he could even get halfway to ridgeton let alone find a hotel were staying at if he was inclined to find us in the first place besides the inn s only two miles from here i dont want to have to go far tonight we need to finish the dam and the taping owen didnt speak for a moment he asked in a distracted voice where do you think he is im not leaving till we get that levee finished the sandbags the owens eyes flashed why are you arguing lis blinked shed learned to tolerate his temper she knew it was usually misdirected her husband was angry now yes but not at herat the sheriff most times she blustered right back at him but tonight she didnt raise her voice on the other hand she wasnt going to back down im not disagreeing the hotels fine but im not leaving until weve got at least another foots worth of sandbags his eyes again looked out onto the lake while liss dipped to the letter resting on the butcher block lis smoothed it then folded the paper it made a crinkling sound and she thought for some reason of dried skin she shivered and tossed it onto a stack of bills to be filed lis pulled on her jacket was he going to argue or agree unable to anticipate his reaction she felt her stomach twisting into a knot cautiously she said it shouldnt take more than an hour still he said nothing you think we can get enough bags piled up by then owen finally turned from the window and asked what shed just said sandbags can we stack enough in an hour an hour im sure we can his serenity surprised her anyway i dont think its going to be as bad as they say you know weathermen around heretheyre always sounding false alarms the driver downshifted to the lowest of his thirteen gears and nudged the huge white tractortrailer past the restaurant and into the parking area he locked the brakes and shut off the diesel then checked a map spending more time than he thought normal for a smart man like himself to calculate that hed be in bangor by four the next afternoon a young man the driver wore his dolphins cap backwards and nike pumps on his feet in the blaupunkt was a grunge tape backed up by a half dozen rap and hiphop cassettes a secret never to be shared with any blood relation he climbed out of the cab pausing long enough to glance in the side mirror with discouragement at the constellation of acne on his cheek then dropped to the ground he was halfway to the diner when the voice barked hey john driver the huge man was suddenly next to him hovering on legs like tree trunks the driver stopped astonished as he looked up into the glistening round face the spitflecked grin the eyes as excited as a kids at a ball game howdy the driver stammered the big man suddenly grew awkward and seemed to look for something to say thats quite a machine it is he offered though he didnt look toward the truck but kept his eyes fixed downward on the driver uhn thanks you excuse me im pretty beat and im gonna get some chow chow chow sure its lucky seven see one two three four five six his arm was making a circuit of the vehicles in the parking lot seven the man adjusted the wool tweed cap that was perched on his bowling ball of a head he seemed bald and the driver wondered if he was a nazi skinhead he said lucky and laughed too loud uhoh thats eight the fellow was pointing to another truck just pulling into the lot his mouth twisted up in a smirking grin always some fucker who ruins it that does happen you bet the driver decided he could outrun this bozo but was as troubled by the thought of looking like a fool in front of fellow truckers as he was of getting stomped well yessir g night now he sidled toward the diner the big mans eyes flashed with concern wait wait wait are you going east john driver the young man looked up into the murky eyes thats not truly my name he said cautiously im going to boston thats the home of our country i really have to get to boston im sorry but i cant give you a lift i work for a lift the man asked with great curiosity a lift uhn i cant give you a ride you know what im saying i work for a company and theyd fire me i was to do that no such luck huh no such luck a rule im saying but what am i going to do they dont like it too much you try for rides in truck stops this wasnt a question but he was too frightened to offer the man a declarative sentence you might go up the road a spell and thumb up the road and thumb somebody might pick you up up the road and thumb i could do that can i get to boston that way that intersection up there see the light thats turn left thatd be north itll get you to the interstate and thatll put you in boston in no time thank you john driver god bless you up the road and thumb the big man started through the lot in a muscular awkward lope the driver said a short prayer of thanksboth for surviving this encounter and equally important for ending up with a good story to tell to his fellow truckers one that needed hardly any embellishment at all peter grimes returned to the hospital directors office and sat in a desk chair adler asked casually he did what as if resuming a conversation recently interrupted im sorry adler slapped a green file folder the nurses duty report hrubek was authorized to be in c ward he had access to the grounds he just walked right into the morgue thats how he got there he just strolled into the freezer oh peter peter peter this is not good adler had conceded the dankness of his office and was now wearing a beige cardigan into whose bottom buttonhole he poked his little finger and i found out why grimes announced he was part of dick kohlers program oh for gods sake not the halfway house no restricted to the grounds here milieu suite and the work program for some reason he had a job at the farm milking cows or something i suppose the assistant gazed out the black window toward the part of the grounds where the hospitals nonprofit farm operated by volunteers and staffed by patients spread for some ten acres into the rocky hills why wasnt any of this in the file adler slapped the folder once again as if disciplining a puppy i think therere some other files we dont have i dont know what happened to them something funnys going on did the board recommend hrubek for the program adler as a member of the marsden board of directors prayed for one particular answer to this question no grimes said ah maybe dick kohler slipped him in somehow slipped him in adler pounced we have to be very buttoned up about this my friend did you mean that slipped him in think now think carefully well i dont know hrubek was always closely supervised its not quite clear who okayed it the paperworks sketchy so maybe he wasnt adler reflected slipped in after all maybe some other idiot here dropped the ball grimes wondered if he was being insulted the hospital director breathed slowly wait a moment kohlers not on staff does he have an office here grimes was surprised adler didnt know yes he does its part of the arrangement with framington we supply facilities for the attendings hes not an attending adler snapped in a manner of speaking he is with the trooper absent grimes inexplicably felt bolder i want to find out what the hell is going on here and i want to know in the next hour whos the e ward resident on call im not exactly sure i think peter youve got to get on top of this adler snapped find out who it is and tell him to go home tell him to take the evening off yes go home are you sure and tell him not to talk to anyone im curious about this woman adler looked for a scrap of paper found it and handed it to grimes did hrubek ever mention her anybody ever mention her grimes read the name mrs owen atcheson no whos she she was at indian leap she testified against hrubek at the trial she claims she got a threatening letter from him last september when our little boy was playing with blocks at gloucester the sheriff says her husband thinks hrubeks after her ridgeton grimes mused forty miles west of here not a problem oh adler turned his red eyes on the young doctor good im so relieved now tell me why you think its quote not a problem grimes swallowed and said because most schizophrenics couldnt get three miles on their own let alone forty ah adler said sounding like a crotchety old oxford don and with what little qualifiers dear grimes did you shore up your substandard assessment grimes surrendered he fell silent and fluffed his crinkly hair a what if he isnt on his own doctor adler barked what if there are coconspirators witting or un and b what if hrubek isnt like most schizophrenics how bout them apples doctor now get on it find out exactly how the son of a bitch got out grimes had not grown so bold that he failed to say yes sir and he said it very quickly if this hold up a minute there if this adler gestured unable or unwilling to give a name to the potential tragedy if this becomes a problem hows that get lowe on the phone i need to have another little talk with him oh and wheres kohler kohler hell be at the halfway house tonight he sleeps over on sunday you think hell be in for rounds tonight no he was here at fourthirty this morning and after evaluations he went right to the halfway house and he was dead on his feet then im sure hes in bed now good should i call him call him adler stared at grimes doctor really hes the last one we want to know about this dont say a word to him not a word i just thought no you didnt just think you werent thinking at all i mean for gods sake do you call up the fucking lamb and say guess what tomorrows easter the steam rising from the plastic cup of coffee left a foggy ellipse on the inside of the windshield dr richard kohler slouching in the front seat of his fifteenyearold bmw yawned painfully and lifted the cup he sipped the bitter liquid and replaced the carton on the dash slightly to the right of where it had been he vacantly watched a new oval paint itself on the glass overlapping the one that was now fading he was parked in the staff lot of marsden state mental health facility the chunky car half hidden under an anemic hemlock was pointed at a small onestory building near the hospitals main structure the duty nurse on e ward a friend and woman he used to date had called the halfway house twenty minutes ago shed told kohler about michaels escape and warned him that adler was stonewalling kohler had flushed his face with icy water filled a thermos with coffee then run groggily to his car and driven here hed pulled into the parking lot and chosen this spot for his stakeout he now looked up at the gothic façade of the asylum and saw several lights one of them he supposed was burning in the office of good dr adler the wittier orderlies called the two doctors hatfield and mccoy and that pretty accurately described their relationship still kohler had some sympathy for the hospital director in his five years as head of marsden adler had been fighting a losing political and budgetary battle most of the state mental hospitals had been closed replaced by small communitybased treatment centers but there remained a need for places to house the criminally insane as well as indigent and homeless patients marsden was such a place adler worked hard for his chunk of the state purse and he made sure that the poor souls in his care were treated kindly and had the best of a bad situation it was a thankless job and one that kohler himself would have quit medicine before taking on but beyond that kohlers sympathy for his colleague stopped because he also knew that adler had a ayear job malpractice premiums and state benefits included and that for his paycheck he worked at most a fortyhour week adler didnt keep up with the current literature didnt attend institutes or continuingeducation sessions and rarely spoke with patients except to dispense the insincere greetings of an incumbent politician mostly though kohler resented adlers running marsden not as a treatment facility but as combination prison and daycare center containment not improvement was his goal adler argued that it wasnt the states job to fix peoplemerely to keep them from hurting themselves or others kohler would respond then whose job is it doctor adler would snap back you give me the money sir and ill start curing the two doctors had played oil and water since kohler first came to marsden brandishing courtappointment orders and trying unusual forms of therapy on severely psychotic patients then somehowno one quite knew howkohler had set up the milieu program at marsden in it noncriminal patients mostly schizophrenics learned to work and socialize with others with an eye toward moving on to the halfway house outside of stinson and eventually to apartments or homes of their own adler was just smart enough to recognize that he had a plum deal that hed have trouble duplicating anywhere in this universe and was accordingly not the least interested in having jive new york doctors rocking his delicate boat with these glitzy forms of treatment recently hed tried to have kohler removed claiming that the younger doctor hadnt gone through proper state civilservice channels to get the job at marsden but the allegation was tenuous since kohler drew no salary and was considered an outside contractor besides the patients themselves rose in rebellion when they heard the rumor that they might lose their dr richard adler was forced to back down kohler continued to work his way into the hospital ingratiating himself with the fulltime staff and cultivating friends among the practical power centersthe nurses secretaries and orderlies the animosity between kohler and adler flourished many of the doctors at marsden wondered why kohlerwho could have had a lucrative private practicebrought all this trouble on himself indeed they were perplexed why hed spend so much time at marsden in the first place where he received a small fee for treating patients and where the practice itself was so demanding and frustrating that it drove many physicians out of psychiatryand some out of medicine altogether but richard kohler was a man whod always tested himself an honors arthistory graduate student hed abruptly given up that career path at the ripe age of twentythree to fight his way into then through duke medical school those grueling years were followed by residencies at columbia presbyterian and new haven general then private practice in manhattan he worked with inpatient borderline and nearfunctioning psychotics then sought out the hardest cases chronic schizophrenic and bipolar depressives he battled bureaucratic resistance to get visitingphysician status at marsden framington and other state bedlams where he put in twelve fifteenhour days it was as if kohler thrived on the very stress that was his schizophrenic patients worst enemy early in his career the psychiatrist developed several tricks for combatting anxiety the most effective was a macabre meditation visualizing that he was slipping a needle into a prominent vein rising from his arm and drawing out a searing white light which represented the stress the technique was remarkably successful though it usually worked best when accompanied by a glass of burgundy or a joint tonight sitting in a car smelling of old leather oil and antifreeze he tried his old trick though without the chemical assist it had no effect he tried again actually closing his eyes and picturing the mystical procedure in vivid detail again nothing he sighed and gazed again at the parking lot kohler stiffened and slouched further down into the front seat as a white van on whose side was painted intertec security inc appeared and zigzagged slowly through the parking lot casting its spotlights on suspicious shadows kohler clicked on the penlight he used for neuro exams and returned to the papers in front of him these sheets represented an exceedingly abridged version of michael hrubeks personal history the records about the young mans life were woefully inadequate since he was an indigent patient very few details of his hospitalization and treatment history were available this was another sin that kohler couldnt lay at the hospital directors feet michael was the type of patient whose files were virtually nonexistent and whose past treatment was largely a mystery hed lived on the street so often been expelled from so many hospitals and used so many aliases with intake personnel that there was no coherent chronicle of his illness he also suffered from a particular type of mental disease that left him with a jumbled and confused sense of the past what paranoid schizophrenics reported was a stew of lies truth confessions hopes dreams and delusions yet for someone with kohlers experience the file he now scanned allowed him to reconstruct in some detail a portion of michaels life this fragment was startlingly illuminating he was vaguely familiar with the file having acquired it four months before when michael came under his care kohler now wished hed paid more attention to its contents when he first read it he wished too that he had more time now to review the material it contained but having skimmed the pages once he noticed that the white van had left the parking lot richard kohler set the folder on the bmws floor he started the car and drove over the wet asphalt to the onestory building hed been watching for the past half hour he circled behind it and located the back door which was near a battered green dumpster he braked to a stop debated for a moment and thenafter wisely clipping on his seat beltdrove the right front bumper of the auto into the door at what seemed to him a leisurely rate of speed still the impact shattered the wood so violently that the door cracked free of both hinges and flew deep into the darkness inside he pulled the chevy onto the shoulder of route the battered truck listed hard to the left and an orange crush empty rolled against the door the brakes squealed as the truck stopped trenton heck pushed the door open and stepped out the soda can fell clattering to the roads rocky shoulder and heck stooped painfully and pitched the empty under the seat come he said to emil who already aimed down the incline of the seat relaxed some muscle or another and slid forward then out the door he landed on the ground and stretched then blinked at the flashing lights of a statepolice car across the highway next to the litup dodge cruiser sat another blackandwhite and beside that was a tan countycoroners meat wagon four men looked up as heck crossed the wide strip of black pebbly asphalt he led emil away from the carshe always got the dog out of the truck as soon as possible at a search scene and kept him far from car engines exhaust dulls dogs noses sit heck commanded when they were in a patch of grass upwind from the cars down emil did as instructed even though he eagerly noted the presence of some fourlegged ladies nearby hey trenton one of the men called he was a large man large all over not just the bellyfood round not drink roundand his weight pulled hard at the buttons and pockets of his gray uniform he was holding back two young female labrador retrievers who nosed in the dirt hiya charlie well if it aint the cadillac of trackers this from one of the two young troopers standing on the roadside a man heck referred to though not to his face as the boy he was a narrowjawed youngster six years hecks junior in age though fifteen in appearance trenton hecks idea of dealing with a budget cutback would have been to fire this kid and keep heck himself on the force at threequarters salary but they hadnt asked his opinion and so the boy who though younger had hired on two months before heck was still a trooper while trenton heck had netted eightyseven dollars last month carting old washing machines and water softeners to the hammond creek dump hey emil the boy said heck nodded to him and waved to the other trooper who called back a greeting charlie fennel and heck walked toward the tan hearse beside which stood a young man in a palegreen jumpsuit not much of a search party heck said to fennel the trooper answered that they were lucky to have what they did theres a concert letting out at midnight or so down at the civic center you hear about that rock n roll heck muttered uhn don sent a buncha troopers over there they had some boy got shot at the last one dont they have security guards for that sort of thing was a guard who shot the kid doesnt seem like a brilliant use of taxpayers money riding herd on a bunch of youngsters paying to deafen themselves then too fennel added the captain had put a good portion of the troops on highway detail he figures what with the storm theyll be picking em off the pavement say i hear theres a reward for catching this crazy heck kept his eyes on the grass in front of him and didnt know what to say listen fennel continued in a whisper i heard about your situation trenton i hope you get that money im rooting for you thanks there charlie heck had a curious relationship with charlie fennel the same bullet that had left the shiny starshaped wound in hecks right thigh had passed first through fennels brothers chest as he crouched beside their patrol car killing the trooper instantly heck supposed that some of the mans living blood had ridden the slug into his own body and that because of that he and charlie fennel were blood brothers once removed at times trenton heck thought that he and fennel ought to be closer the more time the men spent in each others company however the less they found they had in common they occasionally talked about a hunting or fishing trip but the plans came to nothing it was a secret relief to both of them heck and fennel now paused beside the coroners meat wagon heck lifted his head and inhaled air fragrant with the decomposition so prominent on damp autumn nights like this he sniffed the air once more and fennel looked at him curiously no wood smoke heck said in response nope there dont seem to be so wherever this hrubeks got himself to it wasnt toward a house he could smell you learn that from emil heh heck asked the coroners attendant what happened exactly the young man glanced at fennel silently asking permission to answer a civilian heck had gotten used to the demise of his own authority when the attendant received a grunt of approval from fennel he explained how hrubek had escaped then added we chased him for a ways chased him did you heck couldnt resist needling well its not hardly your job to catch him i wouldntve blamed you if youd just hightailed it out of here to hell with a madman yeah well we didnt we chased him the attendant shrugged young and far above shame all right lets get to it heck noticed that fennel had put the tracking harnesses on his dogs some time ago this had worked them up and confused them if they werent immediately going on track scenting dogs should wear only their regular collars heck almost said something to fennel but didnt how the trooper ran his dogs was his business trenton heck was no longer a mantracking instructor he took the red nylon harness and quarterinch nylon track line from his pocket emil tensed immediately though he stayed rumptoground heck hooked him up and wrapped the end of the line around his own left wrist contrary to the general practice of righthand grip drugged up and giddy though this big fellow might be heck remembered havershams warning and he wanted his shooting hand free he then took the bag from his other jacket pocket he opened it pulling back the plastic from the wad of cotton shorts jesus the boy said wrinkling his nose dirty jockeys musk is the best heck muttered yum he pushed the dingy underwear toward the young trooper who danced away trenton stop that they got crazyman jism on em keep em away charlie fennel laughed hard heck subdued his own laughter and then called sternly to emil okay which meant for the dog to stand they let emil and the bitches sniff each other muzzle and ass as they exchanged their complicated greetings then heck held hrubeks shorts down toward the ground taking care not to rub the cloth on the dogs nosesjust letting them get to know a smell that to a human would vanish in an instant if it was detectable at all find heck yelled find emil the three dogs started shivering and prancing skittering in circles noses to the ground they snorted as they sucked in dust and sour fumes from gasoline or grease and picked out the invisible molecules of one mans odor from a million others find find the hound took the lead straining the line pulling heck after him the other dogs followed fennel was a big man but he was being dragged along by two frantic sixtypound labradors and he trotted awkwardly beside heck who himself struggled to keep up the pace soon both men were gasping for breath the bitches noses dropped to the ground sporadically in almost the identical spots on the asphalt of route they were steptracking inhaling at each place hrubek had put a foot on the ground emil tracked differently hed scent for a few seconds then raise his head slightly and keep it off the ground for a ways this was linetracking the practice of experienced tracking dogs continually sniffing on a steptrack could exhaust an animal in a couple of hours suddenly emil veered off the road south and started into a field of tall grass and brush filled with plenty of cover even for a man as large as hrubek oh brother heck muttered surveying the murky heath into which his dog plunged taking the scenic route here we go fennel called to the boy and the other trooper follow along the road ill call on the squawker we need you and if i call bring the scattergun hes real big the coroners attendant shouted i mean no fooling kohler pulled his bmw out of the marsden state hospital parking lot and turned onto the long access road that would take him to route he waved a friendly greeting to a security guard who was walking quickly toward an alarm bell ringing jarringly in the lot the guard did not respond although kohler was a physician and could write prescriptions for any drug that was legally available adler had instituted a rule that no controlled substancesnarcotics sedatives anestheticscould be dispensed in greater than singledose quantities without his or grimess approval this edict was issued after a young resident at marsden was caught supplementing his income by selling xanax miltown and librium to local highschool students kohler had no time to try to bluff his way past the hospitals night pharmacist and found the steel bumper of a german car a much more efficient means than paperwork to requisition what he needed as he approached the highway he pulled the car to a stop and examined the fruits of his theft the hypodermic syringe was unlike most that youd find in a doctors office or hospital it was large an inch in diameter and five inches long made of stainless steel around a heavy glass reservoir the needle mounted to it protected by a clear plastic guard was two inches long and unusually thick although no one admitted it least of all the manufacturer this was actually a livestock syringe to mds however it was marketed as a heavyduty model intended for use on patients in agitationoriented situations sitting beside the instrument were two large bottles of innovar a general anesthetic kohlerd picked because of its effectiveness when injected into muscle tissueunlike most such drugs which must be injected into the bloodstream familiar primarily with psychiatric drugs kohler knew little about innovar other than the prescribed dosages per kilo of body weight and its contraindications he knew too that he had enough drug to kill several human beings one thing he didnt know for certain but that he figured was probably accurate was that by stealing a class ii controlled substance hed just committed a felony kohler slipped the bottles and the syringe into the rustcolored backpack he carried in lieu of a briefcase then opened a small white envelope as a bonus hed also stolen several chlorphentermine capsules two of which he now popped into his mouth the doctor put the car in gear and eased forward hoping that the diet pills would kick in soon and that when they did theyd have the desired effect kohler rarely took medicine of any kind and his system sometimes responded in unexpected waysit was possible that the amphetaminelike drug would paradoxically make him drowsy richard kohler prayed that this didnt happen tonight he desperately needed his thoughts clear tonight he needed an edge an agitationoriented situation indeed as he sped out onto route looking about him in the dark night kohler felt overwhelmed and helpless he wondered if despite their antagonisms he should simply have leveled with adler and enlisted the mans aid after all the hospital director too was trying desperately to conceal michaels escape and to find him as quietly as possible for once the two medicos shared a common goalthough their motives were very different but kohler decided this would be a foolish a disastrous thing to do and might jeopardize kohlers position at marsden perhaps even his career itself oh some of kohlers concern was perhaps paranoiaa junior version of what michael hrubek lived with daily yet there was a significant difference between kohler and his patient michael was classified a paranoid because he acted as if enemies sought his darkest secrets while in fact his enemies and secrets were imaginary in his own case kohler reflected as his car accelerated to eighty they were quite real like a quarter horse cutting cattle from a herd emil would wheel and swerve crossing back and forth through brush or over scrub grass until he picked up the scent once more the dog found the spot where hrubek had tangled with the orderlies then returned to the road now he leapt off the asphalt again and charged back into the brush the labradors following his lead the searchers trotted through this field for a few minutes heading generally east away from the hospital and parallel to route at one point as they were making their way through tall whispering grass heck jerked the lead and growled sit emil stopped abruptly heck felt him shivering with excitement as if the track line were an electric wire down reluctantly the dog went horizontal the bitches wouldnt respond to charlie fennels similar command they kept tugging at their lines he pulled them back once or twice and shouted several times for them to sit but they wouldnt wishing that fennel as well as the dogs would keep quiet heck managed to ignore this bad discipline and strode ahead playing a long black flashlight over the ground lookit what i turned up heck said he shone the light on a fresh bare footprint in the earth god double damn fennel whispered thats size thirteen if its an inch well we know hes big heck touched the deep indentation made by the ball of a huge foot what im saying is hes sprinting sure hes running youre right that dr adler at the hospital said hed just be wandering around in a daze hes in some damn big hurry moving like theres no tomorrow come on weve got a lot of time to make up for find emil find fennel started the other dogs on the trail following the footprints and they ran ahead but curiously emil didnt take the lead he rose on his muscular legs but stayed put his nose went into the air and he flared his nostrils swiveling his head from side to side come on fennel called heck was silent he watched emil gazing right to left and back once more the hound turned due south and lifted his head heck called to fennel hold up shut your light out what just do it with a soft click the two men and three dogs were enveloped in darkness it occurred to heck as it must have to fennel that they were totally vulnerable the madman might be downwind ten feet away with a tire iron or broken bottle come on trenton lets dont be in too big of a hurry here fifty yards north they could see the slow convoy of the squad car and hecks pickup emil paced his head wagging back and forth in the air heck studied him intently whats he doing fennel whispered the tracks here cant he tell he knows that theres something else airborne scent maybe its not as strong as the track scent but theres something there it was possible heck considered that hrubek huge and sweating had given off masses of scent which would eddy and gather here like smoke remaining for hours on a humid night like this emil was probably scenting on the cloud of these molecules still heck was reluctant to pull the hound away he had faith in the cleverness of animals hed seen raccoons dexterously unscrew the lids of jam jars and had once watched a cumbersome grizzly bear the same one that had eyed him so voraciously carefully poke not just one but two delicate claw holes in the top of a up can then drink down the soda without spilling a drop and emil in his masters informed opinion was ten times smarter than any bear heck waited a moment longer but neither heard nor saw anything come emil he turned and started away but emil would not come heck squinted into the night there was a faint glow from the sky but most of the moonlight was now obscured by cloud come on boy he thought lets get back to work our reward moneys jogging east at about five miles an hour but emil dropped his nose and pushed into the grass he quivered heck lifted his pistol in front of him and swung aside a thick whip of green and beige shoots they continued a few feet farther into the maze of grass it was there that they found what emil had been seeking the dog was no setter but he was as good as pointing at the quarrya scrap of paper in a plastic baggie fennel had come up slowly he put his back to heck and scanned the grass nervously his service automatic sweeping left to right bait this had also occurred to heck felons accustomed to being hunted by dogs sometimes leave a pungent article of clothing or spray of urine in a tactical place on the trail when the tracker and his hound stop to examine the spot the fugitive attacks from behind but heck studied emil and said dont think so he was still around emild smell more of him still as he picked up the bag heck kept his eyes not on the plastic but on the wall of grass surrounding him and there were several pounds of pressure on the stiff german trigger of his gun he handed fennel the bag and they stepped into a clearing where they could read without fear of immediate attack from a newspaper the trooper said tore it out one sides part of an ad for bras the others a hey lookie a map downtown boston historical sites you know boston yep we call the highway patrol tell em to keep the main roads to massachusetts covered and heck who saw his precious ten thousand dollars vanishing before him said lets hold off for a bit on that maybe he left this here to lead us off naw trenton if hedve wanted us to find it he wouldve left it in the road not in manhigh grass maybe heck said very discouraged but i still think crack a fierce noise like a gunshot sounded next to hecks ear and he swung around heart pounding pistol raised the volume on charlie fennels walkietalkie had been full on when he received the transmission fennel turned down the squelch and volume knobs and palmed the unit he spoke softly into it in the distance on the road the redandblue roof lights on the boys squad car started spinning fennel here go ahead he lowered his head as he listened what are they doing heck wondered fennel signed off and put the walkietalkie back on his belt he said come on theyve found him hecks heart fell they got him oh damn well not quite he got himself all the way to a truck stop in watertown watertown thats seven miles from here and tried to hitch a ride up to guess where boston the truck driver told him no so hrubek took off on foot heading north well drive over there and pick up the trail man i hope hes winded i myself dont feel like a halfhour run dont go looking so sorrowful trenton youll be a rich man yet hes not but a half hour away fennel and the bitches bounded back toward the road come emil heck called the hound hesitated just a moment longer and slowly followed his master clearly reluctant to forsake the grassy fields damp and cold though they were for the slippery plastic bench seat of an old smelly chevrolet when she heard the deliberate footfalls coming up from the basement stairs the heavy steps the dull clink of metal lis atcheson understood immediately and the mood of the night at once turned icy owen walked into the doorway of the greenhouse and looked at his wife who was pulling more burlap bags from the stack near the lath house oh no lis whispered she shook her head and then sat on a bench made of hard cherry wood owen paused then sat beside her smoothing her hair over her ear the way he did when he explained things to herbusiness things estate things legal things but no explanation was necessary tonight for owen was no longer in his work clothes he wore a darkgreen shirt and matching baggy pantsthe outfit he wore under a brightorange slicker when he went hunting on his feet were his expensive waterproof boots and in his hands a deer rifle and a pistol you cant do it owen he set the guns aside i just talked to the sheriff again theyve got four men out after him only four goddamn men and hes already in watertown but thats east of here hes going away from us that doesnt matter lis look how far hes traveled thats seven or eight miles from where he escaped on foot hes not wandering around in a daze at all hes up to something i dont want you to do this im just going to see exactly what theyre doing to catch him he spoke in an austere assured voice it was her fathers voice it was a voice that could hypnotize her still she said dont lie to me owen and like andrew lauberget owens eyes contracted hard as a ticks back he had a faint smile on his face but she didnt believe it for a second she might very well have been speaking to one of the marbleeyed trophies owen had nailed up on his den wall for all the effect her words had on him she touched his arm and let her fingers linger on the thick cloth he pressed his hand over hers dont go she said she pulled him to her she felt a surge of unfocused ardor it was more than the memory of their liaison earlier his strength his gravity the hunger in his facethey were all immensely seductive she kissed him hard openmouthed she wondered if the arousal she felt was truly lust or was rather an attempt to keep him encircled in her arms all this long night until the danger was past whatever her motives might have been though the embrace had no effect he held her for a moment then stepped to the window she rose and stood behind him why dont you say it youre going to hunt him down she studied her husbands back and the reflection of a face that should she supposed be vastly troubled yet he seemed very much at peace with himself im not going to do anything illegal oh what do you call murder murder he whispered harshly spinning around and nodding toward the upstairs of the house dont you ever think about what youre saying what if she heard you portia isnt going to turn you in thats not the point the point is you cant just track somebody down and you forget what happened at indian leap he snapped i sometimes think i was more upset by it than you were she turned away as if slapped lis he calmed quickly wincing at his own outburst im sorry i didnt mean that look hes not a human being hes an animal you know what hes capable of you more than anybody he continued his argument smoothly he escaped this time he could escape again he got away long enough to mail that letter to you when he was in gloucester next time hes there maybe hell wander off and head this way theyll catch him tonight theyll put him in jail this time if hes still mentally incompetent he goes right back into the hospital thats the law lis look at the newscasts theyre emptying the hospitals you hear about it every day maybe next year the year after theyll just turn him out on the street and wed never know when he might show up here in the yard in the bedroom then the first tears started and she knew that shed lost the argument she had probably known it when she first heard his steps on the basement stairs owen was not always right she reflected but he was perpetually confident it seemed wholly natural for him to load up the x with guns and cruise off into the middle of a stormy night to hunt down a psychopath i want you and portia to go to the inn weve done enough sandbagging she was shaking her head im insisting no owen the waters already up two feet and it hasnt even started to rain here the part by the dock where the creek flows in we need another foot or two there i finished that part i added plenty of bags its three feet high if the crests higher than that theres nothing we could do anyway she spoke coldly fine go if you want go play soldier but im staying i still have to tape the greenhouse forget the greenhouse were insured against wind damage i dont care about the money for heavens sake those roses are my life id never forgive myself if anything happened to them she sat again on the bench lis had noticed that she commanded less authority standing beside her husband with him a foot taller seated though much lower she paradoxically felt more his equal nothings going to happen a few broken windows you heard the report eightymileanhour winds owen sat beside her and gripped her thigh pressing hard his elbow was against her breast instead of comfort she felt vulnerability her defenses breached by his proximity im not going to argue this he said evenly i dont want to have to worry about you i want you to go to the inn once they get him once you get him you mean once they get him ill call you you two come back to the house and well finish the work together owen hes going the other way his eyes flashed are you trying to deny it lis hes run seven miles in fortyfive minutes hes up to something think about it whyre you being so damn stubborn theres a killer out there a psychotic killer he knows your name and address lis said nothing she breathed shallowly owen pressed his face against her hair he whispered dont you remember him dont you remember the trial lis happened to glance up and see on the wall a stone bust of a leering gargoyle she heard in her memory hrubek chanting lisbone lisbone my eve of betrayal my pretty lisbone a cheerful voice filled the room little late for fishing isnt it owen portia stood in the doorway eyeing his outfit the party breaking up owen stepped away from his wife but he kept his eyes on her ill pack a few things lis said going somewhere her sister asked the inn owen said so soon i thought that was later on the program when the crazy man showed up to boogie oops sorry was that in bad taste hes traveled farther than they thought im going to talk to the sheriff about what theyre doing to find him lis and youre going to a bedandbreakfast up the road god hes not coming this way portia asked no hes going east lis looked at her sister itll just be better to spend the night at the inn okay by me portia shrugged and went to collect her backpack lis rose owen squeezed her leg what she wondered does that mean thanks i won i love you hand me my guns woman i wont be long a few hours tops come lock the door after me they walked into the kitchen and he kissed her for a long moment but she could see that his mind was already in the fields and on the roads where his prey wandered he pocketed the pistol and slung his deer rifle over his shoulder he then walked outside lis doublelocked the door behind him watching him climb into the truck she stepped to the window and looked down at the garage the black cherokee backed out and paused for a moment the interior of the truck was dark and she wondered if he was waving to her she lifted her own hand he pulled into the driveway of course owen was right he knew more about hrubek than all of the pros didthe troopers the sheriffs the doctors and whats more lis knew too she knew hrubek wasnt harmless that he wasnt wandering around like a dim animal that he had something on his mind damaged though it was she knew these things not as facts but as messages from her heart her cheek pressed against the window for a moment she backed away and gazed at the uneven bubbleflecked glass realizing something shed never thought ofthat these panes had been made two and a half centuries ago how lis wondered had the fragile glass survived intact all those turbulent years when she focused again on the yard the trucks taillights were gone yet she continued for a long time to gaze at the shadowy driveway down which the truck had vanished here i am she thought in disbelief a pioneer wife staring into the wilderness after my husband whos traveling through the night on his way to kill the man who would kill me the lingering dust raised by the vehicles settled and their taillights vanished behind a hill far to the east the night was still again overhead the clouds that swept in from the west obscured a sallow moon which sat over a rock outcropping above the deserted highway there was as yet no hint of storm no breeze at all and for a moment this portion of highway was absolutely silent then michael hrubek pulling his precious irish cap down over his head pushed aside the grass and walked directly into the middle of route he replaced his pistol in the backpack get to these words swam into his mind and floated there for a moment doing slow looptheloops he knew they were vitally important but their meaning kept evading him they vanished and he was left with a prickling reminder of their absence what do they mean he wondered what was he supposed to do with them he stood on the asphalt and walked in a circle searching through his confused mind for the answer what did get to mean filled with a churning dread he knew that they were jamming his thoughts they the soldiers whod just been pursuing him lets think about this get to what could it possibly mean hrubek again looked east down the highway the direction in which the soldiers had disappeared conspirators with their dogs on ropes sniffing and growling fuckers one man in gray one man in blue one confederate soldier and one union the man with the limp he was the one hrubek hated the most that man was a conspirator a fucking union soldier get to getto slowly the hatred began to fade as he thought about how hed fooled them hed been only thirty feet away from the soldiers holding his cocked gun crouching down in a bowl of dirt high on a ledge of rock above them theyd eased into the grass and found the bag hed carefully placed there shivering with fear hed heard their alien voices heard the wet snorting of the dogs the rustle of grass hrubek saw the letters again geto they floated past then vanished hrubek recalled the colored lights on the police car starting to spin a moment later the soldiers returned to the cars and the one who hated him most the lean fucker in blue the one with the limp got into the truck with his dog they sped off east hrubek crouched down and put his cheek against the damp road then he stood up good night ladies it was coming back to him geto he squinted down the highway westward he was seeing not the black strip of asphalt but rather the letters which slowly stopped swirling and began to line up for him like good little soldier boys geto hrubeks mind was filling with thoughts complicated thoughts wonderful thoughts he started walking im gonna see you cry geton there there it was he began trotting toward it the letters were all falling into place geton m the dogs were gone the conspirators too the fucker with the limp dr richard the hospital the orderlies all of his enemies were behind him hed fooled them all michael hrubek searched his soul and found that his fear was under control and that his mission was as lucid as a perfect diamond he paused and set one of the tiny animal skulls in a nest of grass at the base of the post muttering a short prayer he then walked past the green sign that said ridgeton miles turned off the road into the cover of brush and began to hurry due west indian leap on her parted lips he rubs the petal of a yellow rose his eyes are fixed on hers two feet away close enough for him to penetrate the orbit of her perfume not so close each feels the heat radiating from the others body in this chill room she reaches out for him but he motions curtly for her to stop her hands acquiesce but then rebelliously reach slowly to her own shoulders and dislodge the satin straps of her nightgown they fall away and the creamcolored garment drops to her waist his eyes stray to her breasts but he does not touch her and as he again commands she lowers her hands to her sides from the greenandrusset tangle of a rosebush the reigning plant in the darkened greenhouse he lifts away two more petals these pink he holds them in his large confident fingers and lifts them to her eyes which she closes slowly she feels the petal skin brush over her lids and continue down her cheek again he makes a circuit of her mouth both petals coursing slowly over her halfopen lips she wets these lips and tells him playfully that hes destroying one of her prize flowers but he again shakes his head insisting on silence she leans toward him and nearly succeeds in planting a contracted nipple against his forearm but he sways back and their bodies dont touch a petal caresses her chin then slips from his fingers spiraling to the slate greenhouse path on which they stand he snatches another from the shivering bush still her eyes are closed her hands are at her sides as he has insisted now he brushes her earlobes so gently she doesnt at first feel the touch of the flowers skin he presses the valleys behind her ears and caresses the soft wisps of whitegold hair now her shoulders muscled from carrying tubs of earth like that out of which these rosebushes grow now her throat her head tilts back and if she opened her eyes shed see a cluster of pale stars awash in the speckled glass now he weakens and kisses her quickly the petals disappearing from his spreading fingers which grip her neck and pull her to him her breath matching her desire rushes inside her pulling with it his own she moves her head in a slow circle to increase the pressure of his touch but hes too fast for her and he dodges away he stands back again dropping the crushed petals and tugging more from the thorny stem beside them her eyes still are closed and the anticipation grows unbearable as she awaits the next touch which occurs on the lower part of her modest breasts and she sets her teeth as her lips spread in what could be taken for a snarl but is rather evidence of will the roses move slowly along the arcs of her breasts and she feels too the drag of several of his fingers a much rougher feel yet equally provocative soft and rough fingernails petal flesh the heat of his touch the cold of the greenhouse floor on her bare feet she feels pressure as slight as a breath shes astonished that such a large man is capable of such subtle motion he kisses her again and the sensations from his lips and fingers fire through her but he wont hurry the pressure fades and vanishes and she opens her eyes with a plea for him not to stop he again closes her eyes and she obeys listening to a curious ripping sound then silence as her neck and breasts are covered by two huge handsful of petals which fall away from his hands and trickle to their feet he kisses each of her eyes and she takes this as the sign that he wants her to open them they gaze at each other for a moment and she sees that no not all the petals have fallen one remains he holds it between them a brightred oval from a john armstrong plant he opens his mouth and places it on his tongue like a priest dispensing host she desperately works the nightgown over her hips and reaches for him enveloping him in her arms sliding her hands into the small of his back he leans forward their tongues connect and as she pulls him down on top of her they transfer the red petal back and forth until it disintegrates and they swallow the fragments as they swallow each other lis atcheson remained lost for a moment in this memory then opened her eyes and gazed out over the flowers in the greenhouse listening to the pleasant hiss of spray from the watering system oh owen she whispered owen she set down her packed suitcase and strolled through the damp fragrant room then out the lathhouse door to the flagstone patio she looked out over the lake the black water lapped persistently troubled she noticed that the level of the lake had risen another several inches in the last twenty minutes she glanced to her left toward a lowlying portion of the propertythe dip in the yard behind the garage where owen had stacked the extra bags a creek trickled into the lake there and the marshy shoreline was obscured with rushes she couldnt see how well the barrier was holding but she didnt particularly want to walk down the narrow slippery path to find out owen was a meticulousoften fanaticworker and she guessed that hed built a solid levee her own engineering efforts in the center of the yard looked shoddy the water was almost up to the level of the bags shed dozed upon after she and owen had made love it was only eighteen inches beneath the top row she walked closer to the lake above her no stars she couldnt even discern the underside of the clouds the sky was flat and smooth a grayblue monotone like the flesh of a shark were the clouds moving or not were they a hundred feet in the air or ten thousand she couldnt tell vague motion nearby startled her the shell of the large tortoise jerked again as the ungainly creature lumbered toward the lake fiercely intent on its goal the animal scuttled over rocks and roots too high for its reptilian feet slipping often why the urgency lis wondered was some eerie premonition about the storm prompting the thing to seek the safety of the lake but what would a tortoise have to fear from the rain with a loud splash the animal caromed off a willow root and sliced into the water there it became a perfect airfoil and cruised eloquently just beneath the surface for a short distance then dove out of sight lis watched its wake vanish and the water turn once again to rippling black silk she strolled back toward the house through wide trelliscovered patches of overturned dirther formal garden she paused before the one rosebush that still retained a number of petals when she was young lis had plotted to dye her hair the copper color of a plant this shadean arizona grandifloraand paid for it with a whipping when her father in one of his saturdaymorning raids on the girls room discovered the clairol hidden beneath her mattress she clicked a brittle thorn with her nail then lifted away a few dead petals she rubbed them against her cheek the horizon in the west flared brilliantly with a broad graygreen flash it had vanished by the time her eyes flicked to that portion of the sky the petals fell from liss hands she heard the kitchen door opening then closing im ready portia called you have your suitcase lis walked to the house gazing at the yellow windows she said listen i have to tell youive changed my mind you what lis set her suitcase inside the kitchen door im going to finish the sandbagging taping the greenhouse it could take an hour or so id really like you to stay too but if you want to leave i understand ill call you a cab emil was sorely tempted by the aroma of grilling burgers and onions but he knew his job and kept his butt planted on the ground trenton heck himself cast a longing eye toward the truckstop diner but at the moment the reward money was his main thought and he too ignored the smell of a muchdesired cheeseburger he continued his discussion with the highway patrol trooper and he really seemed set on boston did he heck asked thats what the driver said he was babbling about it being the home of our country or something fennel drawing nearby said he was a history major heck looked up in surprise yup thats what i heard he went to college this made trenton heck with only eleven hours of credits toward an associate degree feel very bad one year only before he started to go wacko but he got himself some as well as damn heck pushed aside his personal chagrin and asked the hp trooper if hed have the truck driver step outside for a minute uhm hes gone hes gone didnt you tell him to wait the trooper shrugged looking placidly into the civilians eyes its an escape situation not an arrest situation i got his name and address figured he didnt need to stay around to be a witness or anything heck muttered to fennel address isnt going to be real helpful i mean whatre we supposed to do send him a postcard the trooper said i asked him a bunch of stuff heck slipped the harness off emil the trooper looked even younger than the boy and would have no seniority over anybody the highway patrol had a separate budget for salaries and they hardly ever fired anybody heckd had the chance to put in for highway patrol when he first joined but no he wanted to fight real crime what was he wearing overalls boots work shirt tweed cap no jacket didnt seem to be was he drinking well the driver didnt say i didnt exactly ask that didnt see any need to heck continued was he carrying anything bag or weapon walking stick the trooper looked uneasily at his notes then at fennel who nodded for him to answer the questions i dont exactly know was he threatening no just kind of goofy the driver said heck grunted in frustration then he asked oh one more thing just how big is he the driver said about six five six six three fifty if hes a pound wwf wrestler you know legs like a side of beef side of beef heck gazed into the blackness in the east fennel asked him is there enough trail to follow its not bad but i wish itd rain nothing brought out a latent scent better than a gentle mist to hear the weatherman tell it youre going to get that wish in spades heck hooked up emil again and refreshed the scent memories of the dogs with hrubeks shorts find find emil took off down the shoulder of the road heck paying out the darkred rope until he felt the twentyfoot knot then he followed fennel and the retrievers too but they hadnt gone fifty feet before emil turned and nosed slowly toward an unlit dilapidated house squatting in an overgrown yard a spookylooking place with a sagging roof and shingles like old snake scales in the window was a sign hunting goods etc deer dressed and mounted pelts bought and sold trout too think hes in there the boy uncomfortably eyed the black windows hard to say all that animal workd confuse even emil heck and fennel led the dogs to a cockeyed fence post and tied them up the men drew their sidearms and simultaneously chambered bullets and put the safeties on heck thought dont let me get shot again oh please i got no insurance this time though what was behind this prayer wasnt hospital bills of course but the horror of a scalding bullet trent you dont have to do this from the sound of this guy you need everybody youve got conceding fennel nodded then motioned the boy around back he and heck walked onto the front porch quietly heck looked at fennel who shrugged and knocked on the door there was no answer heck leaned forward and looked through a grimy window he leapt back suddenly jesus oh his voice clicked into a high register fennel drew down on the window with his glock he squinted then laughed six inches away through the muddy glass was the rearing form of a black bear staring out at them taxidermied into ferocity goddamn heck said reverently son of a bitch i nearly dampened my pants there fennel pointed to a sign propped in another window closed first two weeks of november happy huntin hes telling everybody hes going away dont this fellow know about burglaries hes got himself a watchbear heck studied the creature with admiration thatd be the first thing id steal then they found the door that hrubek had kicked in the men entered cautiously covering each other they found the traces of the madmans shopping spree but it was clear he was no longer here they reholstered their guns and returned outside fennel told the boy to call haversham and tell him where they were and that hrubek did in fact seem to be making for boston they were about to continue up the highway when the boy called hold up a minute charlie theres something here you ought to see heck and fennel ordered the dogs to sit and then walked around to the back of the building to where the young man was standing hand on his own pistol look there he was pointing inside a work shed there was blood on the ground just inside the doorway jesus out came the walther again the safety clicked off heck eased into the shed the place was chockablock with a thousand odds and ends hoses boxes animal skulls bones broken furniture rusted tools auto parts check it out over there we got a coon bit the big one fennel shone his light on the limp corpse of a raccoon think hed do that why goddamn heck whispered in dismay he was looking not at the body of the animal however but at a narrow beam in the ceiling from which dangled some spring animal traps toothless but bigthe sort that would easily snap the neck of a fox or badger or raccoon or the leg of a dog the reason for hecks dismay wasnt the traps themselves but rather the three empty pegs where presumably three other traps had hung until not long ago several large bloody bootprints were directly below the pegs heck asked your girls heel not when theyre on track emil hes slow to if the scents fresh well have to tie the lines back and keep em next to us hell if he takes to the grass well just about have to crawl on our bellies hrubekll be in boston by the time we get to the county line they walked back to the highway and shortened the lines as heck instructed he left his pickup at the truck stop with the third deputy who remained there in case hrubek wandered back this way the boy accompanied heck and fennel in his squad car the headlights dark just the amber flashers on the dogs caught a whiff of the scent and started east once more down the middle of the friggin road fennel laughed nervously this boy is nuts thats for damn sure but heck didnt respond the giddy excitement of earlier in the evening was gone the night had turned coarse their quarry was no longer a big silly fellow and trenton heck felt the same chill he remembered when four years ago outside of a neonlit eleven hed glanced at what he thought was a branch moving in the breeze and saw instead a sphere of muzzle flash and felt a ripping jolt in his leg as the asphalt leapt up to meet his forehead you think hed set traps for dogs fennel muttered nobodyd do that nobodyd hurt a dog heck reached down and held up his hounds right ear in which was a smooth hole the exact size of a slug fennel whistled out his disgust at humankind and trenton heck called find emil find lis stood in the greenhouse taping bold xs over the glass that she could remember being glazed into place twentyfive years ago her mother standing in the construction site arms crossed her austere eye on the contractors often she frowned because she believed that people wouldnt cheat you if it was obvious that you suspected they were capable of it taping windows as she went lis moved slowly around the large room which was filled with hybrid tea roses in all shades and grandiflora blushes dotted with the bloodred john armstrongs and high noon yellow climbers twining around an antique trellis she had largecluster floribunda iceberg whites and fashion corals a thousand flowers ten thousand petals she preferred the striking shades the stark colors especially in the most fragile of flowers recalling the thousands of hours shed spent hereas a girl helping her mother then more recently by herselfshe pictured the many times shed cut back shoots pruned flowered laterals and snipped away unvigorous stems her hands thornpricked and red would scoop a dormant eye from the budding and peel the bark to make a shield then slide it into the tcut rootstock binding the incision with raffia glancing at several recent grafts she heard a sound behind her and turned to see portia rummaging through a box on the floor she was no longer wearing her manhattan outfit but had finally acknowledged that she was in l l bean country and accepted liss offer of jeans sweater and topsiders lis was overcome with an urge to thank her again for staying but the girl wasnt interested in gratitude she seized several rolls of masking tape and disappeared saying too fucking many windows in this house her footsteps pounded up the stairs a teenager sprinting to take a phone call lis was suddenly aware of the greenhouses overhead lights one bank of which owen had turned on when he was looking for burlap bags she now doused them lis respected the daily cycle of plantsin the same way that she herself never woke to an alarm if she could avoid it the rhythm of our bodies she believed is linked to our souls pulse plants are no different and in deference to them lis had installed in addition to fivehundrednanometer artificialsunlight lamps for overcast days a series of dim blue and green bulbs for nighttime hours these lights let her flowers sleepfor she believed plants did sleepwhile illuminating the greenhouse this was what horticulturists call a warm greenhouse ruth lauberget had scattered archaic heaters around the room but they never worked well it seemed as if the woman was daunted by technology and had been content to let nature and fate decide whether her roses prospered or died that wasnt good enough for her daughter this was after all lis reasoned the computer age and she had the place outfitted with a microprocessor climatecontrol system that kept the temperature above sixtytwo degrees even on the coldest of nights and operated the automated vents along the roof s peak and roller shades on the southfacing panes sunlight being as potentially dangerous as frost on one side of the thirtyfivebytwentyfoot room were the cuttings rooted in sand and the seedlings on the other were the growing plats for mature bushes and propagation benches soilwarming cables snaked under the cutting area and hoses trickleirrigation pipelines and capillary sand benches provided the water the connected potting area and lath house were floored in concrete the greenhouse floor itself was gravel through which wound a serpentine path of slatealso selected by lis to replace the original concrete the slate was deep greenblue and had been picked by lis as a reminder of a rose yet to be the lauberget hybrid this was an ambition of hersto develop a luminescent tealcolored rose an allamerican rose selections designation in her name the crossbreeding of this flower had a particular appeal because shed been told it was impossible fellow rosarians assured her that the elusive color couldnt be bred whats more she was bucking the trend the current strategy among growers was to cultivate for fragrance and disease resistance but color and form now traits in disrepute were what excited lis atcheson logically she appreciated the difficulty of the crossbreed but the irony is that by nature rose lovers have deep romantic streaks and arent easily discouraged so working with a number of yellow varieties and pinks and the blue moon hybrid tea lis spent hours here grafting and budding as if it were merely a matter of time until she found the evasive color from literature lis had learned the transcendence of the imagination which shed come to believe was gods main prize to us all things else even love being more or less honorable mentions but from flowers she learned a better lessonthe persistence of beauty petals bursting growing falling and curling into dry colorful flakes roses were more than animate to her they were virtually human think about it shed tell students of hers invited to the greenhouse for informal saturdayafternoon horticultural lectures the history of roses they migrated west to europe and america mostly from the orient their culture they grow in increasingly sophisticated social clusters and how about religion rosesve had as bad a time on that subject as we have they were burned by early christians because of paganexcuse the expressionroots and then what happened the pope converted them now ask a catholic what roses representmary of course thats the mother by the way not the prostitute liss love of flowers began when she was around nine skinny and tall the girl would herd portia into the huge backyard where their mothers helper presided the imported au pair would send the girls on missions to find wildflowers of certain colors after of course delivering the litany of warnings the lake snakes hornets bees abandoned wells strangers men with candy on and on the caveats were the product of andrew lauberget no chubby carefree dutch girl could possibly find the world so threatening the speech delivered paranoia invoked jolande would then dole out the assignments leesbonne a golden flur breeng me a gold flur off the children would go leesbonne now a red one a red flur be careful of that how you call it beehive poortia a red one the girls would charge off into the woods and return with the blossoms the daughters would then ask the big girl to trim and wash the bouquet and the trio would deliver the works of art to ruth lauberget who would nod with approval and thank the girls she would then tie the blossoms into bright arrangements for the rectory office where she spent her afternoons this combination of aesthetics and generosity was irresistible to lis and she would sit at the dinner table too timid to speak but praying that mother would report to father about the flowersor that talkative portia would blurt the story to him impatient with religion andrew lauberget only managed to tolerate his wifes involvement in st johns it was the liquor merchant was fast to joke her only vice still he usually dispensed some backhanded praise ah very good good for you lisbonne and portia too you were careful of thorns and wasps his face was stern but lis believed she heard pleasure in his voice yes father and dont run through tall grass has our jolande been careful with you broken legs can turn gangrenous very easily then off they come zip how about the reverend dalcott he going to snatch you up in a bag and turn you into little episcopalians andrew no daddy he has yellow teeth and his shirt smells funny portia if he was in a good mood father might recite some robert burns or john donne o my loves like a red red rose lis harbored a secret belief that the bouquets shed delivered to her mother had inspired her to build the greenhouse and to start tending roses all year round flowers were what lis thought about too when her fathers mood grew dark and the inevitable willow whip descended on her exposed buttocks the image of an orange hybrid seemed somehow to anesthetize much of the pain through the mottled windows she now gazed toward the very treea black willowthat had sacrificed hundreds of young shoots so that two daughters might grow into proper women she could see only a vague form like an image in a dream it seemed to be just a lighter version of the darkness that filled the yard tonight lis squinted and gazed past the tree it was then that she saw a curious shape in the water what is that she wondered walking outside she looked againat a portion of the shoreline a hundred yards from the house it was a configuration of shapes shed never noticed then she understoodthe water had risen so far that it was ganging near the top of the old dam what she was looking at was a white rowboat that had slipped its moorings and floated to the concrete rim half the rocky beach beside the dam was obscured in thirty years the water had never been this high the dam the thought struck lis like a slap shed forgotten completely about the dam it was of course the lowest spot on the property if the lake overflowed the water would fill the low culvert behind it and flood the yard suddenly from her youth she recalled a sluice gate in the dam operated by a large wheel opening this gate diverted the water to a creek that flowed into the marsden river a mile or so downstream she recalled her fathers opening the gate once many years ago after a sudden spring thaw was it still there and if so did it still work lis walked closer to the house and called portia a secondfloor window opened im going to the dam the young woman nodded and looked up at the sky i just heard a bulletin theyre calling it the storm of the decade lis nearly joked that shed picked a fine night for a visit but thought better of it portia eased the window shut and continued her methodical taping lis walked cautiously into the culvert that led to the dam and plunging into darkness picked her way along the rocky creek bed the two labs suddenly jerked into a frenzy the trackers simultaneously drew their guns heck thumbcocking his the men exhaled long as the animala raccoon fat on village garbagejogged away from them the concentric rings of its tail vanishing into underbrush the indignant animal reminded heck of jills father who was a smalltown mayor heck lowering the prominent hammer of his old german pistol downed emil and waited while charlie fennel futilely scolded the labs and then refreshed their memory with hrubeks shorts as he waited heck gazed around him at the seemingly endless fields theyd come five miles from the shack where hrubek had stolen the traps and the dogs were still scenting on the asphalt heck had never pursued an escapee who stuck so persistently to the road what seemed like bloodsure stupidity now looked pretty smart by doing just the opposite of what everybody expected hrubek was making damn good time heck had a vague thought which lasted merely a second or two that somehow they were making a very bad mistake about this fellow this impression was punctuated by a shiver that dropped from his neck to his tailbone charlie fennels dogs were soon back on the trail and the men hurried along the deserted strip of highway under a sky black as a hole to stem his own uneasiness heck leaned over and said know whats coming up this week fennel grunted st hubert s day and were going to be celebrating it fennel hawked and spit in a long arc then said whos we emil and me st hubert s day hes the patron saint of hunters st hubert houndsthats what he bred who st hubert this is what im telling you he was a monk or something he bred the dogs that eventually became bloodhounds heck nodded at emil that boy goes farther back than i do part of st hubert s day is a blessing of the hounds arent you irish charlie how come you dont know this stuff familys from londonderry youve got those labs there we ought to get a priest to bless our dogs what do you think about that charlie how bout over at st marys think that priestd do that for us fennel didnt answer and heck continued you know bloodhounds go back to mesopotamia where the hells that iraq now that fennel said was a stupid little war i think we shouldve kept going tromp tromp tromp all the way to baghdad ill second that then fennel laughed heck grinning asked whats so funny youre a crazy man after a crazy man trenton say what you will i think im going to find me a priest and get emil blessed after this is over if he catches the guy no i think ill just do it anyway the road down which they now pursued hrubek was a dark country highway which threaded through a string of small towns and unincorporated portions of the county if hrubek had boston in mind he was taking the long route but heck concluded it was also the smarter way to travel along these roads thered be hardly any local police and the houses and traffic would be sparse they followed the dogs still shortlined because of the traps only three miles east before hrubek broke away and turned north onto a small dirt lane a hundred feet away they found a filthy roadside diner which looked bleaker yet because of the sloppily taped xs on the windows thinking that hrubek might be inside fennel sent the boy around back and he and heck snuck up to the windows of the streamlined aluminumsided restaurant cautiously they lifted their heads and found themselves gazing straight into the eyes of the cook waitress and two diners who forewarned by the baying labradors were staring out the windows heck and fennel feeling somewhat foolish stepped through the door bolstering their guns a posse the waitress exclaimed drops of viscous gravy falling from the tilting plate she held but no nobody here had seen hrubek even though to judge by emils scenting hed passed within feet of the window without an explanation or a farewell the men and the dogs vanished as quickly as theyd come emil picked up the scent once more and led them northeast along the dirt road not two hundred yards from the diner they found the spot where hrubek had taken to the fields hold up heck whispered they stood beside a small grassfilled pathan access road for mowing tractors the drive darkened as it passed through a dense stand of trees fennel and heck tied back the track lines until they were shorter than petstore leads they found however that they didnt need the animals any longer not more than fifty yards into the woods they heard hrubek fennel gripped hecks arm and they stopped short the boy dropped to a crouch they heard a mad moaning rising from the trees heck was so excited to have found hrubek that he forgot he was a civilian he began communicating to fennel and the boy with the hand signals law enforcers use when they silently close in on their quarry up went his finger to his lips and he pointed toward the source of the sound then motioned fennel and the boy forward heck bent low to emil and whispered sit then down the dog eased to the ground obedient but irritated that the game was over for him heck loosetied him to a branch ill take over from here you want fennel whispered in a casual way but with enough timber to remind heck who was in charge heck was of course willing to yield the role of commander which was never his in the first place but no way was he going to miss the hogtying party he didnt want any argument about the reward money he nodded toward fennel and unholstered his walther the boy who with his fiery eyes and a big automatic in his fingers didnt look so boyish anymore circled around to the side north of the trees as fennel had indicated heck and fennel went up the middle of the road they moved very slowly they couldnt use their flashlights and the grove was darkly shadowed by the hemlocks whose branches were dense and lay upon one another like ragged petticoats the moaning grew louder to a man it chilled their hearts when heck saw the trucka long semi parked cockeyed in the shadowshe felt a burst of queasiness thinking that the moaning was not hrubek at all but the driver whom the madman had attacked and gutted perhaps he was listening to a sucking chest wound he and fennel glanced at each other exchanging this identical thought in silence and continued their cautious approach then heck saw him an indistinct shape not far away michael hrubek so thick around the middle he seemed deformed moaning like a mooncrazed dog he lay on the ground trying to get up perhaps hed fallen and hurt himself or had been hit by the massive truck maybe hed heard the labs and was feigning injury waiting for his pursuers to get close opposite heck and fennel on the other side of the clearing the boy appeared in a crouch fennel held up three fingers the young trooper responded by mimicking it then fennel clicked the safety off his gun and lifted his hand above his head one finger two fingers three the men jumped into the clearing three dark pistols pointed forward three long flashlights pumping their dazzling halogen light onto the massive body of their quarry freeze all right dont you move for the love of mary trenton heck thought his legs weakening in shock whats happening here the madman lying on the ground in front of the three lawmen was shrieking like a bluejay he suddenly split clean in two half of him leaping into the air white as death what is going on here heck trained the flashlight on the part of the madman that remained on the groundthe part that was now grasping about for something to pull over her ample breasts shit son of a bitch the mans upper half shouted in an edgy tenor what the hell you think youre doing the boy started laughing first then fennel joined in and if heck hadnt been so upset at losing his reward money hed have laughed too the sight of the skinny man searching desperately for his shorts the long condom whipping back and forth as it dangled from his quickly shrunk member well it was the funniest thing heck had seen for a month of sundays dont hurt me the woman wailed son of a bitch the skinny man growled once more hecks humor returned and he whistled the dueling banjos tune from deliverance in a kentuckymountain voice charlie fennel said naw i want him hes a purty one soooeee heck called here piggy piggy piggy the woman wailed again oh shit the young man fumbled with his pants calm down now fennel shone the light on his badge were state troopers that wasnt funny i dont care who yall are she wanted to do it she picked me up at that diner up the road it was her idea the woman had calmed in proportion to the amount of clothing shed pulled on my idea ill thank you not to make me sound cheap i didnt want thats your alls business fennel said but its our business youve had a hitchhiker on the back of your rig for the past ten miles an escapee heck too understood that this is what had happened and he was angry at himself for not thinking of it sooner hrubek had clung to the back bumper guard or loading platform of the truck that was why the scent had been so weak and why it had never wavered from the road jesus that fellow at the truck stop in watertown the big guy oh my everloving lord youre that truck driver heck asked he asked you about going to boston shitabrick maybe hes still on the rig but the boy had already circled around and checked out the trucks roof and undercarriage hes not here nope and the backs padlocked he mustve took off into the fields when the truck stopped oh jesus the driver whispered reverently hes a killer aint he oh jesus jesus the woman had started crying again this is the last time i swear never again fennel asked how long the driver had been there fifteen minutes id guess you love bunnies hear anything nothing not a single thing the driver said eager to please i didnt hear anything either the woman replied sniffling and i dont like your you know attitude uhn fennel responded then said to the young man who was buttoning up his shirt now i suggest you get back in that rig and take this lady home and get on your way take her home forget about it you prick she snapped you damn well better i think you ought to do that son heck said okay if she dont live too far from here ive got a load of auto parts i got to get to bangor by you prick fennel had checked the bushes around the semi no sign of him he called well with the sound these two were making heck said chuckling id run too well lets get on with it he cant be more than a half mile from here we should the boy said uh trenton i think theres a problem heck looked up to see the young trooper pointing at a small sign that in their silent approach theyd passed but not noticed its back was to heck and fennel they strode to it turned and read welcome to massachusetts heck looked at the scripty green letters and wondered why anybodyd waste a nicely painted sign here on this dim country road home of madmen horny truck drivers and loose waitresses he sighed and looked at fennel sorry trenton come on charlie we got no jurisdiction here why he isnt but a half mile away he could be two hundred yards from us right now hell he could be watching us from one of those trees over there the laws the law trenton we need to get the mass troopers in i say lets just go get him we cant cross the state line hot pursuit heck said wont work he aint a felon adler said that hrubek didnt kill that fellow was in the body bag it was a suicide come on charlie if he aint so crazyand it looks like maybe he aintand we nab him in massachusetts he might sue us for assault or kidnapping and he could damn well win not if we get our stories straight lie youre saying heck didnt speak for a moment all we do is we find him and bring him back thatd be that trenton did you ever falsify a case report no you ever perjure yourself on the stand you know i never did well youre not wearing a badge now and i know you feel different about those of us who are but the fact is we just cant stroll over state lines rising through hecks prominent anger now was a sudden understandingthat the interest charlie fennel and the young trooper had in the search was this to do their job oh theyd give the pursuit of michael hrubek percent and theyd bust their balls and put in all sorts of godawful overtime and even risk their life but for that one purpose only to do their job leaving the jurisdiction wasnt their job im sorry trenton didnt any of us notify the mass troopers before heck said itll take em a half hour to get the first cars here maybe more if he hops another ride hell be long long gone by then then thats whatll happen fennel said thats the way it is i know what the money means to you heck stood with his hands on his narrow hips looking at the sign for a few moments then he nodded slowly lets dont have words over it you gotta do what you thinks right charlie im pretty sorry about this trenton okay no hard feelings he walked back to emil if you twoll excuse us no trenton fennel said in a firm monotone heck ignored fennel and continued walking to where emil was loosetied to a forsythia whip trenton what hecks voice bristled as he turned i cant let you go by yourself either dont ride me charlie just dont do it by yourself youre a civilian you couldnt argue hot pursuit even if he was a felon you cross that line its kidnapping for sure you could get yourself into a real fix and what if he kills somebody else youre happy just to let him go there are rules for how this works and im going to stick to em and im going to see that you do too youre saying youd stop me heck spat out use that gun use that fancy departmental glock of yours fennel was clearly stung by this but he received no apology from heck whose fists were balled at his side as if spoiling for a schoolyard fight dont be stupid trenton fennel said kindly think about it that dr adlers a peckerhead to start with you think hes going to pay you a penny of reward you snag his boy out of state you know hell cheat you if he can and what if some pansy civilliberties lawyer gets ahold of you for kidnapping some poor retard bang your ass is hung out to dry it wouldnt have hurt so bad heck knew if they hadnt been so closeif hed gotten a notice that hrubek was say in florida or toronto but they were so damn close trenton heck glanced at fennel then gazed across the empty fields which seemed white as if dusted with snow or lime he saw in the vague indiscernible distance the shape of a mans back crouching low as he ran but as hecks eyes squinted the back became a shrub and he understood that he was seeing only what his imagination had created without a word to the two men heck untied his hound and slipped off the harness replacing it with the jangling id collar he said come and returned to the squad car to wait for the others emil trotting along beside they didnt notice him for a full minute so he spent that time looking around the shabby officethe cheap desk the vibrating fluorescent light the carpet of shocking green the books with torn jackets or no jackets at all stacks of recycled manila folders the shoddy walls owen atcheson was himself a homeowner and handy with tools he recognized that the paneling came from a cheap store and was mounted by cheaper labor the carpet was stained and the windows were streaked with grease though owen also observed that the glass in the frames holding the doctors diplomas was shiny as a diamond excuse me the men turned the one in uniformthis would be haversham the captain the good manpivoted on the heels of his short boots the other onewhose office this was a sandyhaired man of about fiftyseemed to have had only two hours of a muchneeded sleep still he had keen eyes which now tersely examined his visitor owen introduced himself then asked youre dr adler i am said the hospital director neither polite nor contrary what can i do for you the trooper whose eyes suggested that he remembered the name surveyed owens clothing i live in ridgeton its west of here about yes ridgeton i know where it is im here about michael hrubek adlers eyes flashed with brief alarm howd you find out that hes wandered away wandered away owen asked wryly who exactly are you the trooper spoke up its your wife thats right adler nodded the woman at the trial that sheriff called about her a while ago some letter hrubek sent the doctor squinted wondering it seemed where owen might fit in the zodiac of the evening you havent caught him yet not quite you really dont have anything to worry about no that was a pretty frightening letter your patient sent my wife well as i think we explainedhis gaze incorporated havershamto your sheriff hrubek is a paranoid schizophrenic what they write is usually meaningless theres nothing for you to wor usually meaningless then not always i see dont you think theres something to it if he threatened my wife at the trial then wrote this letter a few months back and here he goes and escapes adler said its not really your concern mr atcheson and were really quite busy my wifes safety is my concern owen glanced at the doctors left hand its a mans job to look after his wife dont you look after yours he noticed with some pleasure that adler had in this short time grown to dislike him tell me why there are only four men in the search party the hospital directors front teeth danced together briefly with several short taps the men after himre experienced dogtrackers more efficient than a dozen troopers just wandering around in the dark hes in watertown he was he seems to be going north he is going north i should say from outside the sound of hammering boomed owen recalled that entering the hospital grounds hed seen workmen carrying sheets of plywood toward large plateglass windows in what seemed to be a cafeteria have they actually spotted him owen asked curtly and watched the doctors dislike become active hatred but owen was a lawyer he was used to this i dont think so adler said but theyre very close owen believed posture was a mans most important attribute he could have hair or no hair be shaven or stubbled tall or short but if he stood up straight he was respected now at attention he stared down this doctor who may have believed that hrubek was harmless but on the other hand was here late on sunday looking like death itself with an officer of the state police at his side he asked he escaped in stinson dr adler glanced at the far ceiling he nodded impatiently toward haversham who strode to the desk and with a capped bic pen touched a location on the map heres why your wifes got nothing to worry about were tracking him here he touched a spot near the intersection of routes and he escaped the doctors eyes bored into haversham at this choice of word the captain paused then continued he wandered off here just over the stinson line and how did he get to stinson adler plucked a sentence from inventory and responded quickly there was a mixup he took another patients place in a transport van haversham took a moment to detach his gaze from the hospital directors serene face and continued then he eluded two orderlies here in watertown here he asked a driver for a ride to boston oh and he dropped a map of boston while he was running hes on route now boston what kind of lead does he have just a half hour and our people are gaining fast we should have him within twenty minutes now if youll excuse us adler said weve got some work to do owen had the pleasure of staring the troubled man down once more and said to the state trooper i hope youll do my wife and me the courtesy of keeping the ridgeton sheriff informed about whats happening here ill do that sure nodding to the trooper and ignoring adler owen left the office he was walking down the dank murky corridor when the captain stepped into the hall and caught up with him scuse me sir a question the trooper was a big man though owen was bigger and haversham stepped back a pace so that he wasnt looking up into owens eyes at so steep an angle you out doing some camping when you heard about this im sorry the reason i ask is youre dressed like youve been camping or hunting i just threw on some clothes and drove over here all the way from ridgeton its straight down the highway ill confess i didnt obey the posted you mightve called when he received no response the captain continued you armed by any chance owen asked if haversham wanted to see his pistol permit that wont be necessary no what line of work you in im an attorney lawyer huh this seemed to please haversham what sort corporate mostly the doctor back there hes got a pretty low opinion of this hrubek and i suspect you and your wife do too now this fellow may be criminally insane but in the eyes of the law he isnt no dog hes a human being and if somebody was to shoot him down theyd be guilty of murder just the same as theyd shot a minister but i dont need to tell you that being a lawyer and all let me ask you something captain have you ever seen michael hrubek up close you ever faced him i sympathize with you sir but im telling you we find him dead somewhere i personallyll be coming to talk to you even if you get off with manslaughter thatll be the end of your legal practice owen looked back into the calm eyes of the captain who finally said those are just some things to consider duly noted captain good night to you now from the corner of his eye michael hrubekrunning through tall grassnoticed headlights on a service road that paralleled his path along the highway the car was keeping pace with his speed and he believed it was following him the vehicle stopped suddenly made a sharp turn and headed in his direction conspirators he crowed amid the panic that enveloped him like a cloud of hornets he tripped and fell forward onto the shoulder cinders pebbles and bits of glass embedded themselves in his palms and blood appeared he screamed briefly picked himself up and ran forty feet into the forest crashing through a line of low brush then dropping onto the ground a few moments later the green cube of a car drove past slowly and stopped a door slammed and a man climbed out the conspirator walked in a slow circle near the perimeter of the forest hrubek curled up on his side he closed his eyes and prayed that he might fall asleep so that hed grow invisible michael the man called tentatively as if undecided whether to shout or whisper are you there something familiar about the voice michael its me dr richard the stunned patient realized dr richard kohler from marsden or was it careful here something funnys going on michael i want to talk to you can you hear me hrubek opened his eyes and gazed out from between two ferns it looked like dr richard how did those fuckers do it hrubek nervously scooted under a bush his eyes flicked up and down suspiciously as he examined the man studying the doctors thin frame darkblue suit black penny loafers and argyle socks his backpack the color of old blood sure this looked just like dr richard identical hrubek gave the conspirator credit for disguising himself so cleverly smart fucker make no mistake they told me youd run off michael is that you i thought i saw you the footsteps grew closer crushing leaves beneath the dainty feet hrubek pulled his own backpack to his side it was heavy and clinked with the sound of metal and chains he froze at the noise then rummaged inside quietly at the bottom he found the pistol michael i know youre scared i want to help you he aimed the pistol at the shadowy form that approached hed shoot the impostor in the head no thatd be too merciful ill aim for the belly he thought and let him die like a battlefield soldier slowly with a gut wound from a minié ball for i love the bonnie blue boy who gave his life for me the footsteps came closer the beam from a tiny flashlight swept the ground lit a patch of grass two feet from his foot then moved on hrubek held the gun close to his face he smelled oil and metal as he gazed back into the clearing a dreadful thought came into his mind what if this wasnt an impostor maybe this really was dr richard maybe he was a conspirator too maybe hed been a traitor all along from the first fucking day theyd met four months of betrayal ive been looking all over for you i want to give you some medicine itll make you feel better how do you feel better when youre dead hrubek responded silently how does poison make you feel better if i were a bettor id say you were a bad bet you fucker the conspirator was ten feet away hrubeks right hand began to shake as it gripped the gun which was pointed directly at the belly of dr richard the betrayer or john conspirator the impostor im your last chance there are people who want to hurt you well i knew that all along youre telling me something new howd you like to be in the news cnn can do a story about your blownup guts he pulled the hammer back the click was very soft but inexplicably it released in hrubek a flood of fear he began to quiver the gun slipped from his hand and he remained paralyzed for a long moment finally his vision grew blacker than the black forest around him and his mind froze seated like a hot drill bit in oak when he opened his eyes again and was aware of his surroundings some minutes had passed the air felt colder more oppressive heavy with moisture the conspirator was gone his car too hrubek found the gun and lowered the hammer carefully then stowed the weapon in his bag as he rose to his feet dazed and discomfited and started jogging through the night once more hrubek wondered whether the entire incident had been just a dream but he concluded that even if it hadnt been real the apparition was certainly a message from god to remind him that tonight he could trust no one not even those who wereor who pretended to behis closest friends on earth she called it the berlin wall a sixfoothigh stockade fence of gray cedar surrounding most of the four acres of the lauberget estate lis now walked along a stretch of this fence on her way to the dam to enclose the property had cost andrew lauberget eighteen thousand dollars and theyd been dollars no less but despite the price he was adamant about the barricade lis jokingly named it after the german barrier the reference shared only with portia and friends never with her father though the mans concern hadnt been the red peril terrorist kidnappings were his main fear hed become convinced that he as a successful businessman with several european partnerships was targeted goddamn basques he railed goddamn them and they know all about me the sds the black panthers im in whos who in american business there for the whole world to see where i live my childrens names they could read your name lisbonne remember what i told you about answering the door tell me what youd do if you saw a negro walking around outside the gate tell me the fence even lis the naïve child supposed was easily breachable and less a deterrent to the bad guys than an inconvenience to the family who had to walk threequarters of a mile around it if they wanted to go for walks in the woods across cedar swamp road but like the builders of its namesake laubergets purpose seemed only partially to keep the enemy out he also wanted to restrain his own citizenry i will not have the children wandering off theyre girls for gods sake lis had often heard this declaration or variations on it as she walked along tonight lis reflected with some irony that while its german counterpart was now dust andrew laubergets cedar folly was still as strong as ever she noticed too that if the water did overflow the dam the fence would make a perfect sluice preventing any flood from spilling off the property into the woods and directing it straight to the house she now approached the beacha small crescent of dark sand just beyond was the dam an old stoneandcement slab twenty feet high built around the turn of the century it was against this wide lip of cement that the white rowboat shed seen from the house thudded resonantly behind the dam was the narrow spillway fed by the overflow usually dry tonight it gushed like a colorado rapid the water disappearing into the creek that ran beneath the road the dam was part of the lauberget property though it was under the technical control of the state corps of engineers which had been granted an easement to maintain it why werent they here tonight she wondered lis continued a few feet toward the dam then stopped uneasy reluctant to go further watching the white jet of water shoot into the creek her hesitation had nothing to do with the safety of the dam or the ragged spume the only thought on her mind at the moment was the picnic many many years before a rare eventa lauberget family outing that june day had been a mixture of sun and shade hot and cold the family strolled from the house to this beach and hadnt gotten more than ten yards before father started carping at portia calm down quiet down the girl was five even then cheerfully defiant and boisterous lis was horrified that because of the girls rowdiness father would call off the picnic and she bluntly shushed her little sister portia tried to kick lis in retaliation and with a dark glance from her husband mother finally swept up the squirming girl and carried her lis then eleven and her father hefted picnic baskets packed by him so efficiently that she nearly tore muscles under the weight still the girl didnt complain shed endured eight months of her fathers absence while he was in europe on yet another business trip and nothing on earth would stop her from walking at his side she was thrilled speechless when he complimented her on her strength how about here father asked then answered himself yes i think so it seemed to lis that hed developed a minuscule accent in his recent travels portuguese she supposed she observed his dark slacks and white dress shirt buttoned at the neck without tie and short boots this was hardly american fashion in the nineteen sixties but hed have nothing to do with brooks brothers or carnaby street and remained faithful to the look favored by his iberian business associates it wasnt until after he died that lis and her mother would laugh that andrews style could best be described as postimmigrant that afternoon hed watched his wife arranging the meal and gave her strident instructions the food was cut geometrically cooked perfectly sealed in containers airtight as the nasa capsules that so fascinated him mother set out expensive stainlesssteel utensils and ceramic plates the shade of milky plums a warres port appeared and they each had a glass father asking mother her opinion of it he said she had an uneducated palate and for that reason was worth more than a dozen french sommeliers lis had never heard her mother utter a single negative syllable about any of the wines in her husbands inventory on the day of liss birth andrew lauberget was in portugal where he happened to drop a bottle of taylor fladgate because he was so startled by the sharp ringing of his partners telephoneon the other end of which happened to be his motherinlaw with the news that he was now a father the story goes that he laughed about the catastrophe and insistedthere on the phonethat they name lis after the city in which shed destroyed seven hundred dollars worth of port two things about this incident had always seemed significant to lis the first was the generosity with which he treated the loss and second why wasnt he with his wife at such a time that day at the beach sitting beside the dam hed lifted a silver spoon and against mothers protests poured a scant teaspoon down liss throat there lisbonne what do you think thats a not renowned no but good what do you think andrew shes eleven shes too young i like it father lis said repulsed by the wine by way of compliment she added that it tasted like vicks cough syrup he roared are you mad shes too young mother sent lis out of harms way and the girls went off to play until lunch was ready while portia sat in a cove of grass and picked flowers lis noticed a motion from the state park nearby and stepped closer to explore a boy of about eighteen stood with a girl several years younger she was backed against a tree and he was clutching the bark on either side of her shoulders he would ease forward and kiss her then back away quickly as she wrinkled her nose in mock disgust he reached suddenly for her chest lis was alarmed thinking that a wasp or bee had landed on her and he was trying to pick it off she felt an urge to call out to him to leave it alone they sting when theyre scared she nearly shouted astonished that a highschool boy wouldnt know this plain fact of nature it wasnt of course a bee he was after but the button of her shirt he undid it and slipped his fingers inside the girl crinkled her face again and slapped his knuckles he withdrew his fingers reluctantly laughed then kissed her again the hand crawled back inside and this time she didnt stop him their tongues met outside their mouths and they kissed hard an eerie radiation of warmth consumed lis she couldnt tell from which portion of her body it arose maybe her knees drawing some vague conclusions about the spectacle of the two lovers lis cautiously lifted her own hand to her blouse beneath which was her swimsuit she undid buttons mimicking the young man and eased her fingers under her suit as if his hand directed hers she probed with no discernible results at first then as she fumbled the heat seemed to rise from her legs and center somewhere in her belly lisbonne her father called harshly gasping she jumped lisbonne what are you doing i told you not to wander far he was nearby though apparently he hadnt seen her crimeif a crime it was her heart quivering madly she began to cry and dropped to her knees looking for indian bones she called in a shaking voice how horrible her mother shouted stop that this minute come wash your hands you should respect the remains of the dead young lady when youre dead and laid out howd you like someone to molest your grave the girls returned to the picnic blanket washed and sat down to the meal while father talked about the paste that astronauts would have to eat on extended space flights he tried without success to explain to portia what zero gravity meant lis was unable to get down more than a few bites of anything when they finished she hurried back to the cleft in the bushes on the pretense of looking for a dropped comb the couple was no longer there then came the part of the day that lis had been dreading father took her down to the dark water he removed his shirt and slacks beneath which he wore his burgundy trunks he had a dense bodynot strong but with fat distributed evenly in approximation of muscles her shirt came off then her culottes revealing the plain red swimsuit a thin woman now lis was a thinner girl then but she pulled in her stomach vehementlynot in shame at a belly but hoping futilely that it might inflate her chest they strode into the cold lake a championship swimmer in college andrew lauberget was hed told his daughter on a number of occasions troubled by her fear of the water he never missed an opportunity to get her into a pool or river or ocean its dangerous yes its far too easy to drown thats why you must learn to swim and swim like a fish nervously she flexed her knees feeling the gracious bed of mud beneath her arched toes father made a stern show of these lessons when he noticed that she was resisting putting her head under water he ordered her to take a breath and pushed her face beneath the waves panic finally sent her scrambling upright as she sputtered and shivered he laughed and told her see that wasnt so bad again for ten seconds i can do it for two minutes two whole minutes without a breath no i dont want to you take that tone youll go under for twenty seconds she practiced her strokes beating the water with splayed fingers which he forced closed into paddles he supported her and held her buoyant while she swam in place calm down girl water wont kill you calm down she rested on his palm trying to coordinate her legs and arms just as she struck a rhythm that approximated a breaststroke a wave rolled in and lifted her from his hand for a moment she was actually swimming on her own then the crest passed and lowered her once more but when she drifted back down shed moved forward a foot or so and she came to rest with her groin on his fingers for a tense moment neither father nor daughter moved andcompelled by an urge she understood no better today than thenlis pressed her legs together capturing his hand in that spot and then she smiled lisbonne lauberget looked at her father and gave him a slight smilenot one of seduction or power or pride least of all physical pleasure no just a smile that sprang spontaneously to her cold blue lips and it was for this transgression lis later speculated rather than the fluke contact of bodies that she was so ruthlessly punished the next thing she recalled was being dragged from the water her arm almost popping from its socket and being flung to the hard ground where she lay on her belly as her fathers handthe same hand that had moments before cradled the most enigmatic part of her bodynow rose and fell viciously upon another dont you ever he roared unwilling to give a name to the offense dont you ever dont you ever the raw words kept time with the loud slap of his palm upon her wet buttocks she felt little sting from the powerful blowsher skin was numb from the coldbut the greater pain was in her soul anyway she cried of course and she cried hardest when she saw her mother start toward her then hesitate the woman refused to look then turned away leading her sister from the shore portia looked back once with an expression of cold curiosity they disappeared toward the house nearly thirty years ago lis remembered those few minutes perfectly this very spot except for the level of the water and the height of the trees the place was unchanged even the darkness of night was somehow reminiscent of that june for though the picnic had been at lunchtime she had no memory of sunlight she recalled the whole beach being shrouded as murky as the water in which her father had dunked her tonight lis finally managed to push the memory aside and walked forward slowly over the gray sand of the beach to the dam the lake was already pouring over a low portion of ita cracked corner on the side nearest the house some of this spillage made its way into the runoff and the creek beyond but much of it was gathering in the culvert that led to the house she leapt over this flood and walked to the wheel set into the middle of the dam it was a piece of iron two feet in diameter its spokes in graceful curves like wisteria vines the foundry name prominently forged in some gothic typeface the wheel operated a gate two by three feet now closed over which flowed the water that gushed into the spillway opening it all the way would presumably lower the lake by several feet lis took the wheel in both hands and tried to twist it rose breeders develop good musclesfrom twentyfivepound bags of loam and manure if not the plants themselvesand lis strained hard but the whole mechanism was frozen solid with rust she found a rock and pounded on the shaft dully chipping paint and sending a few sparks flying like miniature meteorites she tried the wheel again without success then drew back and hammered the mechanism once more hard but the rock dipped into the spume of water and was ripped from her hand it bent back her fingers as it catapulted deep into the culvert she cried out in pain lis you all right she turned and saw portia climbing cautiously over the slippery limestone rocks the young woman walked up to the gate the old dam still here yup lis said pressing her stinging fingers she laughed but then where would a dam go give me some muscle here would you they tried the wheel together but it didnt move a millimeter for five minutes the sisters hammered at the worn gears and the wheels shaft but were unable to budge the mechanism been years since anybody opened it looks like portia studied the gate and shook her head she then gazed at the lake it stretched away a huge plain of opaque water at their feet you remember this place lis asked sure thats where we were going to launch the boat lis nodded at the beach right oh is this it the same boat portia touched the gunwale of the rowboat that of course not it was that old mahogany sailboat father sold it years ago what were we going to do run away sail someplace nantucket no england remember thats when wed read books out loud after lights out id read you some dickens story and we were going to live in mayfair no it was sherlock holmes i didnt mind them but dickens you did solo that was more than i could take youre right baker street mrs hudson i think it was the idea of a housekeeper bringing us tea in the afternoon that we liked best and doing the dishes afterwards can you sail to boston from here i cant sail to the other side of the lake from here portia peered into the water id forgotten all about the beach i think one of my dolls drowned here barbie probably worth a hundred bucks nowadays and wed steal oreos then sneak down here and eat them wed come here all the time she tried unsuccessfully to skip a stone until the picnic until the picnic lis echoed softly dipping a hand into the dark water this is the first time ive been back portia was astonished since then yep that was when twenty years ago try thirty portia shook her head as the number sunk in the rowboat gave a hard thud and bounced into the dam she watched it for a moment then said itll go over if we dont do something portia eased the boat to the beach and tied it to a sapling she stepped back wiping the bits of rotten rope from her hands and exhaled a fast laugh what i was thinking i dont know if i ever asked what happened happened lis asked that day the picnic id seen him mad but id never seen him that mad was it true had they never talked about it liss eyes were fixed on the jagged tops of three pines rising out of the forest the protruding trees were all different heights and for some reason put her in mind of calvary i dont know lis answered i sassed him probably i dont remember i wish id been older idve turned him in lis didnt speak for a moment see that she pointed to a rock the size of a grapefruit sticking up out of the sand and mud the water was now an inch away from it after he finished spanking me i crawled over to it tried to pick it up i was going to hit him and push him into the lake you the girl who never fought back i remember being on my hands and knees wondering what itd be like to be in jailwhether they had separate jails for boys and girls i didnt want to be in jail with a boy why didnt you do it after a moment lis replied i couldnt get it out thats why then abruptly she said we better get some sandbags here it looks like weve got about a half hour till it overflows trenton heck stared into the night sky through the sliding door of his trailer in front of him on a red vinyl place mat sat a plate of tuna salad and rice at emils feet was a bowl filled with alpo and spinach neither had eaten very much oh lord the plate got pushed across the table and heck swiped up a quart bottle of budweiser gulping three stiff swallows he realized that hed lost his taste for beer as well as his appetite and set the bottle back on the table aside from a glaring light above the table the trailer was dark he walked over the yellowandbrown shag carpet to his green easy chair a sears best and clicked on the pole lamp it gave an immediate comfort to the long space the trailer was large a threebedroom model it was sided in sunlightyellow aluminum the windows flanked by black vinyl shingles although heck had lived here for four and a half years and had accumulated almost everything that a married then divorced man would by rights accumulate in that time the rooms were not cluttered trailer makers are savvy about closets and storage areas most of hecks earthly possessions were stowed apart from the furniture and lamps the only visible accessories were photographs family dogs trophies silverplated men holding pistols in outstretched hands goldplated dogs a half dozen needlepoints that his mother had produced during the period of her chemotherapy easy sentimentslove is where the home is cassettes for the stereo willie waylon dwight randy garth bonnie kd and a couple of smallbore targets centerriddled with tight groupings because he was feeling sorry for himself he read the foreclosure notice again heck opened the bluebacked paper and laughed bitterly as he thought damn that bank moves fast the auction was a week from saturday heck had to vacate the friday before that part was as unpleasant to read as the next paragraphthe one explaining that the bank was entitled to sue him for the difference between what they made by selling his property in the foreclosure and the amount he still owed damn his palm crashed down emil jumped goddamn them theyre taking everything how he thought bitterly can i owe more than what i bought with the money they lent me yet he knew some things about the law and supposed that suing him for this sum was well within their rights as long as they gave him notice trenton heck knew how fast and bad you could ruin a mans life as long as you gave him notice first he figured he could live without the trailer the worse tragedywhat hurt him like a broken bonewas losing the land the trailer had always been intended as a temporary residence at best heck had bought these acreshalf pine forest and half low grasswith some money an aunt had left him the first time hed seen the property he knew he had to own it the thick fragrant woods giving way to yellowgreen hills gently sloped like a young girls back a wide stream slicing off the corner of the property no good for fishing but wonderful just for sitting beside as you listened to the water gush over smooth rocks and so hed bought it he hadnt asked the advice of his sensible father or his temperamental fiancée jill he went to the bank horrified at the thought of depleting a savings account larger than any hed ever possessed in his life and put the money down he walked away from the office of a surly lawyer the owner of four and seveneighths acres of land that featured no driveway well or septic tank or a dwelling either unable to afford a house heck bought a trailer hed allowed jill a part in that decision and the young waitressborn never to be cheatedhad slugged walls and measured closets and interrogated salesmen about btus and insulation before insisting that they buy the big one the fancy one the dangerwide load trailer you owe me it trenton the dealers men eased the long vehicle onto the pinnacle of the prettiest hill on the property right next to the spot where he planned to build his dream splitlevel these hopes of construction he believed could be achieved as easily as hed built his hundredyard driveway easing his pickup back and forth between the trailer and the road fifty times but the savings hed planned to replenish never materialized and therefore neither did the house finally it came to the point where he could no longer afford the trailer either when the first overdue notices arrived heck recalled to his dismay that the bank had loaned for the trailer on condition it take back a mortgage on the land as wellall his beautiful acreage the same land that as of a week from saturday was going to be somebody elses heck folded the papers and stuffed them behind a statement from the veterinarian he walked to the plateglass picture window which faced west the direction the storm would be coming from in just a few hours in the truck on the drive back home hed heard several announcements about the storm one of them reported that a twister had cut a swath through a trailer park in a town seventy miles west of here thered been no deaths but several injuries and a great deal of damage hearing this newscast just as he happened to click on the old radio seemed to heck a bad omen would his trailer survive intact he wondered then whispered and what the hell does it matter he picked up a roll of masking tape and peeled off a long strip he laid down one long diagonal of an x he started to do the cross strip then paused and flung the tape across the room walking into the bedroom he sat on the spongy double bed he imagined himself explaining this whole matter to jillthe foreclosure the lawsuitalthough he often grew distracted because when he pictured this conversation he pictured it very explicitly and couldnt help but notice that his ex was wearing a hotpink peekaboo nightgown heck continued to speak to her for a few minutes then became embarrassed at the unilateral dialogue he lay back on the bed gazing at the roiling clouds and began another silent conversationthis time not with jill but with hecks own father who at this moment was many miles away presumably asleep in a big colonial house that hed owned for twenty years no mortgage free and clear trenton heck was saying to him its just for a little while dad maybe a month or so itll help me get my life together my old roomll be fine just fine oh those words sounded flat they sounded like the excuses offered by the redhanded burglars and joyriders heck used to nab and in response his father glanced down the long nose that heck was grateful he hadnt inherited and said for as long as you like son sure though he was really saying i knew all along you couldnt handle it i knew it when you married that blonde not a woman like your mother i knew the old man didnt tell his son the story about the time he was laid off from the ironworks in then got himself together and started his own dealership and made himself a comfortable living though it was tough he didnt have to because the storyd been tolda dozen times a hundredand was sitting right there perched in front of their similar but very different faces times arent what they were heck thought as he nodded his flushed thanks though he was also thinking im just not like you dad and thats the long and the short of it he took a swig of beer he didnt really want and wished that jill were back he imagined the two of them packing boxes together looking forward to a joint move a truck horn sounded in the distance an eerie carrying wail and he thought of the lonely whippoorwill in the old hank williams song oh come on he thought rain like a son of a bitch heck loved the sound of the rain on the metal roof of the trailer nothing sent him off to sleep better if i aint going to get my reward money at least give me a good nights sleep trenton heck closed his eyes and as he began to doze he heard the trucks plaintive horn wail once more in the distance owen atcheson knew the harrowing logic of cornered animals and he understood the cold strategy of instinct that flowed like blood through the body of both hunter and prey he would stand motionless for hours in icy marshes so still that a drake or goose would pulse carelessly thirty feet above his head and die instantly in the shattering explosion from owens long tengauge hed move silentlyalmost invisiblyinches at a time along rock faces to ease downwind of a deer and without using a telescopic sight place a slug through the relaxed shoulder and strong heart of the buck when he was a boy hed doggedly follow fox paths and set dull metal traps exactly where the lithe blond animals would pass hed smell their musk hed see the hint of their passage in the grass and weeds hed collect their broken bodies and if one chewed through the stake line hed track it for milesnot just to recover the trap but to kill the suffering animal which he did almost ceremoniously pain in owen atchesons philosophy was weakness but death was strength hed killed men too picked them off calmly efficiently with his black m the empty bullet casings cartwheeling through the air and ringing as they landed for him the jangle of spent shells had been the most distinctive sound of the war much more evocative than the oddly quiet cracks of the gunfire itself they charged at him like children playing soldier these men and women working the long bolts of their ancient guns and hed picked them off ring ring ring but michael hrubek wasnt an animal driven by instinct he wasnt a soldier propelled by battle frenzy and loveor fearof country yet what was he owen atcheson simply didnt know driving slowly along route near stinson he looked about for a roadside store or gas station that might have a phone he wanted to call lis but this was a deserted part of the county he could see no lights except those from distant houses clinging to a hilltop miles away he continued down the road several hundred yards to a place where the shoulder widened here he parked the cherokee and reached into the back he slipped the bolt out of his deer rifle pocketing the welloiled piece of metal from the glove compartment he took a long black flashlight a halogen with six d cells in the tube the lens masked by a piece of shirt cardboard to limit the refraction of the light locking the doors he once again checked to see that his pistol was loaded then walked in a zigzag pattern along the shoulder until he found four hyphens of skid markswhere a car had stopped abruptly then sped off just as fast playing the light over the ground he found where hrubek had jumped from the hearse the bent grass the overturned stones the muddy bare footprints owen continued in a slow circle why he wondered had hrubek rolled in the grass why had he ripped up several handsfuls of it to staunch a wound was he trying to force himself to vomit was it part of a disguise camouflage what was in his mind six feet from the shoulder was a muddle of prints many of them hrubeks most of them the trackers boot prints and the dogs paw prints three animals he noticed here hrubek had paced for a time then started running east through the grass and brush just beyond the shoulder owen followed the trail for a hundred yards then noted that hrubek had turned off the road plowing south aiming for a ridge of hill paralleling the highway fifty feet away owen continued along this track until it simply vanished altogether dropping to his knees he scanned the area wondering if the man was smart enough to deerwalk an evasion technique used by professional poachers stepping straight down on the ground avoiding the most telltale signs of passage not prints but overturned pebbles leaves and twigs but he could find no bent blades of grassthe only evidence most deer walkers leave behind he concluded hrubek had simply backtracked aborting his southward journey and returning to the path beside the road fifty yards east he found where hrubek had once again done the sameturned south walked a short way then backtracked so yes he was moving east but at the same time was drawn to something south of the road owen followed this second detour some distance from the highway he stood in the midst of a field of tall grass and once more saw that the trackers had paused here shutting off the flashlight he took his pistol from his pocket and waded into the pool of cold darkness that rolled off the rocky hills in front of him and gathered at his feet like snow he paused here and against all reason closed his eyes owen atcheson tried to rid himself of the hardened savvy fortyeightyearold wasp lawyer inside him he struggled to become michael hrubek a man consumed by madness he stood this way swaying in the darkness for several minutes nothing he could get no sense whatsoever of hrubeks mind he opened his eyes fingering his pistol he was about to return to the cherokee and drive on to the truck stop in watertown when a thought came to him what if he was allowing hrubek too much madness was it possible that even if his world was demented the rules that governed that world were as logical as everyone elses adler was fast to talk about mixups and dopedup patients ambling off but step back owen told himself why look at what michael hrubeks donehes devised a plan to escape from a hospital for the criminally insane hes executed it and hes managed to evade professional pursuers owen decided it was time to give hrubek a little more credit returning to the spot where hrubeks trail ended he placed his feet squarely in the huge muddy indentations left by the madmans feet with eyes open this time he found himself looking directly at the crest of the rocky hill he gazed at it for a moment then walked to the base of the rock he dabbed his fingers in mud and smeared it on his cheekbones and forehead from his back pocket he took a navyblue stocking cap and pulled it over his head he started to climb in five minutes he found what he sought the nest on the top of the rocks contained broken twigs and grass and the marks of boots their indentations were deepmade by someone whod weigh close to three hundred pounds and they were fresh he also found button marks from where the man had lain prone and looked at the highway below maybe waiting for the trackers and their dogs to leave pressed into the mud was a huge handprint above the word revenge hrubek had been here no more than an hour before hed gone east yes but only for clothes perhaps or to lead his pursuers astray then hed backtracked west along a different route to this outcropping which hed spotted on his way east the son of a bitch owen descended slowly forcing himself to be careful despite his exhilaration he couldnt afford a broken bone now at the bottom of the rocks he played his flashlight over the ground he found a small patch of mud nearby and observed bootprints walking away from the rocksthe same prints hed seen on the top of the cliff although they werent widely spaced they were toeheavy an indication that hrubek was jogging or walking fast they led to the road then back south into the fields where they turned due west following these clear imprints owen walked for a short way through the grass he decided that he would make certain that hrubek was indeed going west then would return to his truck and cruise slowly along the highway looking for his quarry from the road just another ten yards he decided and climbed through a notch in a low stone fence leading to a large field beyond it was there that he tripped over the hidden wire and fell face forward toward the steel trap the big ottawa manufacturing coyote trap had been laid brilliantlyin a section of the path with no handholds for arresting falls just beyond the stone wall so that a searcher couldnt get his other foot to the ground in time to stop his tumble in an instant owen dropped the flashlight and covered his face with his left arm lifting his pistol and firing four magnum rounds at the round trigger plate in a desperate effort to snap it closed before he struck it the bluesteel device danced under the impact of the powerful slugs stones twigs and hot bits of shattered bullets flew into the air as owen twisted sideways to let his broad shoulder take the impact of the fall when he landed his head bounced off the closed jaws of the trap and he lay stunned feeling the blood on his forehead and fighting down the horrific image of the blue metal straps snapping shut on his face an instant later he rolled away assuming that hrubek had used the trap as owen himself would haveas a diversionmeant to hold him immobile and in agony while hrubek attacked from behind owen glanced about huddling beside the fence when there was no immediate assault he ejected the spent and unfired cartridges then reloaded he pocketed the two good rounds and scanned the area once more nothing no sound but a faint wind in the lofty treetops owen stood slowly so the trap had been meant merely to injure a scenting dog in fury owen picked up the bulletdented trap and flung it deep into the field he found the spent shells and buried them then by touch surveyed the damage to his face and shoulder it was minor his anger vanished quickly and owen atcheson began to laugh not from relief at escaping serious injury no it was a laugh of pure pleasure the trap said to him that michael hrubek was a worthy adversary after allruthless as well as clever owen was never as alive as when he had a strong enemy that he was about to engagean enemy that might test him hurrying to the cherokee he started the engine and drove slowly west staring at the fields to his left he was so intent on catching sight of his prey that he grazed a road sign with the trucks windshield startled by the loud noise he braked quickly and glanced at the sign it told him that he was exactly fortyseven miles from home michael hrubek crouched down in a stand of grass caressed his john worker overalls and wondered about the car at which he stared surely it was a trap snipers were probably sighting on it with longbarreled muskets snipers in those trees just ahead waiting for him to sneak up to the sports car he breathed shallowly and reminded himself not to give away his position after hed passed the get to sign hed hurried west through the fields of grass and pumpkin vines paralleling the dim strip of route hed made good time and had stopped only onceto place one of the animal traps beside a stone fence hed set a few leaves on top of the metal and hurried on now hrubek raised himself up and looked again at the car he saw no one around it but still he remained hidden in the foxhole of grass waiting aiming the blade sight of his gun at the trees ahead and looking for any sign of motion as he smelled the grass a dark memory loomed he tried his best to ignore it but the image refused to disappear oh whats that on your head mama whatre you wearing there mama take off that hat mama i dont like it one bit fifteen years ago michael hrubek had been a boy both very muscular and very fat with waddling feet and a long trunk of a neck one day playing in the tall grass field behind an old willow tree he heard michael miiiichael his mother walked onto the back porch of the familys trim suburban home in westbury pennsylvania michael please come here she wore a broadbrimmed red hat beneath which her beautiful hair danced like yellow fire in the wind even from the distance he could see the dots of her red nails like raw cigarette burns her eyes were dark obscured by the brim of the hat and by the amazing little masks that she dabbed on her eyes from the tubes of mask carrier on her makeup table she did this he suspected to hide from him honey come here i need you slowly he stood and walked to her i just got home i didnt have time to stop i want you to go by the grocery store i need some things oh no the boy said tragically she knew he didnt want to his mother said but mr and mrs klevan or the abernathys or the potters would be here at any minute and she needed milk and coffee or something she needed it no i cant yes yes he could he was her little soldier he was brave wasnt he he whined i dont know about this there are reasons why i cant do it and mind the change people shortchange you they wont let me cross the street michael retorted i dont know where it is dont worry honey ill give you the instructions she said soothingly ill write it down i cant do it for me please do it quickly i dont know youre twelve years old you can do it her composure was steadfast no no no all you have to doher mouth curved into a smileis go by the store and get what i need my brave little soldier boy can do that cant he but the klevans or the milfords or the pilchers arrived the next minute and his mother didnt get a chance to write down the directions for him she sent him on his way michael frightened to the point of nausea a fivedollar bill clutched in a death grip started out on a journey to the nearby store an hour passed and his mother stewing with mounting concern and anger received a phone call from the market michael had wandered into the store ten minutes before and had caused an incident your son the beleaguered manager said wants the store he wants the store she asked bewildered he said you told him to buy the store im near to calling the police he touched one of our checkers her you know chest shes in a state oh for the love of christ she sped to the market michael shaking with panic stood in the checkout line confronted with the apparent impossibility of doing what hed been told to dogo buy the storehis conscious thought dissolved and hed belligerently grabbed the checkers fat arm and thrust the cash into her blouse pocket as she stood hands at her side sobbing take it he screamed at her over and over take the money his mother collected him and when they returned home she led him straight into the bathroom im scared are you darling my little soldier boys scared of what i wonder where was i i dont remember nothing anything i dont remember anything now get out of those filthy clothes they were stained with sawdust and dirt michael had bellyflopped to the floor seeking cover when his mother eyes blazing beneath her stylish hat charged through the pneumatic door of the supermarket then i want you to come out and tell my guests youre sorry for what you did after that youll go to bed for the day go to bed bed she snapped okay he said okay sure was he being punished or comforted he didnt know michael pondered this for a few minutes then sat on the toilet faced with a new dilemma his mother had dumped his clothes down the laundry chute did she want him to apologize naked he gazed about the room for something he might wear five minutes later michael opened the door and stepped out into the living room wearing his mothers nightgown hello he said trooping up to the guests i tried to buy the fucking store im sorry mr abernathy or monroe stopped speaking in midsentence his wife raised a protective hand to her mouth to stop herself from blurting something regrettable but his own mother why she was smiling michael was astonished though her masked eyes were cold she was smiling at him well heres our pretty little soldier boy she whispered doesnt michael look fashionable i found it behind the door did you now she asked shaking her head michael smiled fashionable he felt pleased with himself and repeated his apology laughing harshly i tried to buy the fucking store the guests holding the cups that contained tea not coffee and lemon not milk avoided each others eyes michaels mother rose ive changed my mind michael you look so nice why dont you go out and play outside his smile faded come along i want you outside id feel funny going outside wearing no michael outside but they might see me he began to cry somebody might see me now she screeched get the fuck outside then she escorted him by the hand thrusting him out the front door two of the neighborhood girls stared at him as he stood on the doorstep in the paleblue nightgown they smiled at first but when he began to stare back muttering to himself they grew uncomfortable and went inside michael turned back to his own front door he heard the lock click he looked obliquely through the dirty glass window and saw his mothers face turning away michael walked to the willow tree in the backyard and for the rest of the afternoon huddled by himself in a nest of grass similar to the one in which he sat tonight looking for snipers and staring at the car as he listened to the rustle of this grass feeling it caress his skin as it had so long ago michael hrubek remembered much of that day he didnt however remember it with perfect clarity for the very reason that made it so significant in his lifeit was his first break with reality his first psychotic episode the images of those few hours were altered by his mind and by the intervening years and were buried beneath other memories many of which were just as haunting and sorrowful tonight moved by the smell and feel of the grass he might have delved deeper into that eventas dr richard had been encouraging him to dobut hed grown so agitated by now that he could wait no longer snipers or no he had to act he rose and made his way to the road the sports car had apparently broken down earlier in the evening the hood was up and the windows and doors were locked a red triangular marker sat in the road near the rear fender hrubek wondered if its purpose was to help snipers sight on their target he sailed it into the brush like a frisbee mg he whispered reading the emblem on the hood he concluded this meant my god paying no attention to the inside of the car he walked directly to the trunk a gift look at this a gift from my god the rack was locked but he simply grabbed the mountain bicycle in both hands and pulled it free bits of metal and plastic from the mountings cascaded around him he set the bicycle on the ground and caressed the tubes and leather and gears and cables he felt a chill from the metal and enjoyed this sensation very much he lowered his head to the handlebar and rubbed his cheek on the chrome he took a marker from his pocket and wrote on his forearm oh strange are the works of god thank you god for this beautiful gift next to these words he drew a picture of a serpent and one of an apple and wrote the name eve he licked the name and stepped back studying his new means of transportation with an uneasy but grateful gaze richard kohler found himself in an alien world he was wearing a woolblend suit a silk tie redandgreen argyles and a single penny loaferwhat other proof did he need he reflected that he was no outdoorsman bending forward as far as he dared he pulled his other shoe out of a pool of soupy methanelaced mud and wiped it on the grass beside him he stepped back into the wet loafer and continued his journey westward curiously this forest invoked in him a claustrophobia that hed never felt anywhere elseeven in his dark tiny office where he would often spend fifteen straight hours his pulse was high his limbs itched from this fear of confinement and he was having trouble breathing he also heard noises where no noises should be and his sense of direction was terrible he was on the verge of admitting to himself that yes he was lost his points of referencetrees signposts busheswere vague and shifty more often than not as he walked toward them they simply vanished sometimes they turned into grotesque creatures or faces in the process over his shoulder was his ruddy backpack containing the syringe and drugs and on his arm was a black london fog raincoat he was too hot to wear it and he wondered why on earth hed brought the coat with him the radio updates about the impending storm suggested that a helmet and armor would be better protection than gabardine kohler had parked his bmw up the road a half mile from here and had made his way through a field into this forest making slow progress his leather soles slipped off the damp rocks and hed fallen twice onto the hard ground the second time hed landed on his wrist nearly spraining it the vicious thorns of a wild rosebush hooked his pant leg and it took five painful minutes to free himself kohler recognized though that hed been lucky the nurse whod alerted him to the escape reported that the young man had run from the hearse in stinson and had apparently gotten as far as watertown as kohler had sped in that direction down route he was certain that hed sighted michael in a clearing the doctor raced to the turnoff climbed from the car and searched the area hed called his patients name pleaded with him to show himself but received no response then the doctor had driven off once more but he hadnt gone far he pulled off onto a side road and waited ten minutes later he believed that hed seen the same figure hurrying on once more kohler had found no sign of michael since hoping he might stumble across him by chance the psychiatrist had taken to the wilderness again heading in the direction in which michael seemed to be headedwest where are you michael and why are you out here tonight oh ive tried so hard to look into your mind but its as dark as it ever was its as dark as the sky he tripped again on a strand of wire this time and tore his slacks on a sharp rock gouging his thigh he wondered if there was a danger of tetanus this thought discouraged himnot the risk of disease but the reminder of how much basic medicine hed forgotten he wondered if his knowledge of the human brain compensated for the longforgotten facts of physiology and organic chemistry he once had learned and recited so easily then these thoughts faded for he found the sports car there was nothing remarkable about the vehicle itself he didnt for a minute think that michael had lifted the hood and tried to hotwire it his patient would be far too frightened at the thought of driving a car to steal one no kohler was intrigued by something elsea small object resting on the ground behind the rear bumper the tiny white skull ironically was the exact shade of the car itself he stepped closer and picked it up looking carefully at the delicate bones a tiny fracture ran through the cheek trigeminal he thought spontaneously recalling the name of the fifth pair of cranial nerves then the skull teetered on the tips of his fingers for an instant and tumbled with a soft crack onto the trunk of the car rolling into the dust of the shoulder kohler remained completely still as the muzzle of the pistol slid along his skin from his temple to his ear while a fiercely strong hand reached out and fastened itself to his shoulder trenton heck pointed the walther up at the turbulent clouds and eased the ribbed hammer down he put the safety on and slipped the gun back into his holster he handed the wallet back to the skinny man whose hospital identification card and drivers license seemed on the upandup the poor fellow wasnt quite as pale as when heck had tapped the muzzle to his head a few minutes before but he wasnt any less angry richard kohler dropped to his knees and unzipped the backpack heck had tossed onto the grass before frisking him sorry sir heck said couldnt tell whether you were him or not too dark to get a good look with you crouched down and all you come up on michael hrubek that way and hell panic kohler snapped i guarantee it he rummaged inside the pack whatever was so precious insidejust a couple of bottles it looked likedidnt seem to be damaged heck wondered if hed caught himself a tippler and ill tell you something else the doctor turned examining heck even if youd shot him hedve turned around and broken your neck before he died kohler snapped his fingers heck gave a brief laugh with a head wound i dont know about that theres apparently a lot you dont know about him the doctor rezipped the pack heck supposed he couldnt blame the man for being pissed off but he didnt feel too bad about the ambush kohler it turned out had been padding down the same path hrubek mustve taken earlier in the evening in the dark how was heck to know the difference true the doctor was undoubtedly a lot punier but then so are all suspects after they turn out not to be suspects whats your interest here exactly sir heck asked kohler eyed his civvy clothes you a cop or what sort of a special deputy though this was untrue and he had no more police powers than an average citizen still he sensed he needed some authority with this wiry fellow who looked like he was in the mood to make trouble heck repeated his question im michaels doctor quite a house call youre making tonight heck looked over the doctors suit and penny loafers you did some fine tracking to get yourself all the way here considering you havent got dogs i spotted him up the road headed in this direction but he got away so hes nearby i saw him a half hour ago he cantve gotten that far heck nodded at emil whose head was up well for some reason the scents vanished thats got me worried and emil antsy were going to quarter around here see if we can pick it up the tone was meant to discourage company as was the pace that heck set but kohler kept up with man and dog as they zigzagged across the road and along the fields surrounding it their feet crunching loudly on leaves and gravel heck felt the stiffening of his leg muscles a warning to go slow the temperature was still unseasonable but it had dropped in the last half hour and the air was wet with the approaching storm when he was tired and hadnt slept his leg was prone to seize into agonizing cramps now that i think about it heck said you were probably better off tracking him without dogs he fooled our search party damn good led us all in the opposite direction he ended up taking kohler once againfor the fourth time by hecks countglanced at the walther automatic the doctor asked led you off what do you mean heck explained about the false cluedropping the clipping that contained the map of boston the doctor was frowning i saw michael in the hospital library yesterday tearing clippings out of old newspapers hed been reading all morning he was very absorbed in something that a fact heck muttered discouraged once again at hrubeks brainy talents he continued then he pulled a trick ive only heard about he pissed on a truck he what yep took a leak on a tire left his scent on it the truck took off for maine and the dogs followed it stead of going after his footsteps not many peopled know about that let alone psychos thats not exactly kohler said coolly a word we use my apologies to him heck responded with a sour laugh funny thing i was just falling asleepyou know how this happens sometimesand i heard a truck horn it just come to mewhat hed done emils good but following airborne scent of a man hanging on to a tractortrailer naw that didnt seem right for that many miles i drove back to the truck stop and sure enough picked up his backtrack thats a trick of the pros just like he hid that clipping in the grass see i wouldntve believed it itd been lying out in the open hes clever hes fooled dogs before ill bet no impossible hes never escaped from anything in his life not a calculated escape heck looked at kohler to see if he could spot the lie but the doctor seemed sincere and heck added thats not what i heard from who from my old boss at the state police don haversham hes the one called me about the search he said something bout seven hospitals your boyd hightailed it outta kohler was laughing sure but ask michael which ones hell tell you they were prison hospitals and when he escaped he was on horseback dodging musket balls see what i mean heck wasnt quite sure that he did musket balls heh weve gotta head through this brush here they plunged down a steep dirt path into a valley below kohler was soon winded by the arduous trek when they reached flat ground he caught his breath and said of course you dont know for certain that he isnt headed for boston hows that well if he was smart enough the doctor pointed out to fool you into thinking he was going east maybe now hes fooling you into thinking hes going west double bluff well this was something heck hadnt thought about sure why couldnt hrubek just do the same thing all over again and turn east maybe he did have boston in mind but he thought for a minute and then told kohler the truth that might be but i cant search the whole of the northeast all i can do is follow my dogs nose though he was painfully aware that this particular nose presently had no notion of where his prey was just something to think about the doctor said they followed the path through a valley beside an old quarry heck remembered in his youth a solitary boy hed taken an interest in geology hed spent many hours pounding with a hammer in a quarry similar to this one snitching honest quartz mica and granite rocks for his collection tonight he found himself staring at the tall cliffs scarred and choppedthe way bone was gouged by a doctors metal tools he thought of the xrays of his shattered leg showing where the bullet cracked his femur why hed wondered at the time as he wondered now had the goddamn doctor shown him that artwork the hound turned abruptly several times paused then turned again has he got the track kohler asked whispering nope heck replied in a conversational voice well know when he does they walked behind emil as he snaked along the base of the tall yellowwhite cliffs around pools of brackish water they emerged from the rocky valley and climbed slowly they found themselves once again back at the disabled mg heck was grimacing hell back to square one whyre you out here by yourself kohler asked breathing heavily just am theres a reward for him heck looped the track line for a moment finally he said howd you know that i didnt but it explains why youre out here by yourself and how bout you doc if you spotted him how come you didnt call out the marines he panics easily i can get him back without anybody getting hurt he knows me he trusts me emil suddenly stiffened and turned to the forest tensing in an instant heck drew and cocked his pistol the underbrush shook no kohler shouted glancing at the gun he started forward into the bush but heck gripped him by the arm and whispered id be quiet there sir lets dont give our position away there was silence for a moment then the muscular doe bounded in a graybrown arc over a low hedge and vanished heck put the gun away you oughta be a little more careful youre kinda trusting you know what i mean he looked south along the road where the gray asphalt disappeared into the hills emild shown no interest in that direction but heck thought they ought to try it nonetheless he started to hold the plastic bag containing hrubeks shorts down to the dog once more but kohler stopped his arm how much the doctor asked hows that sir heck stood how much is the reward emil was aware that a scent article was dangling over his head and he shivered heck closed the bag up again to keep the dog from growing too skittish he said to the doctor thats sort of between me and the people paying it sir is that adler heck nodded slowly well kohler continued hes a colleague we work together if hes a buddy then how come you dont know bout it the reward kohler asked how much mr heck ten thousand ill give you twelve for a moment heck watched emil rock back and forth eager to run he said to kohler youre joshing oh no im quite serious heck snorted a laugh but his face grew hot as he realized that he was looking at a man who could actually write a check for twelve thousand dollars and probably have some left over afterward why thirteen im not bargaining with you what do you want me to do for that kind of money go home forget about michael hrubek heck looked slowly around him he noticed in the west far away a diffuse flash of lightning it seemed to stretch for a hundred miles he gazed at the huge expanse of countryside the muddy horizon against the black sky he found the view disturbing for the very reason that this unexpected money was so appealing how could he possibly find one man in that vast emptiness heck laughed to himself why did god always drop temptations in front of you when you wanted them the most whats in this for you heck asked again to stall i just dont want him hurt im not going to hurt him not necessarily you were about to use that gun well if i had to i would but im not going to shoot anybody in the back thats not my way wasnt when i was a trooper isnt now michael isnt dangerous hes not like a bank robber doesnt matter if hes dangerous like a crazed moose protecting her calves or dangerous like a mafia hit man im looking out for me and my dog and if that means shooting the mans coming at me with a rock or tire iron so be it kohler gave a little smile that made heck feel hed somehow lost a point look hes set out traps for dogs i dont give much quarter to a man like that he did what the smile vanished from kohlers face traps spring animal traps no michael wouldnt do that well you may say that but have you seen any i know he took some havent found any yet the doctor didnt speak for a moment finally he said i think youre being used mr heck what do you mean by that he was ready to take offense but the psychiatrists voice was suddenly soothing the voice of someone on his side trying to help adler knows that a dogll make a schizophrenic snap chasing someone like michael is the worst thing in the world for him a patient like that cornered hell panic hell panic bad youll have to shoot him adler wants this whole thing wrapped up as smooth as possible fourteen thousand lord heck squeezed his eyes shut and opened them just in time to see another flash of lightning at his feet emil rocked on his paws and had just about had it with this humanconversation stuff take the money and go back home call up the bank feed them a big check fourteend buy him another nine ten months maybe in that time hqd find money to reinstate all the troopers let go in the last three years maybe one of the thirtysix security companies that had hecks résumé would find an opening maybe jilld come home with her knuckleball and tip money and her lacy nightgowns fourteen thousand dollars heck sighed well sir i understand youre concerned about your patient and all and i respect that but therere other people to think about too i wasnt a trooper for nothing emil and me have a chance to capture this fellow and id say its probably a better shot than you haveeven with your talk about double bluffs and all no offense but he isnt dangerous thats what nobody understands you chasing him thats what makes him dangerous heck laughed well you psychiatrists have your own way of talking i dont doubt but those two fellows he almost killed tonight might disagree with you some killed kohlers eyes flickered and the doctor seemed as badly shaken as when heck had pressed the black barrel of the gun against his skin whatre you talking about those orderlies what orderlies he had the runin with those two fellows near stinson i thought you knew about it just after he escaped you know their names no sure dont they were from the hospital marsden thats all i know stepping away from heck kohler wandered to the car he picked up the small skull he rubbed it compulsively in his hands so heck continued i think i gotta turn down your offer kohler stared at the night sky for a moment then turned to heck just do me a favor if you find him dont threaten him dont chase him and whatever you do for gods sake dont sic that dog on him im not looking at this heck said coolly like a fox hunt kohler handed him a card thats my service you get close to him call that number theyll page me id really appreciate it if i can i will heck said thats the best i can say kohler nodded and looked around orienting himself thats down there yessir trenton heck said then leaned against the fender of the car andwith a slight laughwatched the peculiar sight of this narrow man in a suit and tie muddy as a ditchdigger sporting a finelooking overcoat and a backpack as he strolled down this deserted country road late on a stormy night dr ronald adlers eyes coursed up and down the marsden county map made it all the way to the state border whodve thought he added with neither elation nor interest the massachusetts highway patrol should have him within an hour or so i want a worstcase plan are you talking about the reward peter grimes asked reward the director snapped uhm what do you mean by worstcase adler seemed to know exactly but didnt speak for a moment perhaps out of some vestigial superstition that medical training had not wholly obliterated if he kills a trooper when they find him or kills anybody else for that matter thats what i mean okay thats possible i suppose grimes offered unlikely adler turned his attention back to the e ward supervisors reports is all this accurate absolutely im sure hrubek was in the milieu suite kohler was doing individual psychoanalysis with him this delusion therapy hes always boring people with and publishing about in the best professional journals grimes reflected he said so it appears nimh guidelines we all know them the criteria for individual psychotherapy in schizophrenic patients are that they be young intelligent have a past history of achievement and are more acute than chronic oh and that they have some success in a sexual relationship thats hardly michael hrubek the assistant came a half breath away from saying not unless you call rape a successful relationship he wondered if adler would have fired him or laughed a history like hisadler riffled pagesand still kohler puts him in therapy one way you could view it is that kohler was more than negligent in this whole matter lets just take that tack for a minute shall we is that door open my door there close it why dont you grimes did while adler flipped through one doctors assessment of hrubek in which was recorded the patients plans to remove this therapists internal organs with a single bare handa process that hrubek described articulately and all things considered with an impressive knowledge of human anatomy when grimes dropped again into his chair adler had snapped closed the file and was gazing at the ceiling his hand dipped into his crotch where he adjusted something he said you realize what herr dr kohler has done he do you know the case of burton scott webley burton scott webley the third or fourth i dont recall do you know about him do they teach you such arcane things in where did you go to school columbia sir im not familiar with the case no columbia adler stretched the four syllables out with elastic disdain webley the third or fourth he was a patient in new york i dont know creedmoor perhaps or pilgrim state dont lets quibble no wait it was private top doctors like our friend sigmund kohler cum laude sort of doctors columbia sort of doctors got it you see kohler has this idea that our mental hospitals are chockablock with van goghs poets and artists misunderstood geniuses vision and madness locked togetherthe beast with two backs when he noticed grimes staring at him blankly adler continued webley was a paranoid schizophrenic delusional monosymptomatic twentyeight years of age sound familiar grimes delusions centered around his family they were trying to get him blah blah blah felt his father and aunt were having an incestuous relationship including bouts of televised sodomy on network tv if im not mistaken he had a bad episode and threatened the aunt with a pitchfork well hes involuntarily committed insulinshock therapy is all in vogue and his doctors put him into a hundred seventy comas jesus then the ecs department thirdrails him for six months after his blood sugar becomes an embarrassment with that much amperage well he came out of it rather tattered as youd suspect this was when hardly matters a little while after they unplugged him he sees the senior psychiatrist who does a new diagnostic webley is neat and clean and coherent and very sharp astonishing indeed considering the smithkline cocktails hes on hes polite hes responsive hes eager to undergo therapy the doctor schedules the full battery of tests webley takes and passes all twentyfive of them a miracle cure hell be written up in the apa journal i can guess whats coming oh can you grimes adler fixed him with an amused gaze can you guess that after he was released he took a taxi to his aunts house then raped and dismembered her looking for the hidden microphone thatd recorded the evidence used to commit him can you guess that her fifteenyearold daughter walked into the house as his little search was in progress and that he did the same to her any inkling that the only thing that saved the eightyearold son was that webley fell asleep amid the girls viscera you look sufficiently pale grimes but i have to tell you the end of the story the shocking part it was all calculated webley had an iq of after he took himself off his brain candy he snuck into the library and memorized the correct answers to each of those twentyfive tests and i submit honed his delivery pretty fucking well you think hrubek did the same thing to kohler what this webley did yes of course thats what i mean kohler bought a bill of goods lock stock and barrel callaghans death any other deaths tonighttheyre ultimately kohlers fault his fault peter sure of course tell me what do you think of him of kohler pompous little shit adler was pleased to have someone second this sentiment though it reminded him how much he detested grimes for being such a toady i think theres more to it why is he being so blind kohlers not stupid whatever else hes not stupid why i dont really peter id like you to do something for me look sir some detective work when the otherwise thin adler dropped his head to look over the top of his glasses he developed an alarming double chin because it was very late in the evening and he was tired of treading lightly through hospital politics peter grimes chose not to be coy i dont think id like to do that like to do that adler snapped dont give me any of your bluster i want to see fear in your face young man youre not union if i wanted your fucking balls id have them in an instant and a hell of a lot easier than i could castrate those orderlies dont you forget that now are you listening some detective work write it down if you cant remember it are you ready he inquired sarcastically forgetting for the moment that he was speaking not to an incompetent secretary but to a doctor of medicine as man and dog returned to the sports car heck grew convinced that hrubek had hitched a ride or snuck into the back of a repair vehicle that had answered the distress call hiding in trucks for real this time is he heck wondered he leaned against the car and shivered slightly as a breeze came up oh man here i give up almost a years salary sounding all grandiose and righteous and look what happens i lose the trail completely what would youve done jill tell me youdve told him to stuff it too but no heck knew jill wouldve skedaddled home and tucked kohlers check in her jewelry box by now shed be fast asleep in her pink nightgown oh baby then suddenly emils nose shot into the air and the dog stiffened he turned north toward route and began to trot forward heck followed feeling the line go taut and emil pick up the pace whats going on here the breeze blew over them again and emil began to run glancing down at the asphalt heck closed his eyes in disgust goddamn what was i thinking of bicycle heck commanded emil to stop then examined the asphalt and found a tread mark leading unsteadily from the car toward the highway the tread was very wide the rider could easily weigh three hundred pounds the surest clue though was emil whose nose was in the air when a dog raises his nose and switches from trailing ground scent to trailing airborne its a good sign that the quarrys on a bike or motorcycle theyd probably been upwind of the scent until the breeze a moment ago blew a bit of it back in their direction emils ears twitched and he doled his weight from the left paw to the right and back again ready to run heck was too airborne scent is the hardest to track and even a moderate wind will disrupt it a storm of the sort that was expected would surely obliterate it altogether strapping the thong over his pistol he wrapped emils red lead around his left hand find emil find the hound broke from the starting gate and surged down the road they were on the trail once again whats different standing on the edge of the lake not far from the patio lis was momentarily disoriented this place seemed both familiar and foreign then she understood why the lake had risen so high that the shape of the shoreline had changed what had been a voluptuous outcropping of lawn and reeds was now concave and a cluster of small rock islands roughly in the shape of the constellation orion had vanishedcompletely covered with water she turned back to her labors the two women hadnt returned to the dam but chose to build the new levee closer to the house filling and piling sandbags where the culvert met the lawn even if the lake were to overflow the dam a line of bags here would if it held stop the water from reaching the house besides she decided they hardly had the time or strength to cart several tons of sand a hundred yards through a rocky culvert slowly filling with water portia filled the bags and lis dragged or carried them to their impromptu line of defense as they worked lis glanced occasionally at her sister the rings and crystal necklace were gone and her delicate hands and short perfect nailsfiery redwere covered by canvas gloves in place of the black lace headband was a boston red sox cap portia lunged energetically with the shovel absorbed in the task scooping huge wads of sand and pitching them into bags lis with years of gardening and landscaping behind her had always assumed herself the stronger of the two but she saw now that they were in strength at least on par thanks she supposed to the hours portia spent on healthclub treadmills and racquetball courts occasionally the young woman would stop pull off a glove to see what sort of honorable callus she might be developing then return to the job once as she gazed out into the forest portia twined a strand of hair around her finger and slipped an end into her mouth lis had seen her do this earlier in the eveninga nervous habit that shed perhaps developed recently but then lis thought how would i know if shed picked it up recently or not she reflected how little she knew of her sisters life the girl had for all practical purposes left home at eighteen and rarely returned for any length of time when she had it was usually for a single nighta saturday or sunday dinnerwith her current flame in tow she even spent the majority of holidays elsewhereusually with boyfriends sometimes workmates a christmas for two in a faroff inn however romantic didnt appeal much to lis during summer breaks from college portia would travel with girlfriends or work at internships in the city when shed dropped out of school her junior year the girl had abandoned her bronxville apartment and moved to manhattan lis was then working at ridgeton high school and living in a small rental house in redding shed been hoping that after her sister left sarah lawrence the young woman might come back to the area but no portia smilingly deflected the suggestion as if it were pure craziness she added that she had to move to new york it was time for her to do the city lis remembered wondering what exactly this meant and why her sister seemed to treat it as an inevitable rite of passage what lis wondered was life like when you did the city did portias daytime hours pass quickly or slow did she flirt with her boss did she gossip what did she eat for dinner where did she buy her laundry soap did she snort cocaine at adagency parties did she have a favorite movie theater what did she laugh at monty python or roseanne which newspaper did she read in the morning did she sleep only with men lis tried to recall any time in recent years when she and portia had spoken frequently during the prelude to their mothers death she supposed yet even then frequently was hardly the word to use seventyfouryearold ruth lauberget had learned the hopeless diagnosis a year ago august and had immediately taken up the role of patientone that it was no surprise to lis her mother seemed born to play her monied boston soussociety upbringing had taught her to be stoic her generation to be fatalistic her husband to expect the worst the role was in fact simply a variation on one that the statuesque stilleyed woman had been acting for years a formidable disease had simply replaced a formidable husband andrew having by then made his unglamorous exit in the british air loo until she got sick the widow lauberget had been foundering a woman in search of a burden now once again she was in her element buying clothes for a shrinking figure she chose not the shades shed always worncolors that made good backgrounds beige and taupe and sandbut picked instead the hues of the flowers she grew reds and yellows and emerald she wore loudpatterned turbans not scarves or wigs and onceto liss astonishmentburst into the chemo ward announcing to the young nurses hello dahlings its auntie mame only near the very end did she grow sullen and timidmostly at the thought it seemed of an ungainly and therefore embarrassing death it was during this time that on morphine shed described recent conversations with her husband in such detail that liss skin would sting from the goose bumps mother only imagined it lis recalled thinkingas shed protested to owen tonight on the patio shed just imagined it of course the chills however never failed to appear lis had thought that perhaps their mothers illness might bring the sisters closer together it didnt portia spent only slightly more time in ridgeton during the months of mrs laubergets decline than she had before lis was furious at this neglect and oncewhen she and her mother had driven into the city for an appointment at sloanketteringshe resolved to confront her sister yet portia preempted her shed fixed up one of the bedrooms in the coop as a homey sickroom and insisted that lis and ruth stay with her for several days she broke dates took a leave of absence from work and even bought a cookbook of cancerfighting recipes lis still had a vivid comic memory of the young woman feet apart hair in anxious streamers standing dead center in the tiny kitchen as she slung flour into bowls and vegetables into pans searching desperately for lost utensils so the confrontation was avoided yet when ruth returned home portia resumed her distance and in the end the burden of the dying fell on lis by now much had intervened between the sisters and shed forgiven portia for this lapse lis was even grateful that only she had been present in the last minutes it was a time she would rather not have shared lis would always remember the curiously muscular touch of her mothers hand on liss palm as she finally slipped away a triplet of squeezes like a letter in morse code now lis suddenly found herself gasping for breath and realized that in the grip of memory shed been working with growing fervor the pace increasingly desperate she paused and leaned against the pile of bags already threehigh she closed her eyes for a moment and was startled by her sisters voice so portia plunged the shovel into the pile of sand with a loud chunk i guess its time to ask why did you really ask me out at her sisters feet lis counted seven bags filled waiting to be piled up on the levee portia filled two more and continued i didnt have to be here for the estate right i couldve handled it all in the city thats what owen said you havent been out for a long time i dont get into the city very much if you mean we dont see each other very much well thats sure true but theres something else on your mind isnt there other than sisters socializing lis didnt speak and watched another bag vigorously fill with wet sand what is this portia continued kiss and make up lis refused to let herself be stung by the mocking tone gripping a bag by the corners she carried it to the culvert and slung it fiercely on top why dont we take five portia finished filling another bag then planted the shovel and pulled off the gloves examining a red spot on her index finger she sat down beside her sister on the low wall of bags after a moment lis continued im thinking of leaving teaching her sister didnt seem surprised i never could quite see you as a teacher and what exactly did she see me as lis wondered she assumed portia had opinions about her careerand about the rest of her life for that matterbut couldnt imagine what they might be teachings been good to me ive enjoyed it enough but i think its time for a change well youre a rich woman now live off the fat of the land well im not going to just quit why not stay home and garden watch oprah and regis therere worse lives you know langdell nursery nope the young woman squinted shaking her head oh wait that place off we used to go there all the time with mother theyd let us water flowers in the hothouse vaguely thats where they had those big bins of onions lis laughed softly flower bulbs right its still there its for sale the nursery and a landscaping company the family owns jesus look portia was gazing across the lake into the state park the water had pushed an old boathouse off its pilings the ghostly white structure of rotting clapboard dipped slowly into the water the state was going to tear it down lis nodded toward the boathouse the taxpayers just saved a few dollars looks like the nursery i was saying she rubbed her hands together a few times and felt her palms go cold as the nervous sweat evaporated i think im going to buy the place portia nodded again a bit of yellow hair wound between her fingers and the tips of the strands slipped into her mouth in the muted light her face seemed particularly pale and her lips black had she refreshed her lipstick before coming out here to stack sandbags i need a partner lis said slowly and i was thinking id like it to be you portia laughed she was a pretty woman and could instantly as if by turning on a switch become entirely sensual or charming or cute yet she often laughed with a deep breathiness that lis felt instantly killed her appeal this usually occurred when as now she was critical in an obscure way leaving it to others to deduce their slipups heat bristled at liss temples as the blush washed over her face i dont know business finances marketing things like that you do im a media buyer lis im not donald trump you know more than i do youre always talking about getting out of advertising you were thinking about opening a boutique last year everybody in advertising talks about quitting and opening a boutique or a catering company you and me in business its a good deal langdell died last year and his wife doesnt want to keep running the place theyre asking three million for everything the land alones worth two mortgage rates are great now and angie said shed be willing to finance some of it herself as long as she gets a million and a half at the closing youre serious arent you i need a change portia i love gardens and no i think it makes sense for you i meant youre serious about us working together of course i am you handle the business and finance and i handle the productthere doesnt that sound professional the product portia had been staring at the pile of bags shed filled she picked one up carried it to the wall dropped it into place heavy bastards arent they she gasped maybe i oughta shovel less ive got a lot of ideas wed expand the formal gardens and open a specialty hothouse for roses we could even have lectures maybe do videos how to crossbreed how to start your first garden you know people in film production if we work hard it could really fly portia didnt speak for a minute fact is i was going to quit anyway after the first of the year just stay long enough to get my bonus really thats when i was thinking of buying the place february or march the young woman added quickly no i mean i was going to take the year off a couple years maybe i wasnt going to work at all oh lis straightened one of the sandbags which teetered between the two women and do what travel club med it for a while i wanted to learn how to windsurf demon of the sea just not do anything i hear that tone mother lis fought down the wave of anger no im just surprised maybe ill do europe again i was poor when i did the backpacking routine and god those trips with mother and father the pits señor lauberget fascist tour guide come on girls what the hellre you up to the louvre closes in two hours portia dont you dare look back at those boys ha and youyou were probably the only kid in the history of the world who went to bed without dinner because she bitched about leaving what was that the sculpture gardens at the rodin museum lis said in a soft voice laughing wanly at the memory a culture victim at seventeen after a moment portia said i dont think so lis it wouldnt work for a year try it you could sell out your share if it isnt for you i could also lose the money couldnt i yes i suppose you could but i wont let it go under what does owen think ah well there was that he had some reservations you could say you could also say that it nearly broke up their marriage lis began thinking about opening a nursery just before their mother died and it was clear that the sisters would be inheriting a large sum of cash owen had wanted to put money into conservative stocks and invest in his law firm hiring several attorneys and expanding into new offices that would be the best return on the investment hed told her but she was adamant it was her money and a nursery would be perfect for her if not the langdells then another one somewhere nearby always the practical counselor he rattled off a list of concerns youre crazy lis a nursery its seasonal its weatherdependent with landscaping therere major liability issues youll have ins problems with the workers you want to garden well build another one here well get an architect we can i want to work owen for heavens sake i dont tell you to stay home and read law books for fun you can make a living at law hed snapped the more he argued the more insistent she grew jesus lis at best youll probably clear a few thousand a year youd make more if you put it in the bank and earned passbook interest she flung a money magazine down on the table theres an article on profitable businesses funeral homes are number one i dont want a funeral home quit being so damn pigheaded at least in the bank the moneys insured youre willing to risk it all mrs langdell showed me the books theyve been profitable for fifteen years he grew ominously quiet so youve talked to her about it already before you came to me after a moment she confessed that she had dont you think you mightve asked first i didnt commit myself you havent even got your hands on the money yet and youre pretty fucking eager to throw it away its my familys money owen most scripts of domestic confrontation would call for a little parrying at this point your money your money i supported you when the teachers went on strike when you lost your big bank client two years ago it was my salarya teachers salarythat got us through im doing all the estate legal work for free all those months when we couldnt pay the light bill because you joined the country club but owen had done then what owen did best he closed his mouth and walked away he grabbed his old pump rifle and walked out into the woods to plink cans and hunt squirrels and rabbits for several hours lis was left alone with the distant pops of gunshots and the memory of the coldness in his eyes when hed walked out the door and for several hours she wondered if shed lost her husband yet when he returned he was calm the last he said about the nursery was id counsel against it but if you want to go ahead anyway ill represent you shed thanked him but it was several days before his moodiness vanished tonight lis started to tell her sister some of owens concerns but portia wasnt interested she simply shook her head i dont think so after a moment lis asked why im not ready to leave the city yet you wouldnt have to id do the daytoday things wed get together a couple times a month you could come out here or i could go into the city i really need some time off think about it at least please lis exclaimed breathlessly to her sisters face pale and obscure in the darkness no lis im sorry angry and hurt lis picked up a large sandbag and tossed it onto the edge of the levee she misjudged the distance though and it tumbled into the lake shit she cried trying to retrieve the bag but it had slipped deep beneath the surface portia spun some strands of hair once more lis stood several waves splashed loudly at their feet before lis asked whats the real reason lis what if i said i didnt want to buy a nursery what if i was all hot for a boutique on madison avenue portias mouth tightened but lis persisted what if i said lets start a business where you and i travel around europe and try out restaurants or rate châteaux what if i said lets start a windsurfing school lis please goddamn it is it because of indian leap tell me portia spun to face her oh jesus lis she said nothing more the surface of the lake grew light suddenly as a huge flash bile green filled the western horizon it vanished behind a slab of thick clouds lis finally said weve never talked about it for six months we havent said a word it just sits there between us we better finish up here portia seized her shovel that was some mean sonofabitch lightning and it wasnt that far away please lis whispered a groan filled the night and they turned to see the boathouse slide completely off the pilings and into the water portia said nothing more and started shoveling once again listening to the chunk of the sandbags filling lis remained near the shore gazing out over the lake as the boathouse sank a vague white form appeared in the trees behind it for a moment lis was sure that it was an elderly woman limping slowly toward the lake lis blinked and stepped closer to shore the womans gait suggested she was ill and in pain then like the boathouse the apparition eased off the shore and into the water where it sank beneath the still onyx surface a piece of canvas tied to a cleat on the frame or a sixmil plastic tarp lis supposed not a woman at all not a ghost shed just imagined it of course the night abraham lincoln died after spending many hours with a horrid wound in the thick mass of sweatdamp hair the moon that blossomed out of the clouds in the eastern part of the united states was blood red this freak occurrence michael hrubek had read was verified by several different sources one of whom was a farmer in illinois standing in a freshly planted cornfield april this man looked up into the radiant evening sky saw the crimson moon and took off his straw hat out of respect because he knew that a thousand miles away a great life was gone there was no moon visible tonight the sky was overcast and turbulent as hrubek bicycled unsteadily west along route it was a painstaking journey he was now accustomed to the mountain bike and was riding as confidently as a tour de france racer still whenever a crown of light shone over the road before him or behind he stopped and vaulted to the ground hed lie under cover of brush or tree until the vehicle passed then would leap onto his bike once again his hammish legs pedaling fast in low gear he didnt know how to upshift a flash of light startled him he looked across a field and saw a police car patrolling slowly shining a spotlight on a darkened farmhouse the light clicked out and the car continued east away from hrubek his anxiety notched up a few degrees as he pedaled on and he found himself thinking of his first runin with the police michael hrubek had been twenty years old and the arrest was for rape the young man had been attending a private college in upstate new york an area pretty enough at the height of a vibrant summer but for most of the year as bleak as the depressed economy in the small city and fields surrounding the campus during his first semester michael had been reclusive and fidgety but hed done well in his studies especially in his two courses in american history between thanksgiving and christmas however he grew increasingly anxious his concentration was poor and he seemed unable to make even the simplest decisionswhich class assignment to do first when to go to lunch whether it was better to brush his teeth before he urinated or after he spent hour after hour staring out the window of his room he was then nearly as large as he was now with long curly hair neanderthal eyebrows grown together and a round face that paradoxically seemed kind as long as he didnt smile or laugh when he did his expressionin fact usually one of bewildermentappeared to be pure malice he had no friends michael was therefore surprised one gray march sunday to hear a knock on his door he hadnt showered for several weeks and had been wearing the same jeans and shirt for nearly a month no one could remember he least of all when he had last cleaned the room his roommate had long ago escaped to a girlfriends apartment a desertion that delighted michael who was certain that the student had been taking pictures of him while he slept on this sunday hed spent two hours hunched over his desk repeatedly reading t s eliots the love song of j alfred prufrock he found this task was like trying to read a block of wood yo mike who is it the visitors were two studentsjuniors who lived in the dorm michael stood in the open door gazing at them suspiciously they smiled their cleancut smiles and asked how he was doing michael stared at them and said nothing mikey youre working too hard come on we got a party in the rec room have something to eat come on i have to study he whined naw naw come on lets party youre working too totally hard man have something to eat well michael did like to eat he ate three big meals a day and snacked constantly he also tended to acquiesce to peoples requests if he didntif he refused to do what they wantedhis gut erupted with fiery bursts of worry what would they think about him what would they say maybe hey excellent party down so michael reluctantly followed the two young men down the hall toward the dorms common room where a loud party was in progress as they passed a darkened bedroom the juniors paused to let michael precede them they suddenly swiveled and pushed him into the room slamming the door shut and tying it closed michael howled in panic tugging furiously at the knob he stumbled looking unsuccessfully for a light he stormed to the window ripped down the shade and was about to break the glass and jump forty feet to the grass lawn when he noticed the rooms other occupant hed seen her at one or two parties she was an overweight freshman with a round face and curly hair cut very short she had thick ankles and wore a dozen bracelets around her pudgy wrists the girl was passedout drunk lying on the bed skirt up to her waist she wore no panties her hand held a glass that contained the dregs of orange juice and vodka she had apparently regained consciousness long enough to vomit then passed out again michael leaned close and studied her instantly the sight of her genitals his first glimpse of female private anatomy and the smell of liquor and puke sent him into paroxysms of fear he screamed at the insensible girl what are you doing to me then he flung himself into the door again and again the huge noise resounding throughout the dormitory in the hallway outside laughter pealed michael fell back onto the bed hyperventilating claustrophobia clutched him and sweat flowed from every pore a moment later his mind mercifully shut down and his vision went black the next thing he remembered was the cruel grip of two security guards brutally pulling him to his feet the nowconscious girl tugging down her skirt was screaming michaels pants were undone and his limp penis hung out cut and bloodied by the zipper of his trousers michael recalled nothing of what had happened the girl claimed she had just gone to bed having caught the flu shed opened her eyes and found michael spreading her legs and penetrating her violently despite her desperate protests police were called parents notified michael spent the night in jail under the cautious eye of two very uncomfortable deputies unprepared for a prisoner who glared at them and threatened to make them dead fuckers if they didnt bring him a history book from his room the evidence was in conflict although there were traces of three different condom lubricants found in and around the girls vagina michael wasnt wearing a condom when the guards captured him nor were any located in the room the defense lawyers tack was that the girl herself had lifted michaels penis from his jeans and alleged rape rather than admit that shed taken on a succession of students after drinking herself semiconsciousa theory that while politically incorrect might very well have appealed to the jury on the other hand there were several purported witnesses to the crime including the girl herself then too michael had threatened or glared at half the campus at one time or anotherparticularly women but the most damning evidence of all michael hrubek himselfa big scary boy more than twice the girls size whod been caught the prosecutor was only too pleased to point out with his pants down nailing shut his own coffin michael grew incoherent after the incident and began to mutter violent epithets taking the stand in court would have been a disaster the lawyer pled him down to one count of sexual assault and he was given probation on condition that he withdraw from school and voluntarily commit himself to a state hospital near his home where hed undergo a treatment program for violent sex offenders after six months he was discharged from the hospital and returned to his parents home once he was back in westbury reason and madness rapidly began to merge one day the autumn after the rape michael announced to his mother that he wanted to return to college he added im only going to take history they better let me do that oh and i want to become a priest im not going to study anything else no math no english no algebra just fucking forget about it im only going to study history his blearyeyed mother lolling in her unmade bed her blond hair stiff as straw laughed in astonishment at his demands go back to college are you serious look what you did do you know what you did to that girl no michael didnt know what hed done he had no idea all he remembered was some girl lying about him and because of that hed been forced to abandon his precious history classes shes a fucker she lied why cant i go back arent i fashionable enough to go to school well arent i priests are very fashionable someday ill write a history about them they often fuck little boys you know go to your room his mother tearfully shouted and hea man in his twenties a man twice her sizescurried off like a whipped dog often hed whine please i want to go back to school he promised to study hard and become one fucker of a priest to make her happy he said hed wear a crown of thorns on his bloody head and make people rise from their graves jesus wore thorns because he rose from the dead he explained one day to her thats why roses have thorns im going out michael she would cry are you going to run away from me where are you going to algebra class are you going to wear a bra while a priest fucks you his mother left the house she no longer called him her little soldier boy she no longer had nails as red as burning cigarette embers and the masks of her eyes often ran in streaks down the matte skin of her cheeks oh mama what are you wearing take that hat off your head take off that crown all those bloody thorns i dont like that not one bit please im sorry for what i said about you and the soldiers please please please take that off it was an extremely agitated michael hrubek who upon this damp night in november bicycled doggedly down route at twenty miles an hour lost in these hard memorieswhich was why he didnt hear the police car dark and silent until it was within ten feet of the bikes rear wheel the lights and siren burst to life oh god oh god oh god hrubek screamed panic exploded throughout his body a voice came over the loudspeaker jarring as a firecracker you there stop that bicycle and get off a spotlight was trained on the back of hrubeks head john cops he thought agents fbi hrubek coasted to a stop and the deputies stepped from their squad car just climb off that young man hrubek swung awkwardly off the bike the men cautiously approached one whispered hes a mountain hes huge all right there could we see some identification fucking fucker conspirators hrubek thought politely he asked are you federal agents agents one of them chuckled no were just police officers from gunderson step over here sir you have a drivers license hrubek sat down his back to the officers and bowed his head the policemen looked at each other wondering how they might deal with this hrubek upped the ante by crying out im soooo upset he took everything he hit me on the head with a rock look at my hand he held up his scraped palm ive been looking for help they continued forward but stopped a safe distance away somebody attacked you you say are you hurt if you could just let us see some id is it him one asked we just want to see some identification sir a drivers license anything he took my wallet he took everything youve been robbed there were several of them took my wallet and my watch that watch hrubek reported solemnly was a present from my mother if youd watched the roads better you mightve prevented a serious crime im sorry if youve had some misfortune sir could you give us your name and address john w booth is my name didnt think it was that one cop said to the other as if speaking in front of an infant dont recall the notice said hes harmless may be but hes big one cop walked closer to hrubek who rocked and moaned in mournful tears wed appreciate you standing up johnnie just coming over to the car people at the hospitalre worried about you we want to take you back there in a singsong voice he added wouldnt you like to go home get some pie and milk maybe some nice apple pie he stood behind hrubek training his flashlight on the mans empty hands then shining it again on the back of the glossy and somewhat blue head thank you sir you know i would like to be getting back now that you mention it i miss the place hrubek turned and grinned amiably as he reached up very slowly to shake the officers hand the policeman too smiledin curiosity at the young mans sincere gestureand gripped hrubeks meaty fist realizing too late that the madman was intending to break his wrist the bone snapped and shrieking the officer dropped to his knees the flashlight falling onto the ground beside him his partner reached for his gun but hrubek had already trained the stolen colt on him nice try he announced with damp lips that pulled into a wry smile drop that drop that the cop did oh jesus hrubek took the injured cops gun from his holster and tossed it away the man huddled on the ground cradling his wrist look fellow his partner pled youre going to get in nothing but trouble over this hrubek chewed on a fingernail then he looked down at the cops you cant stop me i can do it im going to do it and im going to do it quickly these words rose like a mad battle cry he shook a fist above his head please young man put that gun down the injured policemans voice broke and his eyes and nose dripped pitifully nothing seriouss happened nobodys been really hurt yet hrubek turned a triumphant eye on him he spat out oh nice try john cop but thats where youre wrong everybodys been hurt everybody everybody everybody and its not over yet owen atcheson parked his truck along route next to a large freshly turned field about seven miles west of the high rock overlook where hed located hrubeks nest as anticipated hed found deep indentations of footsteps indicating hrubek was moving parallel to the road from the depth and spacing of the toe prints it was clear he was moving fast running owen stopped at a closed gas station and used the pay phone to call the marsden inn the clerk told him that mrs atcheson and her sister had called and said theyd be delayed some they hadnt checked in yet delayed did they say why no sir they didnt is there any message owen debated he thought of trying to encode a message for her tell her the visitors heading west but shes not to call anyone about it but there was too much risk that the clerk would be suspicious or get the message wrong owen said no ill try them at home but there was no answer at the house just missed them he thought hed call them at the inn later the night was very dark now the cloud cover complete the air growing colder compressing around him he used his flashlight sparingly only when he thought he saw a clue and even then lowering the light almost to the ground before clicking it on to limit the radiation of the light he then moved onbut slowly very slowly every soldier knowsas between the hunter and the hunted the prey has the vastly greater advantage owen fell several times catching his boot on a fence wire or forsythia tendril he went down hard always rolling and absorbing the impact with his shoulder and sides never risking breaking a finger or wrist he saw no more traps only at one point did owen despair the trail vanished completely this happened in a vast grassy field twenty acres square and bordered on all sides with dense woods owen was two hundred yards from route he stood in the center of this field and looked around him the field extended through a break in the long line of rocky hills and offered an easy route south toward train tracks and more populated parts of the county freight trains came through here regularly and it was conceivable that hrubek had leapt onto one or maybe hed simply continued through the notch in the hills south toward boyleston a town that had both amtrak and greyhound stations losing hope owen moved aimlessly through the grass pausing to listen for footsteps and hearing only owls or distant truck horns or the eerie white noise of an expansive autumn night after ten minutes of meandering he noticed a glint coming from a line of trees west of him he headed instinctively toward it at the grove of maples he went into a crouch and moved slowly through a cluster of saplings until he came to a break in the foliage with his gun he pushed aside a bough of dewsoaked hemlock inhaling in surprise as drops of water fell with chill pinpricks on his neck and face walking in slow circles around the old mg owen studied the ground he kicked aside a white animal skull he recognized it instantly as a ferrets there were dozens of footprints and tire prints covering the asphalt and the shoulder some seemed to be hrubeks but they were largely obliterated by people who had been here after him he saw dog prints too and wondered momentarily if the trackers had learned that hrubek was going west but there was evidence of only one animal not the three that hed seen pursuing hrubek from the site of his escape he circled the car again weaving over the shoulder and through the bushes nearby no sign of hrubeks prints in any direction hands on hips he glanced at the car once more this time he noticed the bike rack but then he immediately dismissed the idea that hrubek had stolen a cycle what kind of escapee he reasoned would make a getaway on a bike riding down open highways but wait michael hrubek was a man whose madness had its own logic a bicycle why not owen examined the road around the car and found faint tread marks rather wide oneseither balloon tires or those of a bike ridden by a heavy cyclist he glanced back at the car the carrier rack seemed broken as if the bike had been removed by sheer force owen continued to follow the tread marks at the intersection of this country lane and route he found where the rider had paused perhaps debating which way to go he was not surprised to find beside the tread the clear imprint of hrubeks boot nor was he surprised to find that the rider had decided to turn west the house was little more than a shotgun cabin at the end of a dirtandrock road winding through this scruffy forest the bmw squealed to a stop in a rectangle of mud amid discarded auto parts sheet metal termitechewed firewood and oil drums torchcut as if someone had intended to make a business of manufacturing barbecues but gave up after running out of acetylene or desire richard kohler climbed out of the car and walked to the cabin rubbing his deepset red eyes with a scrawny knuckle he knocked on the screen door no answer though he heard the tinny cluttered sound of a tv from inside he rapped again louder when the door opened he smelled liquor before he smelled wood smoke and there was a lot of wood smoke to smell hello stuart after a long pause the man responded didnt expect to see you guess i mightve raining yet its supposed to be a sonofabitch storm you mind if i come in for a few minutes my girlfriend shes out tonight stuart lowe didnt move from the doorway it wont take long well kohler stepped past the orderly and into the small living room the couch was draped with two blankets and had the appearance of a sickbed it was an odd piece of furniturebamboo frame cushions printed with orange and brown and yellow blotches it reminded kohler poignantly of tahiti where hed gone on his honeymoon and where hed gone after his divorce which had occurred thirtythree months later those two weeks represented his only vacations in the last seven years kohler chose a highbacked chair to sit in the orderly no longer in his regulation blue jumpsuit was now wearing jeans and a tshirt and white socks without shoes his arms were covered with bandages his left eye was blackened and his forehead and cheeks were flecked with small puncture wounds brownstained from betadine he now sat back on the couch and glanced at the blankets as if he were surprised to find the bedclothes sitting out on the tv jackie gleason was screaming in a shrill and thoroughly unpleasant way at audrey meadows lowe muted the program they snag him yet lowe asked glancing at the phone by which he presumably would already have learned if theyd snagged him kohler told him no lowe nodded and laughed vacantly at jackie gleason shaking his fist i want to ask you a few things about what happened kohler asked conversationally not much to tell still howd you hear about it adler wanted it kept quiet ive got my spies kohler said and did not smile what happened uhhum well we seen him and we run after him but it was pretty dark it was damn dark he mustve knowed the lay of the land pretty good and he jumped over this ravine but we fell into it lowe closed his mouth and once more examined the screen on which an automobile commercial now played look at all that writing on there giving all that financing crap who can read that in three seconds thats stupid they do that the room wasnt shabby so much as dim the prints on the walls werent bad seascapes but they were dusky the carpet was gray as were the blankets that lowe was pretending he hadnt been wrapped in five minutes before how you feeling nothing broke sore but not like frank he took the worst of it whatd adler say to you lowe found some serviceable words and submitted them nothing much wanted to know how lowe was feeling where hrubek seemed to be going truth be told he wasnt real happy we dropped the ball in the first place and he got loose across the bottom of the tv screen ran a banner announcing that a tornado had touched down in morristown killing two people the national weather service the streaming type reported had extended the tornado and flashflood warnings until am both men stared at these words intently and both men forgot them almost as soon as the bulletin ended when you found him tonight did michael say anything cant hardly recall i think something about us wearing clothes and him not maybe something else i dont know i was never so scared in my life kohler said frank jessup was telling me about michaels meds frank knows about that i didnt think he did wait maybe i mentioned it to him the doctor nodded at the screen art carneys my favorite hes a funny one sure is i like alice she knows what shes about frank wasnt sure how long michaeld been cheeking them he said two days two lowe shook his head whered he hear that try five i think they want to keep it quiet lowe began to relax thats what adler told me its not my business i mean with the comfort vanished instantly and kohler noticed lowes hand seeking the satin strip on the blanket beside him and i just spilled the beans didnt i oh fuck he spat out bitterly discouraged at how easily his mind had been picked i had to know stu im his doctor its my job to know and its my job period and im gonna lose it shit whyd you trick me kohler wasnt giving any thought to lowes employment he felt his skin crackling with shock at this confirmation of his hunch in his last session before the escape yesterday michael hrubek had looked kohler in the eye and had lied about the thorazine hed said he was taking all his meds and the dosage was working well three thousand milligrams and the patient had given it up purposefully and lied about doing so after hed been off the pills for five days and hed lied very well unlike psychopaths schizophrenic patients are rarely duplicitous in such calculating ways youve got to come clean stu hrubeks a time bomb i dont think adler understands that or if he does he doesnt much care kohler added soothingly you know michael better than most of the doctors at marsden youve got to help me i got to keep my job is what ive got to do im making twentyone thousand a year and spending twentytwo adlerll have my nuts for what i told you already ron adler isnt god im not saying anything else okay stuart you gonna help me or do i have to make some phone calls fuck a can of beer flew from the big hand into the gray wall and with a spray of foam fell gushing onto the dingy shag carpet it was suddenly vitally important for stuart lowe to tend the embers of his fire he leapt up and pitched three fresh logs onto the heap of the dying flames a gorgeous cascade of orange sparks bounced to the hearth lowe returned to the couch and said nothing for a moment kohler believed this meant that he accepted the terms of the agreement which was of course no agreement at all the signal of surrender was the soft pop as the tv was shut off did he stockpile all the thorazine or flush it you have any idea we found it he stockpiled it how much lowe said resignedly five full days thirtytwo hundred a day thisll be the sixth when you saw him tonight was there any indication of what he had in mind he was just standing there in the buff looking at us like he was surprised but he wasnt surprised at all what do you mean nothing lowe spat out i dont mean a fucking thing tell me what he said exactly didnt frank tell you you already talked to him he looked at kohler bitterly to see if he had been as big a fool as he thought the doctor had no choice but to oblige franks still recovering from surgery he wont be conscious till morning jesus christ what did michael say come on stu something about a death he had a death to go to i dont know maybe he meant a funeral or graveyard i was pretty shook you know i was trying to fight him off frank kohler didnt respond and the orderly continued with those rubber things they give us the truncheons i tried i was trying to get him upside the head but he dont feel no pain you know that thats one thing about michael kohler agreed observing what a sorrowful liar lowe was and feeling pity for this man whod obviously abandoned his partner to die a terrible death thats all i heard then michael grabbed away the club and come after me now tell me what adler really said to you lowe exhaled air through puffedout cheeks he finally said i wasnt supposed to say nothing about the meds to nobody and he wanted to know if michaeld said anything about that lady in ridgeton he sent her a note or something what lady some broad at his trial i dont know adler asked me if michaeld ever mentioned her did he not to me he didnt what about this note i dont know nothing about it adler said to keep quiet about that too when did he send it to her how the fuck should i know whats this womans name youre going to ruin me arent you i didnt get your patient back and youre going to fuck me over why dont you just admit it whats her name stu liz something wait liz atcheson i think is there anything else you can tell me no lowe blurted so quickly all kohler could do was fill the ensuing silence with his serene unyielding gaze the orderly finally said miserably well the wire wire i told adler and grimes and they made me swear i wouldnt say anything oh jesus what a time ive had kohler didnt move his red stinging eyes gazed at lowe who said sotto voce as if ronald adler were making this a threesome we didnt fall tell me stu tell me we couldve jumped over that ravine easy but michael strung a trip wire for us he knew we were coming strung a piece of fishline or bell wire and led us over it kohler was dumbfounded what are you saying what am i saying lowe blurted furiously arent you listening arent you listening im saying your patient may be off his brain candy and may be a schizo but he was fucking clever enough to lead us into a trap and he damn near killed both of us the orderly sealed his testimony by clicking the television back on and slouched into the couch refusing to say anything more passing over the gunderson town line trenton heck braked deftly with his left foot as he skidded around a deer that stepped into the road and stopped to see what a collision with a oneton pickup might do to her he eased back into the right lane and continued caroming down route he was driving like a teenager and he knew it even taking the extreme measure of strapping a very unhappy emil into the passenger seat with the blue canvas seat belt which the hound immediately began to chew through behind the truck swirled a wake of dust and bleached autumn leaves stop heck barked over the roar of the engine knowing that dont chew let alone leave that seatbelt be would register in emils mind as mere human grunts worth ignoring the familiar command was pointless however and heck let the matter go good fellow heck said in a rare moment of sentiment and reached over to scratch the big head which slipped away in irritation damn he muttered im doing it again he realized that the hounds evasive maneuver reminded him of the way jill had dodged away from his embrace the day after shed served him with papers got to stop thinking about that girl he now ordered but of course he didnt mental cruelty and abandonment heck had read after the process server left he hadnt even comprehended at first what these documents were abandonment he thought they meant jill herself was being sued for leaving the scene of an accident she was a terrible driver then like a firecracker going off inside him he understood heck had been little good for anything for the month after that it seemed that all he did was work with emil and spend hours debating the separation with jillor rather with jills picture since by then shed moved out sitting on the bed where theyd romped so friskily he tried to recall her arguments it seemed that he hadnt upheld his end of a vague bargain that had been made the morning following one particularly romantic playful night their seventh date at sunrise hed found her plowing through his kitchen cabinets looking for the bisquick mix and hed interrupted the frenzied search to blurt a proposal jill had squealed and in her eagerness to hug him dropped a bag of flour it detonated with a large white mushroom cloud with happiness in her eyes and a littlegirl pout on her lips she cried talking at curious length about the home that had been denied her all her life the marriage had been a stormy union heck was the first to admit when you were on jills side heavens gate opened up and she rained her good nature on you and if you were her man there were plenty of other rewards but if you didnt share her opinion orgood luckif you opposed her then the flesh over her cheekbones tightened and her tongue somehow contracted and she commenced to take you down trenton heck in fact had not been all that certain about getting married unreasonably he was disappointed at having a fiancée with one syllable in her name and when jill grew angryhe couldnt always predict when this would happenshe became a tiny fireball her eyebrows knit and her voice grew husky like the tone he believed hookers took when confronting obnoxious clients she would mope aggressively if he said they couldnt afford a pair of highheeled green shoes dusted with sequins or a microwave with a revolving carousel youre icky to me trenton and i dont like it one bit jill honey baby but the fact remained that she was a woman whod leap into his arms at unexpected times even at the mall and kiss his ear wetly she would smile with her entire face when he came home and talk nonstop about some silliness in a way that made the whole evening seem to him like good crystal and silver and he could never forget the way shed wake suddenly in the middle of the night roll over on top of him and drive her head into his collarbone humping with so much energy that he fought hard not to move for fear it would be over too fast slowly though the pouts began to outnumber the smiles and humps the money which was like a lubricant between their spirits grew sparse when he was denied a raise and the mortgage on the trailer was adjusted upward heck began to like jills waitress friends and their husbands less and less there was much drinking in that group and more silliness than seemed normal for people in their thirties these were clues and he supposed hed been aware of them all along but when he finally understood that she really meant mental cruelty and abandonmenthis mental cruelty and his abandonmentit knocked the wind clean out of him exactly twentytwo months ago at ninefortyeight one saturday night jill let slam the aluminum door of their trailer for the last time and went to live by herself in dillon the ultimate insult was that she moved into a mobilehome park why didnt you just stay with me he blurted i thought you left because you wanted a house oh trent she moaned hopelessly you dont understand nothing do you not a thing well youre in a trailer park for gods sake trent whatd i say so jill left to live in a mobile home somehow better than the one that trenton heck could offer her and once there he supposed entertain men friends billy mosler hecks truckdriving buddy from next door seemed relieved at the breakup trenton she wasnt for you im not going to say anything bad about jill because thats not my way watch it you prick heck thought eyeing his friend belligerently but she was too dippy for you bad choice in a woman dont look at me that way you can do better but i loved her heck said his anger sadly tamed by a memory of jill making him a lunch of egg salad one autumn afternoon oh damn im whining arent i damn you didnt love her billy mosler said sagely you were in love with her or in lust with her more like see the difference watch it prick heck recovered enough to begin glaring once more the worst of the sting wore off after a few months though still he mourned he drove past her restaurant a hundred times and would call her often to talk to her about the few things they could still talk about which was not much many times he got her answering machine what the hell does a waitress need an answering machine for he brooded except to take mens phone calls he grew despairing when the machine picked up on the second ring which meant that someone had called before him heck saw his exwife all over the county at kmart at picnics driving in cars he didnt recognize in jojos steakhouse in liquorstore parking lots as she hiked her skirt up to adjust her slip rolled at the waist to compensate for her being four foot eleven there werent this many jills in the universe but trenton heck saw them just the same tonight his exwife fading very reluctantly from his mind heck turned off the highway emil stirred with relief as the truck braked to a fast stop and the evil seat belt came off his master then hooked up the harness and track line and together they bounded off down the road emil easily picked up hrubeks scent and trotted down the highway mimicking more or less the bicycles passage because they were on the asphalt with good visibility heck saw no need to keep the hound shortlined hrubek wouldnt be setting traps on the surface of the road they made good time coursing past abandoned shacks and farms and lowlands and pumpkin fields still after passing two intersectionsand verifying that the madman was continuing west on route heck ordered emil back to the truck because of the bicycle which hrubek could pedal at fifteen or twenty miles an hour heck continued to droptrackdriving for several miles then stopping just long enough to let emil make sure they were still on scent for a diligent dog like emil to follow a bicyclist was certainly possibleespecially on a damp night like thisbut doing so would exhaust him quickly then too heck with his damaged leg was hardly up for a twentymile run after a man on wheels as he drove scanning the road before him for a bicycle reflector or hrubeks back trenton heck thought about the meeting with richard kohler he recalled the doctors slight scowl when heck had rejected his offer this reinforced hecks fear that maybe hed blown it bad that hed chosen exactly the opposite from what a smart person wouldve picked he often had trouble choosing the sensible thing the thing everybody else just knew was best the thing that both jill and his father would appraise and say damn good choice boy he supposed in some ways it was crazy to turn down that money but when he actually pictured taking the check folding it up going homeno no he just couldnt have done it maybe god hadnt made him like emil doling out to him a singular remarkable knack but trenton heck felt in his heart that if he had any purpose at all it was to spend his hours tracking behind his dog through wilderness just like this even if he never found hrubek tonight even if he never caught a glimpse of him being here had to be better than sitting in front of the tube with a quart of beer in his hand and emil fidgeting on the back deck what troubled heck more than turning down kohlers offer was altogether different maybe something more dangerous if it was really his goal to catch hrubek before he hurt someone then why didnt he just call don haversham and tell him that hrubek had changed direction heck was in gunderson now and would be coming up on cloverton soon both towns had police departments and despite the storm probably a few men to spare for a roadblock calling haversham he thought was the prudent thing to do the proper procedure it promised the least risk to everyone but of course if the local police or troopers caught hrubek adler would surely balk at paying heck the ten thousand so steeped in guilt and uneasiness heck pressed the stiff accelerator with his left foot and continued after his prey speeding west in secret and under cover of the nightjust like he laughed grimly michael hrubek himself he was twentytwo miles from ridgeton when the idea of an automobile slipped into his mind and rooted there a card be so much nicer than a bicycle so much more fashionable hrubek had mastered pedaling and now found the bike a frustrating way to travel it flicked sideways when it hit rocks and there were long stretches of inclines that required him to ride so slowly that he could have walked faster his teeth ached from the air he sucked into his lungs with the effort of lowgear pedaling when he hit a bump the heavy animal traps bounced and jabbed him in the kidney but more than anger at the bike hrubek simply felt the desire for a car he believed he had the confidence to drive hed fooled the orderlies and whipped the cops and tricked all the fucker conspirators who were after him and now he wanted a car he recalled the time hed pumped a tank of gas for dr anne when shed driven hrubek and several other patients to a bookstore in a mall near trevor hill psychiatric hospital knowingand compulsively recitingthe statistics on auto fatalities on american highways he was terrified at the thought of the drive but reluctantly agreed to go along the psychiatrist asked him to sit in the front seat when they stopped at the gas station she asked michael will you help me fill up the tank noooo please not on your life its not safe and its not fashionable lets do it together who knows what comes out of those pumps come on michael get out of the car nice try but he did itopening the tank door unscrewing the lid turning on the pump squeezing the nozzle handle dr anne thanked hrubek for his help and glowing with pride he climbed back into the front seat snapping his belt on without her telling him to do so on their next outing she let him drive the gray mercedes through the hospital parking lot arousing the envy of the patients and the amusementand aweof several doctors and nurses yep he now decided the bikes got to go he coasted to the bottom of a long hill where he stopped at a darkened gas station its windows spattered with mud and grease what had caught his interest was an old limegreen datsun parked beside the air pump hrubek climbed off the bicycle the cars door was unlocked he sat in the drivers seat smelling oil and mold he practiced driving he was very tense at first then relaxed and gradually remembered what he knew about cars he moved the steering wheel he put the gearshift lever in d he practiced pushing the accelerator and the brake he looked down at the wheel pedestal and saw a key in the ignition he turned it silence he climbed out he supposed the car might need a battery or maybe gasoline he opened the hood and found that what the car needed however was an engine some fucker had stolen it he observed and slammed the hood closed cant trust anybody hrubek walked to the front of the store and looked in a soda machine a snack machine a wire tray holding boxes of doughnuts and pastries twinkies he liked twinkies he muttered a line he had once heard on tv a wholesome snack repeating this phrase over and over he walked to the back of the station be smart he whispered use the back door he hoped there was an engine lying around inside could he install it himself in the green car he wondered you probably just plugged them into the engine compartment hrubek knew all about plugs because the electrical appliances in his parents house contained listening devices or cameras michael had settled into the daily routine of unplugging them every morning the vcr in the hrubek household was perpetually flashing he strode to the back door of the gas station and knocked out the glass in the window then undid the dead bolt he walked inside and perused the place he found no readytomount auto engines which was an immense disappointment though this setback was largely mitigated by the doughnuts on the rack by the door he immediately ate an entire package and put another in his backpack taste that beats the others cold promised the torn and faded poster taped to the ancient pepsi machine in the front of the store he easily ripped open its door and pulled out two bottles of soda he had forgotten all about glass containersin mental hospitals you get soda in plastic cups or not at all he popped the cap off with his teeth and sitting down he began to drink in five minutes the parking lot outside turned silver then white this attracted hrubeks attention and he rose walking to the greasy glass to determine the source of the light a glistening metallicblue x truck pulled into the driveway the door opened and the driver climbed out she was a pretty woman with frothy blond hair to a phone pole beside the air pump she taped a poster advertising a church auction to be held tomorrow night will they auction their memorabilia hrubek whispered will they sell their memorylabia will the priest stick his finger in your pussy he glanced inside the truck the womans passenger was a teenage girl her daughter it seemed he continued speaking now in a conversational tone addressing the girl oh youre very beautiful do you like algebra are you wearing one over your tits did you know that ninetynine percent of schizophrenics have big cocks the cock crowed when jesus got betrayedjust like eve say is the priest going to stick his snake in you you may know that as a serpent the driver returned to the truck oh she looks beautiful hrubek thought and couldnt decide whom he liked best mother or daughter the x turned back onto the highway and a moment later pulled into a driveway or side road a hundred yards west on route it vanished he stood for a long moment at the window then blew hot breath onto the cold glass in front of him leaving a large white circle of condensation in the center of which he drew a very good likeness of an apple complete with leaves and stem and pierced by what appeared to be a wormhole their maginot line four feet high was starkly illuminated by another sudden flash of distant lightning the women both exhausted stepped back from their handiwork as they waited for thunder that never sounded portia said we oughta break a bottle of champagne over it she leaned heavily on the shovel might not hold fucking well better the water in the culvert leading to the dam was already six inches high lets finish taping the greenhouse and get out of here they stowed the tools and lis pulled a battered tarp over the depleted pile of sand she still felt hurt by portias rebuff earlier but as they strolled back to the house like two oil workers at days end lis nonetheless had a sudden urge to put her arm around her sisters shoulders yet she hesitated she could picture the contact but not the effect and that was enough to stop the gesture lis recalled bussing cheeks with relatives on holidays she recalled handshakes she recalled palms on buttocks that was the extent of physical contact in the lauberget family lis heard a clatter not far away the wind had pushed over a set of aluminum beach chairs beside the garage she told her sister she was going to put them away and started down the hill portia headed up to the house pausing in the driveway lis felt a sharp gust of windan outrider of the storm ripples swept across the surface of the lake and a corner of the tarp covering the sand snapped like a gunshot then calm returned as if the breeze were a shiver passing through a body in the silence that followed she heard the car the tires crunched on the glistening white stone chips that she and owen had spread in the driveway last summer during a heat spell shed feared then for their hearts under the scalding sun and insisted that they finish the job after dusk lis atcheson knew that the visitor tonight was driving over fragments of premium marble from a quarry somewhere in new england but for some reason the thought came to her that the sound was of wheels on crushed bone and once there the horrid image would not leave the car moved urgently through the stand of pines through which the serpentine driveway ran it pulled into the parking area paused then headed toward her blinded by the beams she couldnt identify the vehicle which stopped a dozen yards away lis stood with arms crossed her feet separated frozen like a schoolgirl playing statue for a long moment neither she nor the driver moved she faced the car whose engine was still running lights on finally before uneasiness became fear she cleared her throat and walked forward into piercing shafts of white light they havent caught him yet lis motioned with her hand toward the back door and richard kohler preceded her into the kitchen no im afraid not he stepped to the counter and set a small backpack on the butcher block he seemed quite possessive about it his thin face was alarmingly pale lis theres a car portia walked into the doorway and paused glancing at kohler lis introduced them portia kohler repeated dont hear that name much nowadays she shrugged and neither sister said a word about the burdens of being the daughter of a man utterly devoted to the business of fortified wine im going to tape the west windows in the parlor thats where itll hit worst youre right we forgot to do those thanks when she left lis turned to the doctor i dont have much time as soon as were finished here were going to a hotel for the evening she added pointedly because of hrubek it was the moment when hed tell her there was nothing to worry about the moment when hed laugh and say that his patient was harmless as a puppy he didnt what he said was thats probably not a bad idea on the other hand he didnt seem particularly alarmed or suggest that they get the hell out of the house immediately and flee for safety do they know where he is not exactly no but he is going away from here east i saw one of the men tracking him not too long ago hes still east of the hospital but it looks like he may have gone east and then turned around hes coming west id say hes more likely wandering in circles he isnt as disabled as some people are making him out to be but i dont think hed be able to get this far what exactly can i do for you doctor id like to be out of here in twenty minutes or so im worried about michael id like to find him before the police do not many people know how to handle a patient like him he could hurt himself or somebody else if they try to arrest him like any other prisoner well what can i do i understand he sent you a letter not long ago in september it had to do with the incident last may it doesnt seem to have to do with anything its mostly gibberish kohler lifted his eyes but not his head and stared directly at her mrs atcheson i need to know about indian leap will you help me six large water spots were evident on the counter beside the sink lis lifted a sponge and rubbed them away you see im michaels attending psychiatrist but i frankly dont have a clue about whats going on in his mind tonight what happened last may was very significant in his life significant she repeated appalled at the word i dont mean to downplay the tragedy well what exactly can i tell you ive read some newspaper stories i have a few files but marsden hospitals practically broke we have very sketchy records i dont even have a transcript of his trial this struck her as the epitome of bureaucratic nonsense and she said so transcripts cost two dollars a page he explained michaels would have cost six thousand dollars the state cant afford it it seems to be just common sense to spend money like that he gestured in concession i really dont think theres time she nodded outside my sister and i have hotel reservations and the storm it wont take long he curled two fingers of his right hand around two fingers of his left and lis pictured the gangly teenage richard kohler asking a pretty girl to dance the fact is id rather not talk about it yes of course kohler hesitated and seemed to be examining her but you have to understand my perspective its important that i find him quickly if he wanders up to someones house if he gets scared and panics people could get hurt inadvertently lis stood silent looking down at the ruddy tile floor thats what im concerned about you see getting him back before theres an accident and i have to tell you there is a chance hes on his way here very slight but it is a possibility if you help me i might be able to prevent that after a long moment lis said cream and sugar kohler blinked youve glanced at the coffeemaker three times in the last minute he laughed ive been trying my best to stay awake ill give you twenty minutes doctor not a minute more thank you very much he said sincerely she stepped to the cupboard hope its no trouble his eyes were hungrily fixed to the can of maxwell house can i ask a question please could you fall asleep now lis asked i beg your pardon if you were home now would you be able to fall asleep at home yes in my car yes on your front lawn on your kitchen floor anytime anyplace she wagged her head at this miracle and watched the pot fill with black liquid impulsively she decided to have a cup too i wont be asleep before eleven tomorrow night whatever happens tonight insomnia he asked a condition on which she was an expert she explained warm milk hot baths cold showers hypnosis selfhypnosis valerian roots biofeedback medication you name it ive tried it in my practice i work with patients dreams a lot but ive never done much with sleep disorders she doctored her coffee with milk kohler took his black lets go in here she said with their thin mugs of steaming coffee in hand they walked into the greenhouse at the far end of which was an alcove as they sat in the deep wroughtiron chairs the doctor looked about the room and offered a compliment which because it had to do only with square footage and neatness meant he knew nothing of and cared little for flowers he sat with his legs together body forward making his thin form that much thinner he took loud sips and she knew he was a man accustomed to dining quickly and alone then he set the cup down and took a pad and gold pen from his jacket pocket lis asked then you have no idea where hes going tonight no he may not either not consciously thats the thing about michaelyou cant take him literally to understand him you have to look behind what he says that note he sent you for instance were certain letters capitalized yes that was one of the eeriest things about it michael does that he sees relationships between things that to us dont exist could i see it she found it in the kitchen and returned to the greenhouse kohler was standing holding a small ceramic picture frame your father im told theres a resemblance some yes eyes and chin he was id guess a professor more of a closet scholar the picture had been taken two days after hed returned from jerez and andrew lauberget was shown here climbing into the front seat of the cadillac for the drive back to the airport young lis had clicked the shutter as she stood shaded by her mothers protruding belly inside of which her sister floated oblivious to the tearful farewell he was a businessman but he really wanted to teach he talked about it many times he wouldve made a brilliant scholar are you a professor teacher sophomore english and you she asked i understand medicine runs in the genes oh it does my father was a doctor kohler laughed of course he wanted me to be an art historian that was his dream then he grudgingly consented to medical school on condition that i study surgery but that wasnt for you nope all i wanted was to be a psychiatrist fought him tooth and nail he said if you become a shrink itll chew you up make you miserable make you crazy and kill you so lis said he was a psychiatrist that he was did it kill him nope he retired to florida about which i wont comment she said he smiled lis added why hows that why psychiatry i wanted to work with schizophrenics id think youd make more money putting rich people on the couch whyd you specialize in that he smiled again actually it was my mothers illness say is that the letter there he took it in his short feminine fingers and read it quickly she could detect no reaction look at this they are holding me and have told lies about me to washington and the entire world see what hes really saying no im afraid i dont look at the capitalized letters i am so tired the encoded message sent a chill through her there are a lot of layers of meaning in michaels world revenge contains the name eve he scanned the paper carefully revenge eve betrayal he shook his head then set the letter aside and turned his hard eyes on her she suddenly grew ill at ease and when he said tell me about indian leap a full minute passed before she began to speak heading northeast from ridgeton route winds slowly through the best and the worst parts of the state picturesque dairy and horse farms then small but splendid patches of hardwood forests then finally a cluster of tired midsize towns studded with abandoned factories that the banks and receivers cant give away just past one of these failed cities pickford is a fivehundredacre sprawl of rock bluffs and pine forest indian leap state park is bisected by a lazy sshaped canyon which extends for half a mile from the parking lot off to rocky point beach a deceptive name for whats nothing more than a bleak rock revetment on a gray manmade lake about one mile by two in size rising from the forest not far from the beach is what the state park service still overly generous calls a peak though its really just a flattopped summit six hundred feet high these rocks have their ghosts in a small band of mohegans trapped on the side of this mountain jumped to their deaths rather than be captured by rival pequots the women flung their screaming children before them then leapt to the rocks below with their men lis could still recall in perfect detail the bad earnest illustration in her fifthgrade textbook of a squaw looking more like veronica lake than a princess of the mohican confederacy reaching for her tearful child as they were about to sail into the air the first time shed come here a skinny wan girl lis walked these trails close to tears thinking of the sorrowwhole families flying through the air even now thirty years later sitting across from kohler she felt the chill horror the story had evoked in her childhood six months ago on may the atchesons and the gillespiesa couple they knew from the country clubplanned a picnic at indian leap accompanying them were portia and a former student of liss claire sutherland the morning of the outingit was a sundayhad begun awkwardly just as lis and owen were about to leave he got a call from his firm and learned that he had to go into the office for several hours lis was used to his zealots schedule but was irritated that he acquiesced today hed worked almost every sunday since early spring the couple fought about itgenteelly at first then more angrily owen prevailed though he promised hed meet them at the park no later than onethirty or two i didnt realize until later how lucky it was that he won that argument she told kohler softly if he hadnt gone into work its funny how fate works she continued with her story portia claire and lis rode with dorothy and robert gillespie in their land cruiser it was a pleasant twohour drive to the park but as soon as they arrived lis began to feel uneasy as if they were being watched walking to the lodge house to use the phone she believed she saw in a distant cluster of bushes someone looking at her because she had the impression that there was something of recognition in the face which she took to be a mans she believed for an instant that it was owen whod changed his mind and decided not to work after all but the face vanished into the bushes and when she called her husbands office he answered the phone you havent left yet she asked disappointed it was then noon he wouldnt be there before two fifteen minutes ill be on my way he announced are you there yet we just got here im at the gift store ohowen laughedget me one of those little pine outhouses ill give it to charlie for making me come in today she was irritated but agreed to and they hung up lis went into the store to buy the souvenir when she stepped outside a moment later and rejoined the others at the entrance to the park she glanced over her shoulder she believed she saw the man staring again studying the five of them she was so startled she dropped the wooden outhouse when she picked it up and looked back again whoever it might have been was gone kohler asked her about the others on the picnic robert and dorothy we met them at the club about a year ago the foursome had coincidentally picked adjacent poolside tables they became friends by default being about the only childless couples over thirty in the place this mutual freedom broke the ice and they gradually got to know one another owen and lis were initially no match socially for their friends not yet inheritors of the lauberget fortune the atchesons lived in a small splitlevel in hanbury a grim industrial town ten miles west of ridgeton in fact the countryclub membership itself which owen had insisted on so that he might court potential clients was far too expensive for them and many nights theyd eaten sandwiches or soup for dinner because they had virtually no cash in the bank robert on the other hand made buckets of money selling hotel communications systems owen a lawyer in a small firm with small clients masked his chagrin under careful smiles but lis could see bitter jealousy when the gillespies pulled up in front of the atchesons tacky house in roberts new forestgreen jag or dorothys merc there was the matter of temperament too robert had lived in pacific heights and on michigan avenue and spent several years in europe no no i kid you not it was tourette sur loup ever hear of it a medieval city in the mountains northwest of nice and what do we find in the town square a crossdressing festival really tell em dot he seemed ten years younger than his fortyone and you couldnt help but feel the tug of his boyish enthusiasm with robert all the world was a sales prospect and you willingly let yourself be hawked owen had more substance but he was quiet and had his temper too he didnt like taking second place to a handsome wealthy charmer who resembled jfk in both appearance and charisma but then last march when ruth died the atchesons became wealthy this had little effect on lis whod grown up with money but it transformed owen for her part lis too had felt some reservations about the foursome her discomfort though lay mostly with dorothy dorothy with the voice of a highschool cheerleader with the perfect figureand the clothes to showcase it with a round middle eastern face and dark eyes always flawlessly made up lis could honestly say though that she felt more pique than jealousy it was mostly dorothys fawning that irritated her the way shed stop whatever she was doing to run errands for her husband or errands she thought hed want done robert seemed embarrassed by this excessive obeisance which always seemed puton calculated and lis silently played the womans game of spouse sniping concluding that what robert really needed in a mate was a partner not this little geisha even one decked out with worldclass boobs yet when it was clear that theyd never be close friends the reservations lis felt about the woman faded she grew more tolerant and even asked for dorothys advice on makeup and clothes about which she was a generous wellspring of data they never became sisterly but dorothy was someone to whom lis could confide sins down to say the fourth level of hell it had been dorothy lis recalled whod heard that the weather the next sunday was supposed to be particularly beautiful and had suggested the picnic and who was claire eighteen years old the girl had been in liss english class her sophomore year she was intensely shy with a pale heartshaped face she was somebody lis explained you hoped wouldnt become too beautiful because it seemed there was no way she could handle the attention but beautiful she was seeing her on the first day of class several years ago lis was struck immediately by the girls ethereal face still eyes and long delicate fingers teachers peg students instantly and lis had felt an immediate fondness for claire shed made an effort to stay in touch as the girl made her way through her junior then senior years lis rarely singled out any youngsters from school only on one or two other occasions had she maintained relationships with students or former students outside of class she generally kept her distance aware of the power she had over these young people when she wore lightcolored blouses she noticed boys eyes lose control and dart across her chest while their cheeks grew red and their penises she supposed irrepressibly hard the shy or unattractive girls worshipped her those in the inner clique were disdaining and jealousfor no reason other than that lis was a woman and they were not quite she handled all of these feelings with consummate dignity and care and usually kept home and classroom absolutely separate but she made an exception for claire the girls mother was a drunk and the womans boyfriend had served time for sexual abuse of a stepchild in a prior marriage when lis learned claires history she began letting the girl into her life in small waysoccasionally asking her to help in her greenhouse or to attend sundayafternoon brunches lis knew this attraction to the girl had an enigmatic almost a dangerous sidethe time for instance that claire had stayed after class to discuss a book report lis noticed a tangle in the girls shimmery blond strands and with her own brush began working it out suddenly she realized teacherstudent contact with the door closed lis virtually leapt from her chair away from the startled girl and vowed to be more circumspect still over the past two years theyd seen each other often and when claire mentioned wistfully on the friday before the picnic that her mother would be away all sunday lis didnt hesitate to invite her along that may the picnickers set up camp on rocky point beach portia left immediately for a runan improvised k through the winding canyons she runs marathons lis told kohler so do i the doctor said lis laughed astonished as ever that people actually engaged in this sport for fun we sat on the beach for a while dorothy robert claire and i watching the boats you know just chatting and drinking soda and beer they had been there for about a half hour when dorothy and robert began to argue dorothy had left liss book in the truck hamlet she explained shed been preparing for final exams and had carted along a wellread and annotated volume i had my hands full with picnic things and dorothy said shed get the book but it had slipped her mind lis had told her not to worry she wasnt in the mood to work anyway but robert leapt up and said hed get it then dorothy made some sour comment about his doing anything for anybody in a skirt it was supposed to be a joke lis supposed but it fell flatsince shed managed to insult both lis and robert at the same time robert asked her what she meant by that dorothy waved her hand and said just go get the fucking book why dont you something like that then she told him he ought to jog all the way to the parking lot work off some of that fat look hes getting tits lis was embarrassed for claires sake robert jogged off angrily and dorothy sullenly returned to her magazine lis had pulled off her shorts and unbuttoned her workshirt beneath which she wore a bikini she lay back on a warm rock and closed her eyes trying not to go to sleep daytime naps are taboo for insomniacs claire with whom robert had struck up an immediate friendship en route to the beach had seemed the most anxious of anyone for him to return after hed been gone a half hour she stood and said she was going to look for him lis had watched the girl as she strolled toward the towering weathered rocks repulsive and fascinating the cliffs seemed hard as polished bone they reminded her of the yellow skull sitting on the lab table in the schools biology classroom lis noticed claire standing in the mouth of the canyon about a quarter mile from the beach then she vanished and i thought suddenly lis told kohler where is everyone whats going on i felt very concerned i picked up my purse and started toward the place where id seen claire disappear then she saw a flash of color ahead of her she believed it was yellow the color of claires shorts and leaving dorothy behind she hurried into the canyon lis was perhaps a hundred yards into the ravine when she found the blood blood it was right outside a cave the entrance had been chained off at one time but the post holding the chain had been pulled out of the ground and flung aside no way she thought was she going inside but she knelt down and looked into the passageway the air was chill and it smelled of wet stone and clay and mold then she felt a shadow over her a huge man appeared just feet away standing behind her michael kohler asked lis nodded hrubek started howling like an animal holding a bloody rock he looked right at her and screamed sic semper tyrannis richard kohler held up a thin hand indicating for her to wait he made his first notation of the evening you didnt think of going to find a park ranger kohler asked lis suddenly grew angry why had he asked her this it was the sort of question the lawyers had asked and the police did i think of looking for a ranger well for gods sake wouldnt we always do it differently if we could wouldnt we recast our whole lives thats why time doesnt reverse of courseto keep us sane i thought about it yes but i dont know i just panicked i ran into the cave inside it wasnt completely dark thirty forty feet above her shafts of pale light streamed inside the walls rose straight up to an arched roof full of stalactites lis breathless and frightened leaned against a wall to steady herself a highpitched moaning of some sort filled the air it was like wind over a reed like someone imitating an oboe terrible she looked at the trail at her feet and saw more blood then hrubek slipped through the cave opening lis turned and raced down the path no idea where she was going not really thinking she simply ran once out of the main chamber she fled down a long corridor about eight feet high hrubek was somewhere behind her as she ran she noticed the tunnel was growing smaller by now it had shrunk to six feet and the sides were closing in once she slammed into a rock cutting her forehead and leaving a scar that still remained by then the chamber had narrowed down to five feet and she was running crouched over then four feet soon she was crawling ahead of her the tunnel grew even smaller though on the other side of a very narrow opening it seemed to widen and grow brighter but escaping that way would mean crawling through a tunnel that was no more than twelve or so inches high with hrubek right behind her the thought of being well exposed to him like that i mean wearing just my swimsuit i couldnt do it i turned to my left and crawled through a larger entrance it was black completely black but she felt cool air circulating and assumed it was a large space she climbed inside feeling her way along the smooth floor looking back she could see the entranceit was slightly lighter than the surrounding walls slowly it darkened then grew less dark again and she heard a hissing sound he was in this small cave with her she lay flat on the ground and bit a finger to keep silent while she sobbed you have no idea what noise is until youve been in a place like that i was sure my heartbeat or the sound of blood in my ears would give me away i think i could hear my own tears falling on the floor of the cave all the while hrubek was shuffling around her he passed her no more than five feet away then he paused and sniffed the air and muttered theres a woman in here i can smell her pussy lis ran she couldnt bear it any longer i scrambled to the opening and turned back down the narrow corridor the way id come that is i thought i did but somehow i took a wrong turn in one sense it was lucky the light was better here and the roof of the cave high she saw discarded cigarettes and beer canswhich led her to believe she was heading toward an exit she kept moving toward the light then i felt a breeze stirring and way up ahead i heard running water i ran toward it as fast as i could then i turned the corner thats where i found the body she gazed through the misty windows into the yard now filled with a blustery wind i didnt recognize it at first there was too much blood robert gillespie lay on the cave floor he was twisted like a rag doll and had a huge gash in his head but he wasnt dead shed taken roberts hand and leaned close urging him to keep breathing shed get help she said but then she heard footsteps ten feet away hrubek stood staring at them he was smiling cynically muttering he was talking lis told kohler about conspirators stumbling backwards lis landed on her purse inside she felt a knife shed packed it for the picnic she explained wrapping it in a paper towel and placing it in her bag so no one would reach blindly into the picnic basket and cut themselves she pulled it out now and ripped the towel away from the bladeit was very sharp a chicago cutlery nine inches long she pointed it at hrubek and told him to keep back but he just kept walking at her saying sic semper tyrannis again and again her nerve broke she dropped the knife and ran that was the knife that he used kohler asked i remember reading that the victim was stabbed as well as beaten sexually mutilated too after a moment lis answered robert was badly hurt but he probably couldve survived according to the evidence at the trial they think he wouldve recovered from the rock blows he died from the stabbing she paused and the mutilation yes hrubek stabbed robert in the groin a number of times only fifty feet away lis found the exit and scrabbled through it she collapsed on the ground and caught her breath then she headed into the canyon but after running only a dozen yards she pulled up with a fierce cramp in her side hrubek was twenty or thirty feet behind her he was saying come here youre a very beautiful woman but whats that on your hair i dont like your hair that way whats that on your head shed gotten some of roberts blood on her hair this upset hrubek he was very angry she supposed that he was worried it was evidence what did you do to yourself he called thats not fashionable you shouldntve done that he stepped toward her and she dropped to her knees rolling under a jutting overhang about a foot and a half high it went back into the rock maybe six feet and there she wedged herself shivering in the cold and fighting the panic from confinement as she stared at the path his feet appeared he wore shoes huge ones wingtips this astonished her for some reason she expected him to be barefoot with long yellow toenails she wondered if hed killed a man for the shoes then he bent down and lay on his belly nice try he kept saying come on out here youre eve arent you beautiful lady ought to shave that fucking hair off she wedged herself as far back as she could her face pressing into the rock when he groped for her she screamed and the piercing sound of her own voice stunned her ears he screamed too crying at her to shut up he grunted and tried again to grab her with a huge effort he jammed his arm forward the tip of his middle finger eased against her thigh those were the only parts of their bodies close enough to touch lis felt the feathery trail of his callused skin move toward her knee the sensation was like a burn and it remained searing even when hrubek stood and vanished lis lay whimpering and fighting the grip of claustrophobia where was he she wondered did she dare leave itd been a half hour since shed disappeared from the beach she knew owen wouldnt have arrived yet but portia and dorothy mightve come looking for her claire too would be somewhere nearby outside she noticed rain beginning to spatter on the stone path i started to push myself out then i heard two things one was hrubeks voice he was very close and talking to himself the other sound was thunder it shook the ground she was worried that the rock above her might shift and trap her where she lay but this fear was soon replaced by a more immediate onethat she would drown huge gushes of water suddenly flowed down the arroyo and the cave began to fill she eased closer to the opening if hrubek had reached in again he could have grabbed her easily her head was sidewaysthe only way it would fit into the narrow spaceand she was twisting her mouth upward desperately gasping for air soon filthy water was surging around her face flowing over her lips she spat it out and started choking more thunder more torrents of water tumbling over the stone she pushed toward the opening but couldnt make headway fighting the rush of water she finally got far enough through the current to fling her hand outside the cave blindly she gripped a rock and pulled herself toward it then the rock moved it wasnt a rock at all but a shoe i pulled back quickly but a huge hand grabbed me by the wrist and tugged me out lis looked away from kohler my swimsuit snagged on a rock and tore open she was halfnaked but she had no choiceshe couldnt stay in the cave any longer she remembered thinking she wished that she had the courage to choose to die by drowning rather than be raped and murdered by the madman as she was drawn out of the cave her mind was filled with images of hrubeks huge hands prodding her breasts and reaching between her legs she began to cry then a mans voice said its all right maam its all right whats the matter she collapsed into the arms of the park ranger leaning against the rock in the torrential rain she told him about robert and hrubek he began asking questions but lis couldnt concentrate all she could hear was a horrid keening that filled the air it seemed to come from earth itself resonating from the rocks stretching out thinner and thinner impossibly thin an unsustainable note that nonetheless refused to stop what is that i asked make it stop oh for gods sake and soon it did lis explained to the psychiatrist for as lis found out just moments later from another ranger an underground stream swollen with rain had overflowed into the cave where lis had found roberts bodythe cave where claire had been all along the sound had been the girls wail for help that had been stifled by the rising waters in which shed drowned stopping the truck abruptly and extinguishing the lights owen atcheson gazed about him surveying this dismal stretch of deserted road he slipped the pistol out of his pocket and stepped into the clearing playing his flashlight on the dusty shoulder hrubeks bike had been laid or had fallen on its side and there were footprints around it several of these he recognized as the madmans boots but the others werent familiar to him it was clear that at one point hrubek had sat on the groundthe sides of his heels made deep cut marks and his hams wide indentations in the dirt of the highways shoulder he couldnt make any sense of whatd happened here he noticed the bicycle treads led on again continuing west down route yet still he studied the turnoff carefully trying to get a clearer idea of how hrubeks mind worked he saw a grassy access road nearby a path disappearing into the forest a number of tire treads led toward it some fresh beyond this was a long road descending through trees bushes tall grass vines mist where the path flattened out again and vanished into the murky shadows of the forest was a car sitting cockeyed in the brush owen shone his flashlight toward it but the distance was too great for illumination all he saw was a vague image of the vehicle he deduced it was an abandoned hulk because it appeared to be twotone detroit had stopped making those a long time ago he didnt bother to explore the vehicle further but returned to the road and drove slowly west checking every hundred yards or so for the weaving bike tread and pondering again the biggest problem of the evening his was no moral dilemma oh owen atcheson had absolutely no ethical difficulty with walking right up to hrubek and putting a bullet into his forehead no it was simply practical one that haversham had reminded him of in adlers office how could he kill michael hrubek without ending up disbarred and in jail himself if hrubek had been a convicted felon owen would have an easier time of it fleeing felons could legally be shot in the back owen now squinted as he recited from cold memory the rules in the state penal code but hrubek was not a felon although the jury found that he had in fact killed robert gillespie the verdict that was entered was not guilty by reason of insanity this meant that there were only two justifiable ways to kill hrubek first to be attacked by him in a place from which owen couldnt reasonably escape an enclosed room a blocked tunnel a bridge second to catch hrubek in the atcheson house where owen could legally shoot him without provocation and have nothing but an inconvenient trip to police hq to show for it and possibly not even that one of these scenarios would have to be engineered but he was still too far from his prey to figure out exactly how no there was nothing to do now but continue on driving slowly through the misty night amid this troubled uncertaintynot of purpose but of means he gave in to the mood of combat thinking purely of the mechanics of the kill which shot would be the most effective which gun should he use how far would a man of hrubeks size be able to run with a mortal wound like a cape buffalo or bear a frighteningly long way he guessed was hrubek himself stalking his pursuers was he even now laying another steeljawed trap or something more deadly from his military days owen knew the huge variety of booby traps that can be created out of gasoline naphtha fertilizer nails tools lumber wire he was considering these matters when he passed an old roadside gas station and general store closed and dark he slowed and studied the road carefully the station had apparently attracted hrubek too the bike treads turned into the driveway owen pulled the truck past the lot and stopped very slowly to keep the damp brakes from squealing he took his pistol from his pocket and verifying that he still had the rifle bolt with him climbed out of the truck he noticed in the front of the building near one of the pumps a box of doughnuts halfempty it seemed a little too prominentas if itd been left here to lure pursuers into a trapand when owen walked to the back of the building he walked very quietly yes the window was broken and the dead bolt unlatched he inhaled slowly to steady himself then pushed the door openfast to keep the hinges from squealingand stepped inside and moved immediately out of the doorway standing still he let his eyes grow accustomed to the gloom his mouth was open widea soldiers trick to mute a loud inhalation should he be startled when he heard nothing for five full minutes he walked in a crouch among the shelves filled with auto parts and greasy cartons foot by foot owen covered the back room of the store and found no evidence of hrubek through the open doorway and smeared glass beyond he saw the highway a car drove past and the light flooded around him creating a thousand shadows that flipped from left to right coalescing then spreading out again into darkness the headlights had dimmed his night vision and he waited five minutes until he could see well enough to continue owen found another empty doughnut carton powdered sugar and cinnamon were scattered on the floor he made his way toward the narrow doorway that opened onto the front room he stopped suddenly listening to a rumbling it grew louder lights flickered outside outlining the oldtime gas pumps a burping explosion from a trucks exhaust stack filled the air as the driver revved the engine to upshift coming off the long incline of the highway the truck thundered past owen partially closed his eyes to protect them from the light that was when he felt more than saw the movement he opened his eyes in alarm and gazed at the dark shape swinging into the doorway before it reached him he leapt backwards but he misjudged and tripped over a metal table falling backwards and dropping his gun his head struck the steel edge on the way down and he lay on the concrete floor stunned while the shadowy form of his assailant filled the doorway not more than three feet from him beckoning the glossy truck sat like a blue jewel in the driveway thatll take me to ridgeton in no time at all make no mistake no time at all o beautiful truck i could sit upon your seat while the priests beautiful daughter sits upon his cock from the old gas station hrubek had cycled to the long gravel driveway down which had vanished the x that contained the woman and her daughter he couldnt see any lights and guessed that their house must be a half mile or more from the highway hed slowly trudged through the field beside the driveway pausing to take the last trap from his canvas bag and place it under some strands of tall grass he continued on carrying the bicycle with him thinking what a truck that is why would i go by a bicycle store to buy a fucking bicycle when i can drive a truck he had paused taken the rear wheel in both hands and eased his shoulders back like a discus thrower he spun around twice and sent the bike flying through the air it fell into a clump of plants thirty feet away he was disappointed it didnt explode on impact though he had no idea why it should he continued up the driveway thinking less about the truck than the womans beautiful hair thats what intrigued him the most he supposed she had breasts he supposed she had a pussy he supposed she had masks on her eyes but what captivated him so was her hair it reminded him of his own hair before he cut it all off when had he done that tonight no last year and why he couldnt remember microphones probably hrubek had walked a half mile until he came to the place where he now stoodthe driveway beside the house now be smart he told himself gravely by this he meant thered be a husband a woman with such soft hair and a delicate face wouldnt live alone shed be married to a big man with cold eyesa conspirator like the limping fucker with the dog he crouched and walked closer hiding in a stand of juniper the dew soaking through his overalls he looked at the threestory colonial the lights were golden the trim garden was filled with indian cornstalks and fat pumpkins on runners the house itself was solid symmetrical plumbeven a picturebook place its red front door decorated with a driedflower wreath he turned away and studied the shiny truck in the driveway next to it was a sporty yellow motorcycle he vaguely remembered that hed ridden a cycle several times at college and recalled being thrilled as well as terrified by the sensation the cycle looked very nice bright and springy but the truck had captivated him first and it continued to possess his heart hrubek walked up to the house and standing in the side yard he peered through a window he tasted bitter paint where his lips pressed against the sill through a thick screen and thicker glass he could see the kitchen there she was the woman with the beautiful hair yes she was beautiful much prettier than shed seemed at the gas station tight blue jeans a white silky blouse and hair cascading to her shouldersno hats for her just tangles of soft blond hair the daughter was heavier and wore a thick sweatshirt with the sleeves drooping over her hands a third woman in the room was dark and her face was tight and sultry hrubek didnt like her at all the women vanished from sight for a moment the kitchen door opened the mother and daughter were carrying boxes out of the house last load the woman said be back soon in a high edgy voice the girl said mom im tired its the church auction and you volunteered to help mom she repeated hopelessly hrubek thought dont whine you little fucker he heard a ringing he squinted into the darkness of the driveway oh no the keys to the truck his truck they were taking it away he stood and tensed to leap into the driveway as he watched them load the boxes into the back of the truck he rocked back and forth willing himself to act see you later mattie bye the dark woman called and returned to the kitchen through the window hrubek saw her pick up the phone the pretty woman and her daughter the whiny little shit climbed into the truck hrubek couldnt move if he stepped out of hiding the woman on the phone would call for help the engine started overcome by a burst of anxiety hrubek nearly leapt forward but he restrained himself and closed his eyes squinting furiously until his head screamed with pain and he regained control he hunkered down beneath a holly bush whose leaves were sharp as knives the truck rolled past him crunching gravel when it was past he stepped away from the house and watched it disappear and neither the mother nor daughter heard hrubeks anguished hiss of rage with a resounding thud he kicked the motorcycles fender he gazed at the cycle for a moment then continued to the back door of the house quietly he opened the screen and looked through the small window high in the back door the darkcomplected woman still on the phone was gesturing broadly and shaking her head as she talked this made hrubek think shed be a screamer on the stove was a teakettle just starting to steam over a high flame as he silently twisted the knob back and forth checking that the door was not locked hrubek thought shes having tea that means she isnt about to leave and wont be expected anywhere soon hrubek congratulated himself on this smart thinking and he continued to act smarthe didnt open the door and step into the kitchen until the woman had hung up and walked across the kitchen to the stove far away from the phone owen atcheson his ear numb from striking the table leg as he fell scrabbled away from the door and unable to find his gun grabbed a soda bottle lying nearby he cracked it hard against the floor and held the shard like a knife he crouched and made himself ready for attack the assailant didnt move owen waited a moment longer finally he stood owen grabbed his pistol from the floor when he heard no breathing and saw no other motion he flicked on the light switch taste t beats t others c in fury owen kicked shut the door of the old pepsi machine jesus he spat out the lock had been brokenby hrubek undoubtedlyand the door dislodged by the semi as it rumbled past had swung open into the doorway his anger was so great he nearly put a bullet through the navel of the bikiniclad girl on the old faded poster taped to the door he jammed the gun into his pocket and trotted outside to his truck only a few hundred feet west he found the tread again turning into a private road or driveway of a residence he couldnt see a house from the road and observing the length of the drive and the size of the property guessed that the family was wealthy horse ranchers maybe he looked back at the ground and noted that hrubek had left the drive and was traveling through the brush making his way silently on the patches of dirt owen followed the madmans clear path a flash in the distant west caught his eye lightning attempting to circle in front of hrubek he made his way west from the driveway into the field of tall fleshcolored grass and moved south from here he was able to see a quarter mile away a stately house although it was late there were many lights on giving a homey glow to the place but that impression vanished when owen noticed a single unsettling tokenthe kitchen door was wide open sending a shaft of bonewhite light onto the gravel driveway as if someone had fled quickly from the house or maybe owen reflected had entered quickly and was still inside one who loves flowers and literature cant doubt the existence of god the lesson hes got for us though probably isnt so hot we see miracles daily thats true on the other hand gods got the universe to mind and doesnt have much time for passengers on colliding trains kids dragged to death behind buses and dear friends murdered by a madman in a state park that lis explained to richard kohler was the thought i just couldnt get out of my mind for months after the murder i repeated it to practically everyone i met im sure they thought i was totally mad kohler nodded her bit of theology politely aside and frowned sympathetically you lost two friends at the same time how terrible i didnt know about the girls death lis was silent for a long moment finally she said no it wasnt featured in the news about the trial her death was considered accidental may i ask lis glanced at him inquiringly did you hear anyone call for help how do you mean claire im thinking of before you saw michael and ran into the cave did you hear her scream when lis didnt respond kohler added it just seems that with michael chasing her down the path i mean he was chasing her wasnt he lis couldnt guess the purpose of his questions after a moment she said i didnt hear anything there werent any screams why would she go into the cave in the first place i dont know its curious isnt it youd think with michael after her shed continue running down the canyon a cave is the last place id want to be with michael chasing me she was testy i cant speak for her obviously im just wondering later did you think about it a young girl being chased by a huge man like michael i wouldve thought shed scream at some point maybe she did maybe i didnt hear her i dont really it was close to where you were looking for her though wasnt it kohler persisted from the way you described it i it was close to where i was yes but she felt crossexamined and forced herself to be calm i dont know maybe i blocked it out maybe she did scream and i dont remember it thats possible isnt it oh sure posttrauma stress very possible well then kohler said something perhaps by way of apology but lis didnt hear she was thinking claire my poor claire and pictured the girls pale eyes the hair that tumbled over her shoulders like water the white mouth that needed lipstick the girl was too bashful to apply she had grieved for robert yes but it was the girls death that hurt her the deepest she hadnt known that she could be so attached to a youngster lis had always felt a certain uneasiness around children even her students she rarely put it that way and tended to think of her and owens childlessness as circumstance but the truth was she just hadnt wanted a son or daughter she couldnt picture the atcheson family on a picnic austere owen cradling an infant andy she herself dropping a line of formula onto her wrist to test the temperature baby showers strollers pta meetings embarrassing conversations about the facts of life but about claire lis felt differently claire shed sought out lis viewed the girl through a rare crack in the wall of distant time and saw in the students eyes and halting manners the effigy of another thin shy girl from years before a child whose father was both intimate and hating and whose mother dared to be truly present only when her man was not lis could not refuse the covert pleas for helplike the times the girl stayed after class to ask intelligent if calculated questions about jacobean drama or happenedtoo coincidentallyto find herself walking beside her teacher on the deserted riverside behind the school lis was again picturing claires face when she realized that the psychiatrist was asking her a question he wanted to know about the trial the trial she repeated softly well i got to the courthouse early just you i refused to let owen come with me its hard to explain but i wanted to keep what happened at indian leap as separate as possible from my home owen spent the day with dorothy after all she was the widow she needed comforting more than i inside the courtroom when lis first saw hrubekitd been five and a half weeks since the murderhe looked smaller than she recalled he was pale sickly he squinted at her and his mouth twisted into an eerie smile as she walked down the aisle lis tried to keep her eyes on the prosecutor a young woman with a mass of flyaway hair shed been prepping lis all week for the court appearance lis sat behind her but in full view of hrubek his hands were manacled in front of him and he lifted them as far as he could then simply stared at her his lips moving compulsively god it was eerie thats just dyskinesia kohler explained its a condition caused by antipsychotic drugs whatever it was scary as hell when he spoke he almost gave me a heart attack he jumped up and said conspiracy and revenge or something i dont remember exactly apparently these outbursts had happened before because everyone including the judge ignored him as she walked past he grew very calm and asked her in a conversational tone if she knew where he was on the night of april at pm april thats right and the murder was may wasnt it yes did april mean anything to you she shook her head a small notation went into kohlers book please go on hrubek said i was murdering somebody im not quoting exactly something like i was murdering somebody the moon rose blood red and ever since that day i have been the victim of a conspiracy lincoln s assassination kohler looked at her with raised eyebrows im sorry didnt it happen in midapril i think it was around then yes another notation with disdain lis observed the brief smile that crossed kohlers lips then she continued he was saying ive been implanted with tracking and listening devices ive been tortured sometimes he was incoherent sometimes he sounded like a doctor or lawyer lis was the main prosecution witness she swore her oath then settled in a huge wooden chair on its seat was a crocheted cushion and she wondered if it had been made by the wife of the grizzled slouching judge the prosecutor asked me to tell the court what happened that day and i did her testimony seemed to take an eternity she later learned she was in the spotlight for all of eight minutes she was dreading crossexamination by the defense attorney but she wasnt called hrubeks lawyer said simply no questions and she spent the next several hours in the gallery all i could do was stare at the plastic bags that contained the rock stained with roberts blood and the kitchen knife i sat in the back of the courtroom with tad kohler lifted an inquiring eyebrow hes a former student of mine he does work for me around the yard and greenhouse i told everybody i knew not to attend the trial but tad ignored me he was there all day long cheerful and smiling we sat together before she testified the young man found her in the corridor outside and handed her a paper bag inside was a yellow rose hed trimmed the thorns and cut the stem back wrapped it in wet paper towels lis had cried and kissed him on the cheek was it a long trial kohler asked not really she explained the defense lawyer didnt dispute the fact that hrubek had killed robert he relied on the insanity defensehrubek lacked the mental state to understand that his acts were criminal under the mnaghten rule lis relayed to kohler what shed learned during the jury instruction the death becomes an act of god the lawyer didnt even put hrubek on the stand he offered medical reports and depositions which were read out loud by a clerk this all had to do with hrubeks inability to appreciate the consequences of his actions all that time the madman had sat at the defense table hunched over twining his dirty hair between blunt fingers laughing and muttering filling sheet after sheet of foolscap with tiny frantic characters and lines she hadnt paid any attention to these doodlings then but understood later that he hadnt been as crazy as it appearedthis was undoubtedly how hed recorded her name and address a verdict of not guilty by reason of diminished capacity was entered under section of the mental health law hrubek would be classified as dangerously insane and would be incarcerated indefinitely in a state hospital to be reevaluated annually i left the courthouse then and what about the incident kohler asked palms meeting as if he were clapping in slow motion with the chair chair he jumped up on a chair or table ah yes that the courtroom began to empty suddenly a huge voice rose over the murmuring of the spectators and press michael hrubek was shouting he threw a bailiff to the ground and climbed onto his chair the manacles clanked and he lifted his arms over his head he began screaming his eyes met liss for a moment and she froze guards subdued hrubek and a bailiff hustled her out of the courtroom what did he say say when he was on the chair did he shout anything i think he was just howling like an animal the article said he shouted youre the eve of betrayal could be you dont remember no i dont kohler was shaking his head michael had therapy sessions with me three times a week during one he said betrayal betrayal oh shes courting disaster she sat in that court and now shes courting disaster all that betrayal eves the one when i asked him what he meant he became agitated as if hed let an important secret slip he wouldnt talk about it hes mentioned betrayal several times since then you have any thoughts on what it might mean no i dont im sorry and afterwards after the trial lis sipped the strong coffee well i took a trip to hell after the publicity faded and hrubek was committed in marsden lis resumed the life shed led before the tragedy at first her routine seemed largely unchangedteaching summer school spending sundays at the country club with owen visiting friends tending the garden she was perhaps the last person to notice that her life was unraveling occasionally shed skip a shower shed forget the names of guests attending her own cocktail parties she might happen to glance down as she walked through the corridors of the school and find that she was wearing mismatched shoes shed teach dryden instead of the scheduled pope and berate students for failing to read material shed never assigned sometimes in lectures and in conversations she found herself gazing at embarrassed perplexed faces and could only wonder what on earth shed just uttered it was as if i was sleepwalking she withdrew into her greenhouse and mourned owen patient initially grew tired of liss torpor and absentmindedness and they began to fight he spent more time on business trips she stayed home more and more frequently venturing outside only for her classes her sleep problems grew worse it was not unusual for her to remain awake for twentyfour hours straight adding to liss difficulty was dorothy who stepped as brusquely into widowhood as she slipped into the front seat of her mercedes sl she was gaunt and pale and didnt smile for two months yet she functioned and functioned quite well owen several times held her out as an example of someone who took tragedy in stride well im not like her owen i never have been im sorry when dorothy sold her house and moved to the jersey shore in july it was not she but lis who cried during their farewell lunch liss life became school and her greenhouse where she would snip plants and wander like a lost child over the slate path her face occasionally damp as the leaves of a plantain lily but gradually she improved she took prozac for a time which made her jaw quiver and fingers tremble and infused her dreams with spectacular effects it also aggravated the insomnia she switched to pamelor which was gentler and then one day she simply stopped taking the pills and hung up her housecoat i cant tell you what happened or when exactly but i suddenly just knew it was time to get on with my life and i did id had some clues that michaels delusion involves american history kohler told her particularly the civil war sic semper tyrannisthats what booth shouted after he shot lincoln thus ever to tyrants lis the schoolteacher added its also the state motto of virginia and the april reference the assassination what does lincoln have to do with anything kohler shook his head michaels been very reluctant to talk to me about his delusions only hints cryptic phrases he didnt trust me even you his doctor especially me his doctor thats the nature of his illness hes paranoid hes always accusing me of trying to get information out of him for the fbi or secret service he has a core delusion but i cant get to the bottom of it i suppose it centers on the civil war lincoln s death conspirators or some event he associates with the assassination i dont know whys his delusion so important because its central to his illness it explains to him why every day is so unbearably hard a schizophrenics life kohler lectured is a search for meaning and whose isnt lis wondered its a very controversial matter right now the doctor said adding that he himself was considered a bit of a renegade she thought he was a little too smug with this characterization of himself schizophrenia is a physical illness just like cancer or appendicitis you have to treat it with drugs no one disputes that but i differ from most of my colleagues in thinking that you can also treat schizophrenic patients very effectively with psychotherapy i cant really imagine hrubek lying on a couch talking about his childhood neither could freud he said schizophrenic patients shouldnt be treated with psychoanalysis most psychiatrists agree the current treatment is to get them on brain candythats how the cynics among us refer to their medicationand force them to accept reality teach them to order in restaurants and do their own laundry then turn them loose and its trueextended analysis with the patient on the couch thats wrong for people like michael but certain types of psychotherapy work very well seriously ill patients can learn to function at a very high level most psychiatrists think that schizophrenic patients ramble incoherently that their delusions are meaningless i think that almost everything they say is meaningfull the more we try to translate their words into our way of thinking yes the more pointless those words are but if we try to grasp their metaphoric meaning then doors open up take a napoleon okay thats the popular image of a schizophrenic i wont try to convince a patient that he isnt napoleon and i wouldnt just pat him on the head and say bonjour when i pass him in the hall id try to find out why he thinks hes the emperor of france nine times out of ten theres a reason and once i know that i can start to unlock doors ive had remarkable results with patientsand some of them are a lot sicker than michael he added bitterly i was just getting inside him i was almost there when this happened you make him sound innocent he is innocent thats the perfect word for him she thought angrily oh isnt the good doctor used to people buying his bill of goods the malleable patients who nod their damaged heads and shuffle off to obey the sorrowful families pecking through his pompous words for comfort like birds for seed young terrified interns and nurses how on earth she asked can you romanticize him hes just a set of muscles free to do whatever he wants hes a machine run amok not at all michaels tormented by the inability to achieve what he thinks he can become that conflict shows itself as what we call madness to him his delusions are merciful explanations for why he cant be like the rest of the world you seem to be saying his disease isnt anybodys fault she waved her arm at the clouds speeding past well neither are tornadoes but wed stop them if we could we should stop hrubek somebody should lock him up and throw away the key shed come a split second away from saying track him down and shoot him hes just a psychopath no he isnt thats a very different diagnosis from schizophrenia psychopaths adapt well to society they seem normalthey have jobs and familiesbut theyre completely detached from morality and emotion theyre evil a psychopath would kill you because you took his parking place or wouldnt give him ten dollars and he wouldnt think twice about it michael would only kill for the same reasons you wouldselfdefense for instance please doctor michaels harmless is that what youre telling me no of course not but kohlers voice faded im sorry ive upset you after a moment lis said no we see things differently thats all but she said it quite coolly its late ive used up my twenty minutes he rose and walked toward the kitchen when they approached the back door he asked one thing im still curious about why would he associate you with betrayal the eve of betrayal revenge forever why well i suppose because i testified against him she lifted her palms at the simplicity of this deduction you think thats it i suppose i really dont know kohler nodded and fell silent a moment later his mind made another of its odd leaps punctuated by a stab at his pale scalp with a nervous finger theres a car lot outside of town isnt there she thought shed misheard him a car lot what did you say cars a dealership well yes but im thinking of the big one all lit up a ford dealership kleppermans ford thats right where is it exactly half mile outside of town on route just over the hills east of town why just curious she waited for an explanation but none came and it was clear that the interview or interrogation or whatever it had been was over kohler cleared his throat and thanked her she was grateful he was leaving the visit had angered her but she was confused too what had he learned that was so helpful and what had he not told her outside walking to his car they both looked up at the thick clouds the wind was fierce now and whipped her hair in an irritating way flinging it into her face doctor lis stopped him touching his bony upper arm tell me what are the odds that hes on his way here kohler continued to gaze at the clouds the odds the odds are that theyll find him soon and even if not that hed never make it this far alone but if you want my opinion i think you should go to that hotel you mentioned he glanced at her for a moment then it was clear that his thoughts were elsewhere maybe wandering with his terrified mad patient through brush and forests lost on highways sitting in a deserted cabin somewhere as she watched him walk to his car she pushed aside her anger for a moment and saw kohler for the ambitious young physician that he was and tough and devoted and undoubtedly damn smart too but she sensed something else about him and was unable for a few moments to fathom exactly what that might be his car had disappeared down the long driveway before she understood dr richard kohler lis decided was a very worried man the ambulance and the police car arrived simultaneously their urgent lights painting the underside of the trees with peculiar metallic illumination the brakes squealed and the yard was filled with uniformed men and women equipment stretchers electric boxes dotted with lights and buttons the medics trotted toward the large colonial house the police too holstering their long flashlights as they ran owen atcheson sat on the back steps beside the kitchen door which was still open his head was in his hands as he watched the medics run toward the doorway one said to him you called nineoneone reported a woman was attacked he nodded where is she in the kitchen owen said exhaustion and discouragement thick in his voice but you can take your time hows that i said theres no rush the only place shes going tonight is the morgue the spirits of the dead who is it not mary haddon jesus not their daughter no thats not her thats not mary look at her for gods sake its not mary but nobody wanted to look theyd look at the wall calendar the postit notes the shattered teacup the scraps of paper clinging to the avocadocolored refrigerator door under fruitshaped magnets theyd look everywhere but at the terrible creature tied with bell wire to the maple captains chair the senior medic walked carefully into the room minding the huge slick of blood on the tile floor he bent down and studied the intricately tied knots her head loosened by the deep cut to her throat lolled backwards and her blouse was pulled open the awkward letters cut into her skin were stark against her bluewhite chest fucking mess one of the young cops said hey lets dont have any of that talk here a plainclothes detective said check out the house all the bedrooms i think joe and maryre over at the church the charity auctions tomorrow and hes chairman i heard theyre working late oh i hope their daughters with them man i hope that well call em up or get a car over there lets get on with this one cop entered and looked at the corpse lord thats mattie mattie selwyn shes the haddons housekeeper i know her brother the nervous banter continued oh this is a bad thing whats that in her lap that little white thing jesus some kind of skull or something a badger why tonight a deputy lamented stormll be here any time already had a twister in morristown couple people died you hear man owen stood in the doorway and looked again at the carnage he shook his head you the one who called us sir the detective asked running his hand through his saltandpepper hair owen nodded and wiped sweat from his face after calling hed glanced into a window and seen on his face the mud smeared on his cheekbones and forehead to mask the glossiness of his skin he had washed his face before the police arrived still his handkerchief now came away from his forehead dirty and he supposed he looked a mess he explained about hrubeks escape the bicycle following him here the detective said yessir we had a notice about that runaway but we thought he was heading east i told them he wasnt owen said heatedly i told them hed turn west they wouldnt listen nobody took this thing seriously from the start and now look we also heard he was harmless the detective said bitterly staring at the body then he glanced at owen whats your role in this exactly he told them that hed come out to see what the state police were doing to capture the escapee who appeared to have a grudge against his wife as he spoke he realized that the story was outlandish and he was neither surprised nor offended when the officer asked could i see some id please owen handed over his drivers license and his attorneys registration card you dont mind if we confirm this not at all the detective picked up the phone and called his office a moment later he nodded and hung up he walked back to owen and returned the id are you armed sir yes i assume you have a firearm permit mr atcheson i do yes and four years of combat experience he said this because the detective was about his age and had a serenity in the face of butchery like this that comes from only one thingsurviving firefights the detective squinted a bit of reluctant camaraderie into his face one cop stuck his head into the foyer and his wide eyes on the dead woman said to the detective found something bob we got motorcycle tracks they look fresh the detective asked owen yours no the cop continued only the helmets still on the ground it seemed the policeman whod identified the housekeeper called from the living room that helmet was hers matties she drove a honda yellow one i think the detective called where do the tracks head they go behind the garage down a path then out over to they turn south owen asked to thats the road to boyleston sure is he was to head down on a motorcycle hed be there in forty fifty minutes boylestons the closest amtrak station isnt it the detective nodded thats right notice we got said he was making for massachusetts they were thinking hed gone on foot but sure he could take the train maybe he doubled back like a feint you know that makes sense to me the detective barked an order to a uniformed sergeant telling him to notify the boyleston police about the murder and to send two of their own cars south on immediately as the cops turned back to the body and busied themselves with fingerprints and crimescene photos owen stepped outside and strolled around the property looking for tracks he studied the estates rolling pastures a horse stable and several small barns that had been converted into garages you see anything the detective called to him nope say mr atcheson well need a statement from you and im sure attorney franks our prosecutor will be wanting to talk to you in the morning id be happy to i in the morning owen said evenly the officer kept eye contact for a moment then chased to his wallet for a business card which he handed to owen youll call me then nine am sharp owen said he would the detective tours of duty aside looked owen up and down i understand what youre going through sir i myself might be inclined to head off after him this minute i was in your position but my advice is for you to stay out of this whole thing owen merely nodded and gazed south toward the ruddy haze of lights that would be boyleston he stepped aside as the medics brought the womans body out of the door he stared at it seeing not so much the darkgreen bag as in his minds eye the bloody black strokes of the letters that had been cut into her chest the words they spelled were forever revenge he lost the scent on the outskirts of cloverton emil was once again quartering zigzagging across the asphalt his master in tow looking for a trail he simply couldnt find even trenton heck who supported his dogs percent was having an uneasy time of it the big obedience problem with tracking was that you never knew exactly what was in the dogs mind maybe just as you lowered the scent article to his nose the hound got a whiff of deer and with the shout of find hed bounded off in pursuit of a big buck whod trotted nearby hours ago the hound would be doing exactly what he believed hed been ordered to do and woe to the handler who failed to slip him a bacn treat just the same as if hed treed the escaping convict yet heck replayed the evening and didnt see how emil could be mistaken come on boy he thought fervently i got faith in you lets do it emil started toward a waterfilled ditch but heck ordered him back it occurred to him that a man whod lay traps would also poison water though heck was more worried about natural contamination it was his rule to let dogs drink only water from home when his fellow troopers would snicker at this and mutter evian or perrier hed tell them fine boys just go to mexico yourselves sometime and drink from the tap see how you enjoy it for your hound anyplace that aint home could be mexico tonight he took a jar from the truck and gave emil a long drink the hound lapped greedily they started on the trail again far distant in the west lightning flashed in mute bands at the horizon and a misty rain had started falling this heck supposed was what had ruined the scent earlier hed been welcoming the rain but that was when hrubek was on foot the madman was now on a bicycle and they were following a very different type of trail dogs detect three different scentsbody scent in the air body scent pressed into the ground and track scent which is a combination of crushed vegetation and smells released by whatever the prey might step on rain intensifies and freshens the latter two but add a hard rain to airborne scent on asphaltwhich is chockfull of chemicals that foul dogs nosesand youve got the worst possible combination to track over come on why dont you get off that damn bike heck muttered cant you hoof it like a normal escapee emil slowed and looked around him a bad sign i got you for your nose boy not your eyes hell i can see bettern you the hound slowly strolled off the road and into a field his leg on fire heck led the dog along a grid search pattern loping in huge squares over the ground moving slowly under the guidance of the flashlight for fear of the steel traps emil paused for long moments sniffing the ground then lifting his nose then he ambled off and repeated the process as heck watched the hound his sense of futility grew then heck felt a tug on the track line and he looked down with hope in his heart but immediately the line went slack as emil gave up on the false lead and returned to nosing about in the ground breathing in all the aromas of the countryside and searching in vain for a scent that for all heck knew might have vanished forever michael hrubeks father was a grayish somber man who had over the years grown dazed by the disintegration of his family rather than avoiding home however as another man might have done he dutifully returned every evening from the clothing store in which he was the formalwear manager and he returned quicklyas if afraid that in his absence some new pestilence might be threatening to destroy whatever normalcy remained in his house once home though he spent the tedious hours before bed largely ignoring the chaos around him for diversion he took to reading psychology books for laypeople and excerpts from the book of common prayer andwhen neither proved to be much of a palliativewatching television specifically travel and talk shows michael was then in his midtwenties and had largely given up his hopes of returning to college he spent most of his time at home with his parents hrubek senior attempting to keep his son happy and more to the point out of everyones hair would bring michael comic books games revell models of civil war weaponry his son invariably received these gifts with suspicion hed cart them to the upstairs bathroom subject them to a pro forma dunking to short out sensors and microphones then stow the dripping boxes in his closet michael look candyland how bout a game later son after supper candyland candyland do you know anybody who plays candyland have you ever met a single person in the fucking world who plays candyland im going upstairs and taking a bath for his part michael avoided his father as he avoided everyone else his rare forays outside the house were motivated by pathetic missions he once spent a month looking for a rabbi who would convert him to judaism and he devoted three fervent weeks to hounding an anxious armed forces recruitment officer who couldnt shake the young man even after explaining a dozen times that there was no longer a union army he took a commuter train to philadelphia where he stalked an attractive black newscaster and once cornered her on the street demanding to know if she was a slave and if she enjoyed pornographic films she got a restraining order that the police seemed eager to enforce with whatever vigor was necessary but michael soon forgot about her on saturday mornings his father would make a big pancake breakfast and the family would eat amid such ranting from michael that his parents eventually tuned out the noise michaels mother most likely still in her nightgown would pick at her food until she could face the plate no longer she would rise slowly put on lipstick because thats what proper ladies did after meals and after spending several frantic minutes looking for the tv guide or the remote control she would return to bed and click on the set his father did the dishes then took michael to a doctor whose small office was above an icecream parlor on main street all that michael remembered about this man was that with almost every sentence he said michael michael what id like to do today is for you to tell me what some of your earliest memories are can you do that michael an example would be christmas with your family christmas morning michael the very first time i dont know fucker i cant remember fucker i dont know anything about christmas fucker so why do you keep asking me michael said fucker even more often than the doctor said michael he stopped seeing this psychiatrist after his fathers insurance company refused to reimburse the family for any more visits he spent more and more time in his room sometimes reading history sometimes wearing his mothers clothing sometimes screaming out the windows at people who walked past the hrubeks paleblue home became a renowned house of terror among the children of westbury pennsylvania this was his life for the years following his expulsion from collegeliving at home going on his mad sorties dunking toys eating junk food reading history watching television it was around his twentyfifth birthday in april that michael withdrew into his room and stopped talking to anyone one month later he tried to burn down the house to stop the voices that came from his mothers bedroom the following saturday hrubek senior dressed his son in an illfitting suit and took him along with three books a change of underwear and a toothbrush to a state mental hospital in new york he lied about state residency and had the boy admitted to the facility under an involuntarycommitment order intended to last for seventytwo hours his father hugged michael and told him the hospital would stabilize his condition and make him well enough to live at home ill have to think about that a frowning michael responded not knowing that those would be the last words ever spoken between father and son upon his return to westbury the depleted man sold the house at a loss and moved to the midwest where his family had come from years before after six weeks the hospitals thirdparty payments section gave up trying to track down his father and michael became a guest of the state this hospital was bleakan institutional desert where the long hours were broken only by pill time and meal time and shock time at this point in his illness however michael was more evasive than aggressive and didnt need electroconvulsiveshock treatment his pills calmed him down and he spent the days sitting placidly in his room until his butt grew sore then hed stand and stare out the windows barred by wire lattice that dangled with tiny streamers of greasy dust once a week he would talk to a doctor you have to take your meds are you taking them good you see were aiming to get you to the point where youre aware im speaking of a conscious awareness that your concerns are a function of your illness not of the reality around you michael would grunt disagreeably and remind himself to keep a suspicious eye on the fellow after six weeks in the hospital michael hrubek was diagnosed as mildly schizophrenic nonviolent possibly paranoid and was among eightyseven similar patients released when the hospital closed one of its wings due to budget cutbacks because thirdparty payments had never informed discharge that the location of michaels father was unknown the release notice was sent to a fictitious address in valhalla new york on the day michael was discharged an orderly parked him on a bench in the waiting room and told him to wait for a family member to pick him up four hours later michael told the duty nurse that he was going to say goodbye to one of the groundskeepers instead he wandered unchallenged through the front gatethus beginning a lengthy and harrowing journey that would lead him to cities throughout the eastern seaboard to hospitals of varying degrees of renown and infamy to idyllic trevor hill psychiatric and his beloved and betraying dr anne to the snakepit of cooperstown to the deaths at indian leap to marsden state mental health facility to dr richard and finallyafter so many miles and so very many lifetimesto the astonishing place in which michael found himself tonight the drivers seat of a black thirtyyearold cadillac coupe de ville speeding not toward boyleston at all but straight down route west to ridgeton which was now less than twenty miles away as he drove musical words flew from his lips cadillac hard tack hard tack horseback soldier boys gray and blue his hands left a residue of sweat on the white steering wheel and he kept repeating to himself which pedal was the accelerator and which was the brake hed sometimes find himself easing over the center line and in panic forget which lane he was supposed to be in then remembering hed forget how to steer back into the proper lane and would drive englishstyle for some distance before gradually returning to the right on and on he drove a steady forty miles an hour in a fiftyfive zone he swallowed and moaned often and muttered to himself and he wanted nothing so much as to fall onto the smooth plain of the upholstered seat cover his head and fall fast asleep but he didnt no michael remained as upright as a soldier on guard duty looking straight into the darkness where the guns of his enemy waited his eyes left the asphalt only once to glance at the sign that said ridgeton miles then returned to the highway with pleasure he inhaled the sweet smell of the heater that blasted air into his face the memories hed had this november evening michael thought with a burst of rare perception had traveled as far as he had and he thought now about an afternoon long ago sitting in the library of one of his hospitals singing a song that he himself had written he recalled that hed sung it over and over until the librarian asked him to stop and then he sang it in his head silently mouthing the words now ensconced in his luxurious black car he once again sang it and he sang it loud hard tack horseback the capitals asleep the soldier boys are crying somewhere a woman weeps hard tack the moons back and bloody in the sky im going to the graveyard where the body lies michael points the black nose of the car down a long hill and feels the gradual smooth acceleration of the engine unexpectedly though despite the glory of newfound speed despite his immense pride at mastering this machine that a year ago would have paralyzed him with terror michael hrubek begins to cry he gulps hot air into his lungs fueling the sobbing and feels the moisture on his wide cheeks his throat stings why am i crying michael wonders barely conscious that he is crying he really has no idea but somewhere deep in his mind is the answer that he cries for mans genius in making this exquisite automobile he cries for all the miles hes traveled tonight and for the vague memory of a woman wearing a very unfashionable hat on her otherwise perfect head for the past dead and for those soon to be and he cries for what is surely sitting above the thickening storm clouds over his car right nowa moon blood red im going to the graveyard where the body lies lis was taping the top row of windows in the greenhouse when the storm finally hit her face was inches from the glass as she was reaching out to lay a strip on a hardtoreach pane suddenly a slash of rain cracked against the window she twisted away dropping the tape thinking for an instant that someone had flung a handful of gravel at the panes she nearly tumbled backwards off the ladder she climbed down and retrieved the masking tape surveying the sky worried that a window might shatter into her face if she continued to tape lis again considered leavingnow but the north windows those facing the storm were still to be done ten minutes she decided shed allow herself that climbing up once again she thought about kohlers advising her to leave yet she felt no extreme urgency he hadnt seemed particularly concerned on her behalf besides she reasoned the ridgeton sheriff would certainly have called if hed learned that hrubek was headed for town as she laid the xs on the squares of glass her eyes fell on the lake and the forest beyond them barely visible in the rain was a huge expanse of countrysidea muddy horizon of fields and woods and rocks disappearing into the black windy sky the sweep of terrain seemed so limitless so perfectly able to contain the infection of michael hrubek that it was foolish to think that he might even get close to ridgeton the vastness of the landscape would protect her husband too how could either man possibly find the other and where was owen at this moment in her heart she believed hed be back soon perhaps even before she and portia left for the inn returning emptyhanded angry and frustratedbecause hed missed his chance to play soldier and because he had lost an opportunity to do penance oh lis had understood that from the start she knew that his errand tonight had a tacit purpose it was part of a complicated debt he seemed to feel he owed his wife and perhaps he did she reflected for owen had spent much of last year in the company of another woman hed met her at a legal continuingeducation conference she was a trustandestates lawyer thirtyseven years old divorced with two children he offered these facts as proof of the virtue of his infidelity no young gumsnapping bimbo for him yaleeducated cum laude do you think i give a fuck about her credentials lis had shouted when shed first seen a mastercard receipt for a hotel in atlantic city dated the weekend he was supposed to be in ohio on business she was devastated never before a victim of adultery lis hadnt realized that illicit sex is only a part of the infidelity game theres illicit affection too and she wasnt sure which hurt the worst why bedding the bitch in trumps palace her highly educated thighs squeezing owens flicking tongues shared spit exposed nipples and cock and cleft those were bad enough but lis was almost more stung by the thought of their joined palms romantic walks on the turbulent jersey beach the two of them sitting on a bench and owen sharing his most private thoughts stern owen her quiet owen owen from whose mouth she had to pry words much of this was speculation of course hed learned his lesson and volunteered nothing more after blurting out the womans cv but the thought alone of an intimacy deeper than sex was horrifying to lis and her fury at their furtive conversations and entwined fingers grew beyond all reasonable proportion for weeks after his confession she was racked by a sensation that she might at any moment erupt in madnessanytime anywhere by the time she confronted him the affair was over he said hed taken his wifes head in his long hands stroking her hair jiggling the earrings hed given her during the height of his infidelity lis had noted with ire and that night pitched the jewelry out the woman had asked him to leave lis owen said and marry her he refused they fought and the affair ended bitterly after the initial cataclysmic weeks following this confession after the long nights of silence after those funereal sunday mornings after an intolerable thanksgiving they began to discuss the matter as couples dotactically then obliquely then reasonably lis now had only vague memories of the conversations youre too demanding youre too strict youre too quiet youre too reclusive youre not interested in what i do you have to loosen up sexually you come on like a rapist you never complained yes but you scare me sometimes i cant tell what youre thinking yes but youre so stubborn yes but the secondperson pronoun occurs never so often as in the aftermath of infidelity finally they decided to consider divorce and went their separate ways for a time during this period lis finally admitted to herself that the affair was no surprise not really owens having an attorney for a lover well that was a shock yes he didnt fare well with strong women to hear him tell it his best relationship prior to lis had been with a young vietnamese woman in saigon during the war he was tactfully reluctant to go into many details but he described her glowingly as sensitive and demure it took lis some translating and prying to figure out that this meant she was subservient and complacent and she spoke very little english thats a relationship she wondered unnerved to find that this was the sort of woman her husband had sought out still there seemed to be something more to the liaison something dark owen wouldnt go into the details and lis was left to speculate maybe he had accidentally wounded her and stayed with her out of loyalty slipping her stolen rations and medicines and nursing her to health maybe her father was a viet cong whom owen had killed plagued with guilt hed offered some reparation and fallen in love this all seemed far too romantic operatic even for owen atcheson and she ultimately attributed the affair to youthful lust and his fond memories of it to the revisionist ego of a middleaged man but there was no denying that a servile young thing had a certain appeal to him the greatest friction between themand his worst flares of temperarose when she opposed him she could rattle off a hundred examplesbuying the nursery urging him to be more of a sexual partner suggesting they see a therapist when the marriage hit rough spots traveling less and yet ironically his domineering side did have a certain appeal to lis as troubling as this was she couldnt deny it she still recalled seeing him for the first time she was in her midthirties an age at which most ridgeton women were sensible mothers several times over lis had attended a towncouncil meeting where owen was representing a building developer seeking a p z variance stern and unyielding owen atcheson stood at the podium and comfortably withstood the assault of wrathful citizens lis stayed long after her own minor ministerial proceeding and watched him play the kings knight she was captivated by his cold articulation and watching him grip the podium with his large hands actually found herself aroused she engineered a chance meeting in the parking lot afterwards suggesting they exchange phone numbers who knows maybe ill need a good lawyer someday one week later he asked her to dinner and she accepted at once on the first date he showed up scrubbed and trimmed wearing a blue blazer and khaki slacks carrying a dozen roses owen ordered for her picked up the check discreetly held open every door she walked through and capped the evening with a chaste kiss after escorting her to the door he did everything by the book and she felt absolutely nothing for him he didnt call her afterwards anddespite a brief sting to the egoshe decided she was relieved not to hear from him she went out with several other men casually thinking no more about the austere owen atcheson then one saturday six months later they ran into each other in a store on main street he claimed hed been meaning to call but had been traveling extensively why lis had wondered did men think this made you feel better explaining how much theyd wanted to call but had not as she and owen stood awkwardly at the counter of ace hardware he glanced down at the white plastic tubing she was buying it was for her garden she explained did she need any help installing it when she hesitated he looked into her eyes and said he didnt have many talents but there were a few things he was very good at plumbing was one all right she said they returned to the small bungalow she was renting with owen supervising together they hooked up the irrigation system in half an hour when the work was finished he walked to the spigot beckoning her to follow he took her hand and placed it on the knob then enfolded her fingers with his shall we he asked and turned the faucet on full as he lifted her chin with his free hand and kissed her hard on the mouth they spent the rest of the afternoon in liss brass bed not even bothering to climb beneath the blue gingham covers their dirty work clothes strewn about them on the stairs and floor they were married eight months later throughout their six years together lis had frequent doubts about their future yet shed never thought that infidelity would end the marriage more likely she believed one of them would just pack and leavemaybe after in a fit of temper he finally delivered one of the slaps hed come close to inflicting on her in the past or after shed insisted no no compromises that he choose between her and another weekend at the office so his affair was a sobering event she was at first fully ready to divorce him and start life on her own initially this had a great appeal to her but lis atcheson was not at heart an angry woman and as the weeks went by she found she needed to remind herself to be indignant about the affair this equilibrium made the idea of living alone again less attractive besides he was excruciatingly contrite which gave her a curious power over himthe only upper hand shed ever attained in the marriage a practical matter too ruth lauberget whod been ill with cancer throughout this time finally passed away and the daughters were heirs to a complicated estate lis with no interest in financial matters found herself relying more and more on owen business and money were after all aspects of his profession and as he became involved in managing the estate the couple grew close once again their life became easier lis bought the x as agreed among the sisters and ruth lauberget lis and owen moved into the ridgeton house with its dream greenhouse and portia received the coop owen bought suits from brooks brothers and fancy shotguns he went deepsea fishing in florida and hunting in canada and he continued to take business trips often overnight but lis believed his pledge of fidelity besides she reasoned owen clearly liked being wealthy and the money stock and house were all in liss name so when tonightafter theyd learned of hrubeks escapeowen had stood before her armed with his black guns lis had looked past his grim mouth and the consuming hunt lust in his eyes and had seen a husband trying the only way he could to fix a love altered by his own carelessness well bless you owen for your errand tonight lis thought taping the last of the windows your efforts are appreciated but hurry home now wont you the wind was rising it drove a whip of rain across the roof and north side of the greenhouse with such a clatter that lis gasped it was time to leave portia lets go ive got a couple more to do she called from upstairs leave em the woman appeared a minute later lis studied her for a moment and was surprised to see that in these country clothes so atypical of portia the sisters looked very much alike what portia asked noting liss gaze nothing you ready lis handed her a yellow rain slicker and pulled her own on portia slung her backpack over one shoulder lifting her small crouch fitzgerald suitcase lis nodded toward the door they walked outside into the rain that now was falling steadily a sudden gust ripped the baseball cap from portias head she shouted in surprise and ran to retrieve the hat while her sister doublelocked the back door and they stepped along the soggy path to the edge of the parking area lis turned to look back at the house with the windows barred by xs of tape and the old warping shingles the colonial had a battleweary air as if it squatted in the middle of a nomansland her eyes were on the greenhouse when she heard her sister ask what is that lis spun around my god spreading out before them was a field of mud and water nearly a foot deep covering much of the driveway and filling the garage they waded through the chill slimy water and gazed at the lake it wasnt their levee that had given way it was the sandbags by the dockthe ones that owen had assured lis hed stacked high and solid the rising lake had pushed them over and the water was backing into the creek behind the garage amid eddies and whirlpools the stream was filling the yard what do we do portia shouted her voice was harsh and unsettling despite the quickmoving current the flood was virtually silent there wasnt much they could do lis decided the water was flowing in through a twentyfoot gaptoo large for the two of them to dam besides the garage was in a lowlying area of the property if the level of the lake didnt rise much more the house and most of the driveway would be safe she said we leave is what we do fine with me they waded into the garage and climbed into the acura lis slipped the key into the ignition she paused superstitiouslyconcerned that the flood had shorted out the battery or ruined the starter she looked at portia then turned the key the engine kicked to life and purred smoothly backing out carefully lis eased the car through the flood up the incline of the driveway they were nearly out of the dark pool surrounding the garage when the car shuddered and the front wheels the drive wheels dug through the gravel and into the slick mud below where they spun uselessly as if they rested in ruts of ice this lis recalled had been her second concern he eased his bmw around the curve on route and sped out of ridgeton through the cutting rain richard kohler now descended through the hills and swept to the right heading due east once again there it was perfect just perfect he laughed out loud thinking that the scene was far more impressive than hed remembered he pulled into the back of the lot parked and shut the engine off he unzipped his backpack extracting michael hrubeks filethe one hed started to read earlier that evening this battered folio had been penned by sixtyfiveyearold dr anne weinfeldt muller a staff psychiatrist at trevor hill psychiatric hospital trevor hill was a renowned private facility in the southern part of the state michael had been anne mullers patient for merely five months but her insights into his plight and his improvement under her care were inspiring it was kohler reflected a true tragedy that no one would ever know how effective mullers treatment of michael hrubek might have been like kohler anne muller divided her time among various hospitals and happened to have come across michael at a small state facility where she worked with severe schizophrenics impressed by his intelligence and struck by his unusual delusions she campaigned to pry open the doors of expensive trevor hill and have michael admitted as a pro bono patient the hospital administratorspreferring patients that were more mainstream than michael that is able to pay their billshad resisted her efforts at first but had finally acquiesced largely because of her own prestige and talent and pigheaded manner his first day had been spent in a restraint camisole then hed calmed and the feared garment had come off kohler glanced again at mullers notes jotted in the first week of the young mans commitment pt is hostile suspicious afraid of being struck you hit me on the head youre one dead fucker make no mistake no apparent visual hallucinations some auditory motor activity is extreme restraint at times necessary affect flat or inappropriate pt began sobbing when noticed book of american history later pt laughed when asked about maternal grandmother and said she was one dead fucker cognitive functioning good but flights of ideas indicate purely random thinking at times although the many state hospitals in which michael had been committed undoubtedly blended together into a grim stew of memories trevor hill might very well have stood out pleasantly in his mind in state facilities patients wore filthy clothing and sat in drab rooms with blunt crayons or playdoh for entertainment many of the men and women had the indentations of lobotomies on the crowns of their heads and were regularly thirdrailed by electroconvulsiveshock technicians or sent into insulin comas but trevor hill was different there were far more orderlies and doctors per patient than in the state hospitals the library was full of books wards were sunny and windows unbarred the grounds landscaped with trim paths and gardens and rec rooms stocked with learning toys and games ecs was used occasionally but medication was the major tool of treatment yet as with all schizophrenic patients getting the right drug and dosage for michael was a major task one young resident at trevor hill had naïvely asked him what medicines hed taken in the past and the patient answered like a diligent medical student oh lithium generally chlorpromazine and its derivatives are contraindicated for me im a schizophrenicmake no mistake about thatbut a big component of my disease is manicdepression you may know that as bipolar depression so lithium has generally been my drug of choice the impressed resident prescribed lithium and under the drugs effect michael went berserk he threw the wards television through a window leapt out after it and got halfway through the main gate before being tackled by three burly orderlies after this incident dr muller took over treatment personally she put michael on a loading dose of haldola dosage larger than he would ultimately need but intended to stabilize him fast he improved immediately then began the fine tuning balancing the drugs effectiveness against the side effects of weight gain dry mouth the uncontrollable moving of the lips that antipsychotic drugs cause the nausea his regimen included at various times thorazine stelazine mellaril moban haldol and prolixin thirty milligrams of this one hundred of that up it to two hundred no better mix it eighteen hundred of thorazine no go higher switch to haldol ninety milligrams of it well thats the same as fortyfive hundred of thorazine too high hows his dyskinesia okay back to stelazine muller finally settled on what kohler himself found worked best with michael high levels of thorazine michaels treatment consisted of this workhorse drug and his therapy with dr anne she met with him every tuesday and friday and what was distinctive about his sessions with this psychiatrist was that unlike so many of his doctors in the past she listened to what he had to say youve said a couple of times now michael that youre worried about whats ahead do you mean your immediate future i never said that he snapped did you mean something ahead of you in the hallway was someone upsetting you i never said a word like that someones making up things about me the governments usually to blame the fuckers i dont want to talk about it do you mean a head like someones head a skull he blinked and muttered i cant go into it if its not the head maybe you mean someones face whose i cant fucking go into it youre going to have to use truth serum on me if you want that information ill bet you have already you may know that as scopolamine he fell silent a smirk upon his face the therapy was no more sophisticated than this like kohler anne muller never tried to dissuade michael of his delusions she dug into them trying to learn what was inside her patient he resisted with the resilience of a captured spy but after four months michaels paranoid and contrary nature suddenly vanished muller herself grew suspiciousshed come to recognize that michael had a calculating streak in him he grew increasingly cheerful and giddy then she learned from the orderlies that hed taken to stealing clothes from the laundry room she assumed that his apparently improved temperament was a ruse to shift suspicion about the theft yet before muller could confront him michael began to deliver the loot to her first two mismatched socks he handed them to her with the bashful smile of a boy with a crush she returned the articles to their owners and told michael not to steal anymore he grew very grave and told her he was unable at this time to make a commitment of that magnitude important principles were involved he continued very important apparently so for the next week she received five tshirts and more socks im giving these clothes to you he announced in a whisper then walked away abruptly as if late for a train the giftgiving went on for several weeks muller was far less concerned about the thefts themselves than understanding what michaels behavior meant then when she was lying in bed at three in the morning the epiphany occurred she sat up stunned in the course of a long disjointed therapy session that day michael had lowered his voice and eyes averted whispered the reason is i want to get my clothes to you dont tell anyone its very risky you have no idea how risky clothes to you close to you i want to get close to you muller bolted from her bed and drove immediately to her office where she dictated a lengthy report that began with a subdued introduction tantamount to a psychiatrists shout of joy major breakthrough yesterday pt expressed desire for emotional connection with dr accompanied by animated affect as the treatment continued michaels paranoia diminished further the thefts stopped he grew more sociable and cheerful and he required less medication than before he enjoyed his grouptherapy sessions and looked forward to outings that had previously terrified him he started doing chores around the hospital helping out the library and gardening staffs michael muller reported had even driven her car several times kohler now looked up from the report and gazed across the gritty parking lot lightning flashed in the west then he read the final entry in the file written in a hand other than anne mullers he found he could picture the scene upon which these notes were based only too well michael lies on his bed looking through a history book when a doctor comes into his room he sits on the bed and smiles at the patient inquiring about the book michael immediately stiffens little sparks of his paranoia begin to burn whore you what do you want im dr klein michael im afraid i have to tell you that dr muller is sick sick dr anne is sick im afraid shes not going to be meeting with you michael doesnt know what to say tomorrow he manages to blurt wondering what this man has done with his doctor and friend will i see her tomorrow no shes not coming back to the hospital she left me actually michael she didnt leave you she left all of us she passed away last night do you know what it means passed away it means some fucker shot her in the head he answers in an ominous whisper was it you she had a heart attack michael blinks a number of times trying to comprehend this finally a bitter smile snaps onto the patients face she left me he begins nodding as if relieved to hear longanticipated bad news your new doctor is stanley williams the man continues soothingly hes an excellent psychiatrist he trained at harvard and he worked at nimh thats the national institutes for mental health hows that for credentials michael very sharp fellow youll be pleased to know hes going to the doctor manages to dodge the chair which splinters against the wall with the sound of a gunshot he leaps into the corridor the heavy oak door restrains michael for about ten seconds then he finishes kicking his way into the hall and storms through the hospital to find his dr anne he breaks the arm of an orderly who tries to subdue him and they finally net him like an animal a nineteenthcentury technique that had been used at trevor hill only once since it opened one week later his advocate and therapist dead michael hrubek and his sole material possessionstoothbrush clothes and several books of american historywere shipped to a state mental hospital his life was once again about to become an endless stream of pill time and meal time and shock time and it would have too except that after sitting in the hospitals intake waiting room for two hours temporarily forgotten about he grew agitated and strolled out the front door he waved goodbye to a number of patients and orderlies hed never met and continued through the gate never to return dr richard kohler noted that the date of that disappearance had been exactly fourteen months ago the next official record about michael hrubek was an arrest report written by the unsteady hand of a trooper at indian leap state park on the afternoon of may the psychiatrist set aside anne mullers file and picked up the small notebook filled with the jottings he had made at lis atchesons house but before he read he stared for a moment outside at the drops of thick rain that rattled on the windshield and he wondered just how much longer hed have to wait whered you find this under the bed up a tree in between mona the moaners legs peter grimes didnt respond and to his great relief the hospital director seemed to forget the question my god hes been talking to dmh for three months three fucking months and look at all of this look adler seemed almost more astonished at the volume of paperwork that richard kohler had generated than by the contents of those papers grimes noticed that his boss was touching the sheets rather gingerly as if afraid of getting his fingerprints on them this was perhaps grimess imagination but it made the young doctor extremely uncomfortablelargely because it seemed like an excellent idea one he wished had occurred to him earlier before hed left the evidence of his identity imprinted all over the documents adler looked up his thoughts hovering and to keep him from asking again where the papers had come from grimes read from the sheet that happened to be faceup in front of the two men dear dr kohler further to your proposal dated september of this year we are pleased to inform you that the finance division of the state department of mental health has provisionally agreed to fund a program for inpatient treatment of severely psychotic individuals according to the guidelines you have set forth in the aforementioned proposal goddamn him adler interjected with such vehemence that grimes was afraid to stop reading a preliminary budget of million dollars covering the first years financial needs for your program has been provisionally approved as agreed funding will come from existing allocations to the state mentalhealth hospital system in order to bypass the necessity of a public referendum but stop he did when adler muttered bypass as if it were an obscenity and snatched away the sheet to read the final paragraph himself this is to confirm that your proposal is conditioned upon approval by the board of physicians of the state department of mental health following your final presentation of the six case studies and verbatims upon which your proposal was based allenton grosz hrubek mcmillan green yvenesky a representative of the board will contact you directly regarding times for oral presentations of those case studies adler slammed the paper to the desk and grimes decided that while his fingerprint paranoia was perhaps misplaced the hospital director should be somewhat more careful if kohler noticed damaged pages he might complain of a suspected theftto which grimes was painfully aware thered been a witness a half hour before the assistant had summoned an irritable slavic janitor to open the door of kohlers office not a seasoned burglar grimes had neglected to send him away and had failed to notice that the squat man planted himself on the threshold to watch with amusement the young doctors heist from start to finish our money hes getting our money on top of everything else and look at this look at it grimes hes using our patients to fuck us hes selling us outour patients our moneyfor his program adler grabbed the phone and made a call as he gazed out the window grimes considered kohlers scheme and he was both shocked and impressed kohler had used michael hrubek as a shining example of how his combination of drugs delusion therapy and milieu resocialization treatment could produce dramatic improvements in chronic dangerous schizophrenic patients the department of mental health had agreed to give kohler a great deal of money and let him create a little fiefdomcarved out of marsden hospital itself at adlers expense no less but of course if hrubek wasnt captured quietly if he injured or killed someone the dmh board of physicians would abort kohlers plan as unworkable and dangerous still it was an admirable scheme grimes thought and he regretted playing a part in the downfall of a talented man one who probably wouldve been a better choice to hitch his star toif of course kohlers career had survived this evening which it surely would not the rain spattered the greasy windows a huge wail of wind ended in a crash of plate glass from somewhere in the courtyard below several other patients had joined patient and a chorus of frightened wailing filled the halls grimes looked absently out the window and tried to avoid thinking about the effect on patients if a tornado touched down nearby adler slammed down the phone and looked at him hes not at the halfway house some son of a bitch tipped him off who kohler he got a call a couple hours ago hes out there hes after hrubek right now by himself he has to go by himself he has to get hrubek to come back like a quiet little lamb then hell claim he simply walked up to him and asked him to come home and the son of a bitch will after kohler hits him with a taser or a tranquilizer gun shit the breakin im sorry the assistant asked cautiously security said somebody broke into the pharmacy tonight right well they said it was a car accident looked like we wont know till morning if anythings missing oh somethings missing you can bet on it that son of a bitch lifted a tranquilizer gun hes going to adler spat out jesus hes going to make hrubek look like the fucking little puppy ive said he is all along jesus lord grimes impersonated a fish again chewing water urgently and wondered aloud what they might do next i want to be ready to preempt the press if this he tried out several words for size before saying if this situation becomes critical if its a worst case yes if its worstcase well have to go public immediately i want a release write it up a press release what else would i mean can you draft one up subject verb subject verb that too much for you and lets go over it you and me say that unbeknownst to staff no say unbeknownst to administrators and officials a private physician with privileges here gave hrubek access to all wards which allowed him to escape say with privileges dont say attending lets confuse the morons then say that this was in defiance defiance of clear instructions that any transfer of section patients must be approved by the office of the director before they go into any milieu group or offward therapy instructions yes well his assistant stammered but there were no instructions to that effect were there oh it made sense yes there probably should be yes but at the moment there were none the memo adler said impatiently dont you remember the memo grimes glanced out the window adler was referring to a directive that required notice to the directors office before criminally insane patients could be moved into medium or lowsecurity wings even temporarilyif for instance the showers on e ward werent working while this was a rule yes it was observed only by the most grimes allowed himself the diagnosis analretentive of the doctors at marsden this seems a little now words evaded assistant grimes and put a copy in here whats the matter i just the issue isnt really access is it well what is the issue adler said this with a sneer in his voice and grimes had an urge to call him a schoolmarm which certainly would have cost him his job faster than jokes about rape kohler doing delusion therapy thats what set hrubek off thats what we can hang him with this was adler reflected a good point hrubeks roaming the halls near the morgue was essentially the orderlies fault they missed his medicine stockpile and they were careless with callaghans body but kohlers sin as grimes accurately pointed out was far more serious he had somehow awakened hrubeks desire to escape the means were largely irrelevant those fantasies ought to have been tucked away inside hrubek tucked away very deeplyor better yet behaviorially conditioned out of him say what you might electrodes and food could turns rats into quite model animals why witness young grimes still the hospital director assessed kohlers errors would be tough to sell to the publicsimple people who would want simple answers in the event that hrubek knifed a trooper to death or raped a girl he thanked grimes for his insight and then added lets just lay the access issue at our friends feet shall we by the time its all sorted out hell be everybodys whipping boy and no onell really care exactly what he did and his assistant pleased to have been patted on the head nodded instantly dont be too specific we have to massage the facts say because of his involvement in kohlers program hrubek was free to get into the freezer the morgue and the loading dock none of the other section criminally insane have that access thats true isnt it it was grimes confirmed but for his involvement in the program he never wouldve escaped sine qua non you want me to say that well not sine qua non obviously you know what im saying you get the picture and dont use kohlers name not at first make it sound like were concerned about you know his reputation good yes his reputation the only mechanic answering the phone tonight was in roenville about fifteen miles west on route the man chuckled and answered that sure he had a truck but itd be four or five hours before he could get somebody over to ridgeton already got three roads out in this part of the county alone and my menre getting a wreck off putnam valley highway injuries mess of em hell of a night just one hell of a night so you wanna go on the list lis said thats okay and hung up she then called the ridgeton sheriff s department why hello mrs atcheson the dispatcher answered respectfully the womans daughter was in liss class parents tended to address her as formally as their children did how you weatherin the storm tonight so to speak ha its something isnt it were getting by say peg is stan around nup not a soul here everybodys out even fred bertholder and hes got the flu like nobody oughta have and they didnt cancel that rock concert like they oughtave can you believe that a lotta youngsters got stranded what a mess have you heard anything from marsden hospital about hrubek whod that be that man who escaped tonight oh him you know stan called the state police about that just fore he went out hes in massachusetts hrubek in massachusetts yesm youre sure they tracked him to the state line then our boys had to call off the search handed it over to the mass troopers theyre topnotch at finding people even though they dont have any sense of humor thats what stan says have they have they found him i dont know the stormll hit there in an hour hour and a half so i dont suppose a druggedup psychos a real high priority but thats me speaking not them they might not take to madmen from out of state being so serious and all you know mrs atcheson been meaning to speak to you about that cminus amy got could we talk about it next week peg absolutely its just that irv coached her like a demon and he reads all the time knows his literature and i dont mean just schlock either he read last of the mohicans even before it was a movie next week absolutely good night to you mrs atcheson she hung up and wandered out to portia who stood sipping a coke on a small screenedin porch off the kitchen they didnt use the place much for entertaining the sun never reached it and the view of the yard and lake was all but cut off by a tall growth of juniper this is pretty her sister commented running her hand along an elaborate railing of mahogany carved in the shapes of flowers vines and leaves the wind blew an aerated mist of icy rain toward the house and the women stepped back suddenly thats right you havent seen it lis had noticed the balustrade at an upstate demolition site and knew at once that she had to have it in one of her brashest moments shed laid quick cold dollars into the ponderous hands of the wreckingcrew captain it was probably an illicit deal for he turned his back as she dragged off the delicate sculpture which she then spent another two thousand dollars incorporating into the railing here friends wondered why such a beautiful piece of woodwork accented a dark outoftheway porch like this but the carving had one frequent admirer lis herself spent many nights here bedded down in a chaise longue shed commandeered for the times when the insomnia was particularly bad the porch was open on three sides if there was wind the breezes flowed over her as she lay beneath the blankets and if there was rain the sound was hypnotic even when owen was away on business shed often come down here she supposed it was risky being alone and so exposed to the night yet the game of finding sleep is a crucible of tradeoffs and an insomniac cant afford the luxury of separating slumber and vulnerability i heard portia said no tow truck nope can we walk two miles in this rain and wind lis laughed rather not what about hrubek supposedly in massachusetts so why dont we just sit it out get a fire going and tell ghost stories if only theyd left twenty minutes sooner angrily lis remembered kohler if he hadnt stopped by theyd be at the inn by now she felt a chill thinking that it was as if michael hrubek had sent an agent to detain her portia asked well were staying overhead the wind sliced through the treetops with a hissing soundthe noise electric trains makeof motion not propulsion the rain pounded the soaked earth no lis said finally were leaving lets get some shovels and dig out the car animals are far easier than humans to pursue for long distances for three reasons they eat whenever theyre hungry they dont control elimination of wastes they have limited options for locomotion the world at large trenton heck reflected may have considered michael hrubek an animal but so far his journey west had all the trappings of a trip by a damn clever human being heck was in despair the driving rain had virtually erased all the airborne scent and he could find no other evidence of hrubeks trail emil had quartered again and again over the highway and surrounding fields for an hour and had found nothing but now just outside of cloverton heck found that the madman had lapsed momentarily his animals impulse to eat had overcome his need for evasion at first heck didnt think anything of the hostess doughnut box lying in the driveway of the old gas station then he noticed it wasnt empty this said to him that it couldnt have been there more than a half hour no selfrespecting raccoon he concluded would let pastry sit uneaten for longer than that as heck and emil walked up to the box the dog immediately tensed heck knew this had nothing to do with a canine fondness for sugar and grease and he scanned the ground carefully there hrubeks boot prints just visible on the concrete apron near the pumps all right his heart thudded at this good luck just west of the station heck found a tread mark in the dirt beside the highway for some reason hrubek was now keeping to the shoulder and in the rain it was easy to follow the tread by sight heck and emil returned to the truck and drove west he saw that the track continued only for another hundred yards or so then cut suddenly across the highway aiming directly for a long driveway or private road heck stopped the truck and got emil harnessed up once again shortlined because of hecks fear of the traps he picked up the scent immediately and together man and dog crashed through brush the hound in heavenhis coat glistening with misty rain his lungs filling with great gulps of cool air his familiar master beside him his simple dogs mind and solid body doing what god had created them for as they ran heck remembered another dog who loved fields sally dodgesons st anneemils predecessor sal was a smarter dog than emil and with a faster gait and lither step those last two qualities however had been her downfall she developed the curse of large working dogs hip dysplasia heck retired her early and spent the bulk of hisand jillssparse savings on operations the surgery was not successful and it was a terrible thing to watch sal a young invalid staring at the fields shed loved to run through often she made pathetic attempts to escape and heck would have to go retrieve the struggling animal carrying her in his arms his heart as broken as hers the condition and the pain that accompanied it grew worse on the last visit to the vet heck himself took the syringe from the doctor and injected the lethal dosage oh it was a hard thing to do and he wept but trenton heck would let no stranger put down a dog of his when he returned home jill asked too improvidently for his taste would you cry for me that way heck was stung but he told her the truth and said of course he would but the timing of his response was somehow off and jill got huffy she went out that night with her girlfriends a batch of funloving waitresses and he mourned alone which was his preference anyway the next morning at seven jill having returned just three hours before heck arose by himself and went to the breeder to talk about bloodhound pups heck had used a classic doghandlers trick to pick emil out of a litter of five mournfullooking irresistibly adorable bloodhound puppies the breeder set up a piece of quarterinch plywood next to the pen where the young pups were playing in the middle of the board was a tiny hole heck crept up to the wood sheet and unseen by the litter watched through the hole as they rolled and nipped and tried out their long legs in a few minutes one of the puppies lifted his head with a spark of curiosity in his eyesa glint clearly visible despite the folds of skin that nearly obscured them he tilted his head back and looked around then stumbled toward the hole behind which was trenton hecks right eye the dog sniffed the alien scent for two minutes before becoming bored and returning to romp with his sorrowfulfaced brothers and sisters the next day heck did the same thing and again the ungainly puppy tripping over his huge ears and paws was drawn to investigatewhile his siblings slept or played oblivious to the intruder when the next week the dog passed the scent test three for three trenton heck stood scooped up the dog and onehanded wrote a very large check to the breeder when emil was twelve months old the training started heck used only inductive trainingdispensing rewards never punishing during the first six months of this work hecks slacks stank of the meaty dog treats then he weaned the dog off food and onto praise as a reward tool the training was a thousand times harder on heck than on emil who had only to learn what commands to obey and to grasp how those words related to using his nose to do what it wanted to anyway heck on the other hand had to make sure the training remained fun smart dogs like emil get bored easily and heck was forced to devise ways to keep the scenting interesting but feasible knowing when to stop for the day figuring out when emil was frustrated or horny or in a bad moodthose were his tasks he had to pick scent articles that were challenging but not impossible a scrap of leather was too easy bic pens and jills trashy romance novels too hard heck who at the time had a fulltime trooper job and a wife who ate up much of his time would rise at am to train his hounda hardship for him but not for emil who woke immediately and joyously knowing he was on his way to the fields oh trenton heck worked he knew the old tracking adage if youre not handling the dog right its your fault if the dogs not tracking right its your fault but emil did track right he had a remarkable noseone of the few in his vets estimation that were two or three million times more sensitive than a human nose he learned fast and the hound so exploited his nature that heck whose marriage was rocky and whose job was going nowhere occasionally felt bad watching this astonishing dog and lamented that he himself had no consuming skill or drive to match emils after six months of training emil could follow a mileandahalf trail in record time shaming the german shepherds that were the troops unofficial trackers by age two emil had his american kennel club td classification and a month later heck took him up to ontario where he was awarded his tracking dog excellent certification by pursuing a stranger over a thousandyard trail that was five hours old never hesitating on the turns or the crosstracks meant to confuse the hound after the tde rating emil more or less joined havershams troop to which heck was assigned though the state technically had no budget for dogs the troop did however spring for membership dog and man in the national police bloodhound association which two years ago gave emil the famed cleopatra award for finding a lost boy whod fallen into the marsden river and been swept downstream in a heavy current after which hed wandered deep into a state park the trail through water marsh cornfields and forest was hours olda record for the state heck had taken to reading a lot about bloodhounds and believed that emil was the descendant spiritual there being no true lineage of the greatest of all tracking bloodhounds nick carter who was run by captain volney mullikin down in kentucky at the turn of the century a dog credited with more than finds resulting in criminal convictions emil himself had put a fair number of people behind bars much tracking work involves trailing suspects from crime scenes or linking weapons or loot to defendants emil because of his akc papers and his solid history of tracking was a permitted witness though he appeared on the stand through his spokesman one trenton heck most of the dogs assignments however involved locating escapees like michael hrubek tonight in fact it was the anticipated triumph in tracking down the psycho and earning heck his reward that preoccupied him as they pushed through the brush he should have had his mind on what he was doing though for he didnt see the spring trap until emil stepped right onto it no he cried jerking back hard on the line pulling the hound off balance oh no whatd i do but emil had already fallen sideways onto the large ottawa manufacturing trap he yelped in pain oh jesus emil heck dropped to his knees over the animal thinking about splints and the emergency vet clinics frighteningly aware that he had no bandages or tourniquets to staunch the flow of blood from a severed vein or artery as he reached for his dog however his trooper instincts took over and he realized that the trap might be a diversion hes waiting for meits a trick heck flicked rain from his eyes lifting the walther and spun about wondering from which direction the madman would come charging at him he paused momentarily debated and when he heard nothing turned back to emil hed have to risk an attack he wasnt going to leave the dog unattended holstering the gun he reached for emil hecks hands shaking and his heart only now beginning to pulse quickly in the aftermath of the fright but the dog suddenly shook himself snootily and stood upright unharmed what had happened heck gazed at the animal who as far as he could tell had landed square on the burnished trigger plate of the trap then he understoodthe jaws had been sprung before emil stepped on the trigger oh lord he gripped the dog around his neck and hugged him hard lord the dog eased back and shook his head embarrassment now piled on top of his indignation heck crouched down and examined the trap it was identical to those at the shop on route hrubek obviously had set it but how had it been sprung there were two possibilities heck supposed first that a small animal its head lower than the steel jaws had bounded onto the trigger and set it off the second possibility was that someone had come by seen the trap and popped it with a stick or rock this heck decided was the likely explanationbecause next to the trap he saw several bootprints in the mud one set was hrubeks but someone else had been here as well he looked closely at the prints and his heart plummeted oh damn he whispered bitterly he recognized the sole hed seen these printsof expensive l l bean outdoorsmans bootsearlier in the evening not far from the overhang where he and emil had picked up hrubeks westward trail miles back so ive got some competition here who is it he wondered a plainclothes trooper or cops maybe or more likelyand more troublinga bounty hunter like heck himself seeking the reward money heck thought of adler had he sent an orderly to find the patient was the hospital director playing a game of ends against the middle with the stake being hecks reward money he rose and clutching his gun examined the two mens tracks carefully hrubek had continued south along the private road the other tracker was coming from that direction and heading back toward route hed done so after hrubeksome of his prints covered the madmansand hed been running as if hed learned where hrubek was headed and was in pursuit heck followed the l l bean prints to the highway and found where the man had stopped and studied a tread mark left recently by a heavy car the tracker had then sprinted to the shoulder of route where hed climbed into a vehicle and hurried west spinning his wheels furiously from the tread marks it was clear that the man was driving a truck with fourwheel drive the scene told him that michael hrubek had got himself a vehicle and was probably just minutes ahead of this other pursuer heck looked around the turbulent night sky and saw a distant flash of silent lightning he wiped the rain from his face he debated for a long moment and finally concluded he had no choice even emil couldnt track prey inside a moving car heck would speed west down the highway relying on luck to reveal some sign of the preys whereabouts ill leave the belt off emil heck said leading the dog into the pickup but you sit tight were gonna waste some fuel here the hound sank down on hecks outstretched leg and as the truck sped onto the highway with a gassy roar closed his droopy eyelids and dozed off seven miles outside of cloverton along route owen spotted the car parked by the roadside near a stand of evergreens oh you smart son of a bitch he drove past the old cadillac then abruptly slowed and turned off the road parking the truck in a cluster of juniper and hemlock hed gambled and hed won about time he thought im due for a little luck walking over the grounds at the murder site in cloverton owen had noticed that two of the small barns near the house contained antique autos hed slipped inside and looked under the blue wolf car covers to find an old pontiac chief a hudson a purple studebaker in one building a stall was empty and the car cover was dropped in a heap on the floorthe only disorder in the entire barn his inclination was to dismiss the possibility of hrubeks stealing such an obvious getaway car but remembering the bicycle owen yielded to his instincts and after a search of the ground he found recent tread marks of a heavy auto leading from the barn down the driveway and then west on route without a word to the cloverton police hed left the house and sped not to boyleston but after the old car now he climbed from the truck and walked back toward the cadillac the sound of his passage obscured by the steady rain and sharp slashes of wind he paused and squinted into the night sixty seventy feet away a large form stood with his back to owen urinating on a bush the mans bald head was tilted back as he looked up into the sky staring at the rain he seemed to be singing or chanting softly owen crouched down slipping his pistol from his belt he considered what to do next when it had seemed that hrubek was heading for the house in ridgeton owen had planned simply to follow him there and then slip into the house ahead of him if the madman broke in owen would simply shoot him maybe hed slip a knife or crowbar into the mans handto make a tidier scene for the prosecutor but now hrubek had a car and it occurred to owen that maybe ridgeton wasnt his destination after all maybe he really would turn south and make for boyleston or simply keep going on and drive to new york or even further west besides here was his quarry defenseless unsuspecting alonean opportunity owen might not have again wherever hrubek was ultimately headed he made his decision better to take the man now but what about the cadillac he could leave his truck here dump the body in the trunk of the old car then drive it to ridgeton himself once there hed lug the body inside the house and but no of course not the blood the hollow points would cause a lot of damage some forensic technician was sure to examine the cadillacs trunk after a moment of debate owen concluded that hed simply leave the car here hrubek was crazy hed become scared of driving and had abandoned it continuing on foot to ridgeton it occurred to him too that he probably shouldnt kill hrubek herethe coroner might be able to determine that hed died an hour or so before owen claimed he had he decided that hed just immobilize hrubek nowshoot him in the upper arm and in the leg owen would lug him into the back of the cherokee and drive on to ridgeton and there the patient would be found in the atchesons kitchen owen would be sitting in the living room staring numbly out the window staggered by the tragedy of it allhaving fired two shots to try to stop him and finally a third a lethal bullet when the big man would not heed owens orders to halt the blood in the cherokee well that was a risk but hed park it behind the garage thered be no reason for any investigators to see it let alone have a forensics team go through the truck he analyzed the plan in detail deciding that yes it was chancy but the risks were acceptable cocking the pistol he made his way closer to the looming shape of hrubek whod now finished his business and was staring up at the turbulent sky listening to the sharp hiss of the wind in the tips of the pine trees and letting the rain fall into his face owen got no further than five steps toward his prey before he heard the distinctive double snap of a pump shotgun and saw the policeman aim the muzzle at his chest on the ground freeze the young mans trembling voice called what are you doing owen cried freeze drop your gun drop that gun then hrubek was running a thick dark mass fleeing toward the cadillac im not going to tell you again the cops voice was high with panic you fucking idiot owen yelled his temper flaring he stepped toward the cop the trooper lifted the shotgun higher owen froze and dropped the smith wesson okay okay the sound of the cadillac firing to life filled the clearing as the car sped past them the trooper glanced in shock at the sound owen easily shoved the shotgun muzzle to the side and drove his right fist into the side of the troopers face the young man dropped like deadweight and owen was on him in a minute slugging the trooper again and again anger exploding within him gasping he finally managed to control himself and looked down at the bloody face of the unconscious cop fuck he spat bitterly the sudden crack sounded some yards behind him it seemed like a gunshot and owen dropped into a crouch snatching up his pistol he heard nothing else other than the wind and the drumming of the rain the distant horizon lit up for a moment with huge sheets of lightning he turned back to the cop and handcuffed the mans wrists behind his back he then stripped off the regulation patentleather belt and bound the officers feet he stared in disgust for a moment wondering if the trooper had gotten a good look at him probably not he concluded it was too dark he himself hadnt seen the cops face at all hed most likely figure that hrubek himself had attacked him owen ran back to his truck he closed his eyes and slammed his fist on the hood no he shouted at the wet breezy sky no the left front tire was flat he bent down and noted that the bullet that had torn through the rubber was from a mediumcaliber pistol a or mm probably as he hurried to get the jack and spare he realized that in all his plans for this evening this was something that hed never consideredthat hrubek might be inclined to defend himself with a gun they stood side by side holding longhandled shovels and dug like oyster fishermen beneath the brown water for their crop of gravel their arms were in agony from filling and lugging the sandbags earlier in the evening and they could now lift only small scoops of the marble chips which they then poured around the sunken tires of the car for traction their hair now dark their faces glossy with the rain they lifted mound after mound of gravel and listened with some comfort to the murmuring of the cars engine from the radio drifted classical music interrupted by occasional news broadcasts which seemed to have no relation to reality one fm announcersedated by the sound of his own voicecame on the air and reported that the storm front should hit the area in an hour or two jesus christ portia shouted over the pouring rain doesnt he have a window apart from this they worked silently this is mad lis thought as the wind slung a gallon of rain into her face nuts yet for some reason it felt oddly natural to be standing in calfhigh water beside her sister wielding these heavy oakhandled tools there used to be a large garden on this part of the propertybefore father decided to build the garage and had the earth plowed under for several seasons the lauberget girls grew vegetables here lis supposed that they might have stood in these very spots raking up weeds or whacking the firm black dirt with hoes she remembered stapling seed packets to tongue depressors and sticking them into the earth where theyd planted the seeds the envelopes contained thatll show the plants what to look like so theyll know how to grow lis had explained to portia who being four bought this logic momentarily theyd laughed about it afterwards and for some years vegetable pinups had been a private joke between them lis wondered now if portia too recalled the garden maybe if she did she would take the memory as proof that going into business with her sister might not be as improbable as it seemed lets try it she called through the rain nodding toward the car portia climbed in and with lis pushing eased her foot delicately to the gas the car budged an inch or two but it sank down into the mud almost immediately portia shook her head and got out i could feel it were close just a little more the rain pours as they resume shoveling lis glances toward her sister and sees her starkly outlined against a flare of lightning in the west she finds herself thinking not about gravel or mud or japanese cars but about this young woman about how portia moved to a tough town how she learned to talk tough and to gaze back at you sultry and defiant wearing her costumes her miniskirts and tulle and nose rings how she glories in the role of the urbane femme lover and yet lis has her doubts tonight for instance portia didnt really seem at ease until she discarded the froufrou clothes ditched the weird jewelry and pulled on baggy jeans and a highnecked sweater and the boyfriends stu randy lee a hundred others for all her talk of independence portia often seems no more than a reflection of the man she is or isnt withprecisely the type of obsolete noxious relationship that she enthusiastically denounces the fact is she never really likes these excessively handsome bedroomeyed boys very much when they leave heras they invariably doshe mourns briefly then heads out to catch herself a fresh one and so lisbonne atcheson is left to wonder as she has frequently who her sister really is is she truly the stranger she seems lis just doesnt know but shes decided to find out if not through the nursery business then in some other way for a thought occurred to her recentlynot long after indian leap in fact a thought she just cant shake that the only way the dark heritage of the laubergets can be redeemedif it can be redeemed at allis through the two surviving members of the family these two together she cant say exactly why she wants this reconciliation but nonetheless lis feels inexplicably that this is something she must try as a student told her last week after she caught him cheating hey you play the odds they sling more gravel as the rain falls heavily in thick dashes through the cars white headlight beams then the stuffy announcer fades in to tell his listeners that coming up next will be handels water music hes apparently oblivious to the joke and moves on to other news while the sisters look at each other for an instant and laugh then return to their task the cadillac raced down the highway amid the sticky rush of thick tires on wet asphalt and the hum of the grand engines eight calm cylinders michael hrubek was still anxious from the runin with the conspirators twenty minutes before the fuckers hed escaped yes but his hands quivered violently and his heart pounded his mind kept slipping off track and hed forget where he was and what he was doing the echo of the guns loud crack the memory of the feel as it jumped in his hand were prominent in his thoughts cadillac he sang frantically hard tack sic semper tyranak dr anne wont you come back after the death of dr anne muller michael began to wander he occasionally spent time in state hospitals but lived mostly on the street surviving on cheese sandwiches from social workers and scrounging through dumpsters outside restaurants he was ravaged by anxiety and paranoia though the latter condition had a positive consequence fearing drugs all of which he believed to be poisonous he remained uninfected by aids hepatitis and other serious illnesses after several months in the northeast he meandered south to washington dc intending to apologize for his past crimes to andrew johnson ulysses s grant or the current president whomever he met first he managed to get to the white house gate and knocked on the door of the guards station its vital that i talk to you about this assassination business john guard its vital picked up bang by the secret service that was stupid he told himself glumly as he waited in an interrogation room somewhere in the treasury department shouldntve done that but he wasnt tortured as hed expected he was simply asked a series of what he called mindmessing questions and released after two hours he knew that during the session the agents had somehow planted a tracking device in his body and he threw himself in the reflecting pool of the washington monument to short out the battery he felt better after this dip and moved into arlington national cemetery where he lived for a month finally he grew bored with the capital and wandered back north looking for his father after a month of sporadic searching michael believed he found his familys house in an old neighborhood of philadelphia he walked through the unlocked front door to see if anyone was home someone was though it turned out to be not his father but the wife of a police detective picked up bang for that one too released the next day he hiked all the way to gettysburg and lay in the middle of the battlefield howling in shame for his role in ending the life of the greatest president the united states had ever known picked up bang phillie newark princeton new york white plains bridgeport hartford that was michaels life hospitals and the street he slept in boxes he bathed in rivers when he bathed and he wandered purposefully every day was an intense experience he saw truths with a piercing clarity there were truths everywhere raw and painful truths in red cars zipping down the street in the motion of a tugboat easing into a slip in the part of a teenage boys hair in a symmetrical display of watches in a jewelrystore window he considered each of these revelations always wondering if it might ease the burden of his anxiety and fear did it say something to him did it offer solace michael met people in his wanderings and they sometimes took to him if he was clean and was wearing clothing recently given to him by a priest or social worker someone might sit beside him on a park bench as he read a book with a penguin classic in your hand you were easily forgiven rumpled clothes and a short stubble of beard like any businessman out on a fine sunday afternoon michael would cross his legs revealing sockless ankles in brown loafers hed smile and nod and avoiding the subjects of murder rape and the secret service talk only about what he saw in front of him sparrows bathing in spring dust trees children playing flag football he had conversations with men who might have been chief executives of huge corporations this nomadic life finally came to an unpleasant end in january of this year when he was arrested and charged with breaking into a store in a small affluent town fifty miles south of ridgeton hed shattered the window and torn apart a female mannequin he was examined by a courtappointed psychiatrist who believed there were sexual overtones to the vandalism and declared him violently psychotic giving his name as michael w booth he was involuntarily committed and sent to cooperstown state mental hospital there even before an intake diagnostic interview michael was shuttled into the hard ward still in a restraint camisole he was deposited in a cold dark room where he remained for three hours before the door opened and a man entered a man bigger even than michael himself whore you michael challenged are you john wilkes orderly do you work for the government ive been to washington dc the capital of this great country who the hell do you shut the fuck up john orderly slammed him into the wall and then shoved him to the floor dont scream dont shout dont talk back just shut the fuck up and relax michael had shut the fuck up but he hadnt relaxed nobody relaxed at cooperstown this was a place where patients simply gave up surrendering to their madness michael spent much time sitting by himself looking out windows jiggling his legs with nervous energy repeatedly muttering a single songold folks at home the staff psychologist who spent about seven minutes a week with michael never pursued this compulsion but if he had hed have found that the old stephen foster song contained the line oh darkie how my heart is yearning which to michael referred not to a slave but to darkness specifically night night brought the hope of sleep and sleep was the only time when he was at peace in this terrible place cooperstownwhere nurses would put two women patients in a room together with a single oiled coke bottle and watch from the door cooperstownwhere john orderly would bend michael over the tin washbasin and press into him again and again the pain crying up through his ass into his jaw and face the cold metal of the orderlys keys bouncing on the patients thigh and matching the rhythm of his thrusts cooperstown where michael slipped far far from reality and came to believe with certainty that he was living in the time of the civil war in his month on the hard ward michael had access to only one book it was about reincarnation and after reading it a dozen times he understood how he could in fact be john wilkes booth he carried booths soul around with him the spirit had flown from the old wounded body and circled for a hundred years it alighted upon the head of michaels mother just as the baby struggled out of her leaving the red marks on her stomach that she had told him were his fault but not to worry about yes within him was the soul of mr john wilkes booth a fair actor but a damn good killer one day in march of this year john orderly took michael by the arm and pushed him into suzies room he slammed the door shut and aimed the video camera through the window they were alone michael and this twentyfouryearold patient on whose pretty face was only one blemisha tiny indentation of scar in the middle of her forehead suzie looked at michael carefully with her sunken eyes she was someone whose only earthly power was in knowing what was expected of her she observed that michael was a man and immediately hiked her skirt over bulging thighs down went her panties and she rolled onto her hands and knees and michael knowing that john orderly was just outside the door also knew what to doexactly the same pants down on his hands and knees here they remained butts bare to the world while john orderly fled down the hallway when a doctor unexpectedly happened by the psychiatrist glanced inside the room and opened the door he inquired what the patients were doing michael answered waiting for john orderly im ready for him and so is she make no mistake like all men of medicine john orderlys got a very big cock oh my god the investigation resulted in the dismissal of five orderlies two nurses and two doctors from cooperstown michael however never learned john orderlys fate because as one of the most victimized patients he was immediately transferred out of the hard ward into the voluntarycommitment section of the hospital due to stabilization of his condition the report said prognosis for improvement fair to good in fact michael was far sicker than when hed been admitted but the administrators wanted to isolate him from the questioning reporters and state mentalhealth examiners who descended on the hospital to investigate what one newspaper dubbed psycho ward atrocities reforms were instituted the reporters went elsewhere for their stories and cooperstown fell from the public eyejust as michael himself was largely forgotten within the halls of the hospital a month after the scandal he was still a resident of the cooperstown soft ward one weekend he found himself unusually agitated on saturday evening the anxiety increased to massive proportions and he began to feel the walls of his room closing in on him breathing grew difficult he suspected the secret service was behind this agents frequently bombarded him with beams that electrified his nerves michael didnt know that his anxiety was due not to the federal government but to something much simpler his medication instructions had been misplaced and hed received no haldol for four days finally in desperation he decided to find the one person in his recent memory who might help him he had he recalled accused dr anne of being a conspirator and had even announced on hundreds of occasions that he was happy she was dead he decided that the only way to find relief was to retract his cruel pronouncements and apologize to her he spent the night plotting his escape from cooperstown a plan that involved diversionary fires and costumes and disguises the elaborate scheme proved unnecessary however because on sunday morning he simply dressed in jeans and a tshirt and walked out the front gate of the hospital right past a guard unaware that he was a hard ward patient in the soft ward wing michael had no idea exactly where dr anne might be but he knew trevor hill was in the southern part of the state and that was the direction in which he started to jog that spring morning soon he became lost in a tangle of country roads and the more lost he became the greater was his anxiety panic crawled over his skin like hives at times he took to sprinting as if fear were an animal snapping at his heels other times he hid in bushes until he felt unseen pursuers pass him by once he summoned up his courage and climbed onto the back of a flatbed truck on which he rode for an hour hiding under the canvas tarps until the driver stopped at a roadside diner noticing that there were four trucks parked in the lot and fearing this very unlucky number michael leapt off and escaped down a nearby country lane around noon he found himself in the middle of a large parking lot he paused caught his breath and walked through the lot toward a row of trees nauseous with anxiety he ran through the lot and disappeared into the bushes just beyond the large wooden sign he glanced at the words that were carved into it as if by a huge woodburning iron welcome to indian leap state park michael hrubek thought of that day now six months later as he steered his black cadillac over the crest of a hill on route he saw before him a long smooth straightaway sailing into a distance filled with flashes of lightning and the soft glow of lights that perhaps were those of ridgeton he cringed as rain clattered on the roof and windshield betrayal he muttered then he repeated the word bellowing he was scalded with anxiety eve of betrayal fuckers in an instant his pulse rate leapt to and sweat sprung from his pores his teeth clattered like galloping hooves on concrete his mind snapped shut he forgot get to he forgot lisbone he forgot eve the conspirators and dr anne and dr richard he forgot everything but the icy clutch of fear his hands quavered on the steering wheel he gazed at the cadillacs hood with shockas if hed suddenly awakened and found himself riding a rampaging bull ill fight this he thought god please help me fight this he lowered his head and chewed on his inner cheek he tasted blood i will fight it and for a very brief moment he did for a very brief moment he gripped the ivory wheel firmly and forced the car back into the right lane of the highway for this brief moment michael hrubek was not a maladroit lunatic a host holding an ancient killers soul he was not driven by unbearable guilt abraham lincoln was merely a great sad figure from history whose face graced copper pennies and michael himself was just a big strong young man filled with much promise driving a gaudy old car down a country road scared to death yes but more or less in charge of himself and then this delusion vanished he could fight it no longer he lost all conception of the controls and it was the pedal on the right upon which he stamped his huge foot in an effort to stop the skid he covered his eyes howled a plea for help and kept his foot to the floorboard as the car disappeared into a low stand of juniper and began turning over and over and over youve got this thing to do ahead of you owen atcheson remembered his platoon lieutenant looking steeleyed and crazed from hits of local funnydust but sounding calm as a college professor youve got this thing ahead of you and youve got to go out and meet it owen and three other marines more often than not rolled their eyes at this pep talk but inspired by it nonetheless they then clipped on their gear and blackened their faces and disappeared into the jungle to cut the throats of thin soldiers or murder politicians with silenced pistols or rig gelignite and c satchel charges owen thought of those times nowas he stood on the ridge of a hill looking at the antique cadillac that sat upright its roof halfstaved in and windows spidered with fractures one parking lamp the only light that had survived the crash he opened the cylinder of his gun hed owned revolvers all his life and fastidious about safety had always kept the chamber under the hammer empty he now loaded a sixth shell into the gun and swung the cylinder closed he started toward the car the incline was steep and owen needed one hand to steady himself as he climbed down to a low hedge he felt a stunning exhilaration and told himself that he shouldnt be enjoying this so much the thrill diminished when he recalled that hrubek was armed and saw that there was no way to approach the car under cover it had crashed through a line of juniper and tumbled for thirty feet into the center of a grassy clearing the rain wasnt heavy and the wind was subdued his approach would be noisy and hrubekassuming his injuries hadnt prevented him from doing sohad also had plenty of time to establish a defensive position owen considered tactics for a moment then decided not to bother with a cautious approach he clutched the gun hard inhaled long then ran at top speed ready to aim and shoot from a tumbling position as he sped across the grass a primitive howl bubbled in his throat and he suppressed the urge to let this grow into the marines battle cry he charged the car straight on and slid into the grass like a runner stealing home ending up behind the rear bumper the muddy leaves scattered by his run settled around him and he looked about frantically the rear windshield was less obscured than the others but he still was unable to tell if hrubek was inside he crouched using the trunk as cover and looked behind the car nothing he moved toward the rear door underneath owen dropped to his stomach with a grunt and aimed the gun under the car a shattered pipe hung like an arm and startled him but hrubek wasnt hiding there he stood and breathed deeply several times then switched his gun to his left hand and yanked the cars right rear door open empty the cadillac held no evidence of michael hrubek other than a smell of animallike musk and sweat and fragments of shattered animal skullslike the one hrubek had left on the womans lap in the house in cloverton the keys were in the ignition owen stood and looked around him the spongy leaves had left no footprints and there was no sign of blood or other trail owen stepped behind the cadillac and turned his back to it as he scanned the vast forest damp and gray and dark his heart fell he knew how hard it was to track on wet leaves and through dark woods and after an accident this bad hrubek might be disoriented or stunned and could wander pointlessly in any direction he might the trunk owen cocked the gun and spun on his heels aiming at the broad dented plain of metala perfect hiding place the trunk was secured by a keyhole button butsince the caddie was an older carit did not automatically lock owen approached he touched the cold chrome latch pushed it in the mechanism snapped open he pulled the lid up and leapt back the spacious trunk had ample room for someone as large as michael hrubek but it did not in fact contain him owen turned toward the forest and in a crouch ran to the closest opening in the tall fence of brush and trees in an instant he was swallowed up by the cold darkness around him he shone his shielded flashlight on the ground in a slow u pattern after ten minutes he found two of hrubeks boot prints they led deeper into the forest he smelled pine in the damp air the psycho might have headed out of the deciduous trees and owen would find a clear trail in pine needles he had proceeded only thirty feet when he heard a thud and a snap nearbya careless footstep it seemed he aimed his pistol toward the sound owen gauged his footsteps perfectly and placed them on foliagefree ground making no noise as he moved he crouched pistol in front of him and stepped onto the bed of fragrant needles the man was sitting on a fallen tree trunk and massaging his outstretched leg as if taking a break on a sundayafternoon hike looks like we just missed him the lanky man in a new york mets cap said to owen looking up without a trace of surprise in his face so youre the other bounty hunter guess we got a few things to talk about the woman was thirtysix years old and had lived in this prim little bungalow all her life the past six of those years after her mothers death alone she hadnt seen her father since the day the old man got his other daughter pregnant was arrested for it and taken away one week after the trial the sister too moved away the womans life consisted of filling cartons with electronic circuit boards that did something she had no desire to understand of lunch with one or two fellow workers sewing andfor entertainmentchurch and the newspaper on the day of rest and television on the other six the house was an island of caution and simplicity in a grassy clearing carved out of what had been one of the oldest forests in the northeast the half acre of grass was almost a perfect circle and was marred only by a rusted hull of a pickup that would never go anywhere under its own power and a doorless refrigerator her father had been meaning to cart to the dump one saturday morning ten years ago when he chose instead to pay a visit to his daughters bedroom blonde thin and fragile the woman had a plain face and a good figure though on the rare occasions when she and a few girlfriends went to the rocky beach at indian leap or the riverside at klamath falls she would wear a highnecked swimsuit that shed bought mailorder so she wouldnt have to try it on in a store she dated somemostly men she met at churchthough she rarely enjoyed the outings and had recently started to think of herself with some comfort as a spinster tonight shed just finished preparing a bedtime snack of jello with mandarin oranges and a cup of hot milk when she heard the noise in the yard she walked to the window and saw nothing other than blowing leaves and rain then returned to the maple dining table she sat down said grace and put her napkin in her lap then lifted a spoonful of jello as she opened tv guide the knocking on the front door seemed to shake the whole house the spoon fell to the table and the gelatincube wobbled off her lap then escaped onto the floor she stood abruptly and shouted yes who is it im hurt i had an accident can you help me it was a mans voice she hesitated walked to the front door hesitated again then opened it as far as the chain allowed the big fellow was bent over clutching his arm he seemed like a working man who are you i was driving by and my car she rolled over and over oh im hurt please let me in no way on gods green earth thank you very much ill call an ambulance you wait right there the woman closed the door and deadbolted it then went to the table that held the rotarydial phone she picked it up she banged the button down several times and when the silence continued said oh dear it was then that she realized the sound shed heard a few moments before was coming from the place where the phone line ran into the house this thought stayed with her only a moment though because michael hrubek had grown tired of waiting outside and kicked open the door huge and wet he walked into the living room and said nice try but your phone it doesnt work i couldve told you that standing beneath a cluster of thick pine trees which offered some shelter from the streaming rain owen asked how trenton heck happened to find the cadillac i followed his track to cloverton thats where i picked up your prints and tire tread i saw you headed west then i saw the jeep parked up there and figured it might belong to you my dog picked up hrubeks scent right away beside the caddie did the detective have any more news hows that i dont recall his name owen patted his pockets for the card he had been given the detective in cloverton at the house where he killed that woman what heck blurted you didnt know didnt you stop at the house i didnt see a house i hightailed it west as soon as i saw your prints to a troubled trenton heck owen explained about the killing the terrible butchery in cloverton he then told him about the antique cars stowed in a barn i figured hed try to lead us off track with that motorcycle he drove it south a few hundred yards and dumped it in a marsh somewhere to fool everybody id guess then he took the cadillac and came here that man is too damn smart heck asked whats your interest in all this owen stooped down and retied his boots which were muddy and scuffed but looked as expensive as heck had guessed theyd be the tall man stood and said was my friend he killed at indian leap and my wife saw him do it heck nodded thinking that this put a whole new spin on the evening tell you what let me get my dog he stays and keeps quiet when hes told but mostly it addles him he walked off into the woods glancing at the signposts of bushes and trees for direction youre quiet when you move owen said impressed you hunt a bit heck chuckled they found emil sitting nervously shifting weight from paw to paw he calmed as soon as he saw his master owen asked purebred blood edouard montague of longstreet the third hes as pure as they come quite a name thats what he came with but it wouldnt do of course not around here so i call him emil and he answers to it if he ever mates a pure bitch ill have to put his full name on the papers but till then its our secret walking back to the clearing beside heck owen asked howd you follow the scent if he was on a bicycle thats nothing for emil hell hes gone through a foot of snow in a blizzard so you think maybe hes after your wife i dont really know but its too dangerous to leave in the hands of cops who dont know what theyre doing this rankled heck and he said you got your state troopers on the case you know well a lot of mistakesve been made i should tell you owen glanced at hecks pistol you mentioned a bounty youre a professional tracker i hire out my dog yep how muchs the reward hotfaced eyes fixed on the dark forest heck said ten thousand dollars he spoke emphatically as if making clear to owen that even if he was just a hired hand he wasnt coming cheap well then owen said lets go catch this psycho and make you some money what do you say yessir heck roused emil with hrubeks scent and off they went through the woods the track was easy to follow now with abundant ground scent in the moist forest the dogs excitement and the uncanny atmosphere of the woods at night urged them forward in a kind of dazed ecstasy and they could do nothing but give in to this lust they crashed through the brush hrubek couldve heard them coming from a hundred yards away but there was nothing to be done about it they couldnt have both stealth and speed and they chose the latter michael watched her carefully irritated that she was crying so much it made him very anxious the blond woman didnt speak all the points of her faceher nose and chin and cheekboneswere red from the silent tears she quivered and shredded a paper napkin between her fingers while michael paced i had to take down your telephone stop that crying the lines sure to be tapped anyway what she sobbed are you going to do to me he walked through the living room his huge muddy feet pounding on the boards this is a nice place stop crying i like your eyes you dont have masks on them where did you get it the house im speaking of she glanced at the small cap on his head what are you he repeated his question sharply and she stammered my mama died and she left it to me ive got a sister its half hers as if he intended to steal it she added we own it free and clear michael lifted the irish cap by the brim courteously tipping it to her he rubbed his hand over his smooth head in the bright light a residue of the blue ink was still visible he saw her staring at the cap as he replaced it he smiled fashionable isnt it im sorry he frowned my hat fashionable isnt it yes she exclaimed very extremely my car rolled over and over and over she was a good car while she lasted he walked closer and examined her body he thought it was strange that although she was a woman she didnt frighten him maybe because she was so frail he could lift her with one hand and could snap her neck as easily as he had the raccoons earlier in the evening whats that smell oh its woman the smell of woman this brought back an indistinct and troubling memory he felt darkness around him claustrophobia fear rocks and water bad people what was it his anxiety notched up a few degrees he also found he had a fierce erection he sat down so that she wouldnt notice the wind slammed against the windows and the sound of the rain grew louder the clatter of muskets he thought lead balls cracking apart a thousand heads he covered his ears at this unnerving sound after a moment he realized that she was staring at him people are after me he said youre a convict she whispered you escaped from the prison over in hamlin nice try dont expect to get anything out of me you know too much as it is she shivered as he leaned forward and stroked her fine hair thats nice he muttered and youre not wearing a fucking hat good good dont hurt me please ill give you money anything give me a penny i have some savings about three thousand but its in the bank you could meet me there at nine tomorrow youre welcome to michael roared a penny she dug frantically into her purse he looked over her shoulder you dont have a microphone in there a panic button or anything she looked mystified then whispered no im getting you the penny like you asked guilty michael said well you cant be too careful he held out his massive hands and she dropped the coin into his palm he held it up behind her head what sevenletter word is on the penny i dont know guess he said petulantly she wrung her hands together e pluribus unum in god we trust legal tender no united states oh god i cant think then sotto voce she began murmuring the lords prayer its right behind sevenletter abraham lincoln without looking at the coin he said the word is right behind him seven letters like the barrel of a gun pointed at his head he poked her scalp with a blunt finger she closed her eyes and whispered i dont know michael said liberty he dropped the penny on the floor im pretty hungry whats to eat she stopped crying youre hungry she gazed at the kitchen i have some roast beef some vegetarian chili youre welcome to it he walked to the table and sat down easing into the chair he delicately opened a paper napkin it covered only a part of his huge lap she asked can i stand up how can you get me dinner if you dont stand up she hurtled into the kitchen and busied herself preparing a plate while michael sang for i love the bonnie blue gal who gave her heart to me he played with the pepper mill her arms her arms are where i want to be she returned setting a tray in front of him michael roared for i love the bonnie blue gal who gave he stopped abruptly picked up the fork and cut a piece off the beef this together with a portion of jello he put on the pink saucer and placed it in front of her she glanced at the food then looked inquiringly at him i want you to eat that he said ive already oh you think its poison i dont think its poison he sneered i dont think theres a posse outside that window i dont think youre a pinkerton agent but you cant be too careful now come on quit being a shit she ate then she smiled and went blankfaced again he studied her for a moment and set his fork down do you have some milk milk i have lowfat is all is that all right some milk he blared and she jumped to get it when she returned hed already started to eat he drank the glass down taking with it a mouthful of food i used to work in a dairy well yes she nodded politely that must be a nice place to work it was very nice dr richard got me the job who is he he was my father your father was a doctor well he scoffed i dont mean a father like that no she agreed quickly seeing the darkness fall over his face he stopped eating she told him she liked his tweed cap he touched it and smiled i like it too i have hair but i cut it off why did you do that i cant tell you no dont tell me anything you dont want to if i dont want to i wont you dont have to give me permission i wasnt giving you permission i didnt mean to sound like i was you can do whatever you want dont i know it michael cleaned his plate would you like some more milk id like more milk when she was in the kitchen he added please as he took the tall glass from her he intoned in an fm disc jockeys voice a wholesome snack she barked a laugh and he smiled as he poured the milk down she asked what are you doing im drinking milk he answered with exasperation no i mean what are you doing out tonight theres supposed to be a storm like we havent seen in a donkeys age whats a donkeys age he squinted she stared at him with a vacant face uhm now that you ask i dont exactly know it means for a long time is it like an expression is it like a cliché i guess so he stared down his eyes as empty and filmy as the glass in his hand did you know that anger is fivesixths of danger no i didnt but it surely is how about that so there she broke the very dense silence by asking what did you do in the dairy michaels erection had not gone away his penis hurt and this was beginning to anger him he reached into his pocket and squeezed himself then stood and walked to the window he said whats the biggest town near here that has a train station well boyleston i suppose its south about forty fifty miles how would i get there go west to itll take you right there that becomes hubert street and it goes right past the train station amtrak in no time at all no time at all she agreed why are you going there i told you he snapped i cant say her hands went into her lap michael began rummaging through his backpack im sorry im very sorry he said to her but he uttered these words then repeated them with such deep longing that it was clear he was apologizing not for being curt but rather for something elsesomething he was about to do something far graver than bad manners he sat down beside her his thigh pressing hard against hers and as she cried he set a small white animal skull in her lap and very gently began stroking her hair under clouds so fast and turbulent they seemed like special effects from a sciencefiction movie portia lauberget inhaled the scents of decaying leaves and the musky lake several feet away her sister lifted the shovel and dropped a huge pile of gravel around the front wheels of the stranded car the young woman flexed her hands they stung and she supposed the skin was starting to blister from the wet gloves her muscles were on fire her head ached from the pounding rain and she was troubled by something else a vague thoughtsomething other than the storm at first she wondered if it might be the escape yet shed never really believed that someone like michael hrubek could make it all the way to ridgeton from the mental hospital certainly not on a night like this no some nebulous memory kept rising up disturbingly then vanishing it seemed that it had something to do with this portion of the yard she was picturing what was it plants had there been a garden here of some sort ah yes it was here the old vegetable garden then she remembered tom wheeler how old had they been twelve or thirteen probably both of them one fall afternoonmaybe november like tonightthe skinny redhaired boy had shown up in the yard portia strolled outside and they sat on the back steps she managed simultaneously to both ignore and converse with him teasing mercilessly finally he suggested that they go to the state park why she asked i dunno he responded hang out you know got the new jefferson airplane he nodded lethargically at an eighttracktape player at his feet she told him no she didnt want to but a moment later she disappeared into the house and returned with a blanket he started for the state park uhuh portia announced this way and led him to the vegetable garden here she spread the blanket in partial view of the house and lay down kicking off her keds and stretching sumptuously but somebody might see he protested somebody could be watching right now she placed his hand on her breast and he stopped worrying about voyeurs portia lay on her back surrounded by slugchewed pumpkins and short blond cornstalks tommy beside her covering her hot mouth with his she had to breathe for long stretches through her nose she now recalled smelling this same scent of wet late fall drowsy flies strafed them finally confusing him by not protesting she allowed his pale freckled hand to pass the elastic barrier he glanced at the windows of the house then jabbed with a shaking finger leaving inside her a glow of pain and on her bare hip a large wet spot that matched the one spreading across the front of his dungarees they lay awkwardly side by side for a few minutes then he suddenly whispered i think theres somebody there though hed said that only to escape and he rose quickly and vanished down the driveway hearing the resonant guitar licks fade portia grew dizzy as she watched the thick clouds pass overhead and wondered about the mysteries of bodies she spent a long time unsuccessfully trying to convince herself to feel bad that hed fled portia now realized with a twist in her belly that it was not this memory of speedy tommy wheeler at all that was so troubling it was indian leap she had almost not accompanied her sister and brotherinlaw on the picnic she had no interest in the outofdoors no interest in state parksespecially the park to which shed been dragged by teachers on tedious field trips and in which she later spent hours gazing at treetops as she lay beneath boyfriends or friends of boyfriends or sometimes strangers no it was essentially a decision by default she was fed up with the quiet anxiety of solo life in manhattan the dinners of turkey sandwiches and coleslaw the companionship of rented movies the tired comeons in bars and at parties delivered as if the men actually thought she hadnt heard it all a thousand times before socializing with lean ponytailed girlfriends whod discard you in an instant if doing so moved them an inch closer to a better job or an available man so on that may shed reluctantly packed bagels and lox and cream cheese and magazines and bikini and sunscreen she endured the surly rentacar clerk she endured the traffic she endured the tense company of the poor shy claire she suffered through all the stress of a day in the country yet there was one aspect of the trip that didnt require enduring robert gillespie portia thought at first was hardly a catch as she sat in the back of his x with lis and claire en route to indian leap she reviewed his ledger and came up mostly with debits only marginally cute fifteen pounds overweight too smooth too pompous too talkative a wife who was a complete cipher there was portia realized no logical basis for finding him irresistible but irresistible he was while lis had dozed in the back of the truck and while dull dorothy liberally applied her ohpuhleaze red nail polish robert deluged portia with questions where did she live did she like the city did she know this or that restaurant did she like her job it was all a comeon of course it was but still and his liquid eyes danced with excitement as they talked portia recalled thinking helplessly oh its true seduce my mind and my body will follow by the time they arrived at the park portia lauberget was his for the asking as they walked along the path from the parking lot to the car he glanced at her running shoes and discreetly askedin a way that was both intimate and lightheartedif they might take a run together she responded maybe he took this to mean yes let me leave before you he whispered then ill meet you near the old cave give me ten minutes then follow me maybe when they got to the beach she appraised her power over him and decided not to abdicate a single bit of it she did a few fast stretches then jogged away first blatantly ignoring him she ran a half mile to the secluded gully hed mentioned past the cave was a stand of pine trees beneath which was an inviting nest of soft needles some green some ruddy portia sat on a nearby rock wondering if hed join her maybe hed retaliate for her defiance by remaining with his wife and lis shed certainly have more respect for him if he did yet portia lauberget had no particular desire or need to respect men especially men like robert gillespie and decided he fucking well better show shed make his day miserable if he didnt she examined the small clearing which was gloomy and shadowed by the steep walls of pale rock rising on either side of the trees overhead the sky had turned heavily overcast much less romantic she reflected than a club med beach in curaçao or nassau on the other hand there were no condoms littering the ground here she scooted from the rock to the needle bed separated from sight of the clearing by a tall line of bushes and young hemlocks a half hour passed then forty minutes and finally robert came jogging toward her he caught his breath and earned many points by not saying a word to portia about disregarding his instructions he was studying his chest pouting she laughed what my wife says im getting tits portia pulled off her tshirt and sports bra lets compare they rolled back under the pine trees robert kissed her firmly stroking her bare nipples with the backs of his hands he closed his fingers around hers and placed them on her breasts she began fondling herself while his tongue slid down to her navel then continued to her thighs and knees he remained there teasing until portia finally seized his head in both hands and directed it firmly between her legs her thighs rose as her head pressed back hard into the pine bed needles fixing themselves in her sweatdamp hair staring through halfclosed lids at the speeding clouds she gasped for breath he rolled on top of her and their mouths met hard brutally he had just entwined her legs around his waist and was thrusting into her savagely when a branch snapped near their heads claire walked out of a stand of trees and stopped frozen six feet from them her hand rose to her mouth in shock oh my god portia shouted claire honey robert began as he rolled to his knees claire speechless stared at his groin portia remembered thinking my god shes eighteen this cant be her first hardon it took a moment for robert to recover some wits and he looked frantically for his shirt or shorts as the girls eyes remained fixed on him portia watched the young blonde this curious à trois voyeurism aroused her all the more robert grabbed his shirt and wrapped the knit garment about his waist abashed and grinning portia didnt move then claire choked a sob and turned running past the cave and back up the path oh shit robert muttered dont worry what oh dont take it so seriously every teenager gets a shock at some point ill talk to her shes just a kid forget her portia said offhandedly then whispered come on over here shes going shes not going to say anything hmm whats that youre still interested i can tell jesus what if she tells lis come on she urged breathlessly dont stop now fuck me i think we ought to get back portia dropped to her knees and pulled his shirt away taking him deep into her mouth no robert whispered he was standing head back eyes closed shuddering uncontrollably and gasping when lis stepped into the clearing claire must have run into her almost immediately and lis had either learned or deduced what had happened she stood above the halfnaked couple and stared down at them portia she raged how could you her expression of horror matched roberts perfectly the young woman stood and wiped her face with her bra she turned to face her sister and with detachment watched liss throat grow remarkably red as the tendons rose and her jaw quivered robert pulled up his running shorts looking around again for his shirt he seemed incapable of speaking portia refused to act like a caught schoolgirl how could you lis gripped her arm but portia stepped away abruptly meeting her sisters furious gaze she dressed slowly then saying nothing left lis and robert in the clearing portia walked back to the beach where dorothy was starting to pack up the temperature had dropped and it was clearly going to rain she looked at portia and seemed to sense something was wrong but said nothing the wind picked up and the two women hurried to gather up the picnic baskets and blankets carting them to the truck they made one more trip back to the beach looking for their companions then the downpour began moments later sirens filled the park and police and medics arrived it was in a raindrenched intersection of two canyons that portia met her sister redeyed and muddy and disheveled looking like a madwoman being led by two tall rangers out of a flooded arroyo portia had stepped toward her lis what the slap was oddly quiet but so powerful it brought portia down on one knee she cried out in pain and shock neither woman moved and liss hand remained frozen in the air as they stared at each other for a long moment a shocked ranger helped portia to her feet and explained about the deaths oh no portia cried oh no lis mimicked with bitter scorn then stepped forward pushed the ranger aside and put her mouth close to her sisters ear in a rasping whisper she said you killed that girl you fucking whore portia faced her sister her eyes grew as cold as the wet rocks around them goodbye lis and goodbye it had been apart from a few brief stilted phone conversations those words had been virtually the last communication between the sisters until tonight indian leap it was the first thing in portias mind when lis had invited her here this eveningjust as it had reared in her thoughts when the subject of the nursery was raised and for that matter every time portia had thought of moving back to ridgeton whichthough shed never confess it to lisshed considered frequently in the past few years indian leap oh lis portia thought dont you see thats what dooms the lauberget sisters and always will not the tragedy not the deaths not the bitter words or the months of silence afterwards but the past that led us to that pine bed the past thats certain to keep leading us to places just as terrible again and again and again the past with all its spirits of the dead portia now looked at her sister ten feet away as lis put aside the shovel and waded toward the front seat of the car the sisters eyes met lis frowned troubled by portias expression what is it she asked but just then a low whistle squealed from the cars grille the engine choked and kicked hard several times as the fan blade slapped water then with a shudder it died leaving the night filled only with the sounds of the wind the rain and the lilting music of a clever baroque composer well i didnt go for help because its over a half mile to the neighbors and if youve listened to the radio you know what kind of storm its supposed to be i mean doesnt it make sense the words fired from the pale mouth of the petite blonde shed stopped crying but was pouring down brandy from a dusty bottle in a medicinal way and anyway she said to trenton heck he told me not to and if you ever saw him youd do what he told you oh my lord all i kept thinking was lucky me lucky me i had communion today owen atcheson returned from the side yard to the houses tiny living room where heck and the fragile woman stood lucky me she whispered and tossed down a belt of liquor she started to cry again he just pulled one wire out owen reported he lifted the receiver i got it working hes got my car its a beige subaru station wagon an apologized about ten times im sorry im sorry im sorry phew her tears stopped thats what i mean when i call him strange well you can imagine asked me for the keys and of course i gave them then off he went squatting behind the wheel missed the drive completely but found the road guess ill write that vehicle off owen grimaced if wed gone that way he wouldve come right to us heck looked again at the tiny skull resting on the paper towel in which shed handed it to him unwilling to touch the bone itself well the woman continued you can find him on hows that hes going to boyleston route he said that he asked me about the nearest town with a train station i told him boyleston he asked me how to get there and then asked me for fifty dollars for a train ticket i gave it to him and a little more heck stared at the phone for a minute cant keep it a secret anymore he thought not with hrubek killing one woman and terrorizing another he sighed and sucked air through bent teeth very conspicuous in hecks mind now was the thought that if hed called haversham like hed thought of doingafter figuring out that hrubek was heading westthey mightve caught him before he got to that house in cloverton all law enforcers heck too had inventories of times when their mistakes and failings had gotten other people hurttimes that occasionally returned hard and kept them from sleeping and sometimes did worse than that though he was removed from the sorrow at the moment he supposed that that womans death would be the most prominent in his personal store of those events and he could only guess how bad it would later come back to him now though he wanted only one thingto see this fellow caughtand he snatched up the receiver he placed a call to the local sheriff and reported hrubeks theft of the subaru and where he seemed to be going he turned to the woman sheriff says hell send somebody out to the house to take you to a friends or relatives maam if you want tell him yes please heck relayed this information to the sheriff when he hung up owen took the phone and called the marsden inn and was surprised to find that lis and portia still hadnt checked in frowning he called the house lis picked up on the third ring lis what are you doing there owen where are you im in fredericks i tried to call you before i thought youd left whatre you doing there you were supposed to be at the inn an hour ago a momentary hollowness on the line he heard her calling its owen what was going on through the line he heard a roll of thunder lis came back on and explained that she and portia had stayed to build up the sandbags the dam was overflowing we couldve lost the house are you all right were fine but the cars stuck in the driveway the rains terrible we cant get out therere no tow trucks what are you doing in fredericks ive been following hrubek west west he did turn around lis i have to tell you he killed someone no a woman in cloverton hes coming here no it doesnt look like it hes going to boyleston to get a train out of the state id guess what should we do he paused im not going after him lis im coming home he heard her exhale a sigh thank you honey stay in the house lock the doors im only fifteen minutes away lis yes he paused ill be there soon heck and owen said goodbye to the woman and hurried out into the rain buffeted by the terrible wind they followed the driveway to the dim road that led back to the highway owen glanced at heck who was trudging along morosely youre thinking about your reward i have to say i am theyll probably get him in boyleston for sure but i had to call and tell them im not going to risk anybody else getting hurt owen thought for a moment youre still due that money id say well the hospitals gonna have a different opinion on that ill guarantee you tell you what heck you burn on down that highway to boyleston and if you get him first fine if not well sue the hospital for your money and ill handle the case myself you a lawyer owen nodded wont charge you a penny youd do that for me surely would heck was embarrassed at owens generosity and after a moment he shook the lawyers hand warmly they continued in silence to the clearing where the ruined cadillac sat okay emil and ill head south here its a beige subaru were looking for right lets hope he doesnt drive japanese any bettern he drives detroit okay lets do it on impulse he added say after thiss over with lets stay in touch you and me what do you say do some fishing hey thats a fine idea by me heck happy hunting to you heck and emil limped and trotted back to the battered chevy pickup fifty yards down the road they climbed in heck started up the rattling engine then sped through the fierce rain toward route his left foot on the accelerator and an eye on his modest prize the sign revolved slowly in the turbulent night sky dr richard kohler looked toward the flashes of light in the west and laughed out loud at the metaphor that occurred to him wasnt this how mary shelleys doctor had animated his creature lightning the psychiatrist now recalled very clearly the first meeting with the patient who would play the monster to kohlers frankenstein four months ago two weeks after the indian leap trial and michaels incarceration in marsden kohlerovercome with morbid and professional fascinationhad walked slowly into marsdens grim highsecurity e ward and looked down at the huge hunched form of michael hrubek glaring up from beneath his dark eyebrows how are you michael kohler asked theyre listening sometimes you have to keep your mind a complete blank have you ever done that do you know how hard it is thats the basis of transcendental meditation you may know that as tm make your mind a complete blank doctor try it i dont think i can if i hit you with that chair your mindd be a complete blank but the downside is that youd be a dead fucker michael had then closed his mouth and said nothing more for several days marsden was a state hospital like cooperstown and offered only a few dismal activity rooms but kohler had finagled a special suite for patients in his program it was not luxurious the rooms were drafty and cold and the walls were painted an unsettling milky green but at least those in the milieu suiteso named because kohlers goal was to ease the patients here gradually back into normal societywere separated from the hospitals sicker patients and this special status alone gave them a sense of dignity they also had learning toys and books and art supplieseven the dangerous and officially forbidden pencils art and expression were encouraged and the walls were graced by the graffiti of paintings drawings and poems created by the patients in august richard kohler commenced a campaign to get michael into the milieu suite he chose the young man because he was smart because he seemed to wish to improve and because he had killed to resocialize one did not cure a patient like michael hrubek would be the ultimate validation of kohlers delusiontherapy techniques but more than precious dmh funding more than professional prestige kohler saw a chance to help a man who suffered and who suffered terribly michael wasnt like the many schizophrenic patients who were oblivious to their conditions no michael was the most tragic of victims he was just well enough to imagine what a normal life might be like and was tormented daily by the gap between who he was and who he so desperately wanted to be exactly the sort of patient kohler wished most to work with not that michael leapt at the chance to join the psychiatrists program no fucking way you fucker paranoid and suspicious michael refused to have anything to do with the suite or kohler or anyone else at marsden for that matter he sat in the corner of his room muttering to himself and suspiciously eyeing doctors and patients alike but kohler persisted he simply wouldnt leave the young man alone their first month togetherand they saw each other dailythey argued bitterly michael would rant and scream convinced kohler was a conspirator like the others the doctor would parry with questions about michaels fantasies trying to break him down finally tuckered out by kohlers aggressiveness and by massive dosages of medicine michael reluctantly agreed to join his program he was gradually introduced to other patients first one on one then in larger groups to get the young patient to talk about his past and his delusions kohler would bribe him with history books filching them from the library at framington hospital because the collection at marsden was almost nonexistent in their individual sessions kohler kept pushing the young man turning up the emotional heat and forcing him to spend time with other patients probing into his delusions and dreams michael whos eve oh yeah right like im going to tell you forget about it what did you mean by i want to stay ahead of the blue uniforms time for bed lights out nightynight doctor so it went one cold wet day six weeks ago michael was in marsdens secluded exercise area walking laps under the surly eyes of the guards he gazed through the chainlink fence at the bleak muddy new england farm on the hospital grounds like most schizophrenics michael suffered from blunted affecthampered display of emotion but that day he was suddenly swept up by the bleak and sorrowful scenery and started to cry i was feeling sorry for the poor damp cows michael later told kohler their eyes were broken god should do something for them theyll have a hard time their eyes were broken michael what do you mean the poor cows theyll never be the same good for them bad for them its so obvious their eyes are broken dont you understand the flash came to kohler like an ecs jolt you mean he whispered struggling to control his excitement youre saying the ice is broken with this backhanded messagelike the one about getting close to dr anne mullermichael was trying to express his inmost feelings in this case that something about his life had changed fundamentally he shrugged and began to cry in front of his therapistnot in fear but out of sorrow i feel so bad for them gradually he calmed it seems like a difficult life to be a farmer but maybe its one thatd suit me would you be interested kohler asked his heart racing in working on that farm the farm the work program here at the hospital are you mad michael shouted id get kicked in the head and killed dont be a stupid fucker it took two weeks of constant pressure to talk michael into the jobfar longer in fact than it took kohler to gin up the paperwork to arrange the transfer michael was technically an untouchable at marsden because he was a section commitment but there is no easier mark than state bureaucracy because kohlers voluminous documentation referred to patient rather than michael hrubek and because the supervisors of vastly overcrowded e ward were delighted to get rid of another patient hrubek was easily stamped approved vetted and blessed he was assigned simple tasks on the farm which produced dairy products for the hospital and sold what little surplus there was at local markets at first he was suspicious of his supervisors yet he never once had a panic attack he showed up for work on time and was usually the last to leave eventually he settled into the jobshoveling manure lugging sledgehammers fence stretchers and staples from fence post to fence post carting milk pails the only times youd suspect he wasnt your average farm boy was when hed use white fence paint on herefords to even up markings he found unpleasant or scary still as soon as he was told not to paint the cows he shamefacedly complied michael hrubek whod never in his life earned a penny of his own money was suddenly making an hour he was having dinner in the hospital cafeteria with friends and washing dishes afterwards he was writing a long poem about the battle of bull run and he was an integral part of kohlers delusiontherapy program not to mention the cover boy of his proposal to the state department of mental health and now kohler reflected sorrowfully he was a dangerous escapee oh where are you michael with your broken eyes one thing he was convinced of michael was en route to ridgeton the visit with lis atcheson had been doubly helpful partly for what it revealed about michaels delusion but also for what it revealed about her shed lied to him that was clear hed tried to deduce exactly where her story about indian leap deviated from the truth but she seemed to be a woman used to living with secrets with feelings unexpressed passions hidden and so he hadnt been able to spot the lie yet kohler felt that whatever she wasnt telling him was significantvery likely significant enough to prod michael out of the haze of his deluded but secure life and urge him to make this terrifying journey through the night oh yes he was on his way to ridgeton and here waiting for him huddled in the driving rain was richard kohler a man willing to bribe bounty hunters with thousands of dollars he could scarcely afford to troop through hostile wilderness to track down and meet his edgy and dangerous patient all by himself and spirit him back to the hospitalfor michaels sake and the sake of the thousands of other patients kohler hoped to treat during his lifetime the doctor now gazed over the spacious parking lot and drew his black overcoat about him in a futile effort to ward off the heavy rain and gusts of wind he opened his backpack and lifted out the sturdy metal syringe then filled the reservoir with a large dosage of anesthetic he flicked the bubbles to the top and fired a small spurt into the air to expel them then he leaned back his face pelted with rain and he looked up once more at the perpetual motion of the sign above his head look at this a mile down the road michael rounded a curve and barked a sudden laugh he calmly recalled which pedal was the brake and he pressed it gently slowing to ten miles an hour look he leaned forward his head almost to the windshield and gazed into the sky filled with rain that reflected red white and blue lights in a million spatters oh god what could this mean his skin hummed with emotion and upon his face a vast grin was spreading michael pulled onto the shoulder and stopped the subaru he stepped out into the rain and as if in a trance began walking through the parking lot his john worker boots scraping on the asphalt he paused at the base of the shrine and stood with his hands clasped before him reverently staring up into the sky he dug into his backpack and observed that he had two skulls left he selected the one in worse conditionit was cracked in several placesand set it at the base of the sign the voice came from nearby hello michael the young man wasnt startled in the least hello dr richard the thin man sat on the hood of a white car one of fifty all in a row doesnt he look small doesnt he look wet michael thought reminded once again of the raccoon hed killed earlier in the evening such little things both of them dr richard scooted off the taurus michael glanced at him but his eyes were drawn irresistibly to the radiant sign revolving above their heads michael ignored the middle portion of the sign noting only that the word mercury was bloody red what he stared at were the two words in blue unionsoldier blue on the top ford on the bottom lincoln thats where you killed him isnt it michael the theater this is surely a miracle oh god in your infinite brilliance ford lincoln fords theater yessir i sure did make no mistake i snuck into the presidential box at tenthirty on april the year of our lord eighteen hundred and sixtyfive it was good friday i came up behind him and put a bullet into his head the president didnt die right away but lingered until the next day he linnnnngered you yelled sic semper tyrannis theyve been after me ever since michael looked at his doctor no he was no impostor it was truly dr richard you look tired doctor michael thought im awake and youre asleep what do you make of that he gazed up at the sign again i want to help you michael chuckled id like you to come back with me to the hospital thats nuts dr richard i just left there why would i want to go back because youll be safe there are people looking for you people who want to hurt you michael snapped ive been telling you that for months thats true you have the doctor laughed michael took the pistol from his pocket dr richards eyes flicked down momentarily but returned immediately to his patients michael ive done a lot for you i got you the job on the farm you like that job dont you you like to work with the cows i know you do the pistol was warm it was comfortable in his hand it was he thought quite fashionable ive been wondering ifwouldnt this be strangeif this was the same gun id used to shoot lincoln the very same gun that would have a special meaning that would make a lot of sense do you like the scent of blood dr richard when do you think a soul makes the ascent to heaven do you think souls linnnnger on earth awhile why is he stepping closer to me michael wondered when hes this close its easier to read my mind i wouldnt know michael held the pistol close to his face smelling the metal but how do you explain that it was just there for me this gun it was just there in the store the store with the heads a shudder ran through michael hrubek what heads all the little heads white and smooth beautiful little white heads those skulls dr richard nodded toward the sign pole michael blinked but said nothing so you shot lincoln did you michael sure did i was willing and abele why didnt you ever tell me about it in any of our sessions michaels stomach twisted with unbridled anxiety it was why fear prickled at his neck between rapid breaths michael answered it was too terrible i did a terrible thing terrible he was such a great man and look what i did it was it hurts dont fucking ask me any more what dr richard asked gently was so terrible about it what was too terrible to tell me many things too numerous to go into tell me about one no just pick one thing and tell me michael no please now quick no whats this fucker up to yes michael tell me for an instant the thin doctors eyes grew fierce and commanding he ordered now

michael swallowed and looked around nervously where did the blood come from the moon ha just kidding where michael where did the blood come from where in a whisper from their head whose head michael

president of the united states head the railsplitter from illinoiss head thats who i meant i put a fucker of a bullet in his head is that what you mean when youd say ahead michael you were talking

trick me get your facts straight he didnt enjoy the evening much either by the way but someone else got shot didnt they no think michael think back you can tell me no he pressed his hands over his ears no no no where did all that blood come from blood everywhere dr richard whispered he leaned forward so much blood enough blood to cover the moon sheets and sheets of it enough blood to cover the sheet michael cried there was so much of it who else michael who else got shot please tell me i tell you you telegraph the cia and the secret service itll be our secret michael i wont tell another living soul will you tell a dead soul he roared throwing his head back and raving into the pouring rain theyre the ones we have to worry about all the dead souls thats where the danger is who michael tell me i oh whats that on your head whats that youre wearing daddyll be home soon daddyll make her take it off her beautiful head all ruined no no michael talk to me why are you crying dr richard gripped his arm what are you thinking hes thinking i came into the house id been in the backyard doing many important things i came into the house and there she was and there were no masks on her eyes and her fingernails werent burning there she was in the bedroom wearing the same nightgown shed worn for days and days and days very fashionable the very thing to wear to go by the store to buy the store the very thing to wear when youre holding a gun this very gun john wilkes booth had given it to her michael whats the matter look at me what are you thinking hes thinking booth must have been her lover and he gave her this gunto protect her from dead union soldiers but she sold me out she betrayed me did you say betrayal i cant hear you youre muttering what are you saying michael she held the gun in her hand she was lying in bed in her nightgown she sat up when i came into the doorway and she said she said she said oh you michael heard her words tonight as hed heard them a million times beforespoken not in surprise or contempt or supplication but out of infinite disappointment hes thinking and then she kissed her gold hair with the lips of the gun and blood flew high as the moon and covered her head like a red glistening hat it covered the sheets oh you oh you michael had stood in the doorway of her bedroom as he watched the blond hair grow dark under the crimson hat then he leaned down and touched her quivering hand awkwardly the first physical contact between mother and son in years her unfocused eyes grew dark as eclipses her forked fingers shuddered once and relaxed and then slowly lost whatever warmth theyd once held though michael let go long long before her flesh grew cold the beautiful head whose michael then the memories vanished as if a switch had been shut off the tears stopped and michael found himself gazing down at dr richard who was now only a foot or so from him who said the doctor desperately nice try michael said cheerfully sarcastic but i dont think so dr richard closed his eyes for a moment his lips tightened then he sighed okay michael okay he fell silent for a moment then said how bout we drive back to the hospital together ive got the bmw we talked about going for a ride sometime you said youd like that you said a bmw was one fucker of a car fucker of a nazi car michael corrected lets go come on oh but i cant dr richard im going to pay a little visit to lisbone oh that was bad what happened there ive got some evening up to do why michael why shes the eve of betrayal he answered as if it were selfevident dr richards face slowly relaxed he looked away for a long moment then his face brightenedevery bit of his face except his eyes michael noticed hey youve got a car too im impressed michael its not like a cadillac he sneered look over there the doctor said casually at that row of cars all those lincolns row after row of lincolns thats interesting dr richard michael said agreeably studying not the cars but his doctors face but whats more interesting is why youve been hiding your hand behind you all night you fucker god no the doctors left cross thudded harmlessly into the huge chest as michael ripped the syringe from the narrow fingers whatve we got here this is shiny oh this is pretty youve got a present for me oh i know all about you you came out all by yourself to stick me in the back and turn me over to the conspirators so nobodyd know about me nobodyd know about dr richards little secret who ran away dont tell the world until youre ready right stick me in the back then stick me in a crash bag you fucker no dont do this michael leaned forward oh you he whispered and moved the long needle with its razorsharp beveled edge even with the doctors eyes it moved closer and closer passing inches from his face as the mans thin muscles struggled uselessly against michaels overwhelming strength please no the needle turned directly toward the doctor and started toward his chest no then with a skill that came from years of careful observation michael eased the needle deep into the doctors skin and injected the drug from dr richards lips came a mournful wail which seemed not to be a cry of pain but appeared to come rather from a deeper sort of anguishthe sound perhaps of a man realizing that the last image in his thoughts as he died would be the look of betrayal upon the face of someone that he had in a way loved how far away was he portia asked fredericks its only eight or nine miles from here but the roadsre bound to be terrible they had changed clothes and shared the hair dryer lis stood in the kitchen window and saw through the rain a dot of light reflecting on the lake a mile away the house of their closest neighbora couple owen and lis knew casually they were young married only six months the woman was very much a hausfrau and on several occasions had talked to lis breathlessly and with queasy candor about wifedom she asked many questions and watched with squinting eyes her elbows on a vinyl place mat as lis awkwardly dished out advice about relationships for heavens sake lis thought how would i know if you should have sex with your husband even if youve got the flu as if there were rules about such things youre all packed portia asked packed nightgown toothbrush underwear itll be about a sixhour stay god what i want is a hot bath they might even catch him before owen gets here hey i need a drink brandy tastes like soap acquired taste granted grand marnier more my style lis poured two glasses and wandered into the doorway of the greenhouse we make a good dam its still holding a huge burst of wind shook the windows it howled through the open vents loud enough to obscure conversation the leafless trees whipped back and forth and whitecaps broke on the surface of the lake lis said that shed never seen the water this turbulent a huge streak of lightning split the sky to the west and the floor seemed to drop beneath their feet when the thunder rolled over the house lets retreat to the living room lis was happy to agree they sat in silence for a moment lis avoided her sisters eyes and glanced instead at a cluster of photographs on the end table pictures from their childhoods portia sassy and sexy lis studious and vigilant and well plain tall stern andrew complete with anachronistic mustache and ubiquitous white shirt and gracious mother with her uplifted matriarchal jaw her eyes commanding everyone except her husband in whose presence she was timid portia lis said slowly eyes now on the frames not the photographs id like to talk to you about something her sister looked toward her the nursery business no lis finally answered its about indian leap what happened there between us i mean not the murder you dont want to talk about it i know but will you just listen to what i have to say portia was silent she licked the sweet liquor from the rim of her glass and waited lis sighed i never wanted to see you again after that day you mustve figured that was how i felt too since we havent seen each other ive felt so guilty i dont want an apology hitting you saying the things i said i was out of control ive never been that way before never in my life i was everything i always prayed id never be you had a good teacher portia tapped the photo of their father got your right hook from him it felt like lis didnt smile she felt ill with shame and anger she looked now for signs of forgiveness softening but portia merely sat hugging her glass and staringalmost bored it seemedinto the greenhouse the eerie moaning of the wind continued absently lis said i went to the dairy queen the other day remember it theyre still around i havent been inside one for years no remember there is no inside thats right sure lis pictured them as young girls with their dutch bodyguard jolande buying the soft vanilla cones at a little screen window and sitting on a sticky picnic bench beside the parking lot during the day bees hovered and at night moths and beetles died fast brilliant deaths as they flew into the mesmerizing purple glow of the bug zapper wed get the cherry coatings the younger sister squinted as she recalled and the ice cream was always melting and running down the cone it was always a racetrying to lick it off before it got to our hands sure i remember they fell silent as the whine from the wind grew more piercing lis walked to the greenhouse and closed the vent tightly the sound waned but didnt cease completely when she returned she said i never mentioned it to you portia but i had an affair last spring and there are some things i have to tell you about it he cruises at seventy miles an hour the tach on the dash edging red on the uphill grades the engine a tortured whine owen atcheson passes the savmor now closed the plate glass taped with huge xs as if instead of a fall storm a hurricane is anticipated then he speeds past a housing development and beyond that the ford dealership the blue and red sign turning slowly in the sky like a lighthouse beacon then route begins to curve through the hills that border ridgetonthe hills that are also part of the same geologic glitch that two hours away rises high above the stone valley of indian leap where robert gillespie had died broken and bloody owen slows to take these turns then speeds again to fifty hurrying through the red light at the intersection of the road now rises along the crest of a long hill and he catches a glimpse of water thirty feet below him off to the right from the dark creek rise the spindly black legs of the old boston hartford new york railroad trestle he slows for the roads only hairpin turn and lifts his foot off the brake to accelerate onto the long straightaway that will take him into downtown ridgeton the beige subaru seems to drift leisurely from the cleft of bushes where it was hidden pointed nose out owen sees however that the cars rear wheels spin furiously shooting mud and water behind them and the import is actually moving at a good clip in the instant before the huge hollow bang he thinks he might escape so close do the vehicles approach without striking then the car hits the cherokee solidly amidships with a terrible jolt that twists owens neck badly pain explodes in his face with a burst of yellow light the subaru stops short of the cliff s edge as the truck eases over the side it teeters for what seems an eternity giving owen atcheson plenty of time to see the face of michael hrubek a mere six feet away hes grinning madly pounding on the wheel and shouting as he tries frantically it seems to make himself heard owen stares back but never does figure out what the message might be because just then the truck lurches forward and starts its plunge toward the creek far below the blossoms of sin portia laughed shortly and asked with astonishment you an affair the older sisters eyes were fixed on the sheets of gray rain that cascaded down the windows me wouldntve guessed would you there lis thought ive done it the first time ive confessed to anyone theres lightning nearby but so far it hasnt struck me dead you never said anything portia was clearly amused i had no clue i was afraid i guess that owen would find out you know him that temper of his why would i tell owen i didnt think you would it just seemed to me that the more people who knew the more the chance word would get out she paused well theres something else too i was ashamed i was afraid of what youd think me why on earth an affair isnt anything to be proud of were you just fucking or were you in love lis was offended yet portias question seemed motivated merely by curiosity no no no it wasnt just physical we were in love i really dont know why i didnt tell you before i should have thereve been too many secrets between us she glanced at her sister owen had an affair too the young woman nodded knowingly lis was horrified that portia had somehow learned this already but no it turned out that shed simply pegged owen as a man with a wandering eye this offended lis too well it was only one time she said defensively frankly lis im surprised you waited as long as you did to find somebody how can you say that lis retorted im not the sort her voice faded not like me her sister asked wryly i mean that i wasnt looking for anyone we were trying to work it out owen and me hed given up the woman he was seeing and we were making a conscious effort conscious effort lis listened for mockery and believed she heard none she continued doggedly an effort to keep our marriage together the affair just happened shed begun the liaison at an awkward time right in the middle of the terrible sequence of last winter owens affair the slow death of her mother her increased discontent with teaching taking over the estate the worst possible time she thought then reflected as if theres a convenient moment for cataclysm liss affair unlike the tidy hollywood version that she imagined owens to have been had tormented her mercilessly it wouldve been far easier she told herself if shed been able to separate the dick from the soul but she couldnt and so of course she fell in loveas her paramour did with her at first lis admitted she was partly drawn to her lover out of retaliation it was petty yes but there it wasshe wanted to get even with owen besides she found she simply couldnt control herself the affair was allconsuming portia asked its over now yes its over well whats the big deal oh lis said bitterly but it is a big deal i havent told you everything lis opened her mouth to speak and for an unbearable moment she was about to confess everything she truly believed that she was going to blurt out every scathing fact and she probably would have if the car hadnt arrived just then portia turned from her sister and looked out the kitchen window toward the driveway owen lis stared out the window both overjoyed at his arrival and bitterly disappointed that the conversation with her sister was being interrupted they walked into the kitchen and peered through the sheets of rain no i dont think its him her sister said slowly they watched the headlights make their snaking way along the driveway lis counted the flares as the beams hit the orange reflectors along the route portia was right although she couldnt make out the vehicle clearly through the bushes and trees it was lightcolored owens cherokee truck was black as a gun barrel lis flung open the kitchen door and looked out through the dazzling rain it was a police car a young deputy climbed out he glanced at the acura sitting in the middle of the flood and ran into the kitchen flicking rainwater from his face in an effeminate way he was round with the tautness of recent fat and had the face of a man on an unexpected assignment lis he pulled his hat off im sorry to have to tell you this we just found owens truck at the bottom of a ravine oh god liss hands flew to her eyes and she pressed hard as if they stung with smoke hed been run intoby that fellow hrubek looks like the psycho knocked him off the road seemed to be an ambush no hrubeks going to boyleston youre wrong well he aint going to boyleston in the car he was driving front ends mashed in lis turned instinctively toward where her purse lay on the counter how badly hurt is he i have to go to him we dont know cant find him or hrubek either where did it happen portia asked by the old railroad trestle near downtown downtown where lis snapped his fat mouth fell silent perhaps he suspected her of hysteria he said well downtown ridgeton no more than three miles from where they stood the wreck wasnt too bad the deputy explained we think hrubek took off and owens after him or owens running with hrubek after him we thought of that too the sheriff and tom scalon are out looking for them all the phones in this part of townre out stan had me drive over to tell you hes thinking you oughta leave till they find him but your cars outta commission looks like lis didnt respond portia told him that they couldnt get a tow truck believe youll need moren a tow for that particular vehicle he nodded toward the sunken acura anyway ill take you just get your stuff together owen lis looked around her scanning the woods in vain im thinking the deputy said we oughta get a move on im not going anywhere until we find my husband perhaps she sounded ferocious for the deputy added cautiously i understand how you feel but i dont exactly know theres a lot you can do here but fret and ill im not going anywhere she said slowly you understand he looked at portia who gave no response finally he said have it your way lis thats your business but stanley said to make sure youre okay i better call him and tell him you dont want to leave he waited a moment more as if this might intimidate her into leaving when she turned away he walked out into the rain once more and climbed into the front seat of the cruiser to make the radio call lis portia protested theres nothing we can do go sit in the car with him if you want or have him take you to the inn im sorry but im not leaving portia glanced outside at a tree bending under a furious gust of wind no ill stay go lock the windows ill check the doors before hed left owen had deadbolted the front door lis now fixed the security chain thinking momentarily how tiny the brass links seemed compared with the manacles that had gripped hrubeks hands at trial she then locked and chained the door off the kitchen utility room she wondered if owen had remembered the lathhouse doorthe only way one could enter or leave the greenhouse from the outside she walked toward it but paused halfway she noticed a large rose planta chrysler imperial hybrid cultivated into a tree last year one week after owen confessed his affair he had bought her this plant it was the only one hed ever purchased without her guidance on the day of rest after owning up to ms trollop esq he appeared with the massive scarlet rosebush in the back of his truck at the time lis nearly pitched it out then she decided not to the plant owed its reprieve to a passage from a class assignment in hamlet which her students were then studying cut off even in the blossoms of my sin no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head the coincidence was too great to dismissthis combination of literature horticulture and reallife drama so what could lis do but resist the urge to destroy it she rooted the damn thing and wondered if the plant would survive it of course proved to be one of her hardier specimens lis stepped forward and cradled the flower it was a paradox of her love for plants that her gardeners hands had toughened so much that she could no longer feel the delicacy of petals she brushed the backs of her hands over the blossoms then started once again toward the door shed taken only a few steps when she saw vague motion from outside walking cautiously to a window thick with condensation and the sheets of rain she wiped the glass with her sleeve and saw to her shock the indistinct form of a tall man standing near the house hands on his hips he was trying to find the front door it appeared he wasnt the young deputy maybe she thought another officer had accompanied him though this fellow didnt seem to be in uniform he noticed the side door that led into the utility room and walked to it oblivious to the downpour he knocked politely like a man picking up a date lis walked cautiously to the door and looked out through the curtain although she didnt recognize him he had such a pleasant innocent face and looked so completely wet that she let him in evening maam you must be mrs atcheson he wiped his lanky hand on his pants leaving it just as wet as before and offered it to her sorry to trouble you my names but he didnt have the chance to complete the introduction just then because a large bloodhound pushed his way uninvited into the greenhouse and started to shake himself enthusiastically showering them both with a million drops of rain owen atcheson lying half in and half out of the chill creek slowly came to he sat up praying that he wouldnt faint again after the cherokee had stopped tumbling owen hadnt waited for hrubek to come leaping down the hill after him hed examined his left shoulder and felt the indentation where the bone ought to be hed made certain his pistol and ammunition were in his pocket and flung the bolt of the deer rifle far into the dark creek exhaling at the astonishing pain caused by this slight effort then hed straggled to his feet and run clumsily through the stream putting distance between himself and the truck two hundred yards into the forest that surrounded downtown ridgeton hed stopped and rolled onto his back lying against a flat rock softened by an old growth of moss hed slipped a length of oak branch into his mouth and chewed down hard gripping his left biceps with his right hand with excruciating concentration he had forced himself to relax and slowly slowly manipulated the bone eyes closed breathing staccato bursts and sending his teeth deep into the wood suddenly with a pop the shoulder had reseated itself in the cuff he cried out softly as the amazing pain made him vomit and then he fainted and slid into the creek now his eyes open he crawled to the shore and lay on his side he allowed himself no more than five minutes of recuperation before standing up he removed his belt and tightly bound his left arm to his side the temporary sling increased the pain but would safeguard against a catastrophic jolt of agony that might make him faint again he lifted his head and breathed deeply the rain was falling steadily now and the wind whipped into his face he threw his head back and inhaled the wet air after a few moments he began to struggle through the woods slowly making his way north around downtown ridgeton he didnt want hrubek to find him of course but neither did he wish to be spotted by anyone elseleast of all a meddling sheriff or deputy after a torturous mile he came to the intersection of north street and cedar swamp road he found a pay phone and lifted the receiver he was not surprised to hear only silence driving north on cedar swamp was the only way to reach their address it was possible to approach the house from the opposite direction but only after driving around two hundred acres of state park and into a different township then back south once again hrubek had rammed him so hard the subaru was surely useless the psycho would now be on foot too if the atcheson property was his destination hed have to come this way despite the delay to reset his shoulder owen doubted that hrubek had preceded him here unfamiliar with the area the man would first need to find a map then hed have to orient himself and find the correct streets many of which were not clearly marked owen struggled into the intersection cautiouslya soldier on advance patrol sighting out ambush and fire zones high ground backfields perimeters he saw a drainage ditch and a corrugated metal pipe four feet wide a good hideyhole he thought falling easily into combatspeak he pictured hrubek loping cautiously down the middle of the road then owen himself stepping out silently coming up behind with the pistol at his side the rain was cool and fragrant with the scents of a deep autumn owen inhaled this liquid air deeply then slipped down into the icy water that filled the ditch guarding his damaged arm but he was no longer faint and was able to ignore the worst of the pain as he moved in his military crouch he recited to himself the profile of kill areas chest head abdomen groin chest head abdomen groin he repeated this gruesome mantra again and again as around him the rain grew fiercer lis atcheson escorted the man into the kitchen and handed him a towel she decided that in the baseball cap with the curly hair dipping toward his shoulders he looked very much like the backhoe operator whod dug the trench for their new septic tank last year he stood with one hip cocked in a stiff way that made her wonder if he had fallen and injured it he looked mussed enough she thought to have taken a tumble recently im from over in hammond creek east of here trenton heck spoke as if no one had ever heard of hammond creeka town with which she wasnt in fact familiar lis introduced portia who glanced at heck in a dismissing way with a juvenile grin heck waited for an explanation of the exotic name like the car he laughed the young woman offered nothing but her hand and that unsmilingly the young officer was in the squad car trying to get an update on hrubeks whereabouts mr heck lis began trenton or trent he said goodnaturedly laughing mr heck ha would you like something he declined a beer but guzzled a can of coke in less than thirty seconds then leaned against the kitchen island looking out the windows in an analytical selfassured way that made lis wonder if he was an undercover policeman but no he explained he was more of a consultant when he told her how hrubek had led the trackers astray then doubled back lis shook her head knowingly hes no fool at all nup i thought he was supposed to be crazy said portia who was rubbing the dogs head with an enthusiasm the hound did not share well he is that but hes a clever son of a gun is what he is too lis asked how he happened to come here i met your husband over in fredericks we found this woman hrubek told her he was headed for boyleston so i went that way and your husband was going to keep on coming this way the deputy tells me they think hrubek drove him off the road we dont know where he is we dont know where either of them are whyd you change your mind and come this way it was something he just felt heck explained he was halfway to boyleston when he decided that hrubek was leading them off track again hed been too you know methodical about moving west and trying to throw us off or stop us he even set out traps for emil here no surely did i was thinking hes been clever up till now and theres no reason for him to stop being clever but why didnt you just call the police he was suddenly awkward she thought he was blushing eyes fixed on the window he gave the women his account which contained not a single period or comma all about a reward and his being laid off and having been a state trooper for nearly but not quite ten years and a recession and a trailer that was about to be foreclosed on heck then asked about owen therere men out looking for him the sheriff and another deputy im sure hell be okay heck said he seems to know what hes about was in the service ill bet two tours of duty lis said distractedly gazing outside heck paying no attention to the sisters dropped to his knees and began drying the dog with paper towels in a wholly absorbed methodical way even blotting the inside of his collar and wiping the gaps between his stubby claws he went through the same ritual as he dried his pistol watching this lis understood immediately that trenton heck was both simpler and sharper than she and she resolved to take him more seriously than shed been inclined to the deputy returned and squeegeed the water from his cheeks with thick fingers stanley tells me he notified the troopers about owens truck theyre passing that info along to some fellow in the state police named haversham hes in charge of the search sure my old boss trenton heck said he seemed not to like this news because lis supposed he was not keen on losing or sharing his reward he added hell probably send a tactical services squad whats that the deputy asked dont you know like swat no fooling the deputy was impressed heck continued theyll be here in forty minutes id guess maybe a little longer why dont they send them by helicopter helicopter heck snorted lis looked past the others for a moment as a sheet of lightning canopied the sky she felt the thunder in her chest the deputy was asking her something but she didnt hear a word of it and when she left the room she was running portia stepped after her and alarmed called lis are you all right what is it but lis was by then taking the stairs two at a time in the bedroom she found the colt woodsman a thin automatic pistol that owen kept beside the bed hed insisted that she learn to use it and had made her fire the pistol a dozen times into a paper target tacked to a pile of rotten wood behind the garage shed done so dutiful and nervous her hand jerking unartfully with every shot she hadnt touched it since then perhaps three or four years ago she hefted the gun now and noted that unlike rose petals the checkered grip and metal of this long pistol left strong sensations upon her callused hands the pistol disappeared into her pocket she walked slowly to the window the immense blackness outside itlacking any reference pointhypnotized her and drew her forward like a sleepwalker she approached the glass three feet two compelled to find something visible on the other side of the bluegreen panesa branch an owl a cloud the verdigris pegasus weather vane atop the garage anything that would make the darkness less infinite and permanent lightning lit the flooded driveway she recalled waving goodbye to her husband she realized with a shock that that gesture might have been the last communication between them ever and worse perhaps one that he had not even seen she gazed into the night where are you owen where lis knew he was near for shed by now realized that injured or not he was making his way back to the house trying to get hrubek onto their property and complete his missionto kill him and make it look like selfdefense they could be a mile from the house or fifty yards away it was only a matter of time another bolt of lightning streaked from the sky and hit nearby lis gasped stepping back as the thunder rattled the badly glazed eighteenthcentury panes the storm now came forward like a wave a wall of indifferent water a thousand feet high it sped frantically across the lake whose surface was oddly illuminated as if the globules of rain emitted radiation when they collided with the dark water a huge growl of thunder enveloped the house finishing with a sharp whipcrack lis hurried downstairs she pulled her rain slicker from a hook and said im going outside im going to find my husband on april doctor samuel a mudd splinted john wilkes booths leg and put him to bed in one of the cots that served as a small infirmary in his home office dr mudd had an idea who his patient was and what hed done the night before but the doctor chose not to ride to town and report booth to the authorities because his wife was afraid to be left alone with the eerie feverish man and begged him not to go mudd got arrested as part of the conspiracy to assassinate lincoln and came one vote from being hanged he was finally released from prison but he died a ruined man michael hrubek now reflecting on mudds ordeal thought he had a woman to thank for that just goes to show he also thought a doctor might not be a bad idea right at the moment his wrist burned wildly it had slammed into the steering wheel when he drove his car into the conspirators truck it didnt hurt much but the forearm was glossy swollen nearly double from fingers to elbow it was a log of flesh as he walked through the rain however he grew too excited to worry about his injuries for michael hrubek was in oz the town of ridgeton was magical to him it was the end of his quest it was the promised land and he looked at every strip of pale november grass and every rainspattered parking meter and mailbox with respect the storm had darkened most of downtown and the only lights were batterydriven exit and emergency signs the red rectangles of light added to the mythic quality of the place standing in a booth he flipped through a soggy phone book and found what he sought he recited a prayer of gratitude then turned to the map in the front of the book and located cedar swamp road stepping back into the rain michael hurried north he passed darkened businessesa liquor store a toy store a pizza restaurant a christian science reading room wait a scientific jesus our lord bless us jesus cryist was a physicist cryist was a chemist he laughed at this thought then moved on catching ghostly images of himself in the plateglass windows some of them were protected by wrinkled sheets of amber plastic some were painted black and were undoubtedly used for surveillance michael knew all about oneway mirrors which could be purchased for from redding science supply company plus shipping no cod orders please good night ladies he sang as he splashed through a torrent of water in the gutters good night ladies the street ended at a threeway intersection michael stopped cold and his heart suddenly began to crawl with panic oh god which way right or left cedar swamp is one way but it is not the other which left or right which way he bellowed michael understood that if he turned one direction he would get to cedar swamp road and if he turned the other he would not he looked at the signpost and blinked and in the very small portion of a second it took to close and open his eyelids his rational mind seized like an overheated engine it simply stopped explosions of fear surged through him so intense that they were visible black and yellow and orange sparks popped through the streets caroming off the windows and wet sidewalks he began a fearful keening and his jaw shook he sank to his knees pummeled by voicesthe voices of old abe of the dying soldiers of the conspirators dr anne he moaned why did you leave me dr anne im so afraid i dont know what to do what should i do michael hugs the signpost as if its his only source of blood and oxygen and he cries in panic searching his pockets for the pistol he must kill himself he has no choice the panic is too great unbearable terror cascades over him one bullet in the head like old abe and itll all be over he no longer cares about his quest about betrayal about eve about lisbone and revenge he must end this terrible fear the gun is here he can feel its weight but his hand is shaking too badly to reach into his pocket finally he rips the wool and slips his hand inside the rent cloth feeling the harsh grip of the pistol i cant stand it oh please he cocks the gun the brilliant light swept across his closed eyes filling his vision with bloody illumination a voice was speaking saying words he couldnt hear he relaxed his grip on the gun his head jerked upright and michael realized that someone was talking to him not dr anne or the deceased president of the united states or conspirators or good dr mudd the voice was that of a scrawny man in his late fifties sticking his face out of a car window not three feet from where michael huddled he apparently hadnt seen the gun which michael now slipped back into his pocket say you all right young man i you hurt yourself my car he mumbled my car the gray and skinny man was driving a battered old jeep with a scabby canvas top and vinyl sheets for windows you had an accident and you couldnt find a phone that worked sure sure theyre mostly all out causa the storm how bad you hurt michael breathed deeply several times the panic diminished not bad but my cars in a state she wasnt that good not like the old cadillac no well come on ill ride you over to the hospital you should get looked at no no im fine but im turned around you know where cedar swamp is cedar swamp road i mean sure i do you live there people im supposed to see im late and theyll be worried well ill drive you over youd do that for me i think i ought to be taking you to the emergency room what with that wrist of yours no just get me to my friends theres a doctor there dr mudd you know him dont believe i do no hes a good doctor well thats good because that wrist is pretty surely broken give me a ridemichael stood up slowlyand ill be your friend till your dying day the man hesitated for an uncomfortable moment then said uhhuh well hop in only mind the door youre a tall one owens trying to make it back here to the house lis explained im sure of it and i think hrubeks chasing him why wouldnt he just go to the station house the deputy asked hes worried about us being here im sure lis said she said nothing about the real reason that owen wouldnt go to the police i dont know the deputy said i mean stan told me look theres nothing to talk about lis said im going out there the deputy objected uneasily well lis portia again echoed his thoughts lis theres nothing you can do heck took off his pitiful baseball cap and scratched his head when he replaced the hat he left a forelock of curly hair dipping toward his right eye he was studying her you testified at his trial lis looked back at him i was the chief prosecution witness he was nodding slowly finally he said i arrested me a fair number of men and testified at their trials none of them ever came after me lis looked into hecks eyes which immediately fled to an old shaker chair she said you were lucky then werent you that i was but its pretty you know rare for an escapee to come after somebody usually they just hightail it out of the state he seemed to want a response but she gave none other than well michael hrubek probably isnt your typical escapee no argument from me there heck didnt continue his line of thought lifting the bright rain slicker from the hook by the door lis said to her sister you stay here if owen gets back before i do honk the horn portia nodded uhn maam lis glanced at heck that might make you a bit you know obvious dont you think hows that the uhn yellow oh i didnt think about that heck lifted away the souwester and hung it up lis reached for her dark bomber jacket but heck held up a hand tell you what im thinking lets dont any of us go tripping over our own tails here i know how you feel and everything him being your husband and all but im speaking as somebodys done this sort of thing before i get paid to track people let me go out there by myself no let me finish ill go out and look for your husband and if hes anywhere nearby ill stand a chance of finding him probably a sight better than you and not only if youre wandering around out there too itll just distract me his voice was taut anticipating liss protest she guessed his essential motive was the reward yet what he said was true and even if lis happened to find her husband she wondered how persuasive she would be in urging him to give up the hunt for hrubek and return home he hadnt listened to her before why would he now okay trenton lis said what i think we should do is ill go out in the woods toward the front gate he could climb the fence of course but ill risk that he wont be swimming the lake not in this wind thats for sure heck then glanced at the deputy id say you stay closer to the house like a second line of defense somewhere near here the deputys interest was rekindled hed done his duty and what more could he say to an ornery woman of the house now he had allies and might see some action and glory after all ill back the car into the bushes over there he said excitedly howd that be i can see the whole of the yard and he wont catch a glimpse of me heck told him that was good idea then said to lis i know your husbands a hunter now you might not feel too comfortable with sidearms but you think maybe you could turn one up for yourself lis took perverse glee in lifting the pistol from her pocket she held it muzzle down finger outside the trigger guardjust as owen had solemnly instructed her portia was appalled the deputy guffawed but trenton heck merely nodded with satisfaction as if one more item had been crossed off a checklist ill leave emil with you here storms too fierce even for him keep him by you hes not an attack dog but hes big and hell make a bushel of noise if someone was to come by uninvited i dont have anything darker thatll fit lis said nodding at the souwesters thats okay im pretty impervious to water but ill take a baggie for my gun its an old german walther and rusts easy he slipped the pistol into a bag and tied the end closed returning the gun to his cowboy holster he gazed outside and stretched his leg out for a moment wincing she supposed that whatever was wrong with his thigh wouldnt be helped by the rain the pain seemed quite severe the deputy went outside to the car though not before hed unsnapped the thong of his automatic and circled his fingers around the grip several times like a bad actor in a bad western lis heard the car start he backed into the bushes halfway between the garage and the house he could turn on his spotlights and illuminate the entire backyard from where he was parked trenton turned to her and spoke in a low voice you know how to use that weapon ill bet but i dont suppose you ever did use it not in a situation like this he didnt wait for confirmation but continued what id like you to do is shut all the lights out in the house sit yourselves away from the windows ill keep my eye on the property as best i can flick the lights if you need me and ill come running then without a word to either woman or his dog he vanished into the sheets of rain lis closed the door behind him jesus lis portia whispered but there were so many things she might be shocked by that her sister had no idea to what she was referring thoughts of his wife are long gone from dr ronald adlers mind the way she tastes the arc of her thigh her skins texture the smell of her hairmemories that so occupied him earlier in the evening are wholly absent now for captain haversham called him not long ago with the news cloverton the trooper growled hrubek just killed a woman the lids off it now doc oh my god adler closed his eyes and his heart seemed to fibrillate as he was lanced with the mad thought that hrubek had committed this crime solely for the purpose of betraying him he held the phone in quivering hands and heard the trooper explain with illconcealed fury how hrubek had murdered a woman and carved her up then stolen a motorcycle to escape to boyleston a motorcycle carved her up cut words on her boobs and two cops in gunderson are missing they were cruising down route and called in with a report on him last we heard were sure hes killed em and dumped the bodies somewhere lowsecurity harmless jesus christ man what were you thinking of ill be in your office in a half hour the phone went dead adler is now on his way back to his office from the hospitals cafeteria where he had taken havershams dismaying call and where he had then sat numb for the next thirty minutes but the doctor isnt making very good progress alone in the dark hallway he pauses and spends a moment considering the chain reaction of miraculous physiology thats now causing his neck hair to stir his eyes to water and his genitals to contract alarmingly and although hes thinking about the vagus nerve and adrenaline release and synaptic uptake whats most salient in his mind is how fucking scared he is the corridor is feet long twenty doors open off it and all but the last onehisare closed and dark every other bulb in the overhead fixtures has been removed as an economy measure and of those remaining most are burnt out three corridors also lead off this one they too are dark as graves adler looks down the dark hallway and wonders why arent i walking hes left the elevator alcove and he knows that haversham is waiting impatiently in his office yet here the doctor stands frozen with fear his arms are weak his legs too he squints away an unfunny apparitiona huge pale form that has stuck its head out of a corridor nearby and darted back into hiding the patients ghostly wailing is displaced by the howl of the wind it reverberates in adlers chest and he thinks all right enough please adler walks five paces again he stopson the pretext of flipping through a file he carries it is at this moment that he is struck by the sudden awareness that michael hrubek has returned to kill him that theres no logic to this mission doesnt lessen adlers growing panic one bit he gasps as the elevator summoned from below grinds downward he hears a patient somewhere utter a guttural moan of infinite inexpressible sorrow as this sound strokes his neck he places one foot before the other and doggedly starts walking no nomichael hrubek has no need to kill him michael hrubek doesnt even know him personally michael hrubek couldnt have made the journey back to the hospital in this short time even if he did feel like eviscerating the director dr ronald adler the veteran of the state mentalhealthhospital system dr ronald adler the fairtomiddlin graduate of a provincial medical schoolthese dr ronald adlers believe that hes probably safe yet the man whose head was entwined between his wifes fragrant legs earlier in the night the man who mediates boardmeeting conflicts far better than he cures madness the man who now pads down this murky stone hallwaythese ronald adlers are paralyzed by the sound of his own gritty footsteps please dont let me die his office now seems miles away and he gazes at the white trapezoid of light falling onto the concrete from his open doorway he continues on passing one of the arterial corridors and exhales a fast astonished laugh at his inability to turn and look down it if he does he will see a technicolor film clip of michael hrubek reaching into adlers mouth the hospital director cannot purge from his thoughts the passages of hrubeks transcripts he read earlier in the evening he recalls in particular detail the patients lively discussion of locating and rupturing a spleen enough please adler passes by the corridor safely but a new worry intrudesthat hell lose control of his bladder hes insanely furious at his wifefor gripping his cock earlier in the evening and unwittingly putting in mind the nowconsuming fear of incontinence he must urinate he absolutely must but the mens room is a lengthy way down the corridor he now approaches the restrooms are dark this time of night he considers pissing against the wall i dont want to die he hears footsteps no yes whose are they the ghosts of one woman and two troopers whats that sound hah theyre his own feet or perhaps not he pictures the urinal he turns toward it and begins to walk through the dim hall and as he does a thought comes to mind that michael hrubeks escape tugs at everything hes ever done wrong as a doctor the escape is the crib sheets that accompanied him into organicchemistry exams its the charts he misplaced the misprescribed medications the aneurysms he forgot to inquire about before dispensing large dosages of nardil the madmans escape is like lifting a twentypound line and watching rise from a murky pond some diseased fish snagged by your hook bloated and near deatha prize you regret ever seeking a token you wish would forever go away listen to me you son of a bitch haversham growled after he hung up the telephone his audiencethe hospital director and a glazedeyed peter grimesstared at him numbly a grating rain fell heavily on the windows of adlers office the wind screamed we just got ourselves another notice haversham continued this ones from ridgeton seems theres a report somebody crashed into a truck and drove it off the road both drivers disappeared into the woods the truck got hit was registered to owen atcheson owen the husband of that woman testified against hrubek the fellow who was here before so now maybe four dead they know for a fact it was hrubek who did it they think they dont know thats what we need you for oh jesus adler muttered he touched his eyes and pushed until he heard soft pops of pressure beneath the lids four dead he whispered its up to you doc we need to know where to put our resources what was he talking about resources no cuddlypup psychocrap i want a straight answer weve had two reportsboyleston and amtrak or ridgeton and that woman testified against him wheres he headed adler gazed at him blankly i think they want to know where to send their men sir grimes explained delicately thats the problem yeah two reports they dont jibe nobody knows jack shit for certain adler looked from his assistant to the tall cowboy of a trooper and thought sleep deprivation thats my problem well the ridgeton sheriff has men he can send doesnt he sure he does only they got but four in the whole of the department they sent somebody out to the house so the womans safe but i need to know where to deploy we gotta catch this boy i got four tactical services troopers ready to go the rest of the men wont be available for close to an hour where should i send the van its your call me i dont know the facts adler blurted i need facts i mean are they sure hrubek hit atcheson where did he get a car was he actually sighted on the motorcycle we cant decide anything until we know that and youve got all the facts there are haversham muttered gazing steeleyed at the doctor this boys been in your care here for four months whatever you know about him is all you got to go on ask dick kohler hes hrubeks doctor we would but we dont know where he is and he aint answering his pager adler looked up as if to ask why me he leaned forward and pressed his palms together he chewed compulsively on a red index finger boyleston the doctors finger left his mouth and traced along the same map on which earlier in the evening he had plotted michael hrubeks capture and richard kohlers downfall ridgeton suddenly his face began to bristle and nothing in this mad universe was as important to dr ronald adler as capturing his errant patient capturing him alive if possible but if not then putting him on a slab with his meaty toe tagged for burial in potters field lying cold and blue and still oh let this night be over he prayed let me slip back home and lie against the hot breasts of my wife let me find sleep under the thick comforters let this night end with no more deaths adler ripped open hrubeks file and leafed frantically through the sheets they spun out and scattered on his desk he began to read hrubek adler considered displays classic paranoidschizophrenic symptomsthought content illogical flights of ideas loose association pressure of speech and increased motor activities typical of manic episodes blunted and inappropriate affect no no no adler spat out in a whisper garnering troubled glances from the two men nearby what he raged to himself do these words mean what is hrubek doing what is driving him who is michael hrubek adler spun his desk chair and gazed out the rainspattered window item hrubek suffers from auditory hallucinations and his speech is a typical schizophrenics word salad he might have told that truck driver boston meaning to say boyleston item revenge the purported reason for going to ridgeton is a common element of paranoidschizophrenic delusions item a schizophrenic would shun the circuitous path of getting to boyleston via cloverton item amtrak runs through boyleston train travel has a far lower stress factor than air travel and accordingly would be preferred by a psychotic item despite being off thorazine he is driving a vehicle thus hrubek has through will or miracle tamed his anxiety and might make the more arduous and complicated journey south to boyleston rather than the logistically simpler trip to ridgeton item with all his tricks tonight his false clues and cleverness hrubek was displaying astonishing cognitive functionality he could easily be setting up a feint to ridgeton intending all along to go to boyleston item but on the other hand he might be so highfunctioning that he was doublefeintingappearing to head for ridgeton when that town was in fact his destination item hes capable of unmotivated murder item some of his delusions have to do with united states history politics and government agencies and several times in his therapy sessions he mentioned washington dca place he could get to via amtrak item he has a hatred of women and he has a rape conviction he threatened the atcheson woman several months ago item he has a fear of confrontation item he cheeked his medicine in anticipation of this evening indicating a longthoughtout plot item item item a thousand facts cascaded though the doctors sumptuous mind dosages of haldol and stelazine intakeinterview observations milieutherapy encounters verbatims of his delusional ramblings psychopharmacologists and social workers reports adler spun back to confront the files spearing some sheets of paper beneath his narrow fingers and clutching others randomly he looked at a page of transcript but he saw instead michael hrubeks faceeyes that revealed no ebullience or lethargy no affection or contempt no trust or doubt adler sat very still for a moment suddenly he looked up at the lined exhausted face of the state trooper and spoke what he devoutly believed to be the truth hrubeks making for the train station hes going to washington dc send your troopers to boyleston now the two sisters went about their tasks combing the house shutting out lights they walked in silence jumping at the noise when there was thunder and at the shadows when there was not finally the house was lit only by ambient light from outside and a few blue uplamps in the greenhouse which lis had left on for the comfort of the faint illumination she reckoned theyd be invisible from the outside shadows fluttered on the walls and floors together they returned to the kitchen and sat side by side on a bench facing an army of pine and birch trees through the rainswept backyard five minutes of quiet passed the rain battering the greenhouse the wind screaming through the holes and cracks in the old house finally lis was no longer able to keep from speaking portia theres something i started to tell you tonight earlier the affair lis whispered discreetly as if owen were in the next room i dont know if this is the time lis touched her sisters knee this things been between us too long i cant stand it anymore whats between us lis this isnt really the time to have a talk for heavens sake i have to talk to you later no now lis said heatedly now if i dont do it now i may never and whys it so important because you have to understand why i said those terrible things to you and i have to know something from you too look at me look okay you told me you were seeing somebody so what what does indian leap have to do with it oh portia lis must have unknowingly inhaled a huge lungful of air her chest stung suddenly and she lowered her forehead to her drawnup knees to ease the pain in the turbulent silence that flowed between them lis felt the pain drift away and she lifted her head again to face her sister as she was about to speak a faint not unpleasant roll of thunder filled the room and as it did portias eyes harrowed with understanding she said oh no yes lis said yes my lover was robert gillespie so how long you known the atchesons the jeep driver had a narrow face and gray wattles running down his throat he downshifted the old vehicle and nursed it up a hill north of downtown ridgeton exhaust popping and the gears in agony the big man next to him was studying the shifting with more interest than the driver thought natural years and years ive known them he said many years i know owen the driver said talked to him a few times we run into each other at ace hardware some a decent sort for a lawyer a hundred years id guess pardon me lisbone especially i didnt think she pronounced it that way but you know em bettern me id guess the jeep bounded over a rough spot of road youre lucky i come by nobodys out on the streets tonight because of the storm those weathermen with their toupees and funny names they said its going to be a pisser of a storm but naw its just a little rain is all it is the big man didnt respond the jeep hissed past the intersection of cedar swamp and north street and for a moment the driver thought that he saw someone turn quickly startled by their passage and drop over the side of a small hill near the drainage ditch simultaneously the sky filled with a huge sphere of lightning and shadows danced every which way a branch fell nearby the driver put the apparition down to a freak arrangement of lights and fog and rain he sped up and followed the winding uneven course of cedar swamp shameful on the part of the county whenre they going to get around and do it up right put some new asphalt along here this roads mostly mud and twigs mud and twigs the big man fired back mud and twigs i believe i mayve made a mistake here what happened to your car mud and twigs maybe something you seem to know a lot about when his rider added nothing more the driver said ahn she slipped out from under me on a slick road she went and twisted rolled over and over what about the police theyre busy elsewhere two of them two young men i was particularly sorry about them poor gunderson boys but i had no choice never again the driver thought never ever again rain or no rain cracked wrist bone or no the big man stared intently at the trees then with great concentration unlocked and relocked his door seven times he asked you ever been in the army whats the best answer to give the driver said did a tour yessir was stationed in army intelligence nope i was a gi the big man frowned whats that government issue a dogface combat infantryman a gi yessir gi gi gee i wonder if you know where abraham lincoln was shot uhm in the head or during a play theyre both right answers i knew that sure oh brother whatve i done to myself here quite a storm after all i stand corrected glad i got fourwheel drive fourwheel drive the man said yes what is that exactly what is fourwheel drive you dont know that the driver blurted a laugh everybody knows what fourwheel drive is the big man turned to him with a malevolent glare and the driver rubbed the back of his hand across a stubbled cheek adding that was most probably a joke nice try the man snapped leaning across the gearshift placing his round face very close to the drivers but if somebody was away in a different country for a long time isnt it possible that they might not know what fourwheel drive is put that way its moren possible what if somebody from for instance just showed up now are you saying its not possible that they might not know what fourwheel drive is moren possible he repeated miserably you know im thinking we should really stop by that hospital get your arm looked at the big man wiped his face with his stubby peasant fingers yellow as his teeth and then took from his pocket a blueblack pistol he lifted it to his face and smelled it then licked the barrel ah the driver whispered and began to pray take me to the atchesons place the man bellowed take me there now and use all of those damn fourwheeled drivers of yours several miles up the road the driver pulled the jeep to a stop bladder loose and hands quivering ill never forgive myself for doing this to the atchesons he thought but thiss the way its gotta be that theres the driveway nice try but i dont see the sign there it is there underneath that rose on the mailbox see the name are you going to kill me you get out of this car and i want to make it so it wont work anymore the jeep yes i want to make it so it wont work okay i can do that lets both get out only im asking you not to hurt me you ever have a mind to go to washington dc youre speaking of of course dc who gives a shit about seattle no no never have i swear good show me how to dismember this truck you take off the distributor cap and pitch it away this thingll never start do that the driver opened the blunt hood of the car and ripped the cap off it sailed into the woods he looked completely forlorn the rain matted his hair and ran into the deep grooves of his face the big man turned to him now you think im stupid youre trying reverse psychology you say you dont want to go to washington hoping ill say go there is that right the man choked thats about right sir well i want you to run you run all the way to washington dc and tell them that revenge is here are you going to shoot me in the back you tell them that are you going to run he ran never looking back believing that hed die before he got ten feet then before he got twenty then fifty running through the streams of rain waiting for death he never turned and so he never saw the big man holding the pistol high in front of him like a nineteenthcentury pinkerton detective stalk slowly down the driveway of gravel and mud lis stared at the young womans face even in the dark she could clearly see silver dots of reflection in her eyes yet lis would have turned on all the lights in the kitchen risked attracting a hundred michael hrubeks to witness her sisters expression at this moment to see if her words were lies or the truth tell me honestly portia did you know about us robert and me before you made love with him either way i lose she thought either her lover had betrayed her or her lover and her sister still she had to know the answer oh lis of course not i wouldnt do that to you didnt you know that no how could i know youre my sister but no i didnt know lis wiped tears looking down i thought he might have told you and you well you just decided to go ahead anyway no of course he didnt liss heart hadnt beat this hard since shed been in the cave at indian leap fleeing from her mad pursuer i didnt know all these months i just didnt know believe me lis think about it why would robert say anything he wanted to get laid he wasnt going to spoil it by confessing that he was my sisters lover when i saw the two of you there together she closed her eyes and massaged her temple and tonight when you were flirting with owen lis werent you portias lips pressed together tightly finally she said i flirt sure it doesnt mean i want somebody if robertd told me about you two idve said no men look at me its a power i have sometimes i think its all i have oh portia it was robert of course i was so angry with not you i wanted to hit him i wanted to kill her voice faded i felt so betrayed claire died because of him after she saw you two she was so upset she ran off and got lost in the cave half the guys i go out with are roberts you can spot em a mile away lis he was all wrong for you no its not what you think it wasnt just a fling we were equals robert and me dorothy was dragging him down they hated each other they fought all the time and owen he doesnt love me the same way not at all i could feel it after being with robert all i felt was the absence of owens love the night before the picnic that saturday night owen was working late in hartford and robert came over lis let me finish owen called and said he wouldnt be home before two or three robert and i made love in the greenhouse we were there for hours hed pull the petals off flowers and hed touch me with them lis closed her eyes and lowered her head once more to her knees and then he proposed proposed from portias lips popped her breathy laugh he asked you to marry him he and dorothy had been unhappy for a long time shed been cheating on him for several years he wanted to marry me and you said no right and lis whispered i said no portia shook her head so he was pissed at you and when i turned my big hazel eyes on him in the truck he jumped at the bait oh brother did i put my foot in it or what i didnt want to end it with him i just couldnt leave owen i wasnt ready to hed given up that woman for me i thought i should try to make it work mistake lis mistake why didnt you go for it my god it mayve been your only chance to dump the last of the family lis shook her head confused you no no owen you shouldve done it years ago what do you mean last of the family portia laughed doesnt owen remind you just a little of father oh dont be crazy theres no comparison why look what hes doing tonight she waved at the window hes out there for me owens a despot lis just like father no hes a good man hes solid he does love me in his way well father put a roof over our heads you call that love portia had grown angry you call it love when somebody says you didnt clean up very well this week or how dare you wear that lowcut blouse then lifts up your skirt and leaves those darling little welts on you the willow trees still in the backyard i see if id moved here thats the first thing that wouldve gone idve chopped that son of a bitch to the ground in ten seconds flat tell me lis how did you explain the marks in gym class you probably changed into your uniform with your back to the locker i told everybody i had an older lover who tied me up and jerked off while he whipped me oh dont look so horrified you talk about love love for christs sake if we grew up in such normal circumstances how come you hide away in this neverland and whym i the easiest fuck on east seventysecond street lis buried her head in her arms the tears streamed her sister said lis im sorry she laughed look what being back here does it makes me crazy ive had more of a dose of family than i can deal with i knew i shouldnt have come on the picnic i shouldntve come tonight lis touched her sisters knee observing that portia was once more wearing her gaudy silver rings and the flecked crystal like a huge grain of salt again hung from her neck a moment passed and portia lowered her hand onto her sisters toughened ruddy fingers but offered no pressure and soon withdrew it then lis too took back her hand and looked out the window staring at the rain snaking down the glass finally she stood up theres something i have to do ill be back in a minute do ill be right back youre going outside portia sounded frightened mystified the padlock on the basement door i have to see about it no lis dont im sure owen checked it i dont think so portia shook her head and watched lis take the gun from her pocket and awkwardly pull the slide to put a bullet in the chamber lis what nothing i nothing carefully pointing the muzzle toward the floor lis dons the bomber jacket she pauses at the back door looking back the old house is dark this house three stories high and filled with flowers and books and the spirits of many dead she thinks how odd it is that were awed by our mortality only during the small momentswhen we think of painted fingernails or a passage of music or the proximity of sleeping bodiesnever at mean ruthless times like these she flicks off the safety catch of the gun and feels no fear whatsoever as she steps into the raindrenched yard owen atcheson every inch of his skin wet in agony ducked against the muddy embankment of the drainage ditch and cringed like a child as a shaft of lightning engulfed the sky above him the thunder shook his teeth and sent spasms of pain through his left arm after all this he thought please dont let me get electrocuted he looked along cedar swamp road down which the jeep had vanished five minutes before sending rooster tails of dirty rain into the air behind it hed recognized it as will mccaffreys he supposed the old coot had worked overtime at the mill and was finally heading home owen sank back into the dirty foaming water this unpleasantness didnt bother him on hunting trips hed endured leeches mosquitoes and temperatures of degrees and below tonight he carried only his pistol and twenty rounds of ammunition on other occasions hed borne not only his weapons but an eightypound pack and more than once the body of a fallen comrade as well these hardships he could cope with far more troubling was the questionwhere the hell was his prey owen surveyed the terrain for the dozenth time yes he supposed itd be possible for hrubek to avoid the road completely and reach the house through the forest but that would require a compass and hours of time and would force him to swim the lake or skirt the shore which was thickly overgrown and virtually impassable besides hrubek had shown a strong preference for roadsas if his impeded mind believed that people could be connected only via asphalt or concrete roads owen reflected cars the jeep mccaffrey he recalled didnt live north of town his bungalow was on the west side hed have no need or occasion to take cedar swamp certainly not to reach his house the only reason someone who didnt live near here would come this way was to take the shortcut to the mall in chilton and there sure werent any stores open there this time of night owen looked up the dark rainswept road for a moment then struggled from the water and began the agonizing run to his wife and his home trenton heck slowly climbed the face of the huge rock shelf that cut the atcheson property in two the surface was slick with rain but slipperiness was not the greatest impediment to his twentyfoot climb rather hecks disobedient leg made for very slow progress he was as exhausted as he was drenched by the time he reached the summit and collapsed on the rocky plain he caught his breath while he massaged his thigh and scanned the driveway and forest below him he saw nothing but the mesmerizing flutter of leaves as the rain poured down after resting for a moment he rose slowly and in a crouch eased along the crest of this hill parallel to the vague white strip of driveway in the shallow valley below he made his way slowly from the house toward cedar swamp roadkeen to spot hrubek yes but even more eager to find owen a man with whom heck felt considerable kinship and a man maybe weaponless maybe injured as he moved cautiously toward the road he found himself thinking about lis atcheson he kept returning to the question that had occurred to him on the hectic drive here after hed abandoned his journey to boyleston limping into cover behind a tall oak tree for a futile inspection of the raindrenched panorama beneath him he wondered again why exactly was michael hrubek after her of course the fellow was maybe completely mad heck allowed lord knew enough people seemed to think so but if heck understood right hrubekd need one hell of a motive to go through with a trip like thisa journey that clearly terrified him itd be like heck himself standing up and with full intent walking right toward someone threatening to shoot him in the leg again why would a man bring that kind of heartache on himself lis testifying against him naw there had to be more to it it was true as hed told her that convicts rarely make matters worse for themselves by hurting witnesses the only time well usually the only time they carried out threats was when the witness had lied but why would sheve done that these musings were interrupted by something heck saw in the distance a large cube of faint blue light it was in the direction of the house he made his way closer and squinted through the rain the lights of the greenhouse she must have forgotten to turn them off the radiance was he thought an unfortunate beacon but there was nothing to be done about it now lightning flared through the forest and heck was jarred by the encompassing blast of thunder the lightning troubled himnot from fear of a hit but because he couldnt afford to be lightblinded also a nearby strike would make him if even for a fraction of a second as sharp a target as if hed been flarelit thunder sounded again or was it thunder the sound was more of a crack than a boom and now that he thought about it the noise seemed to have come from the driveway of the atcheson place alarmed he looked toward the house again for liss summoning signal but no lights flashed through the plastic bag he thumbed the old walther nervously and stalked toward cedar swamp road surveying the dense forest around himwith its mulchy cluttered carpet of downed foliage in this tangle he saw a dozen shadows that clearly resembled the man he sought then he forgot about the thunder that resembled a gunshot and grew depressed the task of finding either owen or hrubek suddenly seemed hopeless oh man heck muttered here hed turned down kohlers bribe hed helped get a woman killed and he could just hear adler saying oh no sorry mr heck it really was tactical services that caught hrubek but heres a hundred bucks for your trouble damn five minutes later he was engaged in a conversation with jill about his troubles when he saw out of the corner of his eye a flash of light coming from the direction of the house he stepped forward quickly thinking at first that it was a summons from lis but then he stopped and squinting through the rain noted how remarkable it was that light would reflect so vibrantly off a bald bluetinted head michael hrubek was not fifty feet away the madman was oblivious to heck and hiding in a stand of bushes overlooking the garage lord hes a monster heck thought his face burning at the first sight of his quarry he trained the walther still in the baggie on the mans back he flicked up the thumb safety and walking as silently as he could closed the distance between them when he was thirty feet away heck took a deep breath and called hrubek the big man jumped and barked out a frightened pathetic cry he looked back through the streaming rain toward heck his eyes scanning the darkness i want you to lie down on the ground do it i got a gun here okay heck thought hes going to run you going to shoot him or not decide now otherwise you chase him hrubeks eyes darted and his tongue appeared circling his open lips he seemed like a confused bear rearing in fright heck decided shoot park one in his leg hrubek ran heck fired twice the bullets kicked up leaves behind the fleeing figure who was covering ground like a wide receiver dodging trees and crashing over saplings falling scrabbling through leaves then leaping to his feet again he howled in fear heck pursued in a fast lope though hrubek carried nearly twice hecks weight he set a furious pace and kept his distance for a long ways but slowly heck began to gain then suddenly he cried out at a searing eruption of agony a cramp seized his game leg from calf to hip heck dropped to his side his leg out straight twitching muscles hard as oak he contorted desperately trying to find a position that would ease the pain slowly it subsided on its own leaving him exhausted and breathless when he sat up and looked around him hrubek was gone heck rolled upright and stood gasping he scooped up his gun and hurried along the low ridge near where hrubek had disappeared orienting himself he located the house a hundred yards away through the rain he saw a thousand trees and ten thousand shadows any one of which might be hiding his prey as he started toward the house hurrying as fast as he dared on the trembling leg heck heard the gunshot not more than ten feet behind him at the same time he felt with more shock than pain the tug of the bullet as it tore through his back oh he gasped he staggered a few steps wondering why no one had ever suggested that hrubek might have a gun he dropped his pistol and looked down at the pucker of his work shirt where the hot bit of metal had exited oh no damn dimly in his minds eye trenton heck saw his exwife jill in her freshly pressed waitress uniform then as in his actual life she vanished from him quickly as if she had far more important matters to attend to and he dropped to his knees falling forward and beginning an endless tumble down the hill of slick leaves lis portia called as her sister returned to the kitchen and hung up the bomber jacket shaking the water out of her hair glancing at portia she locked the door then turned and stared into the backyard which was just a blur in the heavy rain that noise portia blurted what noise didnt you hear it the younger sister paced and wrung her hands compulsively it seemed i mean it wasnt thunder i thought there were gunshots i was worriedwhere were you i had trouble getting through the mud to the basement door it was locked after all waste of time portia said maybe we should tell the deputy lightning struck nearby and she jumped at the thunder shit i hate this it was fifty or sixty feet to the police car lis stood at the door and waved but received no response from the deputy portia said he cant see you lets go tell him with the rain he might notve heard anything all right dont look at me that way im scared what do you expect im so fucking scared lis hesitated then nodded she put on the jacket again and a black rain hat that was owensmore for camouflage than to protect her drenched hair portia pulled on the baseball cap and a navyblue windbreakeruseless against the rain but less conspicuous than the slicker then lis flung open the door portia stepped outside and lis followed clutching the gun in her pocket they were immediately overwhelmed by the storm they leaned into the torrent of rain and wind and struggled toward the car halfway there liss hat vanished toward the turbulent lake it was from this directionthe lakethat the figure suddenly appeared he grabbed lis around the shoulders and they fell together into the saturated mud of one of her rose gardens the fall emptied her lungs and she bent double gasping for breath unable to call for help his full weight was on her pinning her to the ground she yanked at the pistol but the rear lip of the receiver caught in the cloth of her pocket portia turned and saw the assailant she screamed and made a dash for the police car as lis kicked him away she succeeded only in sliding through a muddy trench and catching herself in an ungainly sitting position on the thorny stalk of a blossomless prospero rose shrub she was held immobile as the man his head lowered like an animals crawled through the muck after her muttering eerie sounds lis ripped the pocket flap open and pulled the colt from it she placed the black muzzle against his head just as trenton heck looked up and said help me oh my god im can you help me portia she shouted pocketing the automatic once again its trenton hes hurt get the deputy tell him the young woman stood at the door of the patrol car its trenton lis shouted over the wind and rain tell the deputy but portia didnt move she stepped back from the car and began to scream lis ripped her jacket from the rosebush and crawled away from heck lis approached her sister cautiously frowning smoke poured from the front seat of the cruiser portia pressed her hands over her face then fell to her knees gagging a moment later she vomited violently when the deputy had been shotpointblank in the facethe cigarette he held fell into his lap and started his uniform smoldering oh no portia was crying no no lis pushed her sister aside then scooped up mud and patted out the embers she too gagged at the smell of burnt cloth hair and skin the radio portia screamed she stood wiping her mouth and shouted the word twice more before lis understood but only a curly black wire protruded from the dash the handset had been torn off lis bent to the deputy once more though there was nothing to be done he was pasty and cold lis stepped away and glanced at the acura the water was up to the windows now and had filled the car covering the cellular phone inside together the women stumbled through the mud to where trenton heck lay on his side they managed to get him to his feet and struggled toward the back door the rain pelted their faces and stung it lay on them heavily like a dozen wet blankets halfway to the house a huge gust of wind slapped them from behind and portia slipped into a trench of mud pulling unconscious heck after her it took long agonizing minutes to get him out of the soggy yard and to the kitchen portia collapsed in the open doorway no dont stop here get him inside i have to rest portia gasped come on youre the runner you got the stamina genes in the family jesus the women dragged him into the living room and laid him on the couch emil joined them but apparently the hound had no sixth sense of disaster he sniffed once at his masters boot and went back to the corner hed commandeered where he flopped down and closed his eyes portia locked the door and turned on a small lamp in the living room lis pulled hecks work shirt open oh my goda bullet hole portias voice was high with shock get something i dont know a towel lis walked into the kitchen as she pulled a handful of paper towels off the roll she heard a noise outsidefaint at first then growing until it rivaled the howl of the wind her heart froze for the sound reminded her of claires final keening emanating up through the ground from the caves of indian leap dazed by this terrible memory and her present fear lis stumbled to the door and stared out she saw nothing but rain and windbent foliage and it was a moment before she realized that the sound was michael hrubeks unearthly cry calling from nowhere and from everywhere lisbone lisbone lisbone trenton heck lapsed into and out of consciousness lis tried to find his pulse and couldnt though when she rested her head on his chest his heart seemed to beat stridently can you hear me she shouted like a sleepwalker he muttered unearthly sounds he hardly responded to what must have been excruciating pain when lis pressed the towels firmly against the ragged blackbordered hole in his stomach portia sat in the corner of the living room her arms folded around her knees her head down lis stood and walked past her standing in the dark kitchen she looked out over the yard and saw no sign of hrubek who had ceased calling to her still the macabre sound of his voice chanting her name resonated in her mind she felt tainted abused oh please she thought despairing just leave me alone please for a long moment lis stood at the window then she turned to her sister portia the woman looked at her and began shaking her head no put this on lis handed her the bomber jacket oh lis no youre going for help i cant yes you can im not going out there you know where the sheriffs department is its on the cars stuck youre going to take the deputys portia gasped no hes in it yes you are im not going no dont ask a left out the drive a mile and a half down cedar swamp you come to north street another left then drive about six miles the sheriffs on the right side of the road cedar swampll be washed out parts of it youll have to go slow till you get to town no portias face was awash with tears with fingers white from the rain and red from a mans blood lis seized her sisters shoulders im going to put you in the car and youre going to drive to the sheriff s portias eyes flicked to the crimson stains on the sweater her voice cracked as she said youre getting his portia blood on me no lis pulled the blueblack gun from her pocket and held it in front of her sisters astonished face dont say another word youre going to climb into that car and get the fuck out of here now lets go she grabbed portia by the collar and thrust her out into the rain with their arms around each others shoulders they stumbled toward the car the ground was so marshy that it took them five minutes to get to the cruiser the muddy water that surrounded the garage now was approaching the bend in the driveway four feet deep soon the deputys car too would be submerged once they lost their balance and fell into the muck liss knee stuck in the ooze and portia actually had to pull her out with both hands foot by foot they made their way through the grimy sluice of water toward the car twenty feet to go i cant look portia whispered lis left her at the edge of the driveway and struggled to the squad car by herself the rain was still heavy but there seemed to be a faint illumination from somewhere in the skythough it was too early for dawn perhaps lis thought her eyes had simply gotten used to the darkness all her senses seemed honed like an animals she was attuned to the falling temperature the smells of rain smoke and compost the slickness of the mud and pages of wet leaves beneath her she was poised to attack anyone who might slip into the field of this blood radar reaching for the door handle she looked back at her sister what is that she wondered looking over portias shoulder a dozen yards away a large cloud seemed to form slowly growing blacker than the surrounding haze of rain it floated forward unsteadily in their direction and finally stepped clearly into view michael hrubek waded toward them one arm outstretched the other dangling apparently injured in the damaged hand hung a pistol dwarfed by his fingers he was staring directly at portia lisbone lisbone the young woman spun around and screamed falling backwards into the mud lis froze oh my god he thinks shes me hrubek reached toward her eve lifting the dark colt woodsman with both her hands lis pulled the trigger once twice more perhaps she yanked the sharp tongue of metal so hard she nearly broke her finger the bullets zipped into the night missing hrubek by inches he howled and covering his ears fled into the brush lis ran to her sister and pulled her to the car portia was limp with fear her head lolling lis thrust the gun at her she took it and stared at the black barrel while lis reached into the police car grabbing the beefy deputy by the shoulders with a huge effort lis pulled him out of the car and dropped him irreverently into the mud then reached inside and started the engine she snatched the colt away from portia who started to back away lis closed her tough hands on her sisters arms and shoved her into the front seat easing into the pool of blood portia cringed as if the liquid seared her thighs she was sobbing quaking lis slammed the door go i get his legs get his legs out portia wailed gesturing down at the deputy whose knees were directly in front of the rear tires go lis shouted and reached through the window pulling on the headlights and dropping the gearshift into drive as the car jerked forward the side mirror knocked into lis she slipped on a layer of wet pulverized leaves and fell to the swampy ground slowly the police car drove over the deputy and into the driveway portia gunned the engine with a panicked spray of mud and marble chips the car sped forward it vanished sashaying down the long driveway sending up plumes of dark water in its wake lis clambered to her feet blinded for a momentthe rear tires of the squad car had sprayed her with mud she leaned back letting the downpour clean her face flushing her eyes when she could see once more she noticed that michael hrubek was wading toward her again cautiously churning through the water already halfway across the yard lis slapped her side the gun was gone when shed fallen it had slipped out of her torn pocket she dropped to her knees and patted the sticky ooze around her but couldnt find the pistol where she cried where hrubek was just thirty feet away advancing slowly through the waisthigh flood surrounding the garage finally she could wait no longer and fled into the house slamming the door behind her she doublelocked it and from a wooden block took a long carving knife she turned to face the door but he was gone stepping cautiously to the window she surveyed the backyard carefully she couldnt see him anywhere she stepped away from the glass fearing that he might suddenly pop into view where where his absence was almost as frightening as watching him stalk toward her hurrying from the kitchen into the living room she knelt and checked on trenton heck he was still unconscious but his breathing was steady lis stood and gazed around the room her eyes looking at but not really seeing her familys pictures the porcelainbird collection the quixote memorabilia her father had brought back from iberia the chintz furniture the overwrought paintings a crash outside breaking glass hrubek was circling the house a shadow fell across a livingroom window then vanished a moment later his silhouette darkened another curtain and moved on an unbearable minute of silence suddenly a huge kick shook the front door she gasped another kick slammed into the wood a panel broke with a resounding crack he kicked it again but the wood held she saw hrubeks bulk move past the narrow doorside window her head swiveled slowly following his circuit of the house she heard him rip open the toolshed door then slam it shut silence a fist rapped on a bottleglass window in the far guest room the pane broke but she heard nothing else and guessed the windows were too high and the lattice too solid for hrubek to climb through silence again then he howled and pounded on a wall ripping cedar shakes from the side of the house as she scanned the rooms her eyes fell on the basement door my god she thought suddenly owens guns his collection was downstairs shed get one of his shotguns yet as she took a step toward the basement she heard a crash from outside then morepowerful blows that seemed to shake the foundation of the house wood splintered and with a huge bellow hrubek kicked his way through the outside basement entrance the padlock on the door had stopped him for all of thirty seconds his feet scraped on the concrete floor a moment later the stairs began to creak the stairs leading up to the hallway in which she stood oh christ the door to the basement was deadbolted but the fixture was thin brass more cosmetic than substantial she looked for something with which to wedge the door closed just as the knob started to turn she lifted a heavy oak diningroom chair and shoved it into the hallway wedging the door shut the knob turned sharply she leapt back wondering if he could still shatter the door just kick his way in but he didnt after a minute of playing with the knobalmost timidlyhe started back down the stairs the blanket of silence returned broken by an eerie laughter and the sound of his feet scraping on the basement floor he muttered words she couldnt hear after five minutes even these stopped was he still there would he set the house afire what was he doing she heard no other sound from downstairs or from outside either other than the steady patter of rain michael hrubek had vanished again holding the knife in one hand and leading hecks hound with the other lis atcheson walked into the greenhouse and sat in a dark corner to wait the rain clattered like marbles on the greenhouse roof portiad been gone twenty minutes it was only eight miles or so to the sheriff s department but the road might now be completely impassable it could take her an hour or more to get through yet as the time passed and she heard nothing more of hrubek she began to relax she even let herself wonder if maybe just maybe hed fled she felt a glow of euphoria and reflected that perhaps this was all that comfort ever was believing that were safe despite the clear and unobvious dangers from which were protected by nothing more than singlestrength glass she found herself wondering about owen she refused to think the worst no no he was fine with so much flooding hed probably ducked into a garage or house to wait out the worst of the storm she looked up at the black sky above her head and uttered a short prayer for dawnexactly the opposite of what she usually prayed for lying in bed trying so desperately to sleep a prayer for light for morning for rampaging red and blue and white lights atop approaching cars she smelled a rose whose scent now wafted past her face only twenty minutes more or nineteen or fifteen help will be here by then surely michael hrubek was lost in the forest surely hed fallen and broken his leg lis scratched the dogs ears its all right your masterll be all right she said to him as he tilted his head lis put her arm around the drooping shoulders the poor thing he was as nervous as shehis ears were quivering and his neck was a knot of muscle lis eased back and looked at him the folds of skin and boredlooking eyes his nose was in the air and his nostrils began twitching she smiled you like roses too boy do you he stood his shoulder muscles tensed an unearthly growl rumbled from deep in his throat oh my lord lis cried no he sniffed the air hard his legs eager his head lifting and falling he began to walk quickly back and forth over the floor lis leapt to her feet and grabbed the knife looking around her at the misted glass of the greenhouse she couldnt see through it where was he where stop it she shouted to the dog who continued to pace sniffing the air growing more and more frantic her palms were suddenly slick with cold sweat and she wiped them and gripped the handle of the knife once again stop it hes gone hes not here anymore stop howling she was turning in circles looking for an enemy only the dog could detect the growling became a bay a banshees wail ricocheting off every inch of window oh please she begged stop and he did silently the hound spun around and ran straight to the lathhouse doorthe one lis recalled shed been on her way to check when heck had arrived the door that shed forgotten completely about the door that now burst open and struck the hound in his ribs knocking him down stunned michael hrubek stepped into the greenhouse he stood dripping and huge and muddy in the center of the concrete floor his head swiveled taking in the gargoyles the flowers the mistsall the detailsas if he were on a gardenclub tour in his hand was the muddy pistol seeing lis he called her name in an astonished whisper and his mouth hardened into a smilea smile that arose from neither irony nor triumph nor even mad humor but was instead reminiscent of an expression one might find upon the faces of the dead standing before her he was so much larger than she remembered at the trial hed seemed small a dense bole of evil here now he filled the large greenhouse expanding to touch every wall the gravel floor the peaked roof he wiped rain from his eyes lisbone do you remember me please she whispered the narcotic of fear flooded through her and stilled her voice ive traveled very far lisbone i fooled them all i fooled them pretty good make no mistake she stepped back several feet you told them i killed that man robert six letters in his name you lied dont hurt me please a fierce growling came from the hound who was standing tall and tense behind michael the flesh of the dogs mouth was drawn back from his ardent yellow teeth michael looked down and reached for him as if the dog were a stuffed toy the hound dodged the hand and sank its teeth into michaels swollen left forearm lis thought hed scream in agony but the huge man seemed not to feel the bite at all he lifted the dog by its teeth and dragged him to a large storage closet he pulled the slavering jaw from his arm and threw the animal inside slamming the door oblivious to the gleaming razorsharp knife in her hand michael turned to lis why bother he cant feel pain hes huge he has a gun still she held the knife firmly in her hand and it was pointed directly at his heart lisbone you were in court you were part of that betrayal i had to be in court i had no choice they make you be a witness you understand that dont you i didnt mean you any harm harm he sounded exasperated harm theres harm all around you how could you miss it the fuckers are everywhere trying to stall him she said sympathetically you must be tired ignoring this he said i have to tell you something before we get down to it down to it a chill ran from her neck to her thighs now listen carefully i cant speak loudly because this room is sure to be bugged you may know that as surveil lance where they watch you from behind veils or masks or tv screens are you listening good he began a lecture frantic yet passionless justice cures betrayal he said i killed someone i admit it it wasnt a fashionable thing to do and i know now it wasnt smart he squinted as if trying to recall his text true it was not what you think of as killing but that doesnt excuse me it doesnt excuse anybody anybody he frowned and glanced at words written in red ink on his hand they had bled like old tattoos the monologue continued his subject betrayal and revenge and he paced the greenhouse floor occasionally turning his back on lis at one point she almost leapt forward and plunged the blade into his back but he turned quickly as if suspicious of her and continued to speak with its faint bluegreen lights the room seemed far removed from this time and place it reminded her of a scene from a book shed read years ago perhaps the first novel of her childhood twenty thousand leagues under the sea it seemed in her own numb dementia that they stood not in a rural greenhouse but in a victorian submarine and that she was an innocent harpooner watching the mad captain rant while the dark ocean passed over and around them michael talked about cows and christian scientists and women who hid behind unfashionable hats he mourned the loss of a beloved black car several times he mentioned a dr anne and scowling a dr richard was that she wondered kohler then he wheeled toward her i wrote you a letter and you never answered it but you didnt put a return address on it and you didnt sign it how would i know who it was from nice try he snapped but you knew i sent it his eyes were so piercing she said at once i knew yes im sorry they kept you from writing didnt they well the spirits the conspirators she nodded and he rambled on he seemed to think her given name had seven letters in it this pleased him enormously and she was terrified that hed find some correspondence or a bill that would reveal the extra letter and hed kill her for this deceit and now its time he said solemnly and lis shivered again he pulled his backpack off and set it beside him then he undid his overalls pulling them down over his massive thighs the fly of his boxer shorts parted and stunned she saw a dark stubby penis semierect oh god lis gripped the knife waiting for him to put down the pistol and pull his engorged prick free shed leap the instant he did but michael never let go of the gun his left hand the damaged one was deep within his stained and filthy underwear as if exciting himself further but after a moment when he removed his fingers she saw he was holding a small plastic bag the opening had been tied shut with a piece of string and he squinted like an absorbed child as he carefully untied it with his good hand he paused to pull his overalls up once more and with some frustration reclipped the straps he pulled from the bag a piece of newspaper it was damp and tattered he held it out like a tray and on it he reverently placed a tiny perfect animal skull which hed taken from his backpack when she didnt touch either of these he smiled knowingly at her caution and laid them on the table beside her he opened and smoothed the newspaper clipping then pushed it halfway to her stepping back like a retriever that had just deposited a shot quail at a hunters foot his hands were at his side the gun muzzle down lis planned her assault she would slip closer and aim for his eyes what a horrible thought but she had to act now was the time she tightened her grip and glanced at the clipping it was a local newspapers account of the murder trial the margins filled with the minute scrawl of his handwriting bits of words pictures stars arrowsa good freehand drawing of what seemed to be the presidential seal a silhouette of abraham lincoln american flags these all surrounded a photograph lis recognized her own grainy blackandwhite image taken as she walked down the courthouse steps toward the car after the verdict she and michael were now six feet apart she casually stepped closer lifting the clipping tilting her head toward it as she pretended to read her eyes were on the gun in his hand she smelled his foul odor she heard his labored breathing theres so much betrayal he whispered she gripped the knife his eyes aim for the eyes do it do it left eye then right then roll beneath a table do it dont hesitate she eased her weight forward ready to leap so much betrayal he said and flecks of his spittle pelted her face she didnt back away he looked down at the gun and transferred it to his good hand liss grip tightened on the knife she was incapable of praying but many thoughts filled her mind of her father and mother oh and please owen i hope youre alive our love was perhaps damaged but at least at times it was love and portia i love you tooeven if well never become what i hoped we might all right michael hrubek said he turned the gun over in his palm and offered it to her grip first all right he repeated gently she was too afraid to take her eyes from the pistol for more than an instant but in that brief glance at his face she saw the abundant tears that streamed down his cheeks do it now he said with a choked voice do it quickly lis did not move here he insisted and thrust the gun into her hand she dropped the clipping it spun to the floor like a leaf michael knelt at her feet and lowered his head in a primitive signal of supplication he pointed to the back of his head and said here do it here its a trick she thought madly it must be do it quickly she set the knife on the table and held the gun loosely michael his first name was cold in her mouth it was like tasting sand michael what do you want ill pay for the betrayal with my life do it now do it quickly she whispered you didnt come here to kill me why id no more kill you than hurt that dog in there he laughed nodding toward the supply closet lis spoke without thinking but you set traps for dogs he twisted his mouth up wryly i put the traps down to slow up the conspirators sure that was just a smart thing to do but they werent set they were sprung already id never hurt a dog dogs are gods creatures and live in pure innocence she was shocked why his whole journey this evening meant nothing a man whod kill people and revere dogs michael had traveled all these miles to play out some macabre pointless fantasy you see he offered what people say about eve isnt true she was a victim just like me a victim of the devil in her case government conspirators in mine how can you blame someone whos been betrayed you cant it wouldnt be fair eve was persecuted and so am i arent we alike you and me isnt it just amazing lisbone he laughed michael she said her voice quivering will you do something for me he looked up his face as sad as the hounds im going to ask you to come upstairs with me no no no we cant wait you have to do it you have to thats what ive come for he was weeping it was so terrible and hard ive come so far please its time for me to go to sleep he nodded at the gun im so tired a favor for me just for a little while no no theyre all around us you dont understand how dangerous it is im so tired of being awake for me she begged i dont think i can youll be safe there ill make sure youre safe their eyes met and remained locked for a long moment whatever michael saw in hers lis never guessed poor eve he said slowly then he nodded if i go there for youhe looked at the gunthen youll do it and do it quickly yes if you still want me to ill go upstairs for you lisbone follow me michael its this way she didnt want to turn her back on him yet she felt that some fragile fiber of trustspun from madness perhaps but real to himexisted between them she wouldnt risk breaking it she led the way making no quick gestures and saying nothing climbing the narrow stairs she directed him to one of the spare bedrooms because owen kept confidential legal files here a strong medeco lock secured the door she opened the door and he walked inside lis clicked on the light and told michael to sit in a rocking chair it had been mrs laubergets and was in fact the chair shed died in leaning forward expectantly and squeezing liss hand three times he went to the chair and sat she told him kindly im going to lock the door michael ill be back soon why dont you close your eyes and rest he didnt answer but examined the chair with approval and began to rock then he lowered his lids as shed suggested and laid his head against the tealgreen afghan that covered the chair back the rocking ceased lis closed the door silently and locked it and walked back to the greenhouse she stood in the exact center of the room for a long time before the swarm of emotions surrounded her another line from shakespeare slipped into her thoughts no beast so fierce but knows pity oh my god lis whispered my god she dropped to her knees and began to sob ten minutes later lis was wiping trenton hecks sweaty forehead he seemed to be hallucinating and she had no idea if bathing his face helped at all she squeezed a sponge over his skin and wiped away the effluence in a delicate and superstitious way she was standing up to get more water when she heard a sound at the door she walked into the kitchen wondering why she hadnt heard the sheriff s cars arrive or seen their lights but it wasnt the police lis cried out and ran to the door to let owen inside gaunt and muddy he stumbled into the kitchen his arm bound to his side with his belt youre hurt she cried they embraced briefly then he turned gasping and gazed outside surveying the yard like a soldier pulling his pistol from his pocket he said im all right its just my shoulder but christ listhe deputy outside hes dead i know i know it was horrible michael shot him leaning against the doorjamb he gazed into the night i had to run all the way from north street he snuck past me hes upstairs weve got to get away from the windows what hes upstairs she repeated stroking her husbands muddy cheek owen stared at his wife hrubek she held up michaels filthy gun and handed it to him owen shifted his gaze from liss haggard face to the pistol this is his whats going on he laughed shortly then his smile faded as she told him the story he wasnt going to kill you but why did he come here as she fell against owens chest once more mindful of his shoulder she said his brains gone completely he wanted to sacrifice himself for me i think i dont really know i dont think he does either wheres portia shes gone for help she shouldve been here by now so i guess the car got stuck the roads are mostly out in the north part of town shell probably have to walk lis told him about trenton heck thats his truck outside sure last i heard he was going to boyleston bad luck for him he didnt she said i dont know if hes going to make it could you look at him owen did examining the unconscious man with expert hands he knew a lot about wounds from his military service hes in shock he needs plasma or blood theres nothing i can do for him he looked around where is he hrubek i locked him in the small bedroom upstairs the storeroom and he just walked up there like a puppy oh her hand flew to her mouth lis went to the closet and set free trenton hecks dog he was not pleased at the confinement but strode out unhurt she hugged owen again then walked into the greenhouse picking up the newspaper clipping she read the betrayer hides as the crusher of heads i am to be sacrificed to save poor eve she exhaled in repulsion at the madmans macabre words owen you should see this lis glanced up and saw her husband studying michaels pistol he flipped the cylinder open and was counting how many bullets were inside then he did something whose purpose she couldnt understand he pulled on his leather shooting gloves and wiped the gun with the soft cloth owen what are you doing honey he didnt respond but continued this task methodically it was then that lis realized he still intended to kill michael hrubek no you cant oh no owen didnt look up from the gun he spun the cylinder slowly so that she supposed a bullet was aligned under the hammer with a loud click the gun snapped shut lis pled he wasnt going to hurt me he came here to protect me his minds gone owen its gone you cant kill him owen stood very still for a moment lost in thought dont do it i wont let you owen oh god a ragged white flash of light enveloped his hand and all the panes of the greenhouse rattled at once lis threw her palm toward her face in a mad effort to deflect the bullet which narrowly missed her cheekbone and snipped a lock of her tangled hair as it streaked no more than an inch from her left ear she fell to the floor toppling a small yellow rose shrub and lay on the teal slate her ear ringing smelling her own burnt hair are you mad she shouted owen its me its me as he lifted the gun once more there was a blur of motion a brown streak the dogs teeth struck owens injured arm just as they had michaels but her husband not numb to the pain cried out the pistol flew from his hand and clattered behind him then he was frantically kicking the dog hammering on its solid shoulder with his good fist the hound yelped in pain and fled out the lathhouse door which owen slammed shut lis leapt for the pistol but owen intercepted her grabbing her wrist and throwing her to the rocky floor she rolled opening patches of skin on her elbow and cheek she lay for a moment gasping too shocked to cry or say a word as she climbed to her feet her husband walked slowly toward the pistol my husband she thought my own husband the man ive lain with the majority of nights for the past six years the man by whom i wouldve borne children had circumstances been different the man with whom ive shared so many secrets many secrets yes but not all as she ran into the living room then down the basement stairs she caught a glimpse of him standing gun in hand looking toward herhis quarrywith a piercing assured stare his gaze was cold and for her money the madness in michael hrubeks eyes was twice as human as this predatory gaze poor eve no light none the cracks in the wall are large enough to admit air theyre large enough to bleed brown rain which here falls not from the sky but from the saturated earth and stone of the houses foundation if the time were two hours later perhaps the uneven wall would admit the diffuse light of dawn but now theres nothing but darkness the scuffling sounds outside the door hes coming lis lowers her head to her drawnup knees the wound on her cheek stings her torn elbows too she makes herself impossibly small condensing her body and in doing so exposing wounds she didnt know she had her thigh the ball of her ankle a huge kick against the wooden door she sobs silently at the jolt which is like a blow to her chest it seems to send her flying into the stone wall behind her and her mind reels from the crash in the hallway outside owen says nothing was the blow one of frustration or was it an attempt to reach her the door is locked true but perhaps he doesnt know it can be locked from the inside perhaps he believes the room is empty perhaps hell leave hell flee in his black jeep hell escape through the night to canada or mexico but no he doesntthough he seems satisfied that shes not inside this tiny storeroom and moves on elsewhere in the rambling basement to check other rooms and the root cellar his footsteps fade for ten minutes she has huddled here furious with herself for choosing to hide rather than flee from the house halfway to the outside basement doorthe one michael had kicked openshed paused thinking no hell be waiting in the yard he can outrun me hell shoot me in the back lis then turned and ran to this old room in the depths of the basement easing the door shut behind her locking it with a key only she knows about a key she hasnt touched for twentyfive years why owen why are you doing this its as if hes somehow caught a virus from michael and is raging in a fever of madness another crash on the wall opposite as he kicks in another door she hears his feet again the rooms dimensions are no more than six by four and the ceiling is only chest high it reminds her of the cavern at indian leap the black one where michael had whispered that he could smell her lis thinks too of the times as a girl when she huddled in this same space then filled with coal while andrew lauberget was in the backyard stripping a willow branch then shed hear his footsteps too as he came for his daughter lis read anne frank diary of a young girl a dozen times when she was young and although she understands the futility of concealment she always hid but father found her father hurt her doubly when shed tried to escape from him still she made this castle keep as defensible as she mightstockpiling crackers and water and a knife and flinging all but one of the green brass keys to the ancient lock into the lake hiding the remaining one on a nail inside above the door but the mice got the crackers the water evaporated a cousins child found the knife and took it home with him and the key proved irrelevant for when father said open the door she opened it metal sounds on concrete and rings as it falls owen grunts as he retrieves the crowbar lis cries silently and lowers her head she finds in her hand the clippingmichaels macabre gift spookier to her than the skull as the blows begin she clutches the newsprint desperately she hears a grunt of effort silence for the length of time it takes the metal to traverse the passageway outside then a resounding crash the oak begins to shatter yet her room so far is inviolable its the old boiler room next door that owen is assaulting of course that room has a headhigh window hed be thinking that she would logically pick the room that offers an exit but nosmart lis lis the teacher lis the scholar after her fathers own heart has cleverly chosen the room without an escape route another crash and another a dozen more the wood shrieks as nails are extracted a huge crack his footsteps recede hes looked inside and seen that she isnt there and that the window is still covered with dusty plywood she hears nothing lis realizes that she can see again a tiny shaft of light bleeds into the room around her through a crack in the thin wall shared with the boiler room her eyes grow accustomed to the illumination and she peers out seeing nothing she cannot hear her husband and she is left alone in this cell with the spirit of her father a dozen pounds of ancient anthracite and the clipping which she now understand holds the explanation as to why she is about to die the betrayer hides as the crusher of heads i am to be sacrificed to save poor eve the paper is smeared and disintegrating but shes able to read most of michaels handwriting heads i am ad am adam these sentences circled are connected by lines resembling blood veins to the photo accompanying the article the person they point to however is not lis they extend to the left of the photograph and converge upon the man who holds open the car door for her the betrayer hides as the crusher of heads i am to be sacrificed michaels inked lines encircle owen the betrayer is adam is this the purpose of michaels journey tonight has he come here as an angel of warning not of revenge she opens the clipping fully it is stamped library marsden state mental health facility think now michael saw the article in the hospital perhaps long after the trial perhaps in septemberjust before he sent his note to her she tried to recall his words eve of betrayal perhaps his message was not that she was the betrayer but rather the betrayed perhaps yes yes michaels role at indian leap was that of witness not murderer lis owen says calmly i know youre down here somewhere its useless you know she folds the clipping and sets it on the floor perhaps the police will find it in the investigation that will follow perhaps the owner of this house fifty years from now will notice the clipping and wonder about its meaning and the people depicted in the photo before tossing it out or giving it to his daughter for a scrapbook more likely owen will comb the house and tidily dispose of it like every other clue he is after all meticulous in his work no more prayers for dawn the storm rages and the sky outside is as dark as the hole in which she hides there are no whipsawing lines of colored lights filling the night owens grisly task will take only seconds a bullet into her with michaels gun then one for the madman with his own owen would be found sobbing on the floor clutching liss body raging at the same police whod ignored him when he begged for protection of his wife she hears his footsteps on the gritty corridor outside and then the same as with her father lisbonne rises to her feet and dutifully and with a minimum of fuss unlocks the door then pulls it gratingly aside here i am she says just as she used to ten feet away owen holds the crowbar hes somewhat surprised to see her appear from this direction and he seems if anything disappointed that he was careless enough to let his enemy get behind him she says to him softly whatever you want owen but not here in the greenhouse and before he can speak she has turned her back to him and started up the stairs he whispers you thought id never find out lis backs into a rosebush and senses a thorn easing into her thigh she feels little pain she hardly hears the rain pummeling the glass roof above them how pathetic of you lis how pathetic sneaking into hotels strolling on the beach he shook his head dont look so shocked of course i knew almost from the beginning her throat clogs with fear and her eyes dip momentarily shut and thats why youre doing this because i had an affair my god you whore he lunges forward and strikes her in the face she falls to the ground my wife my wife but you were seeing someone that gives you license to cheat thats not the law in any jurisdiction that i know of lightning flashes though its now in the east the heart of the storm has passed over them i fell in love with him she cries i didnt plan on it why you and i spent months talking about divorce oh of course he says in a snide voice that excuses you robert loved me you didnt robert was interested in anything in a skirt no he fucked half of the women in ridgeton a few of the men too probably thats a lie i loved him i wont have you but through these protests another thought rises into her mind she considers months and dates she considers their reconciliation after owens affairjust around the time mrs lauberget was diagnosed as terminally ill she considers his resistance to buying the nursery her tears slow and she looks at him coldly its something else isnt it its not just that i was seeing robert the estate of course her millions you and robert talked about getting married owen says you talked about divorcing me cutting me out of everything you talk like its money you earned it was my fathers and ive always been more than generous i wait how did you know robert and i talked about getting married we knew stunned by a blow sharper than his palm a moment before lis understands we knew dorothy owen wasnt seeing a lawyer at all dorothy was his lover was and still is obedient dorothy they planned liss death all along for owens insane pride and for the money charming careless robert had perhaps left some evidence of the affair around the gillespie household or perhaps had simply not stopped talking when he should have who do you think called the day of the picnic to get me into work that wasnt my secretary oh lis you were so blind you were at the park after all i thought i saw you i stopped at the office and had my calls forwarded from there to the phone in the acura i was at the park fifteen minutes before you i followed you to the beach and he waited dorothy forgot liss copy of hamlet intentionally thinking that shed go back to the truck alone for it owen would be waiting for her but it was robert not lis who went after the book hoping to meet portia robert must have wandered past owen who attacked him at the mouth of the cave bleeding badly robert had run inside and owen had pursued him claire must have heard roberts calls for help and followed and it would have been owen who found the knife lis had dropped near roberts body the mutilation why you bastard let the punishment fit the crime michael never hurt robert hurt him the son of a bitch tried to save him he was crying he was saying ill get that blood off your head dont worry dont worry some crap like that and youve been waiting for something like this she laughs looking around her at the night you didnt go out there to kill him at all you went to bring him here you were going to let him let him finish the job tonight at first i thought that was why he escapedto come after you then i tracked him to cloverton he that woman oh owen no he didnt hurt her he just tied her up so she couldnt reach the phone i found her in the kitchen hed been muttering to her that he was on his way to ridgeton to save someone named lisbonne from her adam you did it she whispers you killed her i didnt plan it it wasnt supposed to be this way i made it look as if hed done it i dumped her motorcycle in a river the cops thought he was going to boyleston but i knew he was headed this way of course he did he knew all along that michael had a motive for coming to ridgetonto find the woman whod lied about him in court and you shot trenton and the deputy outside he grows eerily calm now it got out of hand it started simple and it got out of hand owen please listen to me listen she hears in her voice the same desperate but soothing tone with which shed addressed michael a half hour before if you want the money for gods sake you can have it but looking at his face she knows that the money isnt the point at all she thinks of her conversation with richard kohler michael might be mad yes but at least his demented world is incorruptibly just its her husband whos the psychopath hes the one immune to mercy lis realizes now that he must have begun planning her death from the very beginning of the eveningwhen he first heard about michaels escape making a scene about the sheriff s putting men here insisting she go to the innthey were just efforts to make him look innocent why after he murdered michael hed have rung up lis at the inn and told her to return alls safe my love come home but hed be waiting for her for her and oh god she whispers portia too she realizes that he must have intended to kill her as well no her wail fills the greenhouse no and she does the very thing shed left her basement hideout for the very thing she prayed for strength to do but never believed herself capable of until this instantshe turns picks up the kitchen knife from the table behind her and swings the blade at him with all her strength shes aimed for his neck but instead hits his cheek his head bounces back from the impact of the metal the gun flies from his hand he blinks in shock blood appears instantly sheets of blood covering his head like a crimson veil for an instant they stand motionless staring at each other their thoughts as frozen as their bodies neither breathes then with the howl of a combat soldier owen leaps for her she falls to the ground dropping the knife holding her hands over her face to ward off his maniacal pummeling she takes a stunning strike on her jaw her vision crinkles momentarily to black she drives her fist into his left shoulder his cries are like an animals as he leans away clutching the tormented joint but he recovers quickly and renews the assault his fury overpowering her shes no match for his strength or weight even with the wound on his face and a damaged arm soon shes on her back her shoulders and neck lacerated by bits of gravel his hand is on her throat squeezing hard the lights of the greenhouse blue and green dim lights all grow dimmer as her lungs beg for oxygen they cant have her hands flail toward his hugely bloody face they strike only air then fall to the ground a dust of blackness fills her eyes she says something to him words he cannot possibly hear words she herself does not understand in her last moment of consciousness a small shadow forms at some distant focal pointpart of her brain dying she thinks this shadow grows from a tiny mass to an encompassing darkness that hangs in the air a wad of black storm cloud then the glass roof directly above the struggling couple disintegrates into a million shards and bits of wood and glass envelop the hurtling shadow like bubbles of air following a high diver into water the massive body lands sideways unbalanced half on owen half on a tall imperial rose tree whose thorns dig deep parallel scratches like musicalstaff lines along michaels cheek and arm he sobs in panic from the twentyfoot leapa terror that for anyone would be overwhelming and for him must be beyond comprehension a long boomerang of glass slits liss neck she rolls sideways away from the straggling men and huddles covering the wound with a shaking hand through the gaping hole in the glass roof a light mist falls and a few swirling leaves descend bulbs shatter under the cold moisture from the sky and the room is suddenly immersed in blue darkness then a sound fills the air a sound that lis believes at first is the rejuvenated storm but no she realizes that its the howling of a human voice inflected with madnessthough whether its michaels or owens or perhaps even her own lis atcheson will never know here in this stormtossed yard the vigilant and serious sheriff s deputies dispersed doggedly combing the house and grounds here the medics directed first to pale trenton heck took his vital signs and determined that he hadnt lost a critical quantity of blood here the same medics stitched and dressed liss own sliced neck a dramatic but unserious wound whose scar would be with her she guessed for the rest of her days and here portia was flying into her sisters arms embracing her hard lis smelled shampoo and sweat and felt one of the young womans silver hoop earrings tap against her lips they hugged for a full minute and when lis stepped away it was the younger of the two sisters who was crying a mudspattered statepolice car arrived its rooftop speaker already turned to the receiving channel and stuttering with broadcasts all of which were related to the cleanup efforts following the storm a tall grayhaired man stepped out of the car lis thought he resembled a cowboy mrs atcheson he called she caught his eye and he started for her but then paused halfway through the muddy yard to gaze with undisguised surprise then concern at trenton heck lying on a gurney he was barely conscious the two men said a few words to each other before the medics carted the lanky tracker off to an ambulance don haversham approached her and asked if she felt like answering a few questions i suppose as they were talking a doctor emerged from one of the ambulances and put a butterfly bandage on the cut on liss arm then retreated saying only hardly a scratch wash it no stitches nup that bump on your head thatll go away in a day or two dont worry unaware that she had a bump on her head she said she wasnt worried she turned back to haversham and spoke with him for the better part of half an hour oh listen she asked after shed finished her account could you get in touch with a dr kohler at marsden hospital kohler haversham squinted hes disappeared we were trying to find him hey would that be a richard kohler the ridgeton sheriff had overheard them thats him lis said well the sheriff responded fella of that name was found drunk an hour ago at kleppermans ford drunk sleeping off a bad one on the hood of a mark iv lincoln continental to top it off had a raincoat laid over him like a blanket and this skull looked like a badger or skunk or something sitting on his chest no im not fooling if that aint peculiar i dont know what is drunk lis repeated hell be okay he was pretty groggy so we got him in a holding cell at the station lucky for him he was on the car and not driving it or he could kiss that license goodbye this hardly seemed like kohler but nothing would have surprised her tonight she led haversham and another deputy into the house and coaxed michael outside together they walked him to an ambulance looks like thats a broken arm and ankle the astonished medic said and id throw in a couple cracked ribs too but he dont seem to feel a thing the deputies stared at the patient with fear and awe as if he were the mythical progeny of jack the ripper and lizzie borden michael upon liss solemn promise that it was not poison consented to a shot of sedative and allowed his own wounds to be cleaned though only after lis asked the medic to dab antiseptic on her wrist to prove it was not acid michael sat in the back of the ambulance hands together staring down at the floor and said not a word of farewell to anyone he seemed to be humming as the doors closed then owen battered but conscious was taken away as was the horrible ragdoll body of the poor young deputy his blood all of it lost in his squad car and in a bed of muddy zinnias the ambulances left then the squad cars and lis stood next to portia in the kitchen the two sisters finally alone she looked at the younger woman for a moment examining the bewilderment on her face perhaps it was shock lis pondered though more likely a virulent strain of curiosity for portia suddenly began asking questions although lis was looking directly at her she didnt hear a single one of them nor did she ask portia to repeat herself instead smiling ambiguously she squeezed her sisters arm and walked outside alone into the blue monotone of dawn heading away from the house toward the lake the bloodhound caught up with her and trotted alongside when she stopped at the far edge of the patio near the wall of sandbags the sisters had raised the dog flopped onto the muddy ground lis herself sat on the levee and gazed at the gunmetal water of the lake the cold front was now upon ridgeton and the trees creaked with incipient ice a million jettisoned leaves covered the ground like the scales of a giant animal theyd glisten later in the sun brilliant and rare if there was a sun lis gazed at broken branches and shattered windows and shingles of wood and of asphalt yanked from the house the heavens had rampaged true but apart from a waterlogged car the damage was mostly superficial this was the case with storms around here they didnt cause much harm beyond dousing lights stripping trees flooding lawns and making the good citizens feel temporarily humble the greenhouse for instance had seen several howling tempests and had never been damaged until tonightand even then itd taken a huge madman to inflict the harm lis sat for ten minutes shivering her breath floating from her lips like faint wraiths then she rose to her feet the hound too stood and looked at her in anticipation which she supposed meant hed like something to eat she scratched his head and walked to the house over the damp grass and he followed epilogue the blossoms of the floribunda are complicated this is a twentiethcentury rose plant and the one that lis atcheson now trimmed a shockingly white iceberg was a hearty specimen that spilled in profusion into the entryway of her greenhouse visitors often admired the blossoms and if she was to enter it in competition she was confident that it would be a blueribbon rose today as she cut back the shoots she wore a dress that was patterned in darkgreen paisley the shade of a lizard at midnight the dress was appropriately somber but it wasnt black she was on her way to a sentencing hearing not a funeral although the results would make her a widow of sorts lis was not in mourning against his lawyers recommendation owen rejected a plea bargaineven after dorothy turned states witness in exchange for a manslaughter charge owen insisted that he could beat the rap by pleading insanity an expert witness a psychiatrist took the stand and in a longwinded monologue characterized owen as a pure sociopath this diagnosis however apparently didnt have the same allure to juries that michaels illness did after a lengthy trial owen was convicted of firstdegree murder on the first ballot last week lis signed the contract to purchase langdells nursery and that same day she gave notice to the high school at the end of the spring semester her twelveyear bout as an english teacher would officially end surprising her older sister portia had asked for the nurserys p l statements and balance sheet which shed then shown to her current boyfrienderic or edward lis couldnt recall an investment banker hed seemed impressed with the company and recommended that portia buy into the deal while she still could the young woman had spent several days considering the proposition then waffled in a big way and declared that she wanted more time to think about it shed promised lis an answer when she returned from the caribbean where she planned to spend february and march portia had spent the night and would be accompanying lis to the hearing today following owens arrest the young woman had stayed for three weeks in the ridgeton house helping lis clean and repair but a week after the indictments were handed up lis decided that she wanted to be on her own again and insisted that her sister return to new york at the train station portia suddenly turned to her listen why dont you move into the coop with me lis was touched by the offer although it was clear that the majority of portias heart voted against it but the city was hardly for lis and she declined cranking closed the upper vanes of the greenhouse today shutting out the winter air lis had this thought we face death in many ways and most are hardly as dramatic as finding the ghosts of our dead ancestors in greenhouses or learning that its your husband whos traveled miles to slice your thin throat as you lie drowsing in bed reflecting on these subtler confrontations with mortality lis thought of her sister and she understood that portia wasnt being perverse or cruel all those long years of separation nothing so premeditated as that there was a simpler point to her escape from the family she did what she had to too many willow switches too many lectures too many stillasdeath sunday dinners and who knew maybe old man lauberget changed his tune after liss fateful swimming lesson and climbed into the sack with portia when she was twelve or thirteen she after all was the pretty one there was a time when this thought would have been madness and seething heresy but madness had since come to roost in liss own backyard and if the night of the stormthe delicate euphemism the sisters had settled upontaught her anything it was that there are only real two heresies lies and our willing acceptance of them trenton heck would also be at the hearing today he had an interest in this case beyond justice before being removed as director of marsden hospital by the department of mental health dr ronald adler had reneged on the reward heck felt he was due adlers successor could find no moral let alone legal reason to pay over the money which adler apparently had no authority to pledge in the first place and so with a certain reluctant desperation heck sued owen for shooting him in the back the insurance company wouldnt pay off for such malfeasance and heck was horrified to find that suing owen ultimately meant suing lis he immediately offered to withdraw the case but lis told him that he more than anyone deserved to profit from this tragedy and over her exasperated lawyers objections wrote him a check for far more than he asked there was lis understood no reasonable connection between the two of them trenton heck and herself yet in some ways she felt they were stations along the same route still when he asked her out to dinner last week she declined it was true that he needed something in his life other than a mobile home and a dog but she doubted that it was for her to provide whatever that might be one person who wouldnt be at the hearing was michael hrubek on thanksgiving at the patients shy request lis had paid him a visit at the framington state mental health facility where he was once again under the care of richard kohler michael at first had been peeved that lis as an agent of god refused to take his life in exchange for that of a nineteenthcentury president but he had apparently come to accept that saving her was part of a complicated spiritual bargain that only he understood and had acquiesced to remaining on this good earth for the time being michael himself had an upcoming trialfor the murder of a fellow prisoner during his escape from marsden the evidence clearly suggested that the mans death was a suicide and the case was going forward only because michaels escape made fools of the hospital and the police michael his attorney assured lis would emerge from the trial not only innocent but with a better public image than that of the prosecutor who at least one editorial pointed out ought to have better things to worry about than the death of bobby ray callaghan an institutionalized killer there were other charges too auto theft breaking and entering assault and the intentional confinement of two extremely unhappy gunderson police officers in their squadcar trunk one of them with an extremely painful broken wrist michael was admittedly the perpetrator but he probably would serve no time in prison the lawyer reported all he need do was tell the judge the truththat he was simply evading pinkerton agents pursuing him for abraham lincolns assassinationand bang hed be out of the lockup and back into his hospital room in no time michael hrubek was a good example of using history to your own advantage lis now pulled on her coat and called to her sister that it was time to leave they were taking two cars after the hearing she was planning to spend an hour or two at framington shed been back to the hospital several times since thanksgiving she was still somewhat wary about seeing him but shed found that when sitting across from michael sometimes in the company of richard kohler sometimes not she got an indefinable pleasure from his company when she entered the room he took her hand with a delicacy and awe that sometimes moved her nearly to tears she would like to understand the immensely complex matrix of his emotions shed like to understand why he undertook his quest to save her of all people and whyeven though it was rooted in madnessthat journey touched her so but those were questions beyond lis atcheson and she was content simply to sit with him in a lounge overlooking the snowy fields and drink coffee and soda from plastic cups while they talked about dairy cows or the state of american politics or insomniaa problem it seemed they both suffered from with dancing eyes michael would listen carefully to what she had to say then lean forward sometimes touching her arm for emphasis and offer his thoughtssome of them illuminating some preposterous but always delivered as if he were speaking gods own truths and whos to say lis sometimes thought that he isnt jeffery deaver
