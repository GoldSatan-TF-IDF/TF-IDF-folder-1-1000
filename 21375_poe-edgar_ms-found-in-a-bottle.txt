ms found in a bottle by edgar allan poe qui na plus quun moment a vivre naplus rien a dissimuler quinaultatys of my country and of my family i have little to say ill usage and length of years have driven me from the one and estranged me from the other hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered upbeyond all things the study of the german moralists gave me great delight not from any illadvised admiration of their eloquent madness but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities i have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius a deficiency of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime and the pyrrhonism of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious indeed a strong relish for physical philosophy has i fear tinctured my mind with a very common error of this agei mean the habit of referring occurrences even the least susceptible of such reference to the principles of that science upon the whole no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition i have thought proper to premise thus much lest the incredible tale i have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity after many years spent in foreign travel i sailed in the year from the port of batavia in the rich and populous island of java on a voyage to the archipelago of the sunda islands i went as passengerhaving no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons copperfastened and built at bombay of malabar teak she was freighted with cottonwool and oil from the lachadive islands we had also on board coir jaggeree ghee cocoanuts and a few cases of opium the stowage was clumsily done and the vessel consequently crank we got under way with a mere breath of wind and for many days stood along the eastern coast of java without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small grabs of the archipelago to which we were bound one evening leaning over the taffrail i observed a very singular isolated cloud to the nw it was remarkable as well for its color as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from batavia i watched it attentively until sunset when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor and looking like a long line of low beach my notice was soon afterwards attracted by the duskyred appearance of the moon and the peculiar character of the sea the latter was undergoing a rapid change and the water seemed more than usually transparent although i could distinctly see the bottom yet heaving the lead i found the ship in fifteen fathoms the air now became intolerably hot and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heated iron as night came on every breath of wind died away and a more entire calm it is impossible to conceive the flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion and a long hair held between the finger and thumb hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration however as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger and as we were drifting in bodily to shore he ordered the sails to be furled and the anchor let go no watch was set and the crew consisting principally of malays stretched themselves deliberately upon deck i went belownot without a full presentiment of evil indeed every appearance warranted me in apprehending a simoom i told the captain my fears but he paid no attention to what i said and left me without deigning to give a reply my uneasiness however prevented me from sleeping and about midnight i went upon deckas i placed my foot upon the upper step of the companionladder i was startled by a loud humming noise like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a millwheel and before i could ascertain its meaning i found the ship quivering to its centre in the next instant a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beamends and rushing over us fore and aft swept the entire decks from stem to stern the extreme fury of the blast proved in a great measure the salvation of the ship although completely waterlogged yet as her masts had gone by the board she rose after a minute heavily from the sea and staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest finally righted by what miracle i escaped destruction it is impossible to say stunned by the shock of the water i found myself upon recovery jammed in between the sternpost and rudder with great difficulty i gained my feet and looking dizzily around was at first struck with the idea of our being among breakers so terrific beyond the wildest imagination was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed after a while i heard the voice of an old swede who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port i hallooed to him with all my strength and presently he came reeling aft we soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident all on deck with the exception of ourselves had been swept overboardthe captain and mates must have perished as they slept for the cabins were deluged with water without assistance we could expect to do little for the security of the ship and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down our cable had of course parted like packthread at the first breath of the hurricane or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed we scudded with frightful velocity before the sea and the water made clear breaches over us the framework of our stern was shattered excessively and in almost every respect we had received considerable injury but to our extreme joy we found the pumps unchoked and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast the main fury of the blast had already blown over and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay well believing that in our shattered condition we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue but this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified for five entire days and nightsduring which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree procured with great difficulty from the forecastlethe hulk flew at a rate defying computation before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind which without equalling the first violence of the simoom were still more terrific than any tempest i had before encountered our course for the first four days was with trifling variations se and by s and we must have run down the coast of new hollandon the fifth day the cold became extreme although the wind had hauled round a point more to the northwardthe sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre and clambered a very few degrees above the horizonemitting no decisive lightthere were no clouds apparent yet the wind was upon the increase and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury about noon as nearly as we could guess our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun it gave out no light properly so called but a dull and sullen glow without reflection as if all its rays were polarized just before sinking within the turgid sea its central fires suddenly went out as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power it was a dim sliverlike rim alone as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean we waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth daythat day to me has not arrivedto the swede never did arrive thenceforward we were enshrouded in patchy darkness so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship eternal night continued to envelop us all unrelieved by the phosphoric seabrilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics we observed too that although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf or foam which had hitherto attended us all around were horror and thick gloom and a black sweltering desert of ebonysuperstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old swede and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder we neglected all care of the ship as worse than useless and securing ourselves as well as possible to the stump of the mizenmast looked out bitterly into the world of ocean we had no means of calculating time nor could we form any guess of our situation we were however well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice in the meantime every moment threatened to be our lastevery mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us the swell surpassed anything i had imagined possible and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle my companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship but i could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself and prepared myself gloomily for that death which i thought nothing could defer beyond an hour as with every knot of way the ship made the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling at times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatrossat times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell where the air grew stagnant and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken we were at the bottom of one of these abysses when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night see see cried he shrieking in my ears almighty god see see as he spoke i became aware of a dull sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck casting my eyes upwards i beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood at a terrific height directly above us and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent hovered a gigantic ship of perhaps four thousand tons although upreared upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the line or east indiaman in existence her huge hull was of a deep dingy black unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship a single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battlelanterns which swung to and fro about her rigging but what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea and of that ungovernable hurricane when we first discovered her her bows were alone to be seen as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her for a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle as if in contemplation of her own sublimity then trembled and tottered andcame down at this instant i know not what sudden selfpossession came over my spirit staggering as far aft as i could i awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles and sinking with her head to the sea the shock of the descending mass struck her consequently in that portion of her frame which was already under water and the inevitable result was to hurl me with irresistible violence upon the rigging of the stranger as i fell the ship hove in stays and went about and to the confusion ensuing i attributed my escape from the notice of the crew with little difficulty i made my way unperceived to the main hatchway which was partially open and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold why i did so i can hardly tell an indefinite sense of awe which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind was perhaps the principle of my concealment i was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered to the cursory glance i had taken so many points of vague novelty doubt and apprehension i therefore thought proper to contrive a hidingplace in the hold this i did by removing a small portion of the shiftingboards in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship i had scarcely completed my work when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it a man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait i could not see his face but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance there was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity his knees tottered beneath a load of years and his entire frame quivered under the burthen he muttered to himself in a low broken tone some words of a language which i could not understand and groped in a corner among a pile of singularlooking instruments and decayed charts of navigation his manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood and the solemn dignity of a god he at length went on deck and i saw him no more a feeling for which i have no name has taken possession of my soula sensation which will admit of no analysis to which the lessons of bygone times are inadequate and for which i fear futurity itself will offer me no key to a mind constituted like my own the latter consideration is an evil i shall neveri know that i shall neverbe satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel a new sensea new entity is added to my soul it is long since i first trod the deck of this terrible ship and the rays of my destiny are i think gathering to a focus incomprehensible men wrapped up in meditations of a kind which i cannot divine they pass me by unnoticed concealment is utter folly on my part for the people will not see it was but just now that i passed directly before the eyes of the mateit was no long while ago that i ventured into the captains own private cabin and took thence the materials with which i write and have written i shall from time to time continue this journal it is true that i may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world but i will not fall to make the endeavour at the last moment i will enclose the ms in a bottle and cast it within the sea an incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation are such things the operation of ungoverned chance i had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down without attracting any notice among a pile of ratlinstuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl while musing upon the singularity of my fate i unwittingly daubed with a tarbrush the edges of a neatlyfolded studdingsail which lay near me on a barrel the studdingsail is now bent upon the ship and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word discovery i have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel although well armed she is not i think a ship of war her rigging build and general equipment all negative a supposition of this kind what she is not i can easily perceivewhat she is i fear it is impossible to say i know not how it is but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas her severely simple bow and antiquated stern there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago i have been looking at the timbers of the ship she is built of a material to which i am a stranger there is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied i mean its extreme porousness considered independently by the wormeaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age it will appear perhaps an observation somewhat overcurious but this wood would have every characteristic of spanish oak if spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means in reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old weatherbeaten dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection it is as sure he was wont to say when any doubt was entertained of his veracity as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman about an hour ago i made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew they paid me no manner of attention and although i stood in the very midst of them all seemed utterly unconscious of my presence like the one i had at first seen in the hold they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age their knees trembled with infirmity their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind their voices were low tremulous and broken their eyes glistened with the rheum of years and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest around them on every part of the deck lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction i mentioned some time ago the bending of a studdingsail from that period the ship being thrown dead off the wind has continued her terrific course due south with every rag of canvas packed upon her from her trucks to her lower studdingsail booms and rolling every moment her topgallant yardarms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine i have just left the deck where i find it impossible to maintain a footing although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience it appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and forever we are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of eternity without taking a final plunge into the abyss from billows a thousand times more stupendous than any i have ever seen we glide away with the facility of the arrowy seagull and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy i am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such effecti must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current or impetuous undertow i have seen the captain face to face and in his own cabinbut as i expected he paid me no attention although in his appearance there is to a casual observer nothing which might bespeak him more or less than manstill a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which i regarded him in stature he is nearly my own height that is about five feet eight inches he is of a wellknit and compact frame of body neither robust nor remarkably otherwise but it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the faceit is the intense the wonderful the thrilling evidence of old age so utter so extreme which excites within my spirit a sensea sentiment ineffable his forehead although little wrinkled seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of yearshis gray hairs are records of the past and his grayer eyes are sybils of the future the cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange ironclasped folios and mouldering instruments of science and obsolete longforgotten charts his head was bowed down upon his hands and he pored with a fiery unquiet eye over a paper which i took to be a commission and which at all events bore the signature of a monarch he muttered to himself as did the first seaman whom i saw in the hold some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue and although the speaker was close at my elbow his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile the ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of eld the crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battlelanterns i feel as i have never felt before although i have been all my life a dealer in antiquities and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at balbec and tadmor and persepolis until my very soul has become a ruin when i look around me i feel ashamed of my former apprehensions if i trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us shall i not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective all in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night and a chaos of foamless water but about a league on either side of us may be seen indistinctly and at intervals stupendous ramparts of ice towering away into the desolate sky and looking like the walls of the universe as i imagined the ship proves to be in a current if that appellation can properly be given to a tide which howling and shrieking by the white ice thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract to conceive the horror of my sensations is i presume utterly impossible yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions predominates even over my despair and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death it is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledgesome nevertobeimparted secret whose attainment is destruction perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself it must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor the crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of despair in the meantime the wind is still in our poop and as we carry a crowd of canvas the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the seaoh horror upon horror the ice opens suddenly to the right and to the left and we are whirling dizzily in immense concentric circles round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance but little time will be left me to ponder upon my destinythe circles rapidly grow smallwe are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpooland amid a roaring and bellowing and thundering of ocean and of tempest the ship is quivering oh god andgoing down notethe ms found in a bottle was originally published in and it was not until many years afterwards that i became acquainted with the maps of mercator in which the ocean is represented as rushing by four mouths into the northern polar gulf to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth the pole itself being represented by a black rock towering to a prodigious height
