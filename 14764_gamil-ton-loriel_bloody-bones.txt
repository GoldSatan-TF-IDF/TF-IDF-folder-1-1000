laurell k hamilton bloody bones book of the anita blake vampire hunter series it was st patricks day and the only green i was wearing was a button that read pinch me and youre dead meat id started work last night with a green blouse on but id gotten blood all over it from a beheaded chicken larry kirkland zombieraiser in training had dropped the decapitated bird it did the little headless chicken dance and sprayed both of us with blood i finally caught the damn thing but the blouse was ruined i had to run home and change the only thing not ruined was the charcoal grey suit jacket that had been in the car i put it back on over a black blouse black skirt dark hose and black pumps bert my boss didnt like us wearing black to work but if i had to be at the office at seven oclock without any sleep at all he would just have to live with it i huddled over my coffee mug drinking it as black as i could swallow it it wasnt helping much i stared at a series of by glossy blowups spread across my desktop the first picture was of a hill that had been scraped open probably by a bulldozer a skeletal hand reached out of the raw earth the next photo showed that someone had tried to carefully scrape away the dirt showing the splintered coffin and bones to one side of the coffin a new body the bulldozer had been brought in again it had plowed up the red earth and found a boneyard bones studded the earth like scattered flowers one skull spread its unhinged jaws in a silent scream a scraggle of pale hair still clung to the skull the dark stained cloth wrapped around the corpse was the remnants of a dress i spotted at least three femurs next to the upper half of a skull unless the corpse had had three legs we were looking at a real mess the pictures were well done in a gruesome sort of way the color made it easier to differentiate the corpses but the high gloss was a little much it looked like morgue photos done by a fashion photographer there was probably an art gallery in new york that would hang the damn things and serve cheese and wine while people walked around saying powerful dont you think very powerful they were powerful and sad there was nothing but the photos no explanation bert had said to come to his office after id looked at them hed explain everything yeah i believed that the easter bunny is a friend of mine too i gathered the pictures up slipped them into the envelope picked my coffee mug up in the other hand and went for the door there was no one at the desk craig had gone home mary our daytime secretary didnt get in until eight there was a twohour space of time when the office was unmanned that bert had called me into the office when we were the only ones there bothered me a lot why the secrecy berts office door was open he sat behind his desk drinking coffee shuffling some papers around he glanced up smiled and motioned me closer the smile bothered me bert was never pleasant unless he wanted something his thousanddollar suit framed a whiteonwhite shirt and tie his grey eyes sparkled with good cheer his eyes are the color of dirty window glass so sparkling is a real effort his snowblond hair had been freshly buzzed the crewcut was so short i could see scalp have a seat anita i tossed the envelope on his desk and sat down what are you up to bert his smile widened he usually didnt waste the smile on anybody but clients he certainly didnt waste it on me you looked at the pictures yeah what of it could you raise them from the dead i frowned at him and sipped my coffee how old are they you couldnt tell from the pictures in person i could tell you but not just from pictures answer the question around two hundred years i just stared at him most animators couldnt raise a zombie that old without a human sacrifice but you can he said yeah i didnt see any headstones in the pictures do we have any names why i shook my head hed been the boss for five years started the company when it was just him and manny and he didnt know shit about raising the dead how can you hang around a bunch of zombieraisers for this many years and know so little about what we do the smile slipped a little the glow beginning to fade from his eyes why do you need names you use names to call the zombie from the grave without a name you cant raise them theoretically no i said but you can do it he said i didnt like how sure he was yeah i can do it john can probably do it too he shook his head they dont want john i finished the last of my coffee whos they beadle beadle stirling and lowenstein a law firm i said he nodded no more games bert just tell me what the hells going on beadle beadle stirling and lowenstein have some clients building a very plush resort in the mountains near branson a very exclusive resort a place where the wealthy country stars that dont own a house in the area can go to get away from the crowds millions of dollars are at stake whats the old cemetery have to do with it the land theyre building on was in dispute between two families the courts decided the kellys owned the land and they were paid a great deal of money the bouvier family claimed it was their land and there was a family plot on it to prove it no one could find the cemetery ah they found it i said they found an old cemetery but not necessarily the bouvier family plot so they want to raise the dead and ask who they are exactly i shrugged i can raise a couple of the corpses in the coffins ask who they are what happens if their last name is bouvier they have to buy the land a second time they think some of the corpses are bouviers thats why they want all the bodies raised i raised my eyebrows youre joking he shook his head looking pleased can you do it i dont know give me the pictures again i set my coffee mug on his desk and took the pictures back bert theyve screwed this six ways to sunday its a mass grave thanks to the bulldozers the bones are all mixed together ive only read about one case of anyone raising a zombie from a mass grave but they were calling a specific person they had a name i shook my head without a name it may not be possible would you be willing to try i spread the pictures over the desk staring at them the top half of a skull had turned upside down like a bowl two finger bones attached by something dry and desiccated that must once had been human tissue lay next to it bones bones everywhere but not a name to speak could i do it i honestly didnt know did i want to try yeah i did id be willing to try wonderful raising them a few every night is going to take weeks even if i can do it with johns help it would be quicker it will cost them millions to delay that long bert said theres no other way to do it you raised the davidsons entire family plot including greatgrandpa you werent even supposed to raise him you can raise more than one at a time i shook my head that was an accident i was showing off they wanted to raise three family members i thought i could save them money by doing it in one shot you raised ten family members anita they only asked for three so so can you raise the entire cemetery in one night youre crazy i said can you do it i opened my mouth to say no and closed it i had raised an entire cemetery once not all of them had been two centuries old but some of them had been older nearly three hundred and i raised them all of course i had two human sacrifices to ride for power it was a long story how i ended up with two people dying inside a circle of power selfdefense but the magic didnt care death is death could i do it i really dont know bert thats not a no he said he had an eager anticipatory look on his face they must have offered you a bundle of money i said he smiled were bidding on the project were what they sent this package to us the resurrection company in california and the essential spark in new orleans they prefer Ð¹lan vital to the english translation i said frankly it sounded more like a beauty salon than an animating firm but nobody had asked me so what the lowest bid gets it that was their plan bert said he looked entirely too satisfied with himself what i asked let me play it back to you he said there are what three animators in the entire country that could raise a zombie that old without a human sacrifice you and john are two of them im including phillipa freestone of resurrection in this probably i said he nodded okay could phillipa raise without a name i dont have any way of knowing that john could maybe she could could either she or john raise from the mass bones not the ones in the coffin that stopped me i dont know would either of them stand a chance of raising the entire graveyard he was staring at me very steadily youre enjoying this too much i said just answer the question anita i know john couldnt do it i dont think phillipa is as good as john so no they couldnt do it im going to up the bid bert said i laughed up the bid nobody else can do it nobody but you they tried treating this like any other construction problem but there arent going to be any other bids now are there probably not i said then im going to take them to the cleaners he said with a smile i shook my head you greedy son of a bitch you get a share of the fee you know i know we looked at each other what if i try and cant raise them all in one night youll still be able to raise them all eventually wont you probably i stood picking up my coffee mug but i wouldnt spend the check until after ive done it im going to go get some sleep they want the bid this morning if they accept our terms theyll fly you up in a private helicopter helicopteryou know i hate to fly for this much money youll fly great be ready to go at a moments notice dont push it bert i hesitated at the door let me take larry with me why if john cant do it then larry certainly cant i shrugged maybe not but there are ways to combine power during a raising if i cant do it alone maybe i can get a boost from our trainee he looked thoughtful why not take john combined you could do it only if hed give his power willingly to me you think hed do that bert shook his head you going to tell him that the client didnt want him that you offered him to the client and they asked for me by name no bert said thats why youre doing it like this no witnesses time is of the essence anita sure bert but you didnt want to face mr john burke with yet another client that wants me over him bert looked down at his bluntfingered hands clasped on the desktop he looked up grey eyes serious john is almost as good as you are anita i dont want to lose him you think hell walk if one more client asks for me his prides hurt bert said and theres so much of it to hurt i said bert smiled you needling him doesnt help i shrugged it sounded petty to say hed started it but he had wed tried dating and john couldnt handle me being a female version of him no he couldnt handle me being a better version of him try to behave yourself anita larrys not up to speed yet we need john i always behave myself bert he sighed if you didnt make me so much money i wouldnt put up with your shit ditto i said that about summed up our relationship commerce at its best we didnt like each other but we could do business together free enterprise at work at noon bert called and said we had it be at the office packed and ready to go at two oclock mr lionel bayard will fly up with you and larry whos lionel bayard a junior partner in the firm of beadle beadle stirling and lowenstein he likes the sound of his own voice dont give him a rough time about it who me anita dont tease the help he may be wearing a threethousanddollar suit but hes still the help ill save it up for one of the partners surely beadle beadle stirling or lowenstein will appear in person sometime this weekend dont tease the bosses either he said anything you say my voice was utterly mild youll do whatever you want no matter what i say wont you gee bert who says you cant teach an old dog new tricks just be here at two oclock i called larry hell be here ill be there bert ive got one stop to make so if im a few minutes late dont worry dont be late be there as soon as i can i hung up before he could argue with me i had to shower change and go to seckman junior high school richard zeeman taught science there we had a date set up for tomorrow at one point richard had asked me to marry him that was sort of on hold but i did owe him more than a message on his answering machine saying sorry honey cant make the date im going to be out of town a message would have been easier for me but cowardly i packed one suitcase it was enough for four days and then some if you pack extra underwear and clothes that mix and match you can live for a week out of a small suitcase i did add a few extras the firestar mm and its inner pants holster enough extra ammo to sink a battleship and two knives plus wrist sheaths id had four knives all handcrafted for little ol moi two of them had been lost beyond recovery i was having them replaced but hand forging takes time especially when you insist on the highest silver content possible in the steel two knives two guns should be enough for one weekend business trip id wear the browning hipower packing wasnt a problem what to wear today was the problem theyd want me to raise them tonight if i could hell the helicopter might fly directly to the construction site which meant id be walking over raw dirt bones shattered coffins it didnt sound like highheel territory yet if a junior partner was wearing a threethousanddollar suit the people whod just hired me would expect me to look the part i could either dress professionally or in feathers and blood id actually had one client who was disappointed that i didnt show up nude smeared with blood there could have been more than one reason for his disappointment i dont think ive ever had a client that would have objected to some kind of ceremonial getup but jeans and jogging shoes didnt seem to inspire confidence dont ask me why i could pack my coverall and put it over whatever i wore yeah i liked that veronica simsronnie my very best friendhad talked me into buying a fashionably short navy skirt it was short enough that i was a little embarrassed but the skirt fit inside the coverall the skirt didnt wrinkle or bunch up after id worn the outfit to vampire stakings or murder scenes take the coverall off and i was set to go to the office or out for the evening i was so pleased i went out and bought two more in different colors one was crimson the other purple i hadnt been able to find one in black yet at least not one that wasnt so short that i refused to wear it admittedly the short skirts made me look taller they even made me look leggy when youre fivefootthree thats saying something but the purple didnt match much that i owned so crimson it was id found a shortsleeved blouse that was the exact same shade of red red with violet undertones a cold hard color that looked great with my pale skin black hair and dark brown eyes the shoulder holster and mm browning hipower looked very dramatic against it a black belt cinched tight at the waist held down the loops on the holster a black jacket with rolledback sleeves went over everything to hide the gun i twirled in front of the mirror in my bedroom the skirt wasnt much longer than the jacket but you couldnt see the gun at least not easily unless youre willing to have things tailormade its hard to hide a gun especially in womens dressup clothes i put on just enough makeup so the red didnt overwhelm me i was also going to be saying goodbye to richard for several days a little makeup couldnt hurt when i say makeup i mean eye shadow blush lipstick and thats it outside of a television interview that bert talked me into i dont wear base except for the hose and black high heels which i wouldve had to wear no matter what skirt i wore the outfit was comfortable as long as i remembered not to bend directly at the waist i was safe the only jewelry i wore was the silver cross tucked into the blouse and the watch on my wrist my dress watch had broken and i just had never gotten around to getting it fixed the present watch was a mans black diving watch that looked out of place on my small wrist but hey it glowed in the dark if you pressed a button it showed me the date what day it was and could time a run i hadnt found a womans watch that could do all that i didnt have to cancel running with ronnie tomorrow morning she was out of town on a case a private detectives work is never done i loaded the suitcase into my jeep and was on the way to richards school by one oclock i was going to be late to the office oh well theyd wait for me or they wouldnt it wouldnt break my heart to miss the helicopter ride i hated planes but a helicopter scared the shit out of me i hadnt been afraid of flying until i was on a plane that plunged several thousand feet in seconds the stewardess ended up plastered against the ceiling covered in coffee people screamed and prayed the elderly woman beside me recited the lords prayer in german shed been so scared tears had come down her face i offered her my hand and she gripped it i knew i was going to die and there was nothing i could do to prevent it but we would die holding on to human hands die covered in human tears and human prayers then the plane straightened out and suddenly we were safe i havent trusted air transportation since normally in st louis there is no real spring theres winter two days of mild weather and summer heat this year spring had come early and stayed the air was soft against your skin the wind smelled of green growing things and winter seemed to have been a bad dream redbuds bent from the trees on either side of the road tiny purple blossoms like a delicate lavender mist here and there through the naked trees there were no leaves yet but there was a hint of green like someone had taken a giant paintbrush and tinted everything look directly at them and the trees were bare and black but look sideways not at a particular tree but at all the trees and there was a touch of green south is about as pleasant as a highway can be it gets you where youre going fairly fast and its over quickly i exited at tesson ferry road the road is thick with strip malls a hospital and fastfood restaurants and when you leave the commerce behind you hit new housing developments so thick they nearly touch there are still stands of woods and open spaces but they wont last the turn to old is at the crest of a hill just past the meramec river it is mostly houses with a few gas stations the area water district office and a large gas field to the right where the hills march out and out at the first stoplight i turned left past a little shopping area the road is a curving narrow thing that snakes between houses and woods there were glimpses of daffodils in the yards the road dips down into a valley and at the bottom of a steep hill is a stop sign the road climbs quickly to the crest of a hill to a t turn left and youre almost there the onestory school sits on the floor of a wide flat valley surrounded by hills having been raised in indiana farm country id have called them mountains once the elementary school sits separate but close enough to share a playground if you got recess in junior high when i was too little to go to junior high it seemed you did get recess by the time i got there you didnt the way of the world i parked as close to the building as i could this was my second visit to richards school and my first during the actual school day wed come once to get some papers hed forgotten no students then i entered the main entrance and ran into a crowd it must have been between classes when they moved the warm bodies from one room to another i was instantly aware that i was about the same height as or shorter than everyone i saw there was something claustrophobic about being jostled by the bookcarrying backpackwearing crowd there had to be a circle of hell where you were eternally fourteen eternally in junior high one of the lower circles i flowed with the crowd towards richards room i admit i took comfort in the fact that i was better dressed than most of the girls petty as hell but i had been chunky in junior high there isnt a lot of difference between chunky and fat when it comes to teasing id had my growth spurt and never been fat again thats right id been even tinier once shortest kid in school for years and years i stood to one side of the doorway letting the students come and go richard was showing something in a textbook to a young girl she was blonde wearing a flannel shirt over a black dress that was three sizes too big for her she was wearing what looked like black combat boots with heavy white socks rolled over the tops of them the outfit was very now the look of adoration on her face was not she was shiny and eager just because mr zeeman was giving her some oneonone help i had to admit that richard was worth a crush or two his thick brown hair was tied back in a ponytail that gave the illusion that his hair was very short and close to his head he has high full cheekbones and a strong jaw with a dimple that softens his face and makes him look almost too perfect his eyes are a solid chocolate brown with those thick lashes that so many men have and women want the bright yellow shirt made his permanently tanned skin seem even darker his tie was a dark rich green that matched the dress slacks he wore his jacket was draped across the back of his desk chair the muscles in his upper arms worked against the cloth of his shirt as he held the book the class was mostly seated the hallway nearly silent he closed the book and handed it to the girl she smiled and scrambled for the door late to her next class her eyes flicked over me as she passed wondering what i was doing there she wasnt the only one several of the seated students were glancing my way i stepped into the room richard smiled it warmed me down to my toes the smile saved him from being too handsome it wasnt that it wasnt a great smile he could have done toothpaste commercials but the smile was a little boys smile open and welcoming there was no guile to richard no deep dark plan he was the worlds biggest boy scout the smile showed that i wanted to go to him have him wrap his arms around me i had a horrible urge to grab his tie and lead him out of the room i wanted to touch his chest underneath the yellow shirt the urge was so strong i put my hands in the pockets of my jacket mustnt shock the students richard affects me like that sometimes okay most of the time when hes not furry or licking blood off his fingers hes a werewolf did i mention that no one at the school knows if they did hed be out of a job people dont like lycanthropes teaching their precious kiddies its illegal to discriminate against someone for a disease but everyone does it why should the educational system be different he touched my cheek just his fingertips i turned my face into his hand brushing lips against his fingers so much for being cool in front of the kiddies there were a few oohs and nervous laughs ill be right back guys more oohs louder laughter one way to go mr zeeman richard motioned me out the door and i went hands still in my pockets normally id have said i wasnt going to embarrass myself in front of a bunch of eighthgraders but lately i wasnt entirely trustworthy richard led me a little ways from his classroom into the deserted hallway he leaned up against the wall of lockers and looked down at me the littleboy smile was gone the look in his dark eyes made me shiver i ran my hand down his tie smoothing it against his chest am i allowed to kiss you or would that scandalize the kiddies i didnt look up at him as i asked i didnt want him to see the raw need in my eyes it was embarrassing enough that i knew he sensed it you cant hide lust from a werewolf they can smell it ill risk it his voice was soft low with a warm edge that made my stomach clench i felt him bend over me i raised my face to his his lips were so soft i leaned against his body palms flat against his chest i could feel his nipples harden under my skin my hands slid to his waist smoothing along the cloth of his shirt i wanted to pull his shirt out of his pants and run my hands over bare skin i stepped back from him feeling just a little breathless it was my idea that we wouldnt have sex before marriage my idea but damn it was hard the more we dated the harder it got jesus richard i shook my head it gets harder doesnt it richards smile didnt look innocent or boy scoutish in the least yes it does heat rushed up my face i didnt mean that i know what you meant his voice was gentle taking the sting out of the teasing my face was still hot with embarrassment but my voice was steady point for me ive got to go out of town on business zombie vampire or police zombie good i looked up at him why good i worry more when you go away on police business or vampire stakings you know that i nodded yeah i know that we stood there in the hallway staring at each other if things had been different wed be engaged maybe planning a wedding all this sexual tension would have been coming to some kind of conclusion as it was im going to be late as it is ive got to go are you going to tell jeanclaude bye in person his face was neutral when he asked but his eyes werent its daylight hes in his coffin ah richard said i didnt have a date planned with him this weekend so i dont owe him an explanation is that what you wanted to hear close enough he said he took a step away from the lockers bringing our bodies very close together he bent to kiss me goodbye giggles erupted down the hall we turned to see most of his class huddled in the doorway gazing at us great richard smiled he raised his voice enough so theyd hear him back inside you monsters there were catcalls and one small brunette girl gave me a very dirty look i think there must have been a lot of girls that had a crush on mr zeeman the natives are restless ive got to get back i nodded im hoping to be back by monday well go hiking next weekend then i put jeanclaude off this weekend i cant not see him two weeks in a row richards face clouded up with the beginnings of anger hike during the day see the vampire at night only fair i dont like this any better than you do i said i wish i believed that richard he gave a long sigh the anger sort of leaked out of him i never understood how he did that he could be furious one minute and calm the next both emotions seemed genuine once i was angry i was angry maybe its a character flaw im sorry anita its not like youre dating him behind my back i would never do anything behind your back you know that he nodded i know that he glanced back at his classroom ive got to go before they set the room on fire he walked down the hallway without looking back i almost called after him but i let him go the mood was sort of spoiled nothing like knowing your girlfriend is dating someone else to take the wind out of your sails i wouldnt have put up with it if it was the other way around a double standard that but one we could all three live with if living was the term for jeanclaude oh hell my personal life was too confusing for words i walked off down the hall having to pass by his open classroom door my high heels made loud rackety echoes i didnt try to catch a last glimpse of him it would make me feel worse about leaving it hadnt been my idea to date the master of the city jeanclaude had given me two choices either he could kill richard or i could date both of them it had seemed a good idea at the time five weeks later i wasnt so sure it had been my morals that had kept richard and me from consummating our relationship consummating nice euphemism but jeanclaude had made it clear that if i did something with richard i had to do it with him too jeanclaude was trying to woo me if richard could touch me but he couldnt it wasnt fair he had a point i guess but the thought of having to have sex with the vampire was more likely to keep me chaste than any high ideals i couldnt date both of them indefinitely the sexual tension alone was killing me i could move richard might even let me do that he wouldnt like it but if i wanted free of him hed let me go jeanclaude on the other hand hed never let me go the question was did i want him to let me go answer hell yes the real trick was how to break free without anybody dying yeah that was the question trouble was i didnt have an answer we were going to need one sooner or later and later was getting closer all the time i huddled against the side of the helicopter one hand in a death grip on the strap that was bolted to the wall i wanted to use both hands to hold on as if by holding very tightly to the stupid strap it would save me when the helicopter plummeted to earth i used one hand because two hands looked cowardly i was wearing a headset sort of like ear protection for the shooting range but with a microphone so you could talk above the teethrattling noise i hadnt realized that most of a helicopter was clear like being suspended in a great buzzing vibrating bubble i kept my eyes closed as much as possible are you all right ms blake lionel bayard asked the voice startled me yeah im fine you dont look well i dont like to fly i said he gave a weak smile i dont think i was inspiring confidence in lionel bayard lawyer and flunkie of beadle beadle stirling and lowenstein lionel bayard was a small neat man with a tiny blond mustache that looked like it was as much facial hair as he would ever get his triangular jaw was as smooth as my own maybe the mustache was glued on his brown suit with a thin yellow tweed fit his body like a welltailored glove his thin tie was brownandyellow striped with a gold tie tack the tie tack was monogrammed his slender leather briefcase was monogrammed as well everything matched down to his goldtasseled loafers larry twisted in his seat he was sitting beside the pilot youre really afraid of flying i could see his lips move but all the sound came out of my headset without them wed never have been able to talk over the noise he sounded amused yes larry im really afraid of flying i hoped sarcasm traveled the headsets as clearly as amusement did larry laughed evidently sarcasm traveled larry looked freshly scrubbed he was dressed in his other blue suit his white shirtwhich was one of three he ownedand his secondbest tie his best tie had blood all over it he was still in college working weekends for us until he graduated his short hair was the color of a surprised carrot he was freckled and about my height short with pale blue eyes he looked like a grownup opie bayard was working hard at not frowning at me the effort showed enough that he shouldnt have bothered are you sure youre up to this assignment i met his brown eyes you better hope i am mr bayard because im all you got i am aware of your specialized skills ms blake i spent the last twelve hours contacting every animating firm in the united states phillipa freestone of the resurrection company told me she couldnt do what we wanted that the only person in the country who might be able to do it was anita blake Ð¹lan vital in new orleans told us the same thing they mentioned john burke but werent confident that he could do all we wanted we must have all the dead raised or its useless to us did my boss explain to you that i am not a hundred percent sure that i can do it bayard blinked at me mr vaughn seemed very confident that you could do what we asked bert can be as confident as he wants he doesnt have to raise this mess i realize the earthmoving equipment has complicated your task ms blake but we did not do it deliberately i let that go id seen the pictures theyd tried to cover it up if the construction crew hadnt been local with some bouvier sympathizers theyd have plowed up the boneyard poured some concrete and voilÐ± no evidence whatever ill do what i can with what youve left me would it have been that much easier if you had been brought in before the graves were disturbed yeah he sighed it vibrated through the headphones then my apologies i shrugged unless you did it personally youre not the one who owes me an apology he shifted a little in his seat i did not order the digging mr stirling is on site the mr stirling i asked bayard didnt seem to get the humor yes that mr stirling or maybe he really expected me to know the name you always have a senior partner looking over your shoulder he used one finger to adjust his goldframed glasses it looked like an old gesture from a time before new glasses and designer suits with this much money at stake mr stirling thought he should be in the area in case there were more problems more problems i asked he blinked at me rapidly like a wellgroomed rabbit the bouvier matter he was lying what else is going wrong with your little project whatever do you mean ms blake his manicured fingers smoothed down his tie youve had more problems than just the bouviers i made it a statement any problems we may or may not be having ms blake are not your concern we hired you to raise the dead and establish the identity of said deceased persons beyond that you have no duties here have you ever raised a zombie mr bayard he blinked again of course not he sounded offended then how do you know the other problems wont affect my job small frown lines formed between his eyebrows he was a lawyer and was earning a good living but thinking seemed to be hard for him made you wonder where hed graduated from i dont see how our little difficulties could affect your job youve just admitted you dont know anything about my job i said how do you know what will affect it and what wont alright i was fishing bayard was probably right the other problems probably wouldnt affect me but you never know i dont like being kept in the dark and i dont like being lied to not even by omission i think mr stirling would have to make the call about whether you are enlightened or not not senior enough to make the decision i said no bayard said i am not geez some people you cant even needle i glanced at larry he shrugged looks like were going to land i glanced out at the rapidly growing land we were in the middle of the ozark mountains hovering over a blasted scar of reddish naked earth the construction site i presume the ground swelled up to meet us i closed my eyes and swallowed hard the ride was almost over i would not throw up this close to the ground the ride was almost over almost over almost over there was a bump that made me gasp weve landed larry said you can open your eyes now i did you are enjoying the hell out of this arent you he grinned i dont get to see you out of your element often the helicopter was surrounded by a fog of reddish dirt the blades began to slow with a thick whump whump sound as the blades stopped the dirt settled down and we could see where we were we were in a small flat area between a cluster of mountains it looked like it had once been a narrow valley but bulldozers had widened it flattened it made it a landing pad the earth was so red it looked like a river of rust the mountain in front of the helicopter was one red mound heavy equipment and cars were clustered to the far side of the valley men were clustered around the equipment shielding their eyes from the dust when the blades came to a sliding stop bayard unbuckled his seat belt i did too we lifted off the headsets and bayard opened his door i opened mine and found that the ground was farther away than youd think i had to expose a long line of thigh to touch the ground the construction workers were appreciative whistles catcalls and one offer to check under my skirt no those werent the exact words used a tall man in a white hard hat strode towards us he was wearing a pair of tan coveralls but his dirtcovered shoes were gucci and his tan was healthclub perfect a man and a woman followed at his back the man looked like the real foreman he was dressed in jeans and a work shirt with the sleeves rolled over muscular forearms not from racquetball or a little tennis but from plain hard work the woman wore the traditional skirt suit complete with little blousy tie at her throat the suit was expensive but was an unfortunate shade of puce that did nothing for the womans auburn hair but did match the blush that shed smeared on her cheeks i checked her neckline and yes she did have a pale line just above her collar where the base had not been blended in she looked like shed been made up at clown school she didnt look that young youd think someone somewhere would have clued her in to how bad she looked of course i wasnt going to tell her either who was i to criticize stirling had the palest grey eyes id ever seen the irises were only a few shades darker than the whites of his eyes he stood there with his entourage behind him he looked me up and down he didnt seem to like what he saw his strange eyes flicked to larry in his cheap wrinkled suit mr stirling frowned bayard came around smoothing his jacket into place mr stirling this is anita blake ms blake this is raymond stirling he just stood there looking at me like he was disappointed the woman had a clipboard notebook pen poised had to be his secretary she looked worried as if it was very important that mr raymond stirling like us i was beginning not to care if he liked us or not what i wanted to say was you got a problem what i said was is there a problem mr stirling bert would have been pleased youre not what i expected ms blake how so pretty for one thing it wasnt a compliment and he motioned at my outfit youre not dressed appropriately for the job your secretarys wearing heels ms harrisons attire is not your concern and my attire is none of yours fair enough but youre going to have a hell of time getting up that mountain in those shoes ive got a coverall and nikes in my suitcase i dont think i like your attitude ms blake i know i dont like yours i said the foreman behind him was having trouble not smiling his eyes were getting shiny with the effort ms harrison looked a little scared bayard had moved to one side closer to stirling making clear whose side he was on coward larry moved closer to me do you want this job ms blake not enough to take grief about it no ms harrison looked like shed swallowed a bug a big nasty squirming bug i think id missed my cue to fall down and worship at her bosss feet the foreman coughed behind his hand stirling glanced at him then back to me are you always this arrogant he asked i sighed i prefer the word confident to arrogant but ill tell you what ill tone it down if you will i am so sorry mr stirling bayard said i apologize i had no idea shut up lionel stirling said lionel shut up stirling was looking at me with his strange pale eyes he nodded agreed ms blake he smiled ill tone it down great i said all right ms blake lets go up to the top and see if youre really as good as you think you are i can look at the graveyard but until full dark i cant do anything else he frowned and glanced at bayard lionel that one word had a lot of heat in it anger looking for a target hed stop picking on me but lionel was fair game i did fax you a memo sir as soon as i realized that ms blake would be unable to help us until after dark good man when in doubt cover your ass with paper stirling glared at him bayard looked apologetic but he stood his ground safe behind his memo i called beau and had him bring everybody down here on the understanding we could get some work done today his gaze was very steady on bayard lionel wilted just a little evidently one memo was not protection enough mr stirling even if i can raise the graveyard in one night and thats a big if what if the dead are all bouviers what if it is their family plot my understanding is that construction will stop until you rebuy the land they dont want to sell beau said stirling glared at him the foreman just smiled softly are you saying that the entire project is off if this is the bouvier family plot i asked bayard why lionel you didnt tell me that there was no need for you to know bayard said why wouldnt they want to sell the land for a million dollars larry asked it was a good question stirling looked at him like hed just appeared out of thin air evidently the flunkies werent supposed to talk magnus and dorcas bouvier have only a restaurant called bloody bones it is nothing i have no idea why they wouldnt want to be millionaires bloody bones what kind of name is that for a restaurant larry asked i shrugged it doesnt exactly say bon appetit i looked at stirling he looked angry but that was all i would have bet a million dollars that he knew exactly why the bouviers didnt want to sell but it didnt show on his face his cards were close to his chest and unreadable i turned to bayard there was an unhealthy flush to his cheeks and he avoided my gaze id play poker with bayard any day but not in front of his boss fine ill change into something more bulky and well go take a look the pilot handed out my suitcase the coverall and shoes were on top larry came up to me gee i wished id thought of the coverall this suits not going to survive the trip i pulled out two pairs of coveralls be prepared i said he grinned thanks i shrugged one good thing about being nearly the same size i slipped off the black jacket which left the gun in plain sight ms blake stirling said why are you armed i sighed i was tired of raymond i hadnt even gone up the hill and i didnt want to go the last thing i wanted to do was stand here and debate whether i needed a gun the red blouse was shortsleeved visual aids are always better than lectures i walked over to him with my arms bent outward exposing the inside of both forearms theres a rather neat knife scar on my right arm nothing too dramatic my left arm is a mess it had only been a little over a month since a shapeshifting leopard had opened my arm a nice doctor had stitched it back together but there is only so much you can do with claw marks the crossshaped burn scar that some inventive vampire servants had put on me was now a little crooked because of the claws the mound of scar tissue at the bend of my arm where a vampire had bitten through the flesh and gnawed the bone dribbled white scars like water jesus beau said stirling looked a touch pale but he held up well like hed seen worse bayard looked green ms harrison paled so that the makeup floated on her suddenly pale skin like impressionist water lilies i dont go anywhere unarmed mr stirling live with it because i have to he nodded eyes very serious fine ms blake is your assistant armed as well no i said he nodded again fine change and when youre ready well go up larry was zipping up his coverall when i walked back i could have been armed you know he said you brought your gun i asked he nodded unloaded in your suitcase just like you told me good i let it go larry wanted to be a vampire executioner as well as an animator which meant he needed to know how to use a gun a gun with silverplated bullets that could slow a vampire down wed work up to shotguns which could take out a head and heart from a relatively safe distance beat the hell out of staking id gotten him a carry permit on the condition he didnt carry it concealed until i thought he was a good enough shot not to blow a hole in himself or me id gotten him the permit mainly so we could carry it around in the car and go to the range in any spare moments the coverall went over the skirt like magic i took off the heels and put the nikes on i left the coverall unzipped enough that i could go for the gun if needed and i was set to go are you going up with us mr stirling yes he said then lead the way i said he walked past me glancing at the coveralls or maybe visualizing the gun under it beau started to follow but stirling said no ill take her up alone silence among the three flunkies id expected ms harrison to stay behind in her highheeled pumps but id been sure the two men would come along so from the looks on their faces had they wait a minute you said her you want larry to wait down here too yes i shook my head hes in training you cant learn if you dont see it done will you be doing anything that he needs to see today i thought about that for a minute i guess not i do get to come up after dark larry asked youll get to see the down and dirty larry dont worry of course stirling said i have no problem with your associate doing his job why cant he come along now i asked at the price were paying humor me ms blake he was being strangely polite so i nodded okay mr stirling bayard said are you sure you should go up alone why ever not lionel bayard opened his mouth closed it then said no reason mr stirling beau shrugged ill tell the men to go home for the day he started to turn away then stopped do you want the crew back tomorrow stirling looked at me ms blake i shook my head i dont know yet whats your best guess he asked i looked over at the waiting men do they get paid whether they show up or not only if they show up stirling said then no work tomorrow i cant guarantee theyll have anything to do stirling nodded you heard her beau beau looked at me then back to stirling he had a strange took on his face half amused half something i couldnt read anything you say mr stirling ms blake he turned and strode off over the raw ground waving at the men as he moved the men began to leave long before he got to them what do you want us to do mr stirling bayard asked wait for us the helicopter too it has to leave before dark will we be down before dark ms blake sure im just going to take a quick look around ill need to get back in here after dark though ill give you a car and driver for your stay thanks shall we ms blake he motioned me forward something had changed in the way he was treating me i couldnt put my finger on it but i didnt like it after you mr stirling he nodded and took the lead striding over the red earth in his thousanddollar shoes larry and i exchanged glances i wont be long larry us flunkies arent going anywhere he said i smiled he smiled i shrugged why did stirling want it to be just the two of us i watched the senior partners broad back as he marched across the torn earth i followed him id find out what the secrecy was all about when we got to the top i was betting i wouldnt like what id hear just me and the big cheese on top of the mountain with the dead what could be better the view from the top of the mountain was worth the hike trees stretched out and out to the horizon we stood in a circle of forest that showed no hand of man as far as the eye could see that first blush of green was more pronounced here but the thing you noticed most was the lavender color of redbuds through the dark trees redbuds are such delicate things that if they came out in the height of summer theyd get lost in all the leaves and flowers but here with nothing but naked trees the redbuds were eyecatching a few dogwoods had started to bloom adding their white to the lavender spring in the ozarks ah the view is magnificent i said yes stirling said it is isnt it my black nikes were covered in rustcolored dirt the raw wounded earth filled the mountaintop this hilltop had probably been just as pretty as the rest once there was an arm bone sticking out of the dirt next to my feet the lower arm judging from the length the bones were slender and still connected by a dry remnant of tissue once id seen one bone my eyes found more to look at it was like one of those magiceye pictures where you stare and stare and suddenly see whats there i saw them all studding the ground like hands reaching up through a river of rust there were a few splintered coffins their broken halves spilling out into the air but mostly it was just bones i knelt and put my hands palm down on the ruined earth i tried to get some sense of the dead there was something faint and faroff like a whiff of perfume but it was no good in the bright spring sunlight i couldnt work my magic raising the dead isnt evil but it does require darkness i dont know why i stood up brushing my hands against the coverall trying to clean the red dust away stirling was standing at the edge of the naked dirt staring off into space there was a distance to his gaze that said he wasnt admiring the trees he spoke without looking at me i cant bully you can i ms blake nope i said he turned to me with a smile but it left his eyes empty haunted i invested everything i had into this project not just my money but clients money do you understand what i am saying ms blake if the bodies up here are bouviers youre screwed how eloquently you put it why are we up here alone mr stirling why all the skullduggery he took a deep breath of the gentle air and said i want you to say they arent bouvier ancestors even if they are he looked at me when he said it watched my face i smiled and shook my head i wont lie for you cant you make the zombies lie the dead are very honest mr stirling they dont lie he took a step towards me face very sincere my entire future is riding on you ms blake no mr stirling your future rides on the dead at your feet whatever comes out of their mouths will decide it he nodded i suppose that is fair fair or not its the truth he nodded again some light had gone out of his face like someone had turned down the power the lines in his face were suddenly clearer he aged ten years in a few seconds when he met my gaze his dramatic eyes were woeful ill give you a piece of the profits ms blake you could be a billionaire in a few years you know bribing wont work i knew it wouldnt work just a few minutes after we met but i had to try you really do believe this is the bouvier family plot dont you i asked he took a deep breath and walked away from me to gaze off at the trees he wasnt going to answer my question but he didnt have to he wouldnt be so desperate if he didnt believe he was screwed why wont the bouviers sell he glanced back at me i dont know look stirling there are just the two of us up here nobody to impress no witnesses you know why they wont sell just tell me i dont know ms blake he said youre a control freak mr stirling youve overseen every detail of this deal you have personally seen that every i was dotted every t crossed this is your baby you know everything about the bouviers and their problem just tell me he just looked at me his pale eyes were opaque empty as a window with no one home he knew but he wasnt going to tell me why what do you know about the bouviers the locals think theyre witches they do a little fortunetelling a few harmless spells there was something about the way he said it too casual too offhand made me want to meet the bouviers in person they any good at magic i asked how am i supposed to know i shrugged just curious is there a reason why it had to be this mountain look at it he spread his arms wide its perfect it is perfect it is a great view i said but wouldnt the view be equally good over on that mountaintop why did you have to have this one why did you have to have the bouviers mountain his shoulders slumped then he straightened and glared at me i wanted this land and i got it you got it trick is raymond can you keep it if you are not going to help me then dont taunt me and dont call me raymond i opened my mouth to say something else and my beeper went off i fished under the coverall for it and checked the number shit i said whats wrong im being paged by the police ive got to get to a phone he frowned at me why would the police be calling you so much for being a household name im the legal vampire executioner for a threestate area im attached to the regional preternatural investigation team he was looking very steadily at me you surprise me ms blake not many people do that i need to find a phone i have a portable with a battery pack at the bottom of this damned hill great im ready to head down if you are he did one last turn taking in that breathstealing billiondollar view yes im ready to go down it was an interesting choice of words a freudian slip you might say stirling had wanted this land for some perverse reason maybe because he was told he couldnt have it some people are like that the more you say no the more they want you it reminded me of a certain master vampire i knew tonight id walk the land visit with the dead it would probably be tomorrow night before i actually tried to raise them if the police matter was pressing enough it might be longer i hoped it wasnt pressing pressing usually meant dead bodies when the monsters are involved its never just one dead body one way or another the dead multiply we got back to the valley the construction crew was gone except for beau the foreman ms harrison and bayard stood next to the helicopter as if huddling against the wilderness larry and the pilot stood to one side smoking sharing that comradery of all people who are determined to blacken their lungs stirling walked towards them all his stride firm and confident once more hed left his doubts on top of the mountain or so it seemed he was the impervious senior partner once more illusion is all bayard get the phone ms blake needs to use it bayard gave a startled little jump like hed been caught doing something he shouldnt have ms harrison looked a little flushed was there romance in the air and was that not allowed no fraternizing among the flunkies bayard ran off across the dirt towards the last car he fetched what looked like a small black leather backpack with a handle he pulled a phone out and handed it to me it looked like an antennaed walkietalkie larry walked over smelling of smoke whats up i got beeped bert i shook my head police i walked a little ways from our group larry was polite enough to stay with them though he didnt have to i dialed dolphs number detective sergeant rudolf storr was head of the regional preternatural investigation team he answered on the second ring anita yeah dolph its me whats up three dead bodies three shit i said yeah he said i cant be there soon dolph yes you can he said there was something in his voice whats that supposed to mean the victims are right near you near branson twentyfive minutes east of branson he said im already forty miles from branson in the middle of freaking nowhere the middle of nowhere is where this one is dolph said are you guys flying up i asked no we got a vampire victim in town jesus are the other three vamp victims i dont think so he said what do you mean you dont think so i asked missouri state highway patrol has this one sergeant freemont is the investigator in charge she doesnt think it was a vampire because the bodies are cut up pieces of the bodies are missing i had to do a lot of tap dancing to get that much information out of her sergeant freemont seems convinced that rpit is going to come in and steal all the glory she was particularly worried about our headlinestealing pet zombie queen its the pet part that i mind the most i said but she sounds charming ill bet shes even more charming in person dolph said and i get to meet her given the choice between a large chunk of the squad coming down later and just you right now she chose you i think she sees you alone without us to back you up as the lesser evil nice to be the lesser evil for a change i said you might get upgraded dolph said she doesnt know you too well yet thanks for the vote of confidence let me test my understanding here none of you are coming up to the scene not right away you know were shorthanded until zerbrowski gets back on duty what does the missouri state highway patrol think about a civilian helping them in a murder investigation i made it clear that you are a valuable member of my squad thanks for the compliment but i still dont have a badge to flash you may if that new federal law goes into effect dolph said dont remind me dont you want to be a federal marshal his voice was very mild nah amused i agreed they should license us but giving us what amounts to federal marshal status is ridiculous you could handle it but who else john burke with the power of the law behind him give me a break it wont get passed anita the provampire lobby is too strong from your lips to gods ear unless they revoke the need for court orders of execution it wont make killing them any easier and they wont do that ive already gone out of state to execute vamps i dont need no stinking badge dolph laughed if you run into trouble give a yell i really dont like this dolph im out here investigating a murder without any official status see you do need a badge i heard him sigh over the phone look anita i wouldnt leave you solo if we didnt have problems of our own ive got a body on the ground here when i can ill send somebody hell id like you to come take a look at our corpse youre our resident monster expert give me some details and ill try to play kreskin male early twenties rigor hasnt set in wheres the body his apartment howd you get there so soon neighbor heard a fight called they called us give me his name fredrick michael summers freddy summers he got any old vampire bites on his body healed bites yeah quite a few looks like a damn pincushion howd you know whats the first rule of a homicide i said you check the nearest and dearest if he had a vamp lover thered be healed bite marks the more of them the longer the relationship has gone on no vamp can bite a victim three times within a month without running the risk of killing them and raising them as a vamp you can have different vamps bite somebody but that would make freddy a vampire junkie ask the neighbors if there were a lot of different guys or girls going in and out at night it never occurred to me that a vampire could be someones nearest and dearest dolph said legally theyre people means they get to have sweethearts too ill check the bite radiuses dolph said if they match one vamp a lover different ones and our boy was doing groups hope for a lover i said if its all one vamp he might even rise from the dead most vamps know enough to slit the throat or take the head he said doesnt sound well planned crime of passion maybe maybe freemont is holding the bodies for you eagerly awaiting your expertise i bet dont bust freemonts balls on this anita i wont start anything dolph be polite he said always i said in my mildest voice he sighed try to remember that the staties may never have seen bodies with pieces missing it was my turn to sigh ill be good scouts honor do you have directions i got a small notebook with a pen stuck in its spiral top out of a pocket of the coverall id started carrying notebooks just for such occasions he gave me what freemont had given him if you see anything fishy at the crime scene keep the scene intact and ill try to send some people down otherwise look over the victim give the staties your opinion and let them do their job you really think freemont would let me close up her shop and force her to wait for rpit silence for a second then do the best you can anita call if we can do anything from this end yeah sure id rather have you on a murder than a lot of the cops i know dolph said that was a very big compliment coming from dolph he is the worlds ultimate policeman thanks dolph i was talking to empty air dolph had hung up he was always doing that i hit the button turning the phone off and just stood there for a minute i didnt like being out here in unfamiliar territory with unfamiliar police and partially eaten victims hanging around with the spook squad legitimized me id even pulled that im with the squad at crime scenes i had a little id badge that clipped to my clothes it wasnt a police badge but it did look official but pretending on home turf where i knew i could run to dolph if i got in trouble for it was one thing out here with no backup was another story the police have absolutely no sense of humor about civilians meddling in their homicide cases cant really blame them i wasnt really a civilian but i had no official status no clout maybe the new law would be a good thing i shook my head theoretically id be able to go into any police station in the country and demand help or involve myself uninvited in any case theoretically in the real world the cops would hate it id be as welcome as a wet dog on a cold night not federal not local and there werent enough licensed vamp executioners in the country to fill a dozen slots i could only name eight of us two of those were retired most of them specialized in vampires i was one of the few who would look at other types of kills there was talk of the new law being expanded to include all preternatural kills most of the vampire executioners would be out of their depth it was an informal apprenticeship i had a college degree in preternatural biology but that wasnt common most of the rogue lycanthropes occasional trolls run amok and other more solid beasties were taken out by bounty hunters but the new law wouldnt give special powers to bounty hunters vampire executioners most of them worked very strictly within the confines of the law or maybe we just had better press id been screaming about vamps being monsters for years but until a senators daughter got herself attacked just a few weeks ago nobody did shit now suddenly its a cause celebre the legitimate vampire community delivered the supposed attacker in a sack to the senators home they left his head and torso intact which meant even without arms and legs he wouldnt die he confessed to the attack hed been the new dead and just got carried away on a date like any other twentyoneyearold redblooded male yeah right the local hitter gerald mallory had done the execution hes based out of washington dc he has to be in his sixties now he still uses a stake and hammer can you believe it there had been some talk that cutting off their arms and legs would allow us to keep vamps in jail this was vetoed mainly on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment it also wouldnt have worked not for the really old vampires it isnt just their bodies that are dangerous besides i didnt believe in torture if cutting someones arms and legs off and putting them in a little box for all eternity isnt torture i dont know what is i walked back to the group i handed the phone to bayard i hope it isnt bad news he said not personally i said he looked puzzled not an uncommon occurrence for lionel i talked directly to stirling ive got to go to a crime scene near here is there someplace to rent a car he shook his head i said youd have a car and driver while you were here i meant it thanks im not so sure about the driver though this is a crime scene they wont want civilians hanging around a car then no driver lionel see that ms blake gets anything she wants yes sir ill meet you back here at full dark ms blake ill be here at dusk if i can mr stirling but the police matter takes precedence he frowned at me you are working for me ms blake yes but im also a licensed vampire executioner cooperation with the local police takes precedence so its a vampire kill i am not free to share police information with anyone i said but i cursed myself by bringing up the word vampire id started a rumor that would grow with the telling damn i cant leave the investigation early just to come look at your mountain ill be here when i can ill definitely look the dead over before daylight so you wont really lose any time he didnt like it but he let it go fine ms blake i will wait here for you even if it takes all night im curious about what you do ive never seen a zombie raised before i wont raise the dead tonight mr stirling weve been over that of course he just looked at me for some reason it was hard to meet his pale eyes i made myself meet his gaze and didnt look away but it was an effort it was like he was willing me to do something trying to compel me with his eyes like a vampire but a vampire even a little one he was not he blinked and walked away without saying another word ms harrison toddled after him in her high heels on the uneven ground beau nodded at me and followed i guess theyd all come in the same car or maybe beau was stirlings driver what a joyous job that must be well fly you to the hotel where we booked your rooms you can unpack and ill have a car brought around for you bayard said no unpacking just a car murder scenes age fast i said he nodded as you like if youll get back into the helicopter well be off it wasnt until i was taking off the coveralls and repacking both of them that i realized i could have gone with mr stirling i could have driven out of here instead of flying shit bayard had gotten us a black jeep with blacktinted windows and more bells and whistles than i could even guess at id been worried theyd saddle me with a cadillac or something equally ridiculous bayard had given me the keys with the comment some of these roads are not even paved i thought you might need something more substantial than just a car i resisted the urge to pat him on the head and say good flunkie hell hed made a great choice maybe hed make full partner someday after all the trees made long thin shadows across the road in the valleys between mountains the sunlight had softened to a lateafternoon haze we might make it back to the graveyard by full dark yes we larry sat beside me in his wrinkled blue suit the cops wouldnt mind his cheap suit my outfit on the other hand might raise a few eyebrows there arent many female cops out in the boonies and fewer who wear short red skirts i was beginning to really regret my choice of clothes insecure who me larrys face was shiny with excitement his eyes sparkled like a kids on christmas day he was drumming his fingers on the armrest nervous tension how you doing ive never been to a murder scene before he said theres always a first time thanks for letting me come along just remember the rules he laughed dont touch anything dont walk through the blood dont speak unless spoken to he frowned why the last i understand all the others but why cant i talk im a member of the regional preternatural investigation team youre not if you go around saying golly gee whiz a dead body they may catch on i wont embarrass you he sounded insulted then a thought occurred to him are we impersonating police officers no keep repeating im a member of the spook squad im a member of the spook squad im a member of the spook squad but im not he said thats why i dont want you talking oh he said he settled back into his seat a little of the shine dimming around the edges ive never actually seen a freshly dead body before you raise the dead for a living larry you see corpses all the time its not the same thing anita he sounded grumpy i glanced at him he had slumped down as far into the seat as the seat belt would allow arms crossed over his chest we were at the crest of a hill a band of sunlight fell like an explosion over his orange hair his blue eyes looked translucent for a moment as we passed from light into shadow he looked all scrunched and sulky have you ever seen a dead person outside of a funeral or a freshly raised zombie he was quiet for a minute i concentrated on driving letting the silence fill the jeep it was a comfortable silence at least for me no he said at last he sounded like a little boy who had been told he couldnt go outside and play im not always good around fresh bodies either i said he looked at me sort of sideways what do you mean it was my turn to scrunch into the seat i fought the urge and sat up straighter i threw up on a murder victim once even saying it very fast it was still embarrassing larry scooted up in his seat grinning youre just telling me that to make me feel better would i tell a story like that about myself if it wasnt true i asked you really threw up on a body at a crime scene you dont have to sound so happy about it i said he giggled i swear he giggled i dont think ill throw up on the body i shrugged three bodies with parts missing dont make promises you cant keep he swallowed loud enough for me to hear it what do they mean parts missing well find out i said this isnt part of your job description larry i get paid for helping the cops you dont will it be awful his voice was low uncertain choppedup bodies was he kidding i dont know until we get there but what do you think he was staring at me very earnestly i glanced back at the road then at larry he looked very solemn like a relative whod asked the doctor for the truth if he would be brave i could be truthful yeah itll be awful it was awful larry had managed to stagger from the crime scene before he threw up the only comfort i could offer him was that he wasnt the only one some of the cops were looking a little green around the edges too i hadnt thrown up yet but i was keeping it as an option for later the bodies lay in a small hollow near the base of a hill the ground was nearly kneedeep with leaves nobody rakes in the woods the drought had dried the leaves to a fine biting crunch underfoot the hollow was ringed by naked trees and bushes with branches like thin brown whips when the leaves came out the hollow would be hidden on all sides the body nearest to me was a blond man with hair cut so short it looked like an oldfashioned butch blood pooled around the eyeballs flowing from them down the face there was something wrong with the face besides the eyes but i couldnt quite figure out what i knelt in the dry leaves glad that the leg of the coverall was protecting my hose from the leaves and the blood blood had pooled to either side of the boys face soaking into the leaves the blood had dried to a tacky maroon substance it looked like the teenagers eyes had been crying dark tears i touched the tip of my gloved fingers to the blonds chin it moved in a boneless wiggling movement that chins were not meant to do i swallowed hard and tried to take shallow breaths i was glad it was still spring if the bodies had been sitting this long in full summer heat theyd have been ripe in more ways than one cool weather was a blessing i put my hands in the leaves and bent from the waist in an awkward sort of pushup motion i was trying to see under his chin without moving the body again there nearly lost in the blood on the neck was a puncture mark a puncture mark wider than my outspread hand id seen knife wounds and claw marks that could make a similar wound but it was too big for a knife and too clean for a claw besides what the hell had a claw that big it looked like a massive blade had been shoved under the blonds chin close enough to the front of his face to slice the eyes up from inside the head thats why the eyes were bleeding but still looked intact the sword had nearly pulled the blonds face off his skull i ran my gloved fingers over the blonds short hair and found what i was looking for the tip of the sword if thats what it was had come out the top of his head then the blade had been withdrawn and the blond had dropped to the leaves dead i hoped but dying i was sure of his legs were missing just below the hip joint there was almost no blood where the legs had been bisected theyd been cut off after hed died small blessing that hed died relatively quickly and had not been tortured there were worse ways to die i knelt by the stubs of his legs the left bone had been cut clean with one blow the right bone had splintered as if the sword struck from the left side cut the left cleanly but only got a piece of the right leg a second blow had been needed to sever the right leg why take the legs a trophy maybe serial killers took trophies clothing personal items a body part maybe a trophy the other two boys were shorter neither of them over five feet younger maybe maybe not they were both small and darkhaired slender probably the kind of boys who looked pretty rather than handsome but frankly it was hard to tell one lay on his back almost opposite from the blond one brown eye stared up at the sky glassy and immobile somehow unreal like the eyes of a taxidermy animal the rest of his face was sliced in two huge gaping furrows as if the tip of the sword had been used coming and going like a backhand slap the third slice had taken out his neck it was a very clean wound they all were the damn sword or whatever it was was incredibly sharp but it was more than a good blade no human could have been fast enough to take them all without a struggle but most beasties that will kill a human being wont pick up a weapon to do it a lot of things will claw us apart or eat us alive but the list of preternatural beings that will cut us up with weapons is pretty small a troll may tear up a tree and whap you to death but it wont use a blade not only had this thing used a sword not a common weapon but it had some skill the blows to the face hadnt killed the boy why didnt the other two run if the blond was killed first why didnt this one run nothing was fast enough that it could take out three teenage boys with a sword before any of them could run these were not quick blows whoever or whatever had done this had taken some time with each kill but they all acted as if theyd been hit by surprise the boy had fallen onto his back in the leaves hands clutching at his throat the leaves had been scuffed away where his feet had kicked them i took a shallow breath i didnt want to probe the wounds but i was beginning to have a nasty idea i knelt and traced the neck wound with my fingertips the edges of the skin were so smooth but it was still human flesh human skin blood dried to a thick stickiness i swallowed hard and closed my eyes and let my fingers search for what i thought id find the edge of the wound had two lips starting about midway i opened my eyes and traced the double wound with my fingers my eyes still couldnt see it there was too much blood once the wound was clean youd see it but not here not like this the neck had been sliced twice deeply one cut was enough to kill why twice because they were hiding something on the neck fang marks maybe being killed by a vampire would explain why he hadnt tried to crawl away hed just lain in the leaves and kicked until he died i stared at the last teenager he was crumpled on his right side blood had pooled under him he was so cut up that at first my eyes didnt want to make sense of what i was seeing i wanted to look away before my brain caught up to my eyes but i didnt where the face should have been was just a ripped gapping hole the creature had done the same thing to this one as to the blond but it had been more thorough the front of the skull had been ripped away i glanced around searching the leaves for the piece of bone and flesh but didnt see it i had to look back then at the body i knew what i was looking at now i liked it better when i didnt the back of the skull was full of blood and gore like a gruesome cup but the brain was gone the blade had sliced him open across the chest and stomach his intestines spilled out in a thick rubbery mass what i thought was his stomach had spilled out from the wound like a balloon halfinflated the left leg had been chopped off at the hip joint the ragged cloth of his jeans clung to the hole like the petals of an unopened flower the left arm had been ripped out just below the elbow the bone of the humerus was dark with dried blood sticking up at an odd angle as if the entire arm had been broken at the shoulder and no longer moved more violent had this one struggled a little my eyes flicked back to his face i didnt want to look again but i hadnt really examined it there was something horribly personal about disfiguring a persons face if it had been humanly possible to do all this id have said check their nearest and dearest as a general rule only people who love you will cut up your face it implies passion that you cant get from strangers one exception is serial killers theyre working through a pathology in which the victims can represent someone else someone that the killer has a personal passion for when cutting up the faces of strangers theyd be symbolically cutting up say a hated father figure the fine bones of the boys sinus cavities had been cracked open the maxillary was gone making the face look incomplete part of the mandible was still there but it had been cracked apart back to the rear molars some trick of blood flow had left two teeth white and clean one of the teeth had a filling in it i stared at that ruined face id been doing pretty good at thinking of it as so much meat just dead meat but dead meat didnt get cavities didnt go to dentists it was suddenly a teenager or maybe even younger i was only judging on height and the apparent age of the other two maybe this one with no face was a child a tall child a little boy the spring afternoon wavered around me i took a deep breath to steady myself and it was a mistake i got a big whiff of bowels and stale death i scrambled for the side of the hollow never throw up on the murder victims pisses off the cops i fell to my knees at the top of the small rise where all the cops were gathered i hadnt exactly fallen so much as thrown myself down i took deep cleansing breaths of the cool air it helped a small breeze was blowing up here thinning out the smell of death it helped more cops of all shapes and sizes were huddled at the top of the rise nobody was spending more time than they had to down among the dead there were ambulances waiting on the distant road but everybody else had had their piece of the bodies they had been videotaped and trooped through with the crime scene technicians everybody had done their job except me are you going to be sick ms blake the voice was that of sergeant freemont division of drug and crime control ddccaffectionately known as dc her tone was gentle but disapproving i understood the tone we were the only two women at the crime scene which meant we were playing with the big boys you had to be tougher than the men stronger better or they held it against you or they treated you like a girl i was betting sergeant freemont hadnt gotten sick she wouldnt have allowed it i took another cleansing breath and let it out i looked up at her from my knees she looked every inch of her fivefooteight her hair was straight dark cut just below her chin the ends were curled under to frame her face her pants were a bright sunny yellow jacket black blouse a softer yellow i had a good view of her polished black loafers there was a gold wedding band on her left hand but no engagement ring deep smile lines put her on the far side of forty but she wasnt smiling now i swallowed once more trying not to taste that smell on the back of my tongue i got to my feet no sergeant freemont im not going to be sick i was glad that it was true i just hoped she didnt make me go back down into the hollow id toss my cookies if i had to look at the bodies again what did that she asked i didnt turn and look where she pointed i knew what was down there i shrugged i dont know her brown eyes were neutral and unreadable good cop eyes she frowned what do you mean you dont know youre supposed to be the monster expert i let the supposed to be go she hadnt called me a zombie queen to my face in fact shed been very polite correct but there was no warmth to it she wasnt impressed and in her quiet way with a look or the slightest inflection she let me know i was going to have to pull a very big corpse out of my hat to impress sergeant freemont ddcc so far i wasnt even close larry walked up to us his face was the color of yellowgreen tissue paper it clashed with his red hair his eyes were redrimmed where his eyes had teared while he threw up if its violent enough sometimes you cry while you vomit i didnt ask larry if he was okay the answer was too obvious but he was on his feet ambulatory if he didnt faint hed be fine what do you want from me sergeant i asked id been more than patient for me id been downright conciliatory dolph would be proud bert would have been amazed she crossed her arms over her stomach i let sergeant storr talk me into letting you see the crime scene he said you were the best according to the newspapers you just do a little magic and figure it all out or maybe you can just raise the dead and ask them who killed them i took a deep breath and let it out i didnt use magic to solve crimes as a general rule i used knowledge but saying so would be defending myself i didnt need to prove anything to freemont dont believe everything you read in the papers sergeant freemont as for raising the dead it wont work with these three are you telling me you cant raise zombies either she shook her head if you cant help us then go home ms blake i glanced at larry he gave a small shrug he still looked shaky i dont think he had the energy yet to tell me to behave myself or maybe he was as tired of freemont as i was i could raise them as zombies sergeant but you have to have a mouth and a working throat to talk with they could write it down freemont said it was a good suggestion it made me think better of her if she was a good cop i could put up with a little hostility as long as i never had to see another set of bodies like the ones below i could put up with a lot of hostility maybe but the dead often lose higher brain function faster after a traumatic death they might not be able to write but even if they could they might not know what killed them but they saw it larry said his voice sounded hoarse and he coughed gently behind his hand to clear it none of them tried to run away larry why why are you asking him freemont said hes in training i said training you brought a trainee in on my murder case i stared up at her i dont tell you how to do your job dont tell me how to do mine you havent done a damn thing yet except for your assistant throwing up in the bushes an unhealthy flush crept up larrys neck embarrassed when he was almost too nauseated to stand larry wasnt the only one upchucking in the weeds just the only one without a badge i shook my head we dont need this shit i brushed past freemont come on larry larry followed obedient to the last i dont want any of this leaked to the press ms blake if the media gets hold of it ill know where it came from she wasnt yelling but her voice carried i turned i wasnt yelling either but everyone could hear me you have an unknown preternatural creature that uses a sword and is faster than a vampire something flickered across her face like maybe id finally done something interesting how do you know its faster than a vampire none of the boys tried to get away all of them died where they stood either its faster or it has some amazing mind control its not a lycanthrope then even a lycanthrope isnt that fast and they dont have the ability to cloud mens minds if a lycanthrope came in there with a sword the boys would have screamed and run there would have at least been signs of a struggle freemont just stood there looking it was a very serious look like she was weighing and measuring me she still wasnt happy with me but she was listening i can help you sergeant freemont i can help you figure out what did this maybe before it does it again her quiet confident mask crumbled around the edge for a second if i hadnt been staring at her neutral brown eyes id have missed it shit i said loud i walked back over to her and lowered my voice thats it isnt it these arent the first killings she glanced down at the ground then met my eyes jaw sort of thrust forward her eyes werent neutral now they were just a little bit scared not for herself but for what shed done or not done the state highway patrol can handle a homicide her voice was the gentlest id heard it how many i asked two before a couple of teenagers boy and a girl probably necking in the woods her voice was soft almost tired whats the me say youre right she said it was a blade probably a sword the monsters dont use weapons ms blake i thought it was the girls exboyfriend hes got a collection of civil war memorabilia including swords it seemed pretty cutanddried i nodded sounds logical none of his swords matched the blows but i thought hed ditched the murder weapon i didnt think she looked away from me hands shoved so hard into her pants pockets i thought theyd split the cloth the first scene wasnt like this they were killed with the first blow it pinned them through the chest into the ground a human being could have done that she looked back at me as if wanting me to agree with her i did were their bodies cut up beyond the death wound she nodded disfigured faces her left hand missing the one that had worn the exboyfriends ring were their throats cut she frowned thinking then nodded hers was not much blood either like itd been done after she died my turn to nod great great larry asked i think youve got a vampire on your hands sergeant freemont they both frowned at me look at the body parts that are missing the legs of the one boy were cut off after he died the femoral artery is in the thigh near the groin ive seen vamps take blood from that in preference to the neck cut off the legs and no fang marks what about the other two freemont asked maybe the smallest boy was bitten his neck was sliced twice for no reason maybe it was just a little extra violence like the disfigurement of the face i dont know but a vamp can take blood from the wrist the bend of the arm all parts that are missing one of their brains is missing freemont said larry swayed gently beside me he wiped a hand over his suddenly sweating face you going to be alright i asked he nodded not trusting his voice brave larry what better way to throw us off the track than to take something a vamp wouldnt be interested in i said okay say it makes some sense why this way this is she spread her hands wide staring down at the carnage she was the only one of the three of us still looking at it this is nuts if it was human id say we had a serial killer on our hands we may have i said softly freemont stared at me what the hell do you mean a vampire was a person once just being dead doesnt cure you of any problems you had as a live human being if you have a violent pathology before death that wont change just because youre dead freemont looked at me like i was the one who was crazy i think it was the word dead that was bothering her once her suspects were dead they werent suspects anymore i tried again say johnny is a serial killer he becomes a vampire why should being a vampire make him suddenly less violent why not more violent oh my god larry said freemont took a deep breath in through her nose and let it out slow okay maybe youre right im not saying you are ive seen pictures of vampire victims and they dont look like this but if you are what do you need from me the pictures from the first crime scene and a look at where it happened ill send the file to your hotel she said where was the couple killed just a few hundred yards from here lets go take a look ill have one of the troopers take you over she said this is a damn small geographic area i assume you searched it with a finetooth comb but frankly ms blake i wasnt sure what we were looking for the leaves and the dry weather make it almost impossible to find tracks yeah i said tracks would help i glanced back the way id come the leaves were disturbed coming up the hill if it is a vampire freemont cut me off what do you mean if i met her suddenly accusing eyes look sergeant if it is a vampire it has more mind control than ive ever seen ive never met a vampire even a master vampire that could hold three humans in thrall while he killed them until i saw this id have said it couldnt be done what else could it be larry asked i shrugged i think its a vamp but if i said i was a hundred percent sure id be lying i try not to lie to the police there may be no tracks up the hill even if the ground was soft because the vampire could have flown in like a bat freemont asked no they dont change shape into a bat but they can i searched for a word and there wasnt one they can levitate sort of fly ive seen it i cant explain it but ive seen it a serial killer vampire she shook her head the lines near her mouth deepening the feds are going to be all over this no joke i said did you find the missing body parts no i thought maybe it had eaten them if it ate that much why not more if it ate why no teeth marks if it ate why not some scattered body parts like crumbs she clenched her hands into fists youve made your point it was a vampire even a dumb cop knows they dont eat flesh she turned her brown eyes to me and there was a lot of anger in them not at me exactly but i might make a good target i stared back at her not flinching she looked away first maybe i wouldnt make a good target i dont like having a civilian contractor in on a homicide investigation but you spotted things down there that i missed youre either very good or you know something that you arent telling me i could have just said im good at my job but i didnt didnt want the police thinking i was holding out information when i wasnt ive got one advantage over a normal homicide detective i expect it to be a monster no one ever calls me in if its just a stabbing or a hitandrun i dont spend a lot of time trying to come up with nice normal explanations it means i get to ignore a lot of theories she nodded alright if you help me catch this thing i dont care what you do for a living glad to hear it i said but no reporters no media i am in charge here this is my investigation i decide when we go public is that clear sure she stared at me like she didnt believe me i mean it about the media ms blake i dont have a problem with no media sergeant freemont i prefer it that way for a person who doesnt want the media around you get a lot of attention i shrugged im involved in only sensational cases detective cases that make good press good sound bites i slay vampires for gods sake it makes great headlines as long as we understand each other ms blake no media its not a hard concept i said she nodded ill have someone walk you over to the first crime scene ill see you get the file at your hotel she started to turn away sergeant freemont she turned back but it was not a friendly look what is it now ms blake youve done your job you cant treat this like a human serial killer im in charge of this investigation ms blake i can do what i damn well please i stared up at her met her hostile eyes i wasnt feeling too friendly myself i am not trying to steal your thunder here but vampires arent just people with fangs if the vamp could catch their minds and hold them while he slaughtered each of them in turn he could capture your mind anyones mind a vampire that talented could make you think black was white do you understand me its daylight ms blake if its a vampire then we find it and stake it youll need a court order of execution well get one when you get it ill come back and finish the job i think we can handle it you ever stake a vampire i asked she just looked at me no but ive shot a man it cant be that much harder its not harder in the way you mean i said but its a hell of a lot more dangerous she shook her head until the feds get here im in charge and not you or anyone else is taking over is that clear ms blake i nodded crystal sergeant freemont i stared at the crossshaped pin in the lapel of her suit jacket most plainclothesmen had a crossshaped tie tack standard police issue across the country you do have silver ammo right ill take care of my men ms blake i raised my hands slightly so much for girl talk fine were leaving youve got my beeper number use it if you need it detective freemont i wont need it i took a deep breath and swallowed a lot of words picking a fight with the cop in charge of a murder investigation was not the way to get invited back to play i walked past her without saying goodbye if i opened my mouth i wasnt sure what would come out nothing pleasant and nothing useful people who dont camp much think darkness falls from the sky it doesnt darkness slides from the trees and fills them first then spreads outward to the open places it was so dark under the trees that i wished for a flashlight when we stumbled to the road and our waiting jeep it was only dusk larry looked up at the coming night and said we can get back and walk the graveyard for stirling first lets eat i said he looked at me you wanting to stop for food thats a first i usually have to beg for driveup i forgot to eat lunch i said he grinned that i believe the smile faded slowly from his face the first time you offer me food voluntarily and i dont think i can eat he stared at me there was enough light left for me to see him search my face could you really eat after what we just saw i looked at him i didnt know what to say not so long ago the answer would have been no well i wouldnt want to face a plate of spaghetti or steak tartare but yeah i could eat he shook his head what the heck is steak tartare raw beef pretty much i said he swallowed hard looking just a little paler than he had a second ago how can you even think of stuff like that so soon after he let the words trail off wed both seen it no words were needed i shrugged ive been going to murder scenes for nearly three years larry you learn to survive which means you learn to eat after seeing cutup bodies i didnt add that id seen worse id seen human bodies reduced to a roomful of blood and gobbets of unrecognizable flesh not enough left to fill a gallonsize baggie i hadnt gone out for big macs after that one are you up to at least trying to eat he was looking at me sort of suspiciously where did you have in mind i untied the nikes and stepped carefully on the gravel road didnt want to snag the hose i unzipped the coverall and stepped out of it larry did the same but he tried to keep his shoes on he managed to work his feet through but it required some hopping on one leg i folded my coverall carefully so the blood wouldnt touch the jeeps immaculate interior i tossed the nikes into the back floorboard and got the high heels out larry was trying to brush wrinkles from his suit pants but some things only a dry cleaner could fix how would you like to go to bloody bones i asked he looked up at me hands still patting at the wrinkles he frowned where its the restaurant that magnus bouvier owns stirling mentioned it did he tell us where it was larry said no but i asked one of the local cops for restaurants and bloody bones isnt that far from here larry squinted suspiciously at me why do you want to go there i want to talk to magnus bouvier why he asked it was a good question i wasnt sure i had a good answer i shrugged and climbed into the jeep larry had no choice but to join me unless he didnt want to continue the conversation when we were all settled in the jeep i still didnt have a really good answer i dont like stirling i dont trust him i got the impression you didnt like him larry said his voice very dry but why not trust him do you trust him i asked larry frowned and thought about it he shook his head not as far as i could throw him see i said i guess so but you think talking to bouvier will help i hope so i dont like raising the dead for people i dont trust especially something this big okay so we go eat dinner at bouviers restaurant and talk to him then what if we dont learn anything new we go see stirling and walk the graveyard for him larry was looking at me like he wasnt sure he trusted me what are you up to dont you want to know why stirling had to have that mountain why the bouviers mountain and not someone elses larry looked at me youve been hanging around the police too long you dont trust anybody the cops didnt teach me that larry its natural talent i put the jeep in gear and off we went the trees made long thin shadows in the valleys between mountains the shadows formed pools of coming night we should have driven straight to the graveyard just walking the cemetery wouldnt hurt anything but if i couldnt go vampire hunting i could question magnus bouvier that part of my job nobody could chase me out of i didnt really want to go vampire hunting it was almost dark hunting vamps after dark was a good way to get killed especially one that could control minds like this one could a vampire can cloud your mind and even hurt you if its control is good enough and you wont mind but once its concentration is off you onto someone else and that person starts screaming youll wake up youll run but the boys hadnt run they hadnt woken up theyd just died if this thing wasnt stopped other people would die i could almost guarantee it freemont should have let me stay they needed a vampire expert with them on this one they needed me okay they really needed police with expertise in monsters but they didnt have that it had only been three years since addison v clark made vampires legally alive three years ago washington had made the bloodsuckers living citizens with rights nobody had thought what that meant for the police before the law changed preternatural crime was handled by bounty hunters vampire hunters those private citizens with enough experience to keep them alive most of us had some sort of preternatural power that helped give us an edge against the monsters most cops didnt ordinarily human beings didnt fare well against the monsters there have always been a few of us who had a talent for taking out the beasties weve done a good job but suddenly the cops are expected to take over no extra training no extra manpower nothing hell most police departments wouldnt even spring for the silver ammunition it had taken this long for washington dc to realize they might have been hasty that maybe just maybe the monsters were really monsters and the police needed some extra training it would take years to train the cops so they were going to shortcircuit the process just make cops out of all the vampire hunters and monster slayers for myself personally it might work i wouldve loved to have a badge to shove in freemonts face she couldnt have chased me off then not if it was federal but for most vampire hunters it was going to be a mess you needed more than preternatural expertise to work a homicide case you sure as hell needed more than vampire expertise to carry a badge there were no easy answers but out there in the coming darkness were a bunch of police hunting a vampire that could do things i never thought they could do if i had a badge i could be with them i wasnt an automatic safety zone but i knew a damn sight more than a state cop who had seen pictures of vampire victims freemont had never seen the real thing here was hoping she survived her first encounter bloody bones bar and grill lay up a red gravel road someone had butchered the trees back to either side so the jeep climbed upward towards a black blanket of sky sprinkled with a million stars the shine of stars was the only light in sight it is really dark out here larry said no streetlights i said shouldnt we see the lights from the restaurant by now i dont know i was staring at the broken trees the trunks gleamed white and ragged it had been done recently as if someone had gone mad with an axe or maybe a sword or something big had ripped off the trunks i slowed down scanning the darkness was i wrong was it trolls was there a greater ozark mountain troll left in these mountains one that would use a sword i was a big believer in a first time for everything i brought the jeep almost to a stop whats wrong larry asked i hit the emergency flashers the road was narrow barely two cars wide but it was going uphill anybody coming down wouldnt see the jeep right away the lights helped but if someone was speeding hell i was going to do it why quibble i put the jeep in park and got out where are you going im wondering if a troll ripped the trees apart larry started to get out on his side i stopped him slide over on my side if you want to get out why youre not armed i got the browning out it was a solid comforting weight but truthfully against something the size of one of the great mountain trolls it wasnt too useful maybe with exploding bullets but short of that a mm wasnt the gun for hunting something the size of a small elephant larry closed his door and slid across you really think theres a troll out here i stared off into the darkness nothing moved i dont know i moved to a dry gully that cut the edge of the road i stepped very carefully into it the heels sank in the dry sandy soil i grabbed a handful of weeds with my left hand and levered myself up the slope i had to grab one of the butchered trunks to keep from sliding backwards in the loose leaves and pine needles my hand came up against thick sap i fought the urge to jerk away forcing myself to keep hold of the sticky bark larry scrambled up the bank slicksoled dress shoes sliding in the dry leaves i didnt have a free hand to offer him he caught himself in a sort of half pushup and used the weeds to move up beside me damn dress shoes at least youre not in heels i said and dont think im not grateful he said id break my neck nothing moved in the dark dark night except us there was the sound of spring peepers close by musical but nothing bigger i let out a breath i hadnt realized i was holding i pulled myself up to more solid footing and looked at the trees what are we looking for larry asked an axe makes a wide smooth stroke if a troll snapped the trunks theyll be ragged and full of jagged points of wood looks smooth to me he said he ran his fingertips over the naked wood but it doesnt look like an axe the wood was too smooth an axe will come in at an angle this was almost flat like each tree had been felled with a single stroke two at most some of the trees had been nearly a foot in diameter no human could do that even with an axe who could have done this i searched the darkness fighting an urge to aim the gun into the dark but i kept it skyward safety first a vampire with a sword maybe he stared off into the darkness you mean the one that killed the guys why would the vampire chop down a bunch of trees after he killed them it was a good question a great question but like with so many questions today i didnt have a good answer i dont know lets get back to the car we scrambled back the way wed come neither of us fell down this time a record when we were at the car i put the gun away i probably hadnt needed it at all but then again something cut down those trees i used the aloe and lanolin baby wipes that i kept in the car to wipe off blood to wipe the sap from my hand the wipes worked nearly as well on tree blood as it did on human we drove on searching for lights we had to be close to bloody bones unless the directions were way off heres hoping they werent is that a torch larry asked i stared into the darkness there was a flicker of fire too high off the ground to be a campfire two torches on long poles illuminated a wide gravel turnaround to the left of the road the trees had been pushed back here too but years ago it was an old established clearing the trees formed a backdrop for a onestory building a wooden sign hung from the eaves it was hard to read by torchlight but it might have read bloody bones dark wooden shingles covered the roof and climbed down the walls so that the entire building looked like a natural growth that had sprung from the red clay soil about twenty cars and trucks were parked haphazardly on the dark gravel the sign swung in the wind the torchlight reflecting off the deeply carved words bloody bones was carved in smooth curving letters i walked carefully over the gravel in my high heels larrys dress shoes worked better on gravel than mine did bloody bones is a strange name for a bar and grill maybe they serve ribs i said he made a face at me i could not face barbecue anything right now it wouldnt be my first choice either the door swung inward directly into the bar the door swung shut and we were plunged into a fireshot twilight most bars are gloomy places to drink and hide a place of refuge from the noisy shiny world outside but as refuges went this was a good one there was a bar along one side of the room and a dozen small tables scattered on the dark polished wood floor there was a small stage to the left and a jukebox near the back wall where a small hallway probably led to bathrooms and the kitchen beyond every surface was dark wood and polished til it shone candles with chimney glass over them shone from the walls a chandelier with more chimney glass and candles hung from the low dark wood ceiling the wood was the darkest of mirrors glowing in the light rather than reflecting it the beams that supported the ceiling were carved with fruiting vines and stray leaves that looked like oaks every face was turned towards us like a bad western a lot of the faces were male the eyes slid over me saw larry and most went back to their drinks a few stayed hopeful but i ignored them it was too early in the night for anybody to be drunk enough to give me grief besides we were armed the women were grouped three deep at the bar they were dressed for a friday night if you planned to spend friday night on a street corner propositioning strangers they stared at larry like they wondered if hed be good to eat me they seemed to hate on sight if i knew any of them id have said they were jealous but im not the kind of woman to elicit jealousy on sight not tall enough not blonde enough not nordic enough not exotic enough im pretty but im not beautiful the women looked at me like they saw something i didnt it made me glance behind me to see if someone had come in behind us even though i knew no one had whats going on larry whispered that was another thing it was quiet id never been in a bar on a friday night that you could whisper in and be heard i dont know i said softly the women at the bar parted like someone had asked giving us a clear view of the bar there was a man behind the bar i thought what beautiful hair she had when i first saw him the hair fell to his waist like thick chestnutcolored water the candle flames gleamed in his hair the same way they shone in the polished wood of the bar he raised startling bluegreen eyes like deep sea water to us he was dark and lovely rather than handsome androgynous as a cat he was exotic as hell and i suddenly understood why the bar was three deep in women he sat an amberfilled glass down on a tiny napkin and said youre up earl his voice was surprisingly low like hed sing deep bass a man got up from the tables earl probably he was a large lumbering man formed of soft squares like a gentler version of boris karloffs monster not a cover boy he reached for his drink and his arm brushed the back of one of the women the woman turned angry i expected her to tell him to go to hell but the bartender touched her arm she was suddenly very still as if listening to voices i couldnt hear the air wavered i was suddenly very aware that earl smelled of soap and water his hair was still damp from the shower i could lick the water from his skin feel those big hands on my body i shook my head and stepped back into larry he caught my arm whats wrong i stared at him clutching his arm my fingers digging through the cloth of his suit until i could feel his arm solid under my hand i turned back to the bar earl and the woman had gone to sit at a table she was kissing the palm of his calloused hand jesus i said whats wrong anita larry asked i took a deep breath and stood away from him im okay it was just unexpected what was magic i stepped up to the bar those amazing eyes stared back at me but there was no power to them it wasnt like dealing with a vampire i could gaze into those beautiful eyes forever and they would still just be eyes sort of i placed my hands on the gleaming wood of the bar more vines and leaves curved around the edge of the heavy wood i ran my fingers over the deep set carvings handcarved all of it his fingertips caressed the wood like it was skin it was a proprietal touch the way some men touch their girlfriends when theyre into ownership i was betting that hed carved every inch of it a brunette in a dress two sizes smaller than it should have been touched his arm magnus you dont need a stranger magnus bouvier turned to the brunette he trailed those caressing fingertips down her arm she shivered he raised her hand gently from his arm pressing his lips to the back of her hand pick anyone you want darlin you are too beautiful to be denied tonight she wasnt beautiful her eyes were small and muddy brown her chin too sharp nose too large for a thin face i was staring right at her from not a foot away and her face smoothed her eyes were suddenly large and sparkling her thin lips full and moist it was like seeing her through one of those soft filters they used during the sixties except more i glanced at larry he looked like hed been hit by a truck a slim lovely truck i stared out over the bar and every other male in the place except earl was staring at the woman in exactly the same way as if shed just appeared before them like cinderella transformed by her fairy godmother not a bad analogy i turned back to magnus bouvier he was not staring at the woman he was staring at me i leaned into the bar meeting his gaze he smiled slightly i said love charms are illegal the smile widened youre much too pretty to be the police he reached out to touch my arm touch me and ill have you arrested for using undue preternatural influence its a misdemeanor he said not if youre not human it isnt i said he blinked at me i didnt know him well enough to be sure but i think i surprised him like i should have believed he was human yeah right lets talk at a table he said fine with me dorrie can you take over for a few minutes a woman came behind the bar she had the same thick chestnut hair but it was tied back from her face in a severe ponytail high and tight on her head the long shining tail of hair swung as she moved like it was alive her face free of hair and makeup was triangular exotic catlike her eyes were the same startling seawater green as magnuss the men nearest the bar watched her out of the corners of their eyes as if afraid to look directly at her larry stared at her openmouthed ill watch the bar but thats all she said she turned those eyes to larry and said what are you staring at her voice was harsh thick with scorn larry blinked closed his mouth and stuttered nnothing she glared at him like she knew he was lying i got an inkling why the men werent staring at her dorcas be nice to the customers she glared at magnus he smiled but he backed down magnus stepped out from behind the bar he was wearing a soft blue dress shirt untucked over jeans so faded they were almost white the shirt hit him at nearly midthigh hed had to roll the sleeves over his forearms black and silver cowboy boots completed the outfit everything but the boots looked borrowed he should have looked sloppy too casual among everyone else duded up for a friday night but he didnt his utter confidence made the outfit seem perfect a woman at one of the tables grabbed the hem of his shirt as he moved past he pulled it out of her hands with a playful smile magnus led us to a table near the empty stage he stood letting me choose my seat very gentlemanly of him i sat with my back to the wall so i could see both doors and the room it was sort of cowboyish but magic rode the air illegal magic larry sat to my right hed watched me and scooted his chair a little back from the table so he could see the room too it was almost frightening how seriously larry watched what i did it would keep him alive but it was like being followed around by a threeyearold with a carry permit kind of intimidating magnus smiled at us both indulgently like we were doing something cute or amusing i wasnt in the mood to be amusing love charms are illegal i said you said that already magnus said he flashed me a smile that i think was meant to be charming and harmless it wasnt there wasnt anything he could do to make himself less than exotic he sure as hell wasnt harmless i stared at him until the smile wilted around the edges and he swallowed he spread his longfingered hands on the tabletop staring at them when he looked up the smile was gone he looked solemn a little nervous even good its not a charm he said the hell it isnt i said it isnt a spell but nothing as mundane as a charm youre splitting hairs i said larry was staring at us intently was that stuff at the bar a love charm what stuff at the bar magnuss face was incredibly mild as if he thought larry would believe him larry looked at me is he kidding the woman went from a three to a twentythree it had to be magic magnus turned his attention to larry for the first time excluding meand i felt excluded it was like a ray of sunshine had moved away from me and i was just a little colder a little more in the dark i shook my head cut the glamor crap magnus turned back to me and for a minute i felt that warmth stop it what i stood up fine lets see how funny you think you are in jail magnus encircled my wrist with his hand his skin should have been workroughened but it wasnt his skin was unnaturally soft like living velvet of course that could have been illusionary too i tried to pull my hand away but his grip tightened i kept pulling and he kept tightening with that certainty of someone who knew that i couldnt get away he was wrong it wasnt just a matter of strength it was a matter of leverage i turned my wrist towards his fingers in a quick turning motion jerking at the same time his fingers slid over my skin trying to dig in but it was over my wrist felt rubbed raw where his finger had scraped along the skin it wasnt bleeding but it hurt anyway it would have felt better if i rubbed it but i wouldnt give him the satisfaction i was after all a toughasnails vampire slayer besides it would have ruined some of the effect and i liked the surprise on magnuss face most women dont pull away once ive touched them you use magic on me one more time and ill feed you to the cops he stared up at me a thoughtful look on his face he nodded you win no more magic on you or your friend or anyone else i said i sat back down carefully putting a little more distance between me and him i angled the chair just a little to one side so the grab for my gun would be smoother i didnt think id have to shoot him but my wrist was aching where hed squeezed i had arm wrestled with vampires and shapeshifters i knew preternatural strength when i felt it he had it he could have squeezed until my bones popped out of my skin but he hadnt squeezed fast enough he hadnt really wanted to hurt me his mistake oh my customers wouldnt like the magic going away he said you cant manipulate them like this it is illegal and i will turn you in for it but everyone knows that friday night is lovers night at bloody bones magnus said whats lovers night larry asked magnus smiled already regaining some of his easy charm but that flicker of warmth was gone he was being true to his word as far as i could tell even vampires couldnt work mind control on me without my knowing it that magnus could made me nervous i make everyone beautiful or handsome or sexy tonight for a few hours you can be the lover of your own dreams and someone elses though i wouldnt spend the night the glamor doesnt last that long what are you larry asked what looks like homo sapiens can breed with homo sapiens but isnt homo sapiens i asked larrys eyes widened homo arcanus hes a fairie please keep your voice down magnus said he glanced around at the near tables no one was playing much attention to us they were too busy gazing into each others magically enhanced eyes you cant be passing for human i said the bouviers have told the future and made love charms for centuries around here you said it wasnt a love charm i said they think it is but you know what it is glamor i said whats glamor larry asked its fairie magic its what allows them to cloud our minds make things seem better or worse than they are magnus nodded smiling as if pleased that i knew so much exactly its really a minor magic compared to some i shook my head ive read about glamor and it doesnt work this well unless youre high court daoine sidhe the seelie court of fairyland doesnt interbreed with mortals often at least not commoners the unseelie court on the other hand does he stared at me with his beautiful eyes looking even without glamor so gorgeous you wanted to touch him wanted to see if his hair was as luxuriant as it looked he was like a really fine sculpture you wanted to run your hands over it and feel the lines magnus smiled gently the unseelie court is evil cruel what i do here is not evil for one night these people can come here and be their own fantasies they think its love charms and i let them we all keep the secret of this small illegal act the local police know they even come down once in a while and join in but its not love charms no its natural talent on my part using my own homegrown magic isnt illegal if everyone knows im doing it so you pretend its love charms and everyone looks the other way because theyre having a good time but its really fairie glamor which isnt illegal with permission of the participants exactly he said which makes it all legal he nodded now if i was descended from the dark side of fairie would i do anything to bring pleasure to so many if it suited your needs yeah isnt there a ban on unseelie court moving to this country larry asked yeah i said not if my family moved here before the ban went into effect the bouviers have been here for nearly three hundred years not possible i said nobody but the indians have been here that long llyn bouvier was a french fur trapper he was the first european to set foot on this land he married into the local tribe christianized them bully for him so how come you didnt want to sell to raymond stirling he blinked at me it would disappoint me greatly to find out you are working for him sorry to disappoint you i said what are you he hadnt asked who hed asked what it was a very different question it sort of stopped me for a second im anita blake this is larry kirkland were animators i take it you dont draw cartoons he said it made me smile no we raise the dead animate from the latin to give life is that all you do he was staring at me very intently like there was something written on the inside of my skull and he was trying to read it it was an uncomfortable level of scrutiny but ive been stared at by the best i met his eyes and answered im a licensed vampire executioner he shook his head gently i didnt ask what you did for a living i asked what you were i frowned maybe i dont understand the question perhaps you dont but your friend asked what i was you said i was a fairie i ask you what you are and you describe your job it would be like me saying im a bartender i dont know how to answer you then i said he was still staring at me yes you do i can see a word in your eyes one word when he said it a word did come to mind necromancer im a necromancer magnus nodded does mr stirling know what you are i doubt hed understand even if i told him do you really have the ability to control all types of undead magnus asked can you really make a hundred shoes in a single night i asked magnus smiled wrong kind of fairie yeah i said if youre working for stirling why are you here i hope you didnt come here to try to persuade me to sell id hate to have to say no to such a lovely woman can the compliments magnus it wont get you anywhere what would get me somewhere i sighed ive got too many men on my plate now thats the gods honest truth larry muttered i frowned at him im not asking you out on a date im asking you into my bed i frowned at magnus no glared was a better word not in this lifetime sex between supernatural beings is always amazing anita im not a supernatural being now whos splitting hairs i didnt know what to say to that so i said nothing i rarely get in trouble with silence magnus smiled ive made you uncomfortable i am sorry but id never have forgiven myself if i hadnt asked its been a long time since i was with anyone who wasnt straight human let me buy you both drinks to make up for my rudeness i shook my head menus would be fine we havent eaten yet the meals will be on the house no i said why not because i dont particularly like you and i dont take favors from people i dont like he sat back in his chair a strange almost startled expression on his face you are direct you have no idea larry said i resisted the urge to kick larry under the table and said can we have some menus he raised a hand and called two menus dorrie dorrie brought them over im part owner of this place not your waitress magnus hurry it up dont forget that appointment ive got tonight dorrie his voice was mild she wasnt fooled you arent leaving me alone with these people i will not she glanced at us i dont approve of lovers night you know that ill take care of everybody before i leave you wont have to sully your morals she glared at all of us in turn youre leaving with them no he said she turned on her heel and stalked back to the bar the men who werent paired off watched her swaying back carefully not staring until she couldnt see them your sister doesnt approve of abusing glamor i asked dorrie doesnt approve of a lot of things she has morals implying i dont he said i shrugged you said it not me she always this judgmental he asked larry larry nodded usually lets just order our food i said larry smiled but he looked down at the menu it was a laminated piece of paper printed on both sides i ordered a cheeseburger well done house fries and a large coke i hadnt had caffeine in several hours i was running low larry was frowning at the menu i dont think i could eat a hamburger right now theyve got salads i said magnus laid his fingertips against the back of larrys hand something swims up behind your eyes something awful just behind your eyes larry stared at him i dont know what you mean i grabbed magnuss wrist and pulled him away from larry he turned his eyes to me but there was more than just their color to make them hard to stare at the pupil of his eyes had spiraled down like the eye of a bird human eyes just didnt do that i was suddenly very aware that i was still holding his wrist i drew my hand away stop reading us magnus you wore gloves or id be able to tell what youd touched he said its an ongoing police investigation anything you discern by psychic means must be held confidential or youre liable just as if you stole information out of our files do you always do that he asked what quote the law when youre nervous sometimes i said i saw blood thats all my gifts are rather limited in the area of farseeing you should shake dorries hand farseeing is her strong suit thanks but no thanks larry said he smiled you are not police or you wouldnt have threatened me with the police but you were with them earlier why i thought all you saw was blood i said he had the grace to look embarrassed nice to know he could be embarrassed a little bit more perhaps touch clairvoyance isnt a traditional fey power our manytimesgreatgrandmother was the daughter of a shaman so the story goes getting magic from both sides of the family tree i said dirty pool clairvoyance isnt magic larry said a really good clairvoyant will make you think it is i said i stared at magnus the last clairvoyant who had touched me and seen blood had been horrified he hadnt wanted to touch me again he hadnt wanted me anywhere near him magnus didnt look horrified and hed offered to have sex with me different strokes for different folks ill take your order through to the kitchen myself if youll just decide what you want he said larry stared at the menu a salad i guess no dressing he thought about it some more no tomatoes magnus started to stand why wont you sell to stirling i asked magnus cocked his head to one side smiling the land has been in our family for centuries its our land i looked at him and couldnt read his face it could have been the absolute truth or a boldfaced lie so the only reason you dont want to be a millionaire is because of what family tradition the smile deepened he leaned closer long hair spilling forward he whispered and it was quiet enough that he needed to whisper money is not everything anita though stirling seems to think it is his face was very close just barely far enough away for me not to complain i could smell his aftershave faint as if youd have to get very near his skin to smell it but it would be worth the effort what do you want magnus if its not money i stared at him from too close his long hair trailed over my hand i told you what i wanted even without the glamor be was trying to sweettalk me distract me what happened to the trees out by your road i didnt distract that easily he blinked long lashes something slid behind his eyes i happened you cut down those trees larry asked magnus turned to him and i was glad not to be staring at him from inches away sadly yes why i asked he straightened up suddenly businesslike i got drunk and went on a little rampage he shrugged embarrassing isnt it thats one word for it i said ill go get your food one naked salad coming up you remember what im getting i asked meat burned to death i remember you sound like a vegetarian oh no he said i eat all sorts of things he walked away through the crowd before i could decide if id been insulted or not just as well for the life of me i couldnt think of a good comeback line dorcas brought our food without a word she seemed angrymaybe not at us but with us or with everything i sympathized magnus went behind the bar spreading his own special brand of magic to his customers once more he glanced our way and smiled but didnt come back to finish our talk of course wed been finished i was all out of questions i took a bite of my cheeseburger it was almost crispy around the edges not a smidgen of pink in the center perfect whats wrong larry asked he was nibbling at a lettuce leaf i swallowed why should something be wrong youre frowning he said magnus didnt come back to the table so he answered all our questions maybe we just dont know the right questions to ask you suspect him of something now larry shook his head you have been hanging around with cops too long anita you think everyones up to something they usually are i took another bite of burger larry squinched his eyes tight whats wrong with you i asked theres juice coming out of your burger how can you eat that after what we just saw i guess this means you dont want me to put ketchup on my fries he looked at me with something near physical pain on his face how can you make jokes my beeper went off had they found the vampire i hit the button and dolphs number flashed at me now what its dolph eat hearty ill phone from the jeep and be back larry stood up with me he put a tip on the table and left his salad nearly untouched im done well im not have magnus pack my meal to go i left him staring forlornly down at my halfeaten burger youre not going to eat it in the car are you just have it packed up i went for the jeep and its fancy phone dolph answered on the third ring anita yeah dolph its me whats up vampire victim out near you shit another one what do you mean another one that stopped me freemont didnt call you after i talked to her yeah she said good things about you that surprises me she wasnt too friendly how not friendly she wouldnt let me hunt vampires with her tell me dolph said i told him dolph was quiet for a very long time after i finished you still there dolph im here i wish i wasnt whats going on dolph why would freemont call and tell you what a good job im doing but not ask for the squads help on something this big i bet she hasnt called the feds either dolph said whats going on dolph i think detective freemont is pulling a lone ranger on us the federal boys are going to want a piece of this the first vampire serial killer in recorded history freemont cant keep it to herself i know dolph said what are we going to do the body on the ground this time sounds like a straightforward vampire kill its classic bite marks no other damage to the body could it be a different vamp could be i said you sound doubtful two rogue vamps in this small a geographical area this far from a city doesnt seem likely the body wasnt cut up there is that i said how sure are you that the first killer is a vamp is there anything else it could be i opened my mouth to say no and closed it anybody who could cut down all those trees in one drunken brawl could certainly cut up people magnus had his glamor i wasnt sure it was capable of doing what id seen in the clearing but anita i might have an alternative what who i said i hated giving magnus up to the cops hed kept his secret so long but what if the question i should ask was had he killed five people id felt the strength in his hands i remembered the clean trunks of the trees cut by just one blow two at most i flashed on the murder scene the blood the naked bone i couldnt rule magnus out and i couldnt afford to be wrong i gave him up to dolph can you keep the part about him being fairie out of it for a while why because if he didnt do it then his life is ruined a lot of people have fey blood in them anita tell that to the college student last year whose fiance beat her to death when he found out he was about to marry a fairie he protested in court that he hadnt meant to kill her the fey were supposed to be hard to kill werent they not everyone is like that anita not everyone but enough ill try anita but i cant promise fair enough i said wheres the new victim monkeys eyebrow he said what thats the name of the town jesus monkeys eyebrow missouri let me guess its a small town big enough to have a sheriff and a murder sorry do you have directions i fished my small spiralbound notebook out of the pocket of the black jacket he gave me directions sheriff st john is holding the body for you he called us first since freemont wants to go it alone well let her youre not going to tell her no i dont suppose monkeys eyebrow has a crime scene unit dolph if we dont have freemont come in with her people were going to need somebody can you guys come down yet were still working our own murder but since sheriff st john called us in for his murder well be in the area as soon as we can get there not tonight but tomorrow freemonts supposed to send over crimescene photos from the first couple that was killed i bet if i asked she might send over photos from the second scene too showandtell tomorrow when you get here freemont may be suspicious about you asking for more pictures dolph said ill tell her i want them for comparison she may be trying to hog the case for herself but she wants it solved she just wants to solve it herself shes a glory hound dolph said looks that way i dont know if ill be able to keep freemont out of the second case or not but ill try to give you some lead time so you can look around without her breathing down your neck much appreciated she said you had your assistant with you at the crime scene had to be larry kirkland right right what are you doing bringing him to crime scenes hell have a degree in preternatural biology this spring hes an animator and a vampire slayer i cant be everywhere dolph if i think he can handle it i thought it might be nice to have two monster experts it might freemont said larry lost his lunch all over the crime scene he didnt throw up on the crime scene just near it there was a moment of silence better than throwing up on the body im never going to live that down am i no dolph said you arent great larry and i will get out there as soon as we can its about a thirtyminute drive maybe more ill tell sheriff st john youre on your way he hung up i hung up dolph was training me never to say goodbye over the phone larry slumped in the seat as far as the seat belt would let him his hands were clenched tight in his lap he stared out into the dark like he was seeing something besides the passing scenery images of butchered teenagers dancing in his head i bet they werent dancing in mine not yet i might see them in my dreams but not awake not yet how bad will this one be he asked his voice sounded quiet strained i dont know its a vampire victim could be neat just a couple of puncture wounds could be carnage carnage like the three boys dolph said no said its classic just bite marks so it wont be messy his voice was squeezed down to a near whisper wont know until we get there i said you couldnt just comfort me his voice sounded so small so uncertain that i almost offered to turn the jeep around he didnt have to see another murder scene it was my job but it wasnt his job not yet you dont ever have to see another murder scene larry he turned his head and looked at me what do you mean youve had your quota of blood and guts for one day i can turn around and drop you back at the hotel if i dont come tonight what happens next time if you arent cut out for this kind of work you arent cut out for it no shame in that what about next time he asked there wont be a next time you arent getting rid of me that easy he said i hoped the darkness hid the smile on my face i kept it small tell me about vampires anita i thought a vampire couldnt drink enough blood in one night to kill somebody pretty to think so i said they told us in college that a vampire couldnt drain a human being with one bite are you saying thats not true they cant drink a human dry with one bite in one night but they can drain one with one bite he frowned at me whats that supposed to mean they can pierce the flesh and drain the blood without drinking it how he asked just put the fangs in start the blood flow and let the blood fall down your body onto the ground but thats not taking blood for food thats just murder larry said and your point is i said hey isnt that our turnoff i caught a glimpse of the road sign damn i slowed down but couldnt see over the crest of the hill i didnt dare uturn until i was sure there were no cars coming the other way it was another half mile before we came to a gravel road there was a row of mailboxes beside the road trees grew so close to the road that even winterbare they covered the onelane road in shadows there was no place to turn around hell if a second car had come one of us would have had to back up the road rose up and up as if it were going to go straight into the sky at the crest of the hill i could see nothing in front of the car i had to simply trust that there was more road in front of us rather than some endless precipice jesus this is steep larry said i eased the jeep forward and the tires touched road my shoulders loosened just a little there was a house just up ahead the porch light was on like they were expecting company the bare light bulb was not kind the house was unpainted wood with a rusting tin roof its raised porch sagged under the weight of the front seat of a car that was sitting by the screen door i turned around in the dirt in front of the house that passed for a front yard it looked like we werent the first car to do it there were deep wheel ruts in the powderdry dirt from years of cars turning in and out by the time we got down to the end of the road the darkness was pure as velvet i hit the jeeps high beams but it was like driving in a tunnel the world existed only in the light everything else was blackness id give a lot for a few streetlights right now larry said me too help me spot our road i dont want to drive past it twice he leaned forward in his seat straining against the shoulder belt there he pointed as he spoke i slowed and turned carefully onto the road the headlights filled the tunnel of trees this road was just bare red earth the dirt rose in a mist around the jeep for once i was glad of the drought mud would have been a real bitch on a dirt road the road was wide enough that if you had nerves of steel or were driving someone elses car you could drive two cars abreast a stream cut across the road with a ditch at least fifteen feet deep the bridge was nothing but planks laid across some beams no rails no nothing as the jeep crept over the bridge the planks rattled and moved they werent nailed in god larry was staring at the drop his face pressed against the tinted glass this bridge isnt much wider than the car thanks for telling me larry id have never noticed on my own sorry past the bridge the road was still wide enough for two cars i guess if two cars met at the bridge they took turns there was probably some traffic law to cover it first car on the left gets to go first maybe at the crest of the hill lights showed in the distance police lights strobed the darkness like muticolored lightning they were farther away than they looked we had two more hills to go up and down before the lights reflected off the bare trees making them look black and unreal the road spilled into a wide clearing a lawn spread up from the road surrounding a large white house it was a real house with siding and shutters and a wraparound porch it was twostoried and edged with neatly trimmed shrubs the driveway was white gravel which meant someone had shipped it in narcissus edged the driveway in two thick stripes a uniformed policeman stopped us in the foot of the sloping drive he was tall big through the shoulders and had dark hair he shined a flashlight into the car im sorry miss but you cant go up there right now i flashed my id at him and said im anita blake im with the regional preternatural investigation team i was told sheriff st john is expecting me he leaned into the open window and flashed his light at larry whos this larry kirkland hes with me he stared at larry for a few seconds larry smiled doing his best to look harmless hes almost as good at it as i am i had a good view of the cops gun as he leaned into the window it was a colt big gun but he had the hands for it i caught a whiff of his aftershave brut hed leaned too far into the window to look at larry if id had a gun hidden in my lap i could have fed it to him he was big and i bet sheer size saw him through a lot but it was careless guns dont care how big you are he nodded and pulled out of the car go on up to the house sheriffs expecting you he didnt sound particularly happy about that you got a problem i asked he gave a smile but it was sour he shook his head its our case i dont think we need any help that includes you you got a name i asked coltrain deputy zack coltrain well deputy coltrain well see you up at the house i guess you will miss blake he thought i was a cop and deliberately didnt call me officer or detective i let it go if i really had a professional title id have demanded it but getting into an argument because he wouldnt call me detective when i wasnt one seemed counterproductive i drove up and parked between the police cars i clipped my id to my lapel we walked up the pale curve of sidewalk and no one stopped us we stood outside the door in a silence that was almost eerie id been to a lot of murder scenes one thing they werent was silent there was no static crackle of police radios no men milling around murder scenes were always thick with people plainclothes detectives uniforms crime scene techs people taking photographs video the ambulance waiting to take the body away we stood on the freshly swept porch in the cool spring night with the only sounds the calls of frogs the highpitched peeping sound played oddly with the swirling police lights are we waiting for something larry asked no i said i rang the glowing doorbell the sound gave a rich bong deep within the house a small dog barked furiously somewhere deep in the house the door opened a woman stood framed in the light from the hall placing most of her in shadow the police lights strobed across her face painting in neon crayola flashes she was about my height with dark hair that was either naturally curly or had a really good perm but shed done more with it than i did and it framed her face neatly mine always looked sort of unruly she was wearing a buttondown shirt with long sleeves untucked over jeans she looked about seventeen but i wasnt fooled i looked young for my age too heck so did larry it cant just be being short can it you arent the state police she said she seemed very sure of that im with the regional preternatural investigation team i said anita blake this is my colleague larry kirkland larry smiled and nodded the woman moved back out of the door and the light from the hallway fell full on her face it added five years to her age but they were a good five years it took me a minute to realize she was wearing very understated makeup please come in miss blake my husband david is waiting with the body she shook her head its awful she peered out into the colored darkness before she closed the door david told him to turn off those lights we dont want everyone for miles to know whats happened whats your name i asked she blushed slightly im sorry im not usually this scattered im beth st john my husband is the sheriff ive been sitting with the parents she made a small motion towards a set of double doors to the left of the main entrance the dog was still barking behind those doors like a small furry machine gun a mans voice said quiet raven the barking stopped we were standing in an entryway that had a ceiling that soared up to the roof as if the architect had cut a piece out of the room above us to create the sweeping space a crystal chandelier sparkled light down on us the light cut a rectangle out of the darkened room to our right there was a glimpse of a cherrywood dining room set so polished it gleamed the hallway cut straight back to a distant door that probably led to the kitchen stairs ran along the wall with the double doors the bannister and door edges were white the carpet was pale blue the wallpaper white with tiny blue flowers and tinier leaves it was open and airy bright and welcoming and utterly quiet if we could have found a piece of uncarpeted floor we would have dropped a pin and listened to it bounce beth st john led us up the blueandwhite stairway in the center of the hallway on the righthand side was a series of family portraits they began with a smiling couple smiling couple and smiling baby smiling couple and one smiling baby one crying baby i walked down the hallway watching the years pass by the babies became children a girl and a boy a miniature black poodle appeared in the pictures the girl was the oldest but only by about a year the parents grew older but didnt seem to mind the parents and the girl smiled sometimes the boy did sometimes he didnt the boy smiled more on the other wall where the camera had caught him tanned with a fish or with hair slicked back from just coming out of the pool the girl smiled everywhere you looked i wondered which of them was dead there was a window at the end of the hallway the white drapes framed it no one had bothered to draw them the window looked like a black mirror the darkness pressed against the glass like it had weight beth st john knocked on the last door to the right next to that pressing darkness david the detectives are here i let that slide the sin of omission is a manysplendored thing i heard movement in the room but she stepped back before the door could open beth st john backed up into the middle of the hallway so there would be no chance of her seeing inside the room her eyes flicked from one picture to another catching glimpses of smiling faces she put a slender hand to her chest as if she was having trouble breathing im going to go make coffee do you want some her voice was strained around the edges sure i said sounds good larry said she gave a weak smile and marched down the hallway she did not run which got her a lot of brownie points in my book i was betting it was beth st johns first murder scene the door opened david st john was wearing a pale blue uniform that matched the one his deputy wore but there the resemblance ended he was about fivefootten thin without being skinny like a marathon runner his hair was a paler browner version of larrys red you noticed his glasses before you noticed his eyes but the eyes were worth noticing a perfect pale green like a cats except for the eyes it was a very ordinary face but it was one of those faces you wouldnt grow tired of he offered me his hand i took it he barely touched my hand as if afraid to squeeze a lot of men did that but at least he offered to shake hands most dont bother im sheriff st john you must be anita blake sergeant storr told me youd be coming he glanced at larry whos this larry kirkland st johns eyes narrowed he stepped fully into the hallway closing the door behind him sergeant storr didnt mention anyone else can i see some id i unclipped my badge id he looked at it and shook his head youre not a detective no im not i was mentally cursing dolph id known it wouldnt work how about him he jerked his chin at larry all i have on me is a drivers license larry said who are you the sheriff asked i am anita blake i am part of the spook squad i just dont happen to have a badge larry is a trainee i fished my new vampire executioners license out of my jacket pocket it looked like a glorified drivers license but it was the best i had he peered at the license youre a vampire hunter its a little early for you to be called in i dont know who did it yet im attached to sergeant storrs squad i come in at the start of a case instead of the end it tends to keep the body count down that way he handed back the license i didnt think brewsters law had gone into effect brewster was the senator whose daughter got eaten it hasnt ive been working with the police for a long time how long nearly three years he smiled longer than ive been sheriff he nodded almost as if hed answered a question for himself sergeant storr said if anybody could help me solve this it was you if the head of rpit has that much confidence in you im not going to refuse the help weve never had a vampire kill out here ever vampires tend to stay near cities i said they can hide their victims better that way well no one tried to hide this one he pushed the door open and made a little arm gesture ushering us in the wallpaper was all pink roses big oldfashioned cabbage roses there was an honesttogod vanity with a raised mirror and everything that looked like it might be an antique but everything else was white wicker and pink lace it looked like the room for a much younger girl the girl lay on the narrow bed the bedspread matched the wallpaper the sheets twisted up underneath her body were jellybean pink her head lay on the edge of the pillows as if it had slipped to one side after she was laid on them the pink curtains fanned against the open window a cool breeze crawled through the room ruffling her thick black hair it had been curled and styled with hair gel there was a small red stain under her face and neck where the sheets had soaked up some blood i was betting there was a bite mark on that side of the neck she wore makeup not nearly as well applied as beth st johns but the attempt had been made the lipstick was badly smeared one arm hung off into space the hand halfcupped as if reaching for something the nails were shiny with fresh red nail polish her long legs were spreadeagled on the bed there were two fang marks high on her inner thighnot fresh though her toenails were painted to match her fingers she was still almost wearing the black teddy shed started the night in the straps had been pushed down her shoulders exposing small wellformed breasts the crotch had been ripped out or was one of the ones that snapped open because the bottom was pushed up nearly to her waist until the teddy was little more than a belt with her legs spread wide she was completely exposed that more than anything pissed me off he could have at least covered her up not left her like some whore it was arrogant and cruel larry was standing across the room at the other window it was open too spilling cool air into the room have you touched anything st john shook his head have you taken any photos no i took a deep breath reminding myself that i was a guest here and had no official status i could not afford to piss him off what have you done called you and the state cops i nodded how long ago did you find the body he checked his watch an hour ago how did you get here so fast i wasnt ten miles away i said lucky for me he said i looked at the girls body yeah larry was hugging the windowsill gripping it with his hands larry why dont you run down to the jeep and get some gloves out of my bag gloves ive got a box of surgical gloves in with my animating stuff bring the box he swallowed hard and nodded every freckle stood out on his face like ink spots he moved very quickly to the door and shut it behind him i had two sets of gloves in my jacket pocket but larry needed air this his first murder second i said how old is the girl seventeen he said then its murder even if she consented consented what are you talking about there was the very first hint of anger in his voice what do you think happened here sheriff a vampire climbed in her window while she was getting ready for bed and killed her wheres all the blood theres more blood under her neck you cant see the mark but thats where he drained her thats not enough blood to kill her he drank the rest he sounded a little outraged i shook my head no single vampire can consume the entire blood supply of an adult human in one sitting then there was more than one he said you mean the bites on her thighs yeah yeah he paced the pink shag carpet in quick nervous strides those marks are at least a couple of days old i said so he hypnotized her twice before but this time he killed her its awfully early for a teenager to be going to bed her mother said she wasnt feeling well that i believed even if you want it to happen that much blood loss can take the sparkle out of your step she fixed her hair and makeup before she went to bed i said so did you know this girl yes hell yes this is a small town miss blake we all know each other she was a good kid never in any trouble you never found her parked with a boy or out drinking she was a good girl i believe she was a good girl sheriff st john being murdered doesnt make you a bad person he nodded but his eyes were sort of wild too much white showing i wanted to ask how many murders hed seen but didnt whether this was his first or his twentyfirst he was sheriff what do you think happened here sheriff id asked the question once but i was willing to try it again a vampire raped and killed ellie quinlan thats what happened here he said it almost defiantly like he didnt believe it either this wasnt rape sheriff ellie quinlan invited her killer into this room he paced to the far window and stood like larry had staring out into the darkness he wrapped his arms around himself like he was hugging himself how am i going to tell her parents her kid brother that she let some thing make love to her that shed been letting it feed off her how can i tell them that well in three nights two counting tonight ellie can rise from the dead and tell them herself he turned back to me his face pale with shock he shook his head slowly they want her staked what they want her staked they dont want her to rise as a vampire i stared down at the stillwarm body i shook my head shell rise in two more nights the family doesnt want it if she was a vampire it would be murder to stake her just because her family doesnt want her to be one but shes not a vampire yet st john said shes a corpse the coroner will have to certify death before she can be staked that can take a little time he shook his head i know doc campbell hell speed it along for us i stood there staring down at the girl she didnt plan to die sheriff this isnt a suicide shes planning on coming back you cant know that i stared at him i do know that and so do you if we stake her before she can rise from the dead its murder not according to the law i am not going to take out the head and heart of a seventeenyearold girl just because her parents dont like the lifestyle shes chosen shes dead miss blake its ms blake and i know shes dead i know what shell become probably better than you do then you understand why they want it done i looked at him i did understand there was a time when i could have done it and felt good about it felt like i was helping the family freeing her soul now i just wasnt sure anymore let her parents think about it for twentyfour hours trust me on this theyre horrified right now and griefstricken are they really in a position to decide what happens to her theyre her parents yeah and two days from now would they rather have her on her feet talking to them or dead in a box shell be a monster he said maybe probably but i think we should hold off for just a little while until theyve had some time i think the immediate problem is the bloodsucker that did this i agree we find him and kill him we cant kill him without a court order of execution i said i know the local judge i can get you a court order i bet you can whats the matter with you dont you want to kill him i looked at the girl if hed really wanted her to rise as a vampire hed have taken the body with him hed have hidden her until she rose to keep her safe from people like me if he cared for her yeah ill kill him for you alright what can we do well first the killing took place just after dark so his daytime resting place had to be very near here are there any old houses caves some place where you could hide a coffin theres an old homestead about a mile from here and i know theres a cave down along the stream i used to go there when i was little we all did heres the deal sheriff if we go out into the dark after him now hell probably kill some of us but if we dont try it tonight hell move his coffin we might not find him again well look for him tonight now how long have you and your wife been married i asked five years why you love her yes we were high school sweethearts what kind of question is that if you go out after the vampire you may never see her again if youve never hunted one out there at night in its own territory you dont know what were up against and nothing i can tell you will prepare you for it but think about never seeing beth again never holding her hand never hearing her voice we can go out in the morning the vampire may not move its coffin tonight or it might move from the cave to the homestead or vice versa we might catch it tomorrow without risking anybodys life do you think it wont move tonight i took a deep breath and wanted to lie god knows i wanted to lie no i think itll leave the immediate area tonight thats probably why he came just after full dark it gives him all night to run then we go after him i nodded okay but we have to have some ground rules here im in charge ive done this before and im still alive that makes me an expert if you do everything i say maybe just maybe we can all live until morning except for the vampire st john said yeah sure it had been a long time since i had gone up against a vampire at night in the open my vampire kit was at home in my closet it was illegal to carry it with me without a specific court order of execution i had the cross i was wearing the two handguns the two knives and that was it no holy water no extra crosses no shotgun hell no stake and mallet do you have silver bullets i can get some do it and find me a shotgun and silver ammo for that too is there a catholic or episcopalian church around here of course he said we need some holy water and holy wafer the host i know you can throw the holy water on the vampire but i didnt know you could throw the host i had to smile they arent like little holy grenades i want the host to give to the quinlans so they can put one at every windowsill every doorsill you think itll come for them no but the girl invited it in only she can revoke the invitation and shes dead until we get the bastard better safe than sorry he hesitated then nodded ill go to the church ill see what i can do he went for the door and sheriff he stopped and turned to me i want that court order in my hands before we leave im not going to be up on murder charges he nodded sort of nervously head bobbing like one of those dogs you see in the backs of cars youll have it ms blake he left closing the door behind him i was left alone with the dead girl she lay there pale and unmoving growing colder deader if her parents had their way it would be permanent and it would be my job to make it happen there were schoolbooks scattered beside the bed as if she had been studying in bed before he came i pushed one of the book covers closed with my toe careful not to rearrange it calculus shed been studying calculus before she put on her makeup and black teddy shit while we waited for the court order i talked to the family not my favorite thing to do but necessary this hadnt been a random attack which meant they probably knew the vampire or had known him before he died the living room continued the pastel theme blue predominating beth st john had made coffee shed shanghaied larry into carrying up a tray i guess she didnt want to see the body again couldnt say i blamed her id seen bloodier murder scenes a lot bloodier but each death has its own peculiar poignancy there was something very piteous about ellie quinlan stretched across her pink candy sheets and i hadnt known her beth st john had made it hard the family sat huddled on the white sofa the man was broad not fat but square like a linebacker he had short black hair that was going nicely grey at the sideburns very distinguished his complexion was ruddy not tanned but colorful just the same he was dressed in a white dress shirt unbuttoned at the neck but sleeves still sporting their cufflinks his face was very tight immobile like a mask as if underneath something entirely different was going on he looked calm composed but the effort thrummed along his skin anger glittered in his dark eyes his arm was around his wifes shoulders she leaned into him crying softly eyes closed as if that would make it better her eye makeup had smeared in long multicolored streaks like an oil slick down her cheeks she had thick black hair done in some short complicated style that looked too stiff to touch she wore a longsleeved buttondown blouse with a delicate flower pattern on it pink predominating her slacks were a matching pink her feet were bare except for dark hose a delicate gold cross and wedding rings were her only jewelry the boy was only about my height and slender as a willow he hadnt hit his growth spurt yet and it made him look younger than he was his face had that soft perfect skin that said hed never had a pimple and shaving was a distant dream if the girl was seventeen he had to be at least fifteen maybe sixteen he could have passed for twelve a perfect victim except for his eyes and the way he held himself even in the midst of grief with the lines of tears drying on his face he looked sure of himself selfpossessed his eyes held a quick intelligence and a rage that would hold the bullies at bay his hair was the perfect black of his fathers but it was baby fine probably the natural texture of mrs quinlans before she styled it to death a little black poodle was in his lap it had barked like a machine gun ratatattat yipyipyip until hed picked it up and held it a soft growl tickled out of its curly jaws hush raven the boy said he petted the dog as he said it thus rewarding the growling the dog growled again he petted it again i decided to ignore it if the poodle got loose i figured i could take it i was armed mr and mrs quinlan my names anita blake i need to ask you a few questions have you staked the body yet the man asked no mr quinlan the sheriff and i agreed to wait twentyfour hours her immortal soul is in jeopardy we want it done now if you still want it done tomorrow night ill do it we want it done now he was holding his wife very tight fingers digging into her shoulder she opened her eyes and blinked at him jeffrey please youre hurting me he swallowed hard and loosened his grip im sorry sally im sorry the apology seemed to take some of the anger out of him the lines in his face softened he shook his head we must save her soul her life is gone but her soul remains we must save that at least there had been a time when i believed that too down to my toes i thought all vampires were evil now i wasnt so sure i knew too many of them who didnt seem that bad i knew evil when i felt it and that wasnt what they were i didnt know what they were but were they damned according to the catholic church yes they were and so was the girl upstairs but then according to the church so was i id become episcopalian when the church declared all animators excommunicates are you catholic mr quinlan yes what difference does that make i was raised catholic so i understand your beliefs they are not beliefs miss what is your name blake anita blake they are not beliefs miss blake they are facts ellies immortal soul is in danger of eternal damnation we must help her do you understand what youre asking me to do i asked to save her i shook my head mrs quinlan was looking at me her eyes were very intent i was betting i could cause a little family disagreement i will put a stake through her heart and chop off her head i left the fact out that most of my executions were done with a shotgun now at close range it was messy and you needed a closed coffin but it was a lot easier on me and a quicker death for the vampire mrs quinlan started to cry again huddling against her husband she buried her face against him smearing makeup on his clean white shirt are you trying to upset my wife no sir but i want you all to realize that two nights from now ellie will rise as a vampire shell walk and talk eventually shell be able to be around you if i stake her all shell be is dead she is already dead we want you to do your job he said mrs quinlan wouldnt look at me either she believed as strongly as her hubby or she wouldnt fight him not even for her daughters continued existence i let it go i could stall for twentyfour hours i doubted that mr quinlan was going to change his mind i had hopes for mrs quinlan does the poodle always bark at strangers they all three blinked at me like rabbits caught in headlights the change of subject was too abrupt for their grief what has that got to do with anything he asked there is a murderous vampire out there somewhere im going to catch him but i need your help so please just answer my questions as best you can what does the dog have to do with it i sighed and sipped my coffee he had just found his daughter dead murdered raped im sure hed told himself the horror of it cut him some slack but he was beginning to use it up the poodle barked its head off when i came to the door does it bark every time a stranger comes to the house the boy saw what i was getting at yeah raven always barks at strangers i ignored his parents and talked to the most reasonable person in the room whats your name jeff he said god jeffrey junior of course how many times would i have to come to the house before raven stopped barking at me he thought about that rolling his lower lip under really thinking about it mrs quinlan sat up a little apart from her husband raven always barks when someone comes to the door even if she knows you did she bark tonight the parents frowned at me jeff said yeah she barked like crazy until ellie let her in her room just after dark ellie let her in then a few minutes later raven came back downstairs howd you find the body raven started barking again and wouldnt stop ellie didnt let her in ellie always lets her in i mean im not allowed in her room but raven gets to go in even when ellie wants her privacy he made that last word sound like he usually said it with a lot of eyerolling i knocked at the door and she didnt answer raven was scratching at the door it was locked she locked her door a lot but she wouldnt answer a tear escaped from his wide eyes i went and got dad you unlocked the door mr quinlan he nodded yes and she was just lying there i couldnt bear to touch her shes unclean now i he was choking on tears trying so hard not to cry that his face was turning purple jeff came and put his arm around his dad leaning against his mother the poodle still gripped in his other arm the dog whined softly licked the makeup from mrs quinlans face the woman looked up and gave a choked laugh petting the curly fur i wanted to leave i wanted to let them huddle together and grieve hell the death was so fresh they hadnt gotten to grieving yet they were still in shock but i couldnt leave sheriff st john would be back with the warrant and i needed as much information as i could get before we braved the darkness larry was sitting in the corner in a pale blue chair he was being so quiet youd almost forget he was there but his eyes were eager noticing everything filing it all away when i first realized he damn near memorized everything i said and did it was intimidating now i counted on it beth st john came into the room with a tray of sandwiches coffee and soft drinks i didnt remember anybody asking for them but i think beth was needing something to do besides sit here and watch the quinlans cry me too she set the tray on the coffee table between the couch and the love seat the quinlans ignored it i took a fresh mug of coffee grilling grieving families always goes down better with caffeine the group huddle broke up the poodle was transferred to the wifes arms and the two men sat on either side of her jeffrey and jeff looked at me with identical eyes it was almost eerie genetics at work the vampire had to be in the room with ellie when she let the dog in at full dark i said my daughter would not have let in her murderer if she was eighteen mr quinlan it wouldnt be murder being made a vampire against your will is still murder miss blake i was getting tired of everyone calling me miss but the grieving father could do it a few more times i believe your daughter knew the vampire i believe she let him in willingly you are crazy beth go get the sheriff i want this woman out of my house beth stood up uncertainly davids gone to get some things jeffrey i deputy coltrains upstairs with the body but then get him down here beth looked at me then back to him she gripped her small hands together almost wringing them jeffrey shes a licensed vampire hunter shes done this a lot listen to her he stood up my daughter was raped and murdered by some soulless bloodsucking animal and i want this woman out of my house now if he hadnt been crying at the same time id have been pissed beth looked at me she was willing to stand up to him if i needed her to mucho points for her has anyone you know vanished or died recently i asked quinlan squinted at me he looked confused the change of subject again was just too abrupt i was hoping i could distract him from throwing me out long enough to learn something what has anyone you know gone missing or died recently he shook his head no andys missing jeff said quinlan shook his head again that boy is no concern of ours whos andy i asked ellies boyfriend he is not her boyfriend quinlan said i caught jeffs gaze the look said it all andy had been a boyfriend and dear old dad hadnt liked him one little bit why didnt you like andy mr quinlan he was a criminal i raised my eyebrows in what way he was arrested for drug abuse he smoked some pot jeff said i was beginning to wish i could just go off and talk with jeff he seemed to know what was going on and wasnt trying to hide it trick was how to manage it he was a corrupting influence on my daughter and i put a stop to it and hes missing i asked yes jeff said i will answer miss blakes questions jeff i am the man of the house jesus man of the house hadnt heard that in a while id like to see the rest of the house in case the vampire entered somewhere other than her room if jeff could show me the doors id appreciate it i can show you around miss blake quinlan said im sure your wife needs you right now mr quinlan jeff can show me around but only you can comfort your wife mrs quinlan looked up at him then at me as if she wasnt sure she wanted to be comforted but i knew the image would appeal to him he nodded perhaps youre right he touched his wifes shoulder sally needs me right now sally cooperated with fresh crying using the poodle as a sort of impromptu handkerchief the poodle squirmed and whined quinlan sat down and took his wife in his arms the dog squirmed free and trotted over to jeff i stood larry stood i moved toward the door and looked back at the boy jeff stood and the poodle trotted at his side i opened the doors and ushered us all outside raven the poodle eyed me suspiciously but she came along i caught a last glimpse of beth st john gazing at the door as if she wanted to go with us but she sat down beside the unwanted sandwiches and the cooling coffee she sat like a good soldier she would not abandon her post i closed the door feeling cowardly i was glad it wasnt my job to hold the quinlans hands facing the vampire even in the dark didnt seem so bad by comparison of course i was still safe inside the house out there in the dark with the vampire i might feel different we stood out in the entryway the air felt cooler out here easier to breathe had to be my imagination the poodle was sniffing at my foot she gave a low growl and jeff picked her up tucking her under one arm in a familiar gesture like hed done it a hundred times before you dont really want to see the doors do you he asked no i said dads all right hes just he shrugged hes just right and everyone else is wrong he doesnt mean anything by it i know hes scared right now too that makes everyone bitchy jeff grinned i wasnt sure if it was the scared comment or the word bitchy probably didnt hear many people saying either about his dad how serious were andy and your sister he glanced at the closed doors and lowered his voice just a little dadll say not very but they were serious real serious he glanced at the door again we can go somewhere else to talk i said your choice of rooms he looked at me youre really a vampire hunter if the circumstances had been different he would have been enjoying himself its hard not to think its cool to put stakes through peoples chests yeah and we raise zombies too both of you he sounded surprised im a fullfledged animator larry said jeff shook his head we can talk in my room he led the way up the stairs we followed if id been a cop questioning a juvenile without a guardian or lawyer present would have been illegal but i wasnt a cop and he wasnt a suspect just gathering information folks just grilling a sixteenyearold boy about his sisters sex life murder investigations are never pleasant and some of that unpleasantness has nothing to do with the corpse jeff hesitated at the head of the stairs peering down the hallway deputy coltrain was standing outside ellies room back stiff hands behind his back alert for intruders the door was open too hard to stand in the room with the body i guess he saw jeff and closed the door still standing in front of it nice of coltrain to make sure jeff didnt see the body but standing outside the closed door was not the best idea a vampire if it was old enough could have come in the room behind him and opened the door before he could have drawn his gun the undead make no noise i debated on whether to tell him that i let it go if the vamp had meant to take out more people it could have he could have taken out the entire family instead when the dog barked he panicked and ran this was not an ancient bloodsucker this was someone who was new at the job i was betting on the boyfriend andy but id keep an open mind andy might have just driven to california to find fame and fortune but i doubted it jeff opened the door near the head of the stairs and went in his room was smaller than his sisters being firstborn does have its advantages the wallpaper was tan with cowboys and indians on it the bed had a matching spread it was the room of a much younger person just like his sisters the walls were bare no pinups no sports figures there was a desk stacked high with books a small pile of clothes lay near the closet door raven the poodle sniffed the clothes jeff shooed her away and kicked the clothes into the closet and closed the door sit down anywhere you can he pulled the desk chair out a little then stood near the window not sure what to do i doubted he had many adults up to his room for a talk parents didnt count though frankly i couldnt imagine either of the quinlans coming in for a quiet chat i took the chair i figured jeff would feel more comfortable lounging on his bed with larry than with me besides i wasnt used to wearing skirts this short yet and every once in a while i forgot the chair seemed safer larry sat down on the bed with his back pressed against the wall jeff sat down next to him propping some of the pillows into the corner for a back rest raven jumped up on the bed circled his lap twice and lay down cozy how hot an item were andy and your sister no prelims off with the clothes he glanced at both of us larry gave him an encouraging smile he shifted more securely against his mound of pillows and said pretty hot i mean they hung all over each other at school embarrassing i said yeah i mean she was my sister shes only a year older than me and theres this guy pawing her he shook his head he rubbed the poodles ears hands moving down her small curly body he petted her like it was habit a comfort measure did you like andy he shrugged he was older and sort of cool but no i thought ellie could have done better how so he did smoke pot and didnt have any plans for college andy wasnt going anywhere it was like the fact that he loved my sister was everything like theyd live on love or something stupid like that i agreed that that was stupid when your dad put a stop to it did it stop he grinned at me no they just started sneaking around i think if anything telling ellie she couldnt see him made it worse it usually does i said when did andy disappear about two weeks ago his car went missing too so everybody thought hed run off but he wouldnt have left ellie behind he was sort of creepy but he wouldnt have left her was ellie upset at being left behind he frowned hugging the dog against his chest raven licked his chin with her small pink tongue that was the weird part i mean i know she had to pretend not to care in front of mom and dad but even at school or out with our friends she didnt seem to care i was kinda glad i mean andy was a loser but it was like she didnt believe he was gone or knew something the rest of us didnt i thought hed just gone off to find like an outoftown job and was going to send for her maybe he did i said the frown deepened between his smooth unblemished brows what do you mean i think andy may be the vampire that did your sister a look of disgust crumbled his face even further i dont believe that andy loved ellie he wouldnt kill her if hes a vampire jeff he wouldnt think turning her into the undead is killing her hed probably think of it as bringing her over jeff shook his head raven wiggled out of his grasp as if he was squeezing too hard she hopped off his lap and lay down on the covers andy wouldnt hurt ellie doesnt it hurt to die probably i said the bushes underneath her end window are all crushed larry said i looked at him say again he smiled pleased with himself i took a look around outside thats what took me so long when you sent me out for gloves that you didnt need the bushes under the end window to the girls room are all smashed like something heavy fell on them i had a moment to visualize larry out in the dark all alone unarmed except for his cross the thought made my skin cold i opened my mouth to yell at him and closed it never dress anyone down in public unless its an object lesson i said any tracks i gave myself a dozen brownie points for not yelling do i look like tonto besides the ground is just grass and its been so dry lately i dont think thered be any tracks he frowned at me can you track vampires not normally but if this one is as new as i think he is then maybe i nodded yeah i stood up ive got to go ask the deputy something thank you for your help jeff i offered him my hand to shake he took it his handshake was a little uncertain as if he wasnt used to it i went for the door and larry followed you will find him and kill him even if its andy jeff asked i turned back and looked at him his dark eyes were still intelligent still full of purpose but there was also a little boy needing reassurance yeah well find him and kill him and kill him i said good he said good i wasnt sure if good was the word i would have chosen but it wasnt my sister lying dead in the other room you got a cross i asked he frowned but said yeah you wearing it he shook his head get it and wear it until we catch him okay you think hell come back fear glittered at the edge of his eyes no but you never know jeff just humor me he got up and went to his bureau there was a line of glittering chain on one corner of the mirror when he picked it up a tiny gold cross dangled from it i watched him put it on the dog watched it all with anxious eyes i smiled well see you later he nodded fingering the cross scared now underneath the shock we left him in the tender care of raven you really think the vamp will come back to the house larry asked no i said but just in case your little visit out into the dark gives him ideas i want jeff to at least have a cross on heh he said i found a clue deputy coltrain was watching us but we were running out of privacy i kept my voice down and hoped that was enough yeah and you went out alone unarmed in the dark with a vampire that had already killed once on the loose you said it was a really new vampire not before you went out after the gloves maybe i figured out that it was a new one all on my own he said he was looking stubborn like far from taking my warning to heart he just might do it again new vampires can still kill you larry with a cross on he had a point very few of the new dead could get past the pain of a cross or play enough head games to get you to take it off voluntarily fine larry but wheres the vampire that made him that one may be a couple of centuries old and its out in the dark too he went a little pale around the edges i never thought of that i did he gave a shrug and had the grace to look embarrassed thats why youre the boss thats right i said all right all right i promise to be good great now lets go ask deputy coltrain if he knows anyone who could track our vampire can you really track a vampire like that i dont know but with one less than two weeks old one that falls out a window and into some shrubs you might be able to they at least might be able to narrow down where we should look first he was grinning very broadly at me yeah knowing it fell out the window is useful information it might not have occurred to me to check for tracks outside the window if he grinned any wider he was going to pull something and if a vampire old enough to get past your cross had eaten your face id have never known about the shrubs ah anita i done good i shook my head for all that larry had seen of vampires it wasnt enough he still didnt fully appreciate what they were he didnt have any scars yet if he stayed in the business long enough to get his license that would change god help him the wind was cool and smelled of rain i turned my face to the soft touch of it the air smelled of green growing things it smelled clean and new i stood on the grass looking upward ellie quinlans window shone like a soft yellow beacon ellie had opened the windows but her father had turned on the lights she had met her vampire lover in darkness the better not to see him for the walking corpse he was i had the coverall back on unzipped halfway so i could get to the browning id only brought an inner pants holster for the firestar so i shoved it into a pocket of the coveralls not handy for a quick draw but better than not having it an inner pants holster just doesnt work well with a skirt on larry had his very own gun in a shoulder rig he stood beside me shrugging his shoulders trying to get the straps more comfortable it isnt really uncomfortable if its a good fit but it isnt really comfortable either its sort of like a bra they fit and they are necessary but they are never completely comfortable he was wearing the extra coverall unzipped and flapping nearly to his hips a flashlight flicked over us glinting on larrys cross the light swept over me glaring in my eyes now that youve ruined my night vision get that damn thing out of my eyes deep masculine laughter came from behind the brilliant beam of light two state cops had arrived just in time to join us on the hunt oh joy wallace a mans voice said do what the lady says the voice was deep and vaguely threatening a voice to say lean on the hood of the car and spread em and youd do it or else officer granger walked up to us his flashlight pointed at the ground he wasnt as tall as wallace and a gut was beginning to creep over his belt but he moved through the dark like he knew what he was doing like maybe hed hunted in the dark before maybe not vampires but something maybe men wallace walked over to us flashlight swimming around us like an oversized firefly it wasnt in my eyes but it was still not helping my night vision turn off the flashlight please i said wallace took a step closer looming over me he was tall built like a football player with long legs a running back maybe he and deputy coltrain could arm wrestle later right now i just wanted him to back the fuck off me turn it off wallace granger said hed already clicked off his own i wont be able to see a damn thing he protested afraid of the dark i asked smiling up at him larry laughed it was the wrong thing to do wallace turned on him you think thats funny he stepped up to larry until they were almost touching using his size to intimidate but larrys like me hes been small all his life hed been bullied by the best he stood his ground are you larry asked am i what wallace asked afraid of the dark animating wasnt the only thing larry was learning from me unfortunately for larry he was a boy i could get away with being a pain in the ass and most people wouldnt take a swing at me larry wasnt so lucky wallace balled his hands into larrys coverall and lifted him to tiptoes his flashlight fell to the grass rolling around spotlighting our ankles officer granger stepped up close to them but didnt touch wallace even in the dark you could see the tension in his shoulders and arms not from lifting larry but from wanting to hit him and resisting the urge ease down wallace he didnt mean anything wallace didnt say anything he just pulled larry closer to him leaning over to put his face next to larrys a square of yellow light fell across his face the muscle along the edge of his jaw was jutting out throbbing like it would pop out of his face there was a scar under the bone of his jawline a scar that disappeared into the collar of his jacket wallace nearly put his face nose to nose with larry iamnotafraidofanything each word was squeezed out i stepped up close to him he was bent down to intimidate larry so i could whisper in his ear nice scar wallace he jumped like id bit him he released larry so suddenly that larry stumbled he whirled one big hand raised to smash my face at least hed let go of larry he swung at me i swept his arm to one side and past me he stumbled i brought my knee up into his stomach hard it took a lot not to follow through and really hurt him he was a cop one of the good guys you dont beat up on them i stepped back out of reach and hoped that one near miss had cooled him down i could have hurt him badly in the initial rush but now hed be ready harder to hurt he was nearly a foot taller than me and outweighed me by more than a hundred pounds if the fight turned serious i was in trouble i hoped i wouldnt regret my gallant gesture wallace ended on all fours near the shrubs by the house he got to his feet quicker than i wanted him to but he stayed half bent over hands on his knees he looked up at me i wasnt sure what his expression meant but it wasnt completely hostile it was more a considering sort of look as if id surprised him i get that look a lot you all right now wallace granger asked wallace nodded hard to talk after a good gut shot granger glanced at me you all right ms blake im fine he nodded yes you are larry moved up beside me he was standing too close if wallace came back at me i would need more room to maneuver i knew that larry meant it as a show of support after we got larrys shooting up to speed wed have to work on some basic handtohand techniques why was i training him to shoot before i taught him to fight because you dont arm wrestle vampires you shoot them he would live through a beating from officer wallace he wouldnt live through a vampire attack not if he couldnt shoot were you with him when he got that scar i asked granger shook his head his first partner didnt make it vampire got him he nodded wallace stood up sort of slow he arched his back just a bit as if working the kinks out nice shot he said i shrugged it was my knee not my fist still a good shot i dont have any excuses good enough for what i just did no i said you dont he just looked down at the ground then up i dont know what made me do it lets take a little walk i started off into the dark without looking back as if i had no doubt hed follow me this technique works more often than you think it would he followed me he had stopped to pick up his flashlight but bravely turned it off i stopped just short of the woods and stared off into the trees letting my eyes adjust to the dark i didnt look at anything in particular i let my eyes just sort of see everything i was looking for movement any movement the tree limbs moved fitfully in the spring wind but it was a general movement like ocean waves the trees werent what worried me wallace tapped the darkened flashlight against his thigh a soft whap whap i wanted to tell him to stop but didnt if it comforted him i could live with it i let the silence stretch between us the wind picked up filling the night with a rushing hurrying sound you could smell the rain on the wind he gripped the flashlight in both hands i could hear his intake of breath above the wind what was that the wind i said are you sure pretty much what do you want he asked is this the first vamp youve gone after since your partners death he looked at me granger told you yeah but i saw your neck i was pretty sure what had done it i wanted to tell him it was okay to be scared hell i was scared but he was a cop and a man and i didnt know him well enough to know how hed take a pep talk from me but i had to know if hed follow me into those woods i had to know if i could depend on him if he stayed this scared i couldnt what happened i asked maybe talking about it right now was the wrong thing to do but ignoring it wasnt working very well he shook his head headquarters says youre in charge ms blake fine ill do what im told but i dont have to answer personal questions it was too much trouble to shrug out of the overall and i really didnt want my arms trapped i undid one button on my blouse and spread the cloth what are you doing how goods your night vision why can you see the scar what are you talking about he sounded suspicious suspicious that i was crazy maybe my night vision would have picked it up but most people dont have my eyes give me your hand why i am about to give you a onceinalifetime offer just give me your damn hand he did sort of hesitatingly glancing back at the waiting men his hand was cold to the touch he was one scared puppy i traced his large blunt fingers along my collarbone the moment he touched the scar tissue his hand jerked like hed had an electric shock i pulled my hand away and he traced the scar again on his own he took his hand back slowly rubbing his fingers together like he was remembering the feel of my skin what did that same thing that did your neck a vampire that wasnt neat with its food jesus he said yeah i said i rebuttoned my blouse tell me what happened wallace please he looked at me for a moment longer then nodded harry my partner and me we got a call that someone had found a body with its throat torn out he made the words very bland ordinary but i knew he was seeing it in his head watching it all happen again behind his eyeballs it was a construction site just us in the middle of the place with our flashlights there was a sound like wind whistling and something hit harry he went down with a man on top of him he screamed and i had my gun out i fired into the mans back i hit him solid three four times he turned on me and his face was bloody i didnt have time to wonder why cause he jumped me i emptied my gun into him before i hit the ground he took a deep breath big hands twisting back and forth on the flashlight he was looking off into the trees too but not for vampires or at least not for this one he ripped my jacket and shirt like they were paper i tried to fight him but he shook his head he caught me with his eyes he caught me with his eyes and when he tore into my neck i wanted him to do it wanted it worse than ive ever wanted anything in my life he turned a little away from me as if not meeting my eyes wasnt enough when i woke up he was just gone harry was dead the girl was dead i was alive he turned to me finally looked me straight in the eyes and said why didnt he kill me ms blake i looked into his earnest eyes and didnt have a good answer i dont know wallace he wanted to make you one of them maybe i dont know why you and not harry you ever catch him the local master sent his head in a box to the station the note apologized for his uncivilized behavior thats what the note said uncivilized behavior its hard to look at it as murder when you feed off humans yourself do they all do that feed off people ive never met one that didnt cant they eat animals theoretically yes in practice it seems to lack certain nutrients truth was feeding was too close to sex for most vamps they werent into bestiality so they didnt feed off animals i didnt think the sex analogy would go over well with officer wallace can you do this wallace what do you mean can you go out into the dark and hunt vampires its my job i didnt ask if it was your job i asked if you can go out into that darkness and hunt vampires you think theres more than one always best to assume so i said he nodded yeah i guess so scared i asked are you i looked off into the windswept night the trees tossed and moaned in the wind there was movement everywhere soon there would be rain and what light the stars gave would be gone yeah im scared but youre a vampire hunter he said how can you do this night after night if it scares you doesnt it scare you to know that every time you pull over some yahoo for a traffic violation that he could be armed you walk up on that car and never know its my job and this is my job but youre scared down to my toes larry called the sheriffs back hes got the warrant wallace and i looked at each other you got silver bullets i asked yes i smiled then lets go youll be fine i said i believed it wallace would do his job i would do my job we would all do our jobs and come morning some of us would be alive and some of us wouldnt of course maybe there was just the one newly dead vampire to deal with if so we might all see the sunrise but i hadnt lived this long assuming the best assuming the worst was always safer and usually truer id gotten used to the sawedoff shotgun that i had at home yeah it is illegal but its easy to carry and makes mincemeat out of vampires what more could a modern vampire hunter want the ithaca pump action gauge was close why dont i get a shotgun larry asked i just looked at him he looked serious i shook my head when you can handle the nine well talk about shotguns great oh for the enthusiasm of youth larry was only four years younger than i was sometimes it seemed like a million hes not going to shoot us in the back by accident is he deputy coltrain asked i smiled not sweetly he promised not to coltrain looked at me like he wasnt sure i was kidding sheriff st john joined us at the edge of the woods he had a shotgun too i had to trust that he knew how to use it wallace had the shotgun from their unit his partner granger had a wickedlooking rifle like something a sniper would carry it looked like the wrong tool for tonights job and i had said so granger had just looked at me id shrugged and let it go it was his neck and his gun i looked around at them they looked at me waiting for me to give the word everybody got their holy water i asked larry patted his coverall pocket everyone else nodded or mumbled yes remember the three rules of vampire hunting one never ever look them in the eyes two never ever give up your cross three aim for the head and heart even with silver ammo it wont be a killing blow anywhere else i felt like a kindergarten teacher sending her kiddies off to a hostile playground dont panic if you get bitten the bite can be cleansed as long as they dont mesmerize you with their eyes you can still fight i looked at them all silent all taller than me even larry by an inch or two they could all arm wrestle me and win so why did i want to order them all into the house whered theyd be safe heck we could all go inside have a nice cup of hot cocoa tell the quinlans their little girl would be fine i mean liquid diets are in with teens right i took a deep breath and let it out slow lets do it boys were wasting starlight either nobody got my john wayne reference or nobody thought it was funny hard to tell which i had to let st john lead the way into the black trees i didnt know the area he did but i didnt like him taking point i didnt like it at all i wanted to bring him back to his wife his high school sweetheart five years married and still in love jesus i didnt want to get him killed the trees closed around us st john threaded his way through them like he knew what he was doing there was very little undergrowth this time of year it made it easier but there is still an art to going through thick woods especially in the dark you cant really see even with a flashlight you have to sort of give yourself over to the trees the way you give yourself to water when you swim you dont really concentrate on the water or even on your own body you concentrate on the rhythm of your body cutting sliding through the cool liquid for the forest you find a rhythm too you concentrate on sliding your body through the natural openings finding the place where the forest itself will let you through if you fight it it will fight you back and just like water it can kill you anyone who doesnt believe that the forest is a deadly place has never been lost in one st john knew how to move and so did i i was pretty pleased at that actually id been a city girl for a long time larry stumbled into me i had to brace or wed have both gone down sorry he said pushing himself away from me how ya doing up there vampire hunter coltrain called he was bringing up the rear i had to go second to back up st john and i wouldnt let larry take rear coltrain had wanted it said he and the sheriff would guard our ass fine with me yell a little louder wallace said i dont think the vampire heard you i dont need no statie telling me how to do my job it knows were here i said that stopped them they both looked at me granger who was just ahead of wallace looked at me too i had everyones attention even if the vampire is only a few weeks old its hearing is incredibly acute it knows were here it knows were coming it doesnt matter if were quiet or have a brass band its all the same we wont surprise it in the dark it would probably surprise us but i didnt add that part aloud we were all thinking it anyway we are wasting time here deputy st john said coltrain didnt apologize or even look sorry wallace did im sorry sheriff it wont happen again st john nodded and turned without another word and led us farther into the woods coltrain made a small humphing sound but let it go whatever he said i didnt think wallace would rise to bait again at least i hoped not i didnt care if he was scared we had enough problems without fighting among ourselves the trees rustled and swayed around us last years dead leaves crunched underfoot someone cursed softly behind me the wind blew in a wild gust streaming my hair back from my face up ahead the quality of darkness was different we were approaching the clearing st john stopped just short of the tree line he glanced back at me how do you want to do this i could taste the rain on the wind coming closer if possible i wanted us out of here before it came visibility sucked as it was we kill it and we get the hell back to the house its not a hard plan he nodded as if id said something profound wish i had a figure stepped in front of us one minute nothing the next there he was darkness and shadows magic he grabbed st john as he went for his gun and threw him out into the clearing in a high looping arch i shot the vampire in the chest at almost pointblank range he collapsed to his knees i caught a glimpse of the whites of his eyes like he couldnt believe it i had to pump the shotgun to jack another shell in place grangers rifle exploded behind me like a cannon someone screamed i shot the vampire between the eyes his head splattered into the leaves i turned with the shotgun to my shoulder before the body hit the ground larry was on the ground with a vamp on top of him i had a glimpse of long brown hair before his cross flared to life in a brilliant flash of bluewhite fire she flung herself backwards with a scream scrambling into the dark gone a vamp with long blonde hair held granger in her slender arms head pressed to his neck i couldnt use the shotgun they were pressed too close together at this range id kill them both i dropped the shotgun into larrys surprised lap he was still lying on the ground blinking i drew the browning and fired into the vampires broad chest she jerked but didnt let go of granger the vampire looked at me the man still clasped to her chest she hissed at me i fired a round into her gaping mouth it blew the back of her head out the vamp shuddered i fired a second round into her head she let go of granger and fell to the leaves in convulsions granger just lay there in the dark i couldnt see his face or neck dead or alive id done all i could larry was on his feet shotgun awkward in his hands there was a scream low and painfilled wallace was on the ground with a slenderbodied vamp on top of him fangs sunk in his arm the bone broke with a loud brittle snap he screamed again i had a glimpse of coltrain standing frozen just beyond there was movement behind him i stared straight at it waiting for the vampire to take shape from the shadows but something gleamed a dull silver blade flashed into sight i stared straight at it but i lost a second somehow the next thing i knew the blade tip exploded from coltrains throat i lost another second blinking at shadows and the vampire tore the blade from his throat and was gone it scuttled through the trees like nothing human unbelievably fast like a nightmare seen from the corner of your eye larry raised the shotgun to his shoulder aimed in wallaces direction i grabbed it from him and something smashed into my back and rode me into the leaves a hand pressed my face into the dry crackling leaves a second hand ripped the back of my coverall so violently it wrenched one shoulder there was an explosion just behind my head and the vampire was gone i rolled over ears ringing larry was standing over me with his arm extended gun out whatever hed shot was gone out in the dark my left shoulder was hurt but not as badly as it might be if i didnt get up i struggled to my feet the vampires were gone wallace was sitting up cradling his arm coltrain lay on the ground without moving a sound behind us i turned browning pointed larry was turning too but too slow i sighted down the barrel and it was st john dont shoot its me larry held his gun twohanded pointed at the ground sweet jesus he said amen what happened to you the fall knocked me out i followed the sound of shots st john said a gust of wind slapped against us it smelled so strongly of rain i almost felt it on my skin check grangers pulse larry i said what larry looked shellshocked see if hes alive it was a messy job and id have done it myself but i trusted me more than larry to keep the vampires away hed saved me once tonight but i still trusted me more st john walked past us he touched wallace who nodded my arms broke but ill live st john went to coltrains still form larry knelt by granger he switched his gun to his left hand not the best thing to do but i understood hard to check for a pulse in the dark on a throat warm with blood better to use your dominant hand ive got a pulse he looked up his broad smile a dim whiteness in the dark coltrains dead st john said god help me hes dead he raised a hand and the skin glistened with blood black in the dim light hes nearly decapitated what did this sword i said id seen it watched it happen but all i could remember was a black shape larger than a human being or larger than most a shadow with a sword was all id seen and id been looking right at it something flowed across my skin and it wasnt the wind power filled the spring night like water theres something old out here i said what are you talking about st john said an ancient vampire its here i can feel it i searched the darkness but nothing moved but the trees the wind there was nothing to see nothing to fight but it was here and it was close sword in hand maybe granger sat up so suddenly that larry fell back into the leaves with a squeak the big mans eyes turned to me i saw his hand go for his gun and i knew what the vampire was doing i pointed the browning at his head and waited i had to be sure granger didnt hunt for his dropped rifle he drew his sidearm and pointed it very slowly as if he didnt want to do it he pointed it at larry from less than a foot away wallace yelled granger what the fuck are you doing i fired granger jerked the gun wavered then his hand came back up i fired again and again his hand fell slowly to the ground gun still in it he fell straight back into the leaves granger wallace was screaming crawling toward his partner shit i got there first and kicked the gun out of his hand if hed twitched id have shot him again he didnt twitch he just lay there dead wallace tried to cradle him onehanded whyd you shoot him why he was going to kill larry you saw it why the vamp that bit him his master is out here and hes a powerful son of a bitch he used him wallace had grangers bloody head in his lap his own ravaged arm pressed to grangers chest he was crying shit a sound rode the rising wind a sharp furious barking a womans scream high and clear cut across the sound oh god i whispered beth st john was on his feet running before i could say anything i grabbed wallaces shoulder pulling on his jacket he looked up whats happening theyre in the house i said can you walk he nodded i helped him to his feet another scream came it wasnt the same scream a man this time or a boy stay with him larry get to the house as soon as you can what if theyre trying to split us up larry asked then its going to work i said shoot anything that moves i touched his arm as if that would make him more real keep him safe it wouldnt but it was all i had i had to go for the house larry had signed up to be a monster slayer the quinlans and beth st john hadnt i holstered the browning kept a twohanded grip on the shotgun and threw myself into the trees i ran not trying to see where i was going rushing through openings in the trees that i wasnt sure were there but they were i jumped over a log and nearly fell but caught myself and kept running a branch slashed my face bringing tears to my eye the forest that had seemed passable before was now a maze of roots and branches that grabbed and tripped i was running blind it was not a good way to stay alive with vampires in the dark i spilled out onto the quinlans lawn on my knees shotgun tightly gripped the front door was open light spilled in a warm rectangle shots sounded from inside the house i got to my feet and ran for the light the poodle lay broken by the door crumpled like someone had tried to force it into a ball the doors to the living room were open a second shot sounded i went in to the left of the door wall at my back shotgun ready mr and mrs quinlan were huddled in the far corner with their crosses held out before them the metal glowed with a whitehot light like burning magnesium the thing in front of them didnt look much like a vampire it looked like a skeleton with muscle and flesh stretched over a bone frame it was stretched impossibly thin and tall a sword rode its back gleaming and wide as a scimitar coltrains killer st john was firing into the brownhaired vamp from the woods she had long brown hair parted in the middle straight and lovely framing a face that was bloodsmeared and stretched wide over fangs i had a glimpse of beth st john on the floor behind her she wasnt moving st john kept firing into the vampires body she just kept coming blood blossomed on the front of her jean jacket his gun clicked empty the vampire staggered then fell to her knees she fell forward on all fours and you could see that her back was so much raw meat she lay gasping on the floor while st john reloaded i got to my feet trying to keep an eye on the door just in case this wasnt all i walked towards the quinlans and the thing that stood in front of them i needed a better angle before i used the shotgun didnt want to catch them in the shot pattern the thing turned on me i had a glimpse of a face that was neither human nor animal but stretched thin and alien with fangs and blind glowing eyes it shrank and skin flowed over the bare flesh covered the nearly naked bone id never seen anything like it when i aimed the shotgun i was looking into what could have passed for a human face long white hair framed a fineboned face and it ranif running was the word for that blur of motion it ran like some of them flew almost like it was doing something else altogether but i had no better word for it some of them flew this one ran it was gone before i could pull the trigger i was left staring at the open door where the barrel had followed its movement could i have fired had i hesitated i didnt think so but i wasnt sure it was like in the woods when coltrain died like id missed a few seconds the vampire had to be our killer but the only thing id seen clearly in the woods had been the sword st john shot into the fallen vampire he fired until his gun clicked empty again the gun went click click click i walked over to him the vampires head was bloody meat and heavier wetter things there was no face left its dead st john you killed it he just stared at it down the barrel of his empty gun he was shaking he collapsed to his knees suddenly as if he just couldnt stand any longer he crawled over to his wife gun left behind him on the carpet he cradled her in his arms halflifting rocking her she was soaked with blood her throat was so much raw meat on one side st john was making a high keening sound deep in his throat the quinlanss crosses had stopped glowing they stood still clinging to each other blinking as if blinded by the light jeffhe took jeff mrs quinlan said i looked at her her eyes were too wide he took jeff who took jeff i asked the big one mr quinlan said that thing that thing told jeff to take his cross off and jeff did it he looked at me with startled eyes why did he do that why did he take it off the vampire caught him with his eyes i said he couldnt help himself if his faith had been stronger he wouldnt have given in quinlan said it wasnt your sons fault quinlan shook his head he wasnt strong enough i turned away from him which put me staring at st john he had folded as much of his wifes body into his lap and arms as he could he rocked her eyes distant he wasnt seeing this room hed gone somewhere deep inside someplace better i hoped i went for the door i didnt have to see this watching st john rock his wifes body was not part of my job description honest i sat down on the stairs where i could see the door the hallway and the stairs as far as the landing st john started singing in a strange broken voice it took me a few minutes to figure out what he was singing it was you are so beautiful i got up and went for the outer door larry and wallace were just limping up onto the porch i just shook my head and kept walking i was almost to the driveway before i couldnt hear the singing i stood there taking deep breaths letting them out slowly i concentrated on my breathing concentrated on the sound of frogs and wind i concentrated on anything but the sound that was building in my throat i stood there in the dark in the open knowing it was dangerous and not sure i cared i stood there until i was sure i wasnt going to start screaming then i turned and went back to the house it was the bravest thing id done all night detective freemont sat on one end of the quinlans couch and i perched on the other we were as far away from each other as we could get and share it only pride kept me from taking a chair i wouldnt flinch under her cool cop eyes so i stayed nailed to my end of the couch but it was an effort her voice was low and careful every word enunciated as if she thought she might yell if she rushed the words why didnt you call and tell me you had a second vampire kill sheriff st john called the state cops i assumed youd be told well i wasnt i stared up into her cool eyes youre twenty minutes away with a crime scene unit looking into a possible vampire kill why wouldnt they send you over to a second vampire scene freemonts eyes shifted to one side then back to me her cool cop eyes had melted just a little it was hard to read for sure but she looked uneasy maybe even scared you havent told them it was a vampire kill have you her eyes flinched shit freemont i know you dont want the feds to steal your case but withholding information from your own people bet your superiors arent happy with you thats my business fine whatever plan youve got more power to you but why are you pissed at me she took a deep shaking breath and blew it out like a runner trying to get that extra kick how sure are you the vampire used a sword you saw the body i said she nodded a vampire could have ripped the neck apart i saw a blade freemont the me will either back you up or not why dont you want this to be vampires she smiled i thought i had this case all solved thought id make an arrest this morning i didnt think it was vampires i stared at her i wasnt smiling if it wasnt vamps then what was it fairies i stared at her for a heartbeat what do you mean your boss sergeant storr called me told me what youd found out about magnus bouvier hes got no alibi for the time of the killings and even you think he could have done it because he could have done it doesnt mean he did i said freemont shrugged he ran when we tried to question him innocent people dont run what do you mean he ran if you were there questioning him how could he run freemont settled back into the couch hands clasped together so tightly her fingers were mottled he used magic to cloud our minds and made his escape what sort of magic freemont shook her head what do you want me to say ms preternatural expert four of us sat there in his restaurant like idiots while he just walked out we didnt even see him get up from the table she looked at me no smiles her eyes were back to that neutral coolness you could stare all day at someone with eyes like that and keep all your secrets safe he looked human to me blake he looked like a nice normal guy i wouldnt have picked him out of a crowd how did you know what he was i opened my mouth and closed it i wasnt exactly sure how to answer the question he tried to use glamor on me but i knew what was happening whats glamor and how did you know he was using a spell on you glamor isnt exactly a spell i said i always hated explaining preternatural things to people who had no skill in the area it was like having quantum physics explained to me i could follow the concepts but i had to take their word for it on the math the math was beyond me hated to admit it but it was but not understanding quantum physics wouldnt get me killed not understanding preternatural creatures might get freemont killed im not stupid blake explain it to me i dont think youre stupid detective freemont its just hard to explain i was riding with two uniforms in st louis they were transporting me from a crime scene playing taxi the driver spotted this guy just walking along he pulled over put him up against a car the guy was carrying a weapon and was wanted in another state for armed robbery if id been in a room with him id have noticed the gun but just passing by in a car no way i wouldnt have seen it even his partner asked him how he spotted him he couldnt explain so that we could do it but he knew how to do it so its practice freemont said i sighed in part but hell detective i raise the dead for a living i have some preternatural abilities it gives me a leg up how the hell are we supposed to police creatures ms blake if bouvier had pulled a gun wed have sat there and let him shoot us we just sort of woke up and he wasnt there anymore ive never seen anything like it there are things you can do to protect yourself from fairie glamor i said what a fourleaf clover will break glamor but it wont keep the fey from killing you by hand there are other plants you can wear or carry that break glamor saintjohnswort red verbena daisies rowan and ash my choice would be an ointment made of either fourleaf clovers or saintjohnswort spread it on your eyelids mouth ears and hands itll make you proof against glamor where do i get this stuff i thought about that for a second well in st louis id know where to go here try healthfood stores and occult shops any fairie ointment will be hard to find because we dont have any fairies native to this country ointment from fourleaf clovers is very expensive and rare try for the saintjohnswort she sighed will this ointment work on any mind control like for vamps nope i said you could drop a vamp in a whole tub of saintjohnswort and it wouldnt give a damn what do you do against vampires then keep your cross avoid eye contact pray they can do things thatll make magnus look like an amateur she rubbed her eyes smearing eye shadow on the ball of her thumb she suddenly looked tired how do we protect the public against something like that you dont i said yes we do she said we have to its our job i didnt know what to say to that so i didnt try so you thought it was magnus because he ran and he doesnt have an alibi why else would he run i dont know i said but he didnt do it i saw the thing in the woods it wasnt magnus hell ive only heard about vampires forming from shadows id never seen it before she looked at me youve never seen it before thats not comforting it wasnt meant to be but since it wasnt magnus you can call off the warrant she shook her head he used magic on police officers while committing a crime thats a class c felony what was his crime escaping but he wasnt under arrest i had a warrant for his arrest she said you didnt have enough for a warrant i said helps to know the right judge he didnt kill those kids or coltrain you pointed the finger at him she said just an alternate possibility with five people dead i couldnt afford to be wrong she stood well you got your wish it was vampires and i dont know why the hell magnus bouvier ran from us but just using magic on a police officer is a felony even if he was innocent of the original crime you were trying to bring him in on i asked felonious use of magic is a serious crime ms blake theres a warrant for his arrest you see him you remember that i know magnus isnt nice people detective freemont i dont know why he ran but if you put out the word that he used magic on cops someonell shoot him hes dangerous ms blake yeah but so are a lot of people detective you dont hunt them down and arrest them for it she nodded weve all got prejudices ms blake makes us all wrong once in a while at least here we know what did it yeah i said we know what did it do you know when the girls body was taken she asked she got a notebook out of her coat pocket down to business i shook my head no it was just gone when i went up what made you think to check on the body i looked at her her eyes were pleasant and unreadable theyd gone to a lot of trouble to make her one of them i thought they might try to get her they did the fathers making noises that he asked you to stake her body before you went out after the vampires is that true her voice was soft matteroffact but she was paying attention to the answers she didnt take as many notes as dolph did the notebook seemed to be more something to do with her hands than anything else i was finally seeing freemont doing her job she seemed good at it that was reassuring yeah thats true why didnt you stake the girl when the parents requested it i had a father a widower his daughter and only child got bit he wanted her staked i did it that night right away next morning hes in my office crying wanting me to undo it wanting me to bring her back as a vampire i leaned back into the couch hugging myself you put a stake through a new vamps heart and its dead for good i thought you had to take a vampires head to be sure you do i said if i had staked the quinlan girl i would have taken out her heart cut off her head i shook my head there isnt much left she drew something on her note pad i couldnt see what i was betting it was a doodle and not a word i see why you wanted to wait but mr quinlan is talking about suing you yeah i know freemont raised her eyebrows just thought youd want to know thanks we havent found the boys body yet i dont think you will i said her eyes didnt look pleasant anymore they looked narrow and suspicious why if they wanted to kill him they could have done it here tonight i think they want to make him one of them why i shrugged i dont know but usually when a vampire takes this personal an interest in a family theres a reason for it you mean a motive i nodded youve seen the quinlans theyre devout catholics the church sees vampirism as suicide their children will be damned for all eternity if they become vampires worse than just killing them she said to the quinlans i think so you think the vampires will be back to get the parents i thought about that for a minute hell i dont know i mean before vampires were legal you had some cases where a master vamp would take out entire families sometimes befriend them first sometimes just for revenge for some slight but since theyve been legal i dont know why the vamp would do it i mean the vampire can take them to court what could the quinlans have done that was bad enough for this the doors opened freemont turned a frown already in place two men appeared in the doorway they were both dressed in dark suits dark ties white shirts standard federal issue one was short and white the other tall and black that alone should have made them look different but there was a sameness to them like the same cookie cutter had been used no matter how well cooked the outside was the shorter of the two flipped his badge at us im special agent bradford this is agent elwood which one of you is detective freemont freemont walked towards them with her hand out showing she was unarmed and friendly yeah right im detective freemont this is anita blake i appreciated being included in the introductions i stood up and joined the foursome agent bradford looked at me for a long time long enough that it got on my nerves is there something wrong agent bradford he shook his head i attended sergeant storrs lectures at quantico the way he talked about you i thought youd be bigger he smiled when he said it halfway between friendly and condescending a lot of scathing comebacks came to mind but never get in a pissing contest with the feds youll lose sorry to disappoint you weve already talked with officer wallace he makes you sound taller too i shrugged hard to make me sound shorter he smiled wed like to speak with detective freemont in private ms blake but dont go far well want a statement from you and your associate mr kirkland sure i took ms blakes statement personally freemont said i dont think we need her any more tonight bradford looked at her i think well be the judge of that if ms blake had called me in when there was only one body on the ground there wouldnt be two dead policemen and a dead civilian freemont said i just looked at her somebodys ass was going to be in a sling and freemont didnt want it to be hers fine dont forget the missing boy i said everyone looked at me you want to start pointing fingers fine theres enough blame to go around if you hadnt chased me off earlier i might have called you in but i did call the state police if youd told your superiors everything i told you theyd have connected the two cases and youd have been here anyway i had enough men with me to cover the house and the civilians freemont said not including me cost lives i nodded probably but youd have come down here and kicked me out again youd have taken st john and his people out in the dark with five vampires one of them ancient when all youve seen is pictures of vampire kills theyd have slaughtered you but maybe just maybe beth st john would be alive maybe jeff quinlan would still be here i stared up at her and watched the anger drain from her eyes we looked at each other it took both of us to fuck this one up sergeant i turned back to the two agents ill wait outside wait bradford said storr said that sometimes the legal vampire community will help on a case like this who do i talk to down here why would they hunt down one of their own agent elwood asked this kind of shit is bad for business especially right now with senator brewsters daughter getting killed vampires dont need any more bad publicity most of them like being legal they like the fact that killing them is murder so who do i talk to bradford asked i sighed in this area i dont know im not a hometown girl how do i go about finding out who to talk to i might be able to help you there how i shook my head i know someone who might know a name im not trying to give you a hard time here but a lot of the monsters dont like dealing with cops it just hasnt been that long ago that the police shot them on sight so youre saying the vampires will talk to you and not to us elwood said something like that that makes no sense youre a vampire executioner your job is to kill them why would they believe you and not us he asked i didnt know how to explain it and wasnt sure i wanted to i also raise zombies agent elwood i think they sort of consider me one of the monsters even though youre their version of an electric chair even though thats not logical i laughed then i couldnt help it god has anything that happened here tonight been logical elwood gave a very small smile i pegged him as the newer of the two i dont think hed gotten over the thought that fbi agents dont smile you wouldnt be withholding information from the fbi would you ms blake bradford asked if i come up with a vampire in this area that will talk to you ill give you the name bradford stared at me how about if you come up with any vampires in this area you give us the names let us worry about whether theyll talk to us or not i looked at him for a heartbeat and lied sure if i expected the monsters to help me i couldnt give them all over to the cops only a select few he looked like he didnt believe me but couldnt quite call me a liar to my face when we find the vampires responsible well be sure to call you in for the kill that was more than freemont had been willing to do the night was looking up beep me any time well talk to sergeant freemont now ms blake i was dismissed fine with me he offered his hand i took it we shook agent elwood and i shook everyone smiled i left larry was waiting out in the entryway he got up off the stairs where hed been sitting what now i need to make a phone call who to two more men with federal agent tattooed on their foreheads walked up the hallway from the direction of the kitchen i shook my head and went out the door into the cool windy night the place was swarming with cops id never seen so many federal agents in my life but hey the very first vampire serial killer was news everyone would want a piece watching everyone mill around on the carefully tended lawn i suddenly wanted to go home to just pack up and go home it was still early hours and hours left of darkness it only seemed like it had been an eternity since we left the graveyard hell thered be time to go back and look at stirlings boneyard before dawn i got in the jeep that bayard had loaned us id use the nifty portable phone it came with larry got in the passenger side private call come on anita out larry out in the dark with the vampires he blinked his big blue eyes at me the place is lousy with cops i think youll be safe out he got out grumbling under his breath he could grumble all he wanted to larry wanted to be a vampire hunter fine but he didnt have to be as intimately involved with the monsters as i was i was trying to keep him as out of it as i could not easy but worth the effort id lied to the nice agents it wasnt the fact that i raised zombies that got me in good with the vampires it was the fact that the master of the city of st louis had the hots for me was maybe in love with me or at least thought he was i knew the number by heart which was a bad sign all on its own guilty pleasures where your darkest fantasies come true this is robert how may i help you great robert one of my least favorite vampires hi robert this is anita i need to speak to jeanclaude he hesitated then said ill transfer you to his office phone its a new system so if i disconnect you call back the phone clicked before i could answer a moment of silence and the voice came on the line you can criticize a lot about jeanclaude but he gives good phone good evening ma petite that was it all he said but even over the buzzing phone his voice was like fur inside my skull im near branson i need to contact the master of the city down here no good evening jeanclaude how are you doing just down to business how terribly rude ma petite look i dont have time for games right now some vampires down here are on the rampage theyve kidnapped a young boy i want to find him before they can make him one of them how young is the boy sixteen in centuries past ma petite that was not considered a child it isnt legal age right this minute did he go willingly no you know that for a fact or were you merely told he was kidnapped i talked to him before he didnt go willingly jeanclaude sighed the sound slithered down my skin like cool fingers what do you want of me ma petite i want to talk to the master of the city down here i need the name im assuming you do know who the master is down here of course but it is not that simple we only have three nights to save him and a hell of a lot less if they just want a snack the master will not talk to you without a guide to take you in send someone then who robert willie neither of them is powerful enough to be your escort if you mean they cant protect me i can protect myself i know you can take care of yourself ma petite you have made that abundantly clear but you do not look as dangerous as you are you might have to shoot one or two to teach them their place if you got out alive they would not help you i want to get this boy back intact jeanclaude work with me here ma petite i had an image of jeff quinlans brown eyes his room with its cowboy wallpaper help me jeanclaude he was silent for a moment i am the only one powerful enough to be your escort do you wish me to drop everything and rush down to you it was my turn to be quiet put like that it didnt sound right it sounded like a big favor i didnt want to be indebted to him but id probably live through owing him a favor jeff quinlan might not fine i said you want me to come help you i gritted my teeth and said yes i will fly down tomorrow night tonight ma petite ma petite what am i to do with you you said youd help me and i will but these things take time what things it might be helpful if you thought of branson as a foreign country a potentially hostile foreign country where i am working to get us safe passage there are customs to be observed if i barge in it will be seen as a declaration of war isnt there any way to start tonight i asked short of starting a war perhaps but if you wait one more night ma petite we can enter much more safely we can take care of ourselves jeff quinlan cant that is his name yeah he took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh that made me shiver i would have told him to stop that but it would have amused him so i didnt i will fly down tonight how do i contact you i gave him the name of my hotel and then with a sigh my beeper number i will call you when i arrive how long will it take you to fly this far anita do you think i am going to fly myself down as a bird would i didnt like the faint amusement in his voice but i answered truthfully it was a thought he laughed and it raised goosebumps on my arms oh ma petite ma petite you are precious just what i wanted to hear so how are you getting here my private jet of course he had a private jet when can you be here i will be there as soon as i can my impatient flower i prefer ma petiteto flower as you like ma petite i want to see the master of branson tonight before dawn you have made that abundantly clear and i will try do more than try you are feeling guilty about this boy why im not feeling guilty responsible then he said i sat there not sure what to say he was right i dont suppose you read my mind just then no ma petite just your voice and your impatience i hated that he knew me that well hated it yeah i feel responsible why i was in charge did you do all you could to keep him safe i had hosts put at every entrance someone let them in then they had a doggie door that exited through the garage into the house wall they didnt want to cut a hole through any of the outer doors was there a child vampire among them no then how i described the thin skeletal vampire it was almost a form change he changed back in seconds once he changed back he could have passed for human in dim light ive never seen anything like it ive only seen the ability once he said you know who it is dont you i will be with you as soon as i am able ma petite you sound serious all of a sudden why he gave a small laugh but this one was bitter like swallowing broken glass it hurt just to hear it you know me too well ma petite just answer the question did the boy who was taken look younger than his years yeah why silence thick enough to slice was the only answer talk to me jeanclaude have there been any other young boys gone missing not to my knowledge but i havent asked ask he said how young twelve fourteen older if they look young enough like jeff quinlan i said i fear so is this vampire into more than just kidnapping what do you mean ma petite murder not just biting them but murder what sort of murder i hesitated i didnt discuss ongoing police investigations with the monsters i know you do not trust me ma petite but it is important tell me of these deaths please he didnt say please very often i told him not in great detail but enough were they violated what do you mean violated i asked violated ma petite violated there are other words for it but none better for children oh i said i dont know if they were sexually assaulted they were still clothed there are things that can be done without removing clothing ma petite but the abuse would have happened before the killings systematic abuse over a period of weeks or months ill find out if they were assaulted an idea occurred to me would this vamp ever do a girl by do you mean sex yeah if pressed for company he would take a young girl prepubescent but only if he could find nothing else i swallowed hard we were talking about children like they were things objects no this girl looked like a woman she didnt look young then no he would not willingly touch her what do you mean willingly what other choice would there be his master could order him to do it and he might if he feared the master enough though i cannot think of many people that he would fear enough to do something he found repugnant you know this vampire who is he give me a name when i arrive ma petite just give me the name so you can give it to the police that is their job no ma petite if it is who i think it is it will not be a matter for the police why not put simply he is too dangerous and too exotic to be revealed to the general public if mortals found out we could have among us such things they might turn on us all together you must be aware of that nasty law floating around the senate im aware then you must understand my caution maybe but if more people die because of your caution its going to help brewsters law get passed you think about that oh i am ma petite trust that i am now farewell i have much to do he hung up i sat there staring at the phone damn him what did he mean by exotic what could this new vampire do that others couldnt he could slim himself down enough to fit through a doggie door maybe it made houdini jealous but it was hardly a crime but i remembered its face not human not even just a corpses face it had been something else altogether something different and i remembered those few seconds i lost twice me the great vampire hunter helpless as any civilian for just a heartbeat with vampires a heartbeat was enough visions of such things would get you talking of demons which quinlan had done briefly the police ignored him and i didnt back up his story quinlan had never met a real demon or he wouldnt have made the mistake once youve been in the presence of demons you never forget it id rather fight a dozen vampires than one demonic presence they dont give a shit about silver bullets it was after am before we got back to the graveyard the feds had kept us forever like they didnt believe we were telling them the whole truth fancy that i hated being accused of concealing evidence when i wasnt made me want to lie to them just so they wouldnt be disappointed i think freemont had painted a less than charitable picture of me thatll teach me to be generous but it seemed petty to point fingers at each other and say she did it when beth st johns blood was still wet on the carpet the wind that had all but promised rain had drifted away the thick clouds that had obscured the woods while we were playing tag with vampires were suddenly gone the moon rode high and two days past full since dating richard id paid more attention to the lunar cycles fancy that the moon sailed the shining night sky gleaming like it had been polished the moonlight was so strong it cast faint shadows you didnt need a flashlight but raymond stirling had one a big freaking halogen torch that filled his hand like a captive sun i watched him start to point it at larry and me i raised an arm and said dont point it at us youll ruin our night vision it wasnt very diplomatic but i was tired and it had been a long night he hesitated in midmotion i didnt have to see his face to know he didnt like it men like raymond give orders better than they take them he clicked off the light good for him he waited with ms harrison bayard and beau gathered around him he was the only one with a flashlight i bet that his entourage wasnt worried about night vision and would have liked to have had a light larry and i were still wearing the coveralls i was getting tired of mine what i really wanted to do was go back to the hotel and sleep but once jeanclaude arrived i wouldnt be sleeping anyway might as well work besides stirling was my only paying client well yeah i do get money for killing vampires if its a legal kill but its not a lot of money stirling was financing this trip he deserved his moneys worth i guess weve been waiting for a very long time ms blake im sorry that the death of a young girl inconvenienced you mr stirling shall we go up i am not unsympathetic to anothers loss ms blake and i resent the implication that i am he stood there in the moonlit dark very straight very commanding ms harrison and bayard moved a little closer showing support beau just stood there looking sort of amused behind stirlings back he was wearing a black slicker with a hood he looked like a phantom i looked up at the clear sparkling sky looked at beau he grinned broadly enough for his teeth to flash in the moonlight i just shook my head and let it go maybe hed been a boy scout always prepared and all that fine whatever you say lets get this over with i didnt wait for them i just walked past them and started up larry at my side said youre being rude i glanced at him yeah i am he is a paying client anita look i dont need you to chastise me okay whats wrong with you i stopped what we just left is whats wrong with me id think itd bother you a little more too it bothers me but i dont have to take it out on everyone else i took a deep breath and let it out slow he was right damn alright youve made your point ill try to be nicer stirling marched up to us entourage in tow are you coming ms blake he walked past us his back ramrodstraight ms harrison stumbled and only bayards grab on her elbow kept her from falling flat on her butt she was still wearing her high heels maybe it was against the executive secretary code to wear tennis shoes beau followed with his black slicker flapping around his long legs it made a distinctive slapslap sound that was most irritating okay maybe everything was irritating right now i was feeling decidedly grumpy jeff quinlan was out there somewhere he was either already dead or had one bite by now it wasnt my fault id told his father to put a piece of the host in front of every entrance i would have thought of the doggie door if id seen it but id never gone that far into the house even i would have thought it was paranoid to guard the doggie entrance but i would have done it and beth st john would be alive id dropped the ball i couldnt bring beth st john back but i could save jeff and i would i would i didnt want to avenge him by killing the vampire that killed him for once i wanted to be in time for once i wanted to save someone and leave revenge for someone else was jeff being violated right this minute was that thing id seen in the quinlans living room doing more than just biting his neck god i hoped not i was pretty sure i could bring jeff back from a vampire bite but combine that with rape by a monster and i wasnt so sure what if i found him and there wasnt much left to save the mind is a surprisingly fragile thing sometimes i prayed as we walked up the hill i prayed and felt a measure of calm return no visions no angels singing but a feeling of peace flowed over me i took a deep breath and something hard and tight and ugly in my heart let go i took it as a good sign that id get to jeff in time but part of me was skeptical god doesnt always save someone often he just helps you live through the loss i guess i dont entirely trust god i never doubt him but his motives are too beyond me through a glass darkly and all that just once id like to see through the damn glass clearly the moon shone down on the top of the hill like silver fire the air was almost luminescent the rain was gone giving its blessing somewhere else heaven knows we could have used the rain but personally i was just as glad i didnt have to walk the raw dirt in a downpour mud would have been just too perfect well ms blake shall we begin stirling asked i glanced at him yeah i took a breath and swallowed the blunt things i wanted to say larry was right stirling was a pain in the ass but he wasnt who i was mad at he was just a convenient target mr kirkland and i will walk the graveyard but you need to stay here other people moving around are very distracting there that was diplomatic if you were going to make us stand here like an audience you could have said so at the bottom of this mountain and saved us the walk so much for diplomacy would you have liked me telling you to stay at the bottom of the hill where you couldnt see what we were doing he thought about that for a minute no i suppose i wouldnt have liked it then what are you complaining about anita larry said very softly under his breath i ignored him look mr stirling it has been a really rough night i am just out of niceness right now please just let me do my job the faster i get this done the sooner we go home okay honesty i was hoping profound honesty would work it was about all i had left he hesitated a minute then nodded all right ms blake do your job but know this you have been decidedly unpleasant it better be pretty spectacular i opened my mouth and larry touched my arm he gripped my arm not too hard but hard enough i swallowed what i was going to say and walked away from all of them larry trailed after me brave larry whats the matter with you tonight he asked when we were out of earshot of stirling and co i told you no he said it isnt just the murder tonight hell ive seen you kill people and be less upset afterwards whats wrong i stopped walking and just stood there for a minute hed seen me kill people and be less upset was that true i thought about it for a heartbeat it was true that was pretty damn sad i knew what was wrong id seen too many slaughtered people in the last few months too much blood too much killing id done some of the killing not all of it had been sanctioned by the state i also wanted to be looking for jeff quinlan i couldnt do anything until jeanclaude arrived i really couldnt but i felt like my job was interfering with my police work was that a bad sign or a good one i took a deep breath of the cool mountain air i let it out very slowly concentrating on just breathing in and out in and out when i felt calm again i looked at larry im just a little on edge tonight larry ill be alright if i said a little on edge with a surprised lilt in my voice would you get mad i smiled yeah i would youve been in a blacker mood than usual since you talked to jeanclaude whats up i stared into his smiling face and didnt want to tell him he wasnt that much older than jeff quinlan four years he could still have passed for a highschooler fine i said and told him a vampire pedophile isnt that against the rules what rules that you can only be one kind of monster at a time it kind of caught me off guard too a strange look flashed across his face sweet jesus jeff quinlan is with that thing he looked at me all the horror all the pain or as much as he could imagine flowing across his face we have to do something anita we have to save him he turned as if to go back down the mountain i grabbed his arm we cant do anything until jeanclaude arrives but we cant just do nothing we arent doing nothing were doing our job but how can we because we cant do anything else right now larry looked at me for a second then nodded okay if you can be calm so can i good man thanks now show me this nifty trick youve been talking about ive never heard of anyone who could read the dead without raising them first truthfully i didnt know if larry could do it but telling him he might not be able to was not going to help his confidence magic if that was the right word often rises and falls on your own belief in your abilities ive seen very powerful people completely crippled by selfdoubt im going to walk the cemetery i tried to think of how to put it into words how do you explain something that you dont fully understand yourself i have always had an affinity with the dead even as a small child i always knew if the soul had fled the body i remember my greataunt katerines funeral im named after her my middle name she was my fathers favorite aunt we went early to view the body and make sure everything was ready i felt her soul hovering above the coffin i looked up expecting to see it but there was nothing for my eyes to hold onto ive never seen a soul ive felt them but ive never seen one i know now that aunt katerines soul hung around a long time most souls leave within three days some leave instantly some dont my mothers soul was gone by the time the funeral arrived i didnt feel her there there was nothing but a closed coffin and a blanket of pink roses over the coffin as if the coffin would get cold it was at home where i felt my mother hovering close not her soul not really but some piece of her that couldnt let go immediately i would hear her footsteps in the hall outside my bedroom as if she was coming to kiss me good night she moved through the house for months and i found it comforting when she finally left i was ready to let her go i never told my father i was only eight but even then i knew that he couldnt hear her maybe he heard other things i dont know my father and i never talked much about my mothers death it made him cry id been able to sense ghosts long before i could raise the dead what i was about to do was just an extension of that or maybe a combination of both skills i dont know but it was like trying to explain that there was a soul hovering over aunt katerines coffin either you knew the soul was there or you didnt words didnt quite cover it can you see ghosts you mean right now i smiled and shook my head no just in general well i knew the calvin house wasnt haunted no matter how many stories people made up but there was a little cave near town that had something in it something not nice was it a ghost he shrugged i never tried to find out but nobody else seemed able to feel it do you know when the soul leaves the body i mean can you tell it sure he said it like couldnt everybody do that i had to smile good enough im just going to do it i dont know what youll see if anything i know that raymond is going to be disappointed because he wont see anything unless hes a lot more talented than he looks what are you going to do anita they never talked about walking a cemetery in college its not like a magic spell a few words or gestures and it works it isnt anything like that i struggled to put into words something that we had no vocabulary for its closer to psychic ability than magic its not physical its not a muscle to move or even a thought its i just do it let me get started then if i can ill bring you in or try and talk to you while i do it okay he shrugged i guess so i still dont understand what the heck youre doing but thats okay i usually dont know whats going on but you always figure it out i said he grinned i do dont i you bet i stood in nearly the dead center of the raw earth not so long ago i was afraid of what i was about to do it wasnt really frightening in and of itself i was scared of the fact that i could do it at all it wasnt a very human thing to be able to do but then lately id been rethinking exactly what made you human and what made you one of the monsters once id been very sure of myself and everyone else i wasnt so sure anymore besides id been practicing of course id been practicing in empty graveyards where there was nothing but me and the dead okay night insects but arthropods never bothered my concentration people did even with my back turned i could feel larry like a warm presence behind me it bugged me can you move back farther sure how far i shook my head as far as you can get and still be in sight he raised his eyebrows do you want me to go over and wait with mr stirling if you can stand it i can stand it i schmooze clients better than you do that was the gods honest truth great when i call you over come slowly ive never tried to talk to someone while i do this whatever you say he gave a laugh that was almost nervous i cant wait to see this i let that go and turned away i walked away from him when i glanced back he was walking to the others i hoped larry wouldnt be disappointed i still wasnt sure if hed be able to even sense anything i turned my back on all of them seeing them huddled there would distract me that much i was sure of the top of the mountain had been stripped it was like standing on the edge of the world looking down the moonlight bathed everything in a soft glow it was so bright up here near the sky without any trees to hide it that the air itself glowed with diffused light a gentle wind traced just about headhigh it smelled green and fresh almost as if the rain had actually fallen i closed my eyes and let the wind touch my skin ruffle my hair there was almost no sound but the singing of insects from below nothing but the wind me and the dead i couldnt tell larry exactly how to do it because i wasnt completely sure myself if it was a muscle i would move it if it was a thought i would think it if it was a magic word i would say it it is none of those things it is like my skin opens up all my nerve endings naked to the wind my skin grew cool its like a cool wind emanates from my body it isnt really wind you cant see it you cant feel it or no one else can but its there its real the cool fingers of wind stretched outward from me within a ten to fifteenfoot radius i would be able to search the graves as i moved the circle would move with me searching i raised my arm and waved i didnt turn around to see if larry saw me i stayed tight inside my private circle i was holding it in trying not to start searching the dead until larry got over here i was hoping hed be able to sense what was going on seemed logical that it would be easier to figure out if he saw it from the beginning i heard his footsteps on the dry earth they seemed thunderously loud as if i could hear every grain of dirt under his shoes he stopped behind me jesus what is that what my voice sounded distant and loud at the same time wind a cold wind he sounded a little scared good you should always be a little afraid when you do magic its when you start taking it for granted that you get in trouble come closer but dont touch me i wasnt sure on that last but it sounded like a good idea better cautious than not he came slowly one hand held out like he was feeling the wind against his skin jesus mary and joseph anita its coming from you the wind is coming from you yes i said his eyes were wide he looked like his voice sounded a little scared if i stood right next to stirling he wouldnt feel a thing none of them would larry shook his head how could they miss it his hand hovered just off my body almost touching but not quite its colder or stronger or something the closer i get to your body interesting i said what now he asked now i touch the dead i let go of it like unclenching a hand the fingers of wind stretched downward how does it feel to go through solid earth and touch the dead beneath like nothing human it was as if the invisible fingers could melt through the dirt searching for the dead this time we didnt have to search far the earth was disturbed and the dead lay on top of the raw land id never tried this in anything but a wellorganized cemetery where each grave each body was distinct the wind touched larry like a stone in a stream the power rippled around him he was alive and it disturbed us but wed been practicing and we could work around him i was standing on top of bones under the earth where eyes could not see i tried to step off them and only stepped on more the earth was thick with bodies like raisins in a pudding no eating around them i stood on top on a raft of bones in a sea of dry red earth everywhere i touched was a bodya piece of bone there was no clear space no breathing space i stood there huddled in on myself trying to sort through what i was sensing the rib cage just to the left belonged with the thighbone yards away the wind leaked out and touched piece after piece i could have put the skeleton back together like a giant jigsaw puzzle that was what my power would do if i tried to raise it i moved stepping on the dead and everywhere i walked i put bodies together the pieces stayed separate but i remembered larry moved with me he moved surprisingly smoothly through the power like a swimmer leaving the smallest possible ripples behind a ghost flared to life like a pale dancing flame i walked towards it it rose like a swaying snake watching me without eyes there was that thread of hostility that some ghosts seem to feel towards the living a jealousy but if id been tied to some forsaken piece of earth for a hundred years or more i might be hostile too what is that larry whispered what do you see i asked i think its a ghost ive just never seen one materialize before he reached out as if to touch it i grabbed his wrist before he could ever have reached i felt his power flare to life in a rush of wind that should have poured my hair back from my face the circle suddenly widened like a camera lens spreading wide the dead awoke under our combined power like twigs touched by fire our power spread over them and they gave up their secrets bits of muscle withered to bone gaping skulls all the pieces were there all we had to do was call them forth two more ghosts rose from the ground like smoke it was a lot of active ghosts for this small and this old a cemetery and they were all angry at being disturbed the level of hostility was unusual combining our powers hadnt doubled the circleit had quadrupled it the nearest ghost stood like a white pillar of flame it was strong powerful a fullblown ghost in a graveyard that hadnt seen a burial in over two hundred years i stared at it larry stared at it as long as we didnt touch it we were safe heck we were safe even if we did touch it ghosts cant cause physical harm not really they can grab you but if you ignore them they fall away if you pay attention they can be bothersome frightening but if a spirit causes real harm it isnt just a ghost demon evil sorcerous dead but not a normal ghost staring at the wavering shape i wasnt at all sure this was a normal ghost ghosts wear out they fade to haunts which dont usually materialize hot spots that can give you a jolt then just shivery places ghosts do not last forever these looked pretty damn solid for ghosts stop a mans voice yelled larry and i turned towards the voice magnus bouvier scrambled up the side of the mountain opposite from where we had walked up his hair fell across his face hiding everything but his eyes from the moonlight his eyes glowed in the dark reflecting lights i could not see stop he was waving his hands his longsleeved shirt was untucked over jeans he hit the circle of wind and froze he put his hands up as if he was trying to touch it two people in one night who could sense the power unusual but sort of cool if magnus hadnt been on the run from the police we could have sat down and had a nice talk about it we told you to stay off this land mr bouvier stirling said bouvier looked at him turning his head slowly as if concentrating on anything besides the feel of power was hard weve tried being nice about this stirling said we are not going to be nice any longer beau the pump action on a shotgun is a very distinctive sound i turned towards the sound gun in hand i dont remember thinking about it i was just looking down the barrel of a gun at beau he was cradling a shotgun in his arms not aimed at anything that saved him i know if it had been pointed near us id have shot him i was still seeing double i could see the graveyard behind my eyes where there is no optic nerve the cemetery was mine i knew the bodies i knew the ghosts i knew where all the pieces lay i stared down the gun seeing beau and the shotgun but inside my head the dead still reached out for their scattered parts the ghosts were still real the power had agitated them theyd dance and sway on their own for a while but theyd fade back into the ground there was more than one way to raise the dead but not permanently i couldnt look away from the shotgun to see what bouvier was doing anita please dont raise the dead his surprisingly deep voice held a note of pleading i fought an urge to glance at him why not magnus get off my land stirling said this is not your land get off my land or you will be shot for trespassing beau glanced my way mr stirling he was being very careful that the shotgun stayed loose and harmless in his hands beau show him we mean business mr stirling he said again with a little more urgency in his voice do what i pay you for stirling said he started to raise the shotgun to his shoulder but slowly watching me dont do it i said i let my breath out all the way until my body was still and quiet there was nothing but the gun and what i was aiming at beau lowered the shotgun i took a breath and said put it on the ground now ms blake this is none of your business stirling said you are not going to shoot someone for trespassing on a piece of land while i watch larry had his gun out too now it wasnt pointed at anybody in particular which i was grateful for pointed guns have a tendency to go off if you dont know what youre doing on the ground beau now i wont ask a third time he laid the shotgun on the ground i pay your salary you dont pay me enough to get killed stirling made an exasperated sound and moved forward as if he would pick up the gun himself dont touch it raymond youll bleed just as easy as anybody else he turned to me i cannot believe that you would hold me at gunpoint on my own property i lowered my gun arm just a touch it gets shaky if you hold a shooting pose too long i cannot believe that you had beau come up here armed you knew my little show would attract bouvier you knew it and planned for it you coldblooded son of a bitch mr kirkland are you going to let her talk to me like that i am a client larry shook his head im with her on this one mr stirling you were going to ambush that man murder him why good question i said why are you so afraid of the bouvier family or is it just him that youre afraid of i am afraid of no one come along we will leave you to your new friend he marched away and the others followed beau sort of hesitated ill bring the shotgun down for you i said he nodded figured that and you better not be waiting down there with another gun he looked at me for a long minute at both of us he shook his head im going home to my wife you do that beau i said he walked away black slicker flapping against his legs he hesitated then said im out of it from now on money doesnt spend if youre dead i knew a few vampires that would argue with him but i said glad to hear it i just dont want to get shot he said he walked away down the slope out of sight i stood there with the browning pointed skyward i turned in a slow circle surveying the mountaintop we were alone the three of us so why didnt i want to put my gun up magnus took a step up the slope and stopped he raised slender hands towards the powercharged air he trailed fingertips down it like it was water i felt the ripples of his touch shiver down my skin tremble through my magic no i wasnt putting my gun up yet what was that larry asked his gun was still out pointed at the ground bouvier moved his gleaming eyes to larry he is not a necromancer anita but he is more than he seems arent we all i said why didnt you want me to raise the dead magnus he stared up at me his eyes were full of glinting lights like reflections in a pool but the reflections were of things that were not there answer me magnus or what he asked youll shoot me maybe i said the slope made him shorter than i was so i was looking down on him i didnt believe anyone could raise dead this old without a human sacrifice i thought youd take stirlings money try fail and go home he took a step forward trailing his hands through the power again as if he were testing it as if he werent sure he could cross into it the touch made larry gasp with this power you can raise some of them maybe enough of them magnus said enough for what i asked he stared up at me as if he hadnt meant to speak aloud you mustnt raise the dead on this mountain anita larry you must not give us a reason not to i said he smiled up at me i dont suppose just because i asked i shook my head not hardly this would be so much easier if glamor worked on you he took another step up the slope of course if glamor worked on you we wouldnt be here would we if he wouldnt answer one question id try another one whyd you run from the police he took another step closer and i backed up hed done nothing overtly threatening but there was something about him as he stood there something alien there were images in his eyes that made me want to glance behind to see what was reflecting in his eyes i could almost see trees water it was like the things you see out of the corner of your eye except in color you told the police my secret why i had to you really think i did those awful things to those boys he took another step moving into the flow of power but he didnt slip easily as larry had magnus was like a mountain huge forcing the power to go wide around him as if he filled more space magically than could be seen with the naked eye i pointed the browning twohanded at his chest no i dont then why point a gun at me why all this fey magic shit he smiled i performed a lot of glamor tonight its like a high you feed off your customers i said you dont just do it for business you siphon them thats fucking unseelie court he gave a graceful shrug i am what i am howd you know the victims were boys i asked larry moved to my left gun pointed carefully at the ground id yelled at him for pointing guns at people too soon the police said so liar he smiled gently one of them touched me i saw it all convenient i said he reached out towards me dont even think it larry pointed his gun at magnus whats going on anita im not sure i cant allow you to raise the dead here i am sorry how are you going to stop us i asked he stared at me and i felt something push against my magic like something large swimming just out of sight in the dark it made me gasp freeze right there or i will pull this trigger i havent moved a muscle he said softly no games magnus youre too damn close to being dead what did he just do larry asked there was a fine tremor in his twohanded grip later i said clasp your hands on top of your head magnus slowly very slowly are you going to take me in as they say on television yeah i said youve got a better chance of getting to the jail alive with me than with most of the cops i dont think ill go with you staring down two guns and he still sounded sure of himself he was either stupid or knew something i didnt i didnt think he was stupid tell me when to shoot him larry said when i shoot him you can shoot him too okay larry said magnus looked from one to the other of us you would take my life for such a small thing in a heartbeat i said now clasp your hands slowly on top of your head if i dont i dont bluff magnus do you have silver bullets in those guns i just stared at him i could feel larry shift slightly beside me you can only point a gun so long without getting tired or antsy ill bet theyre silver silver isnt very effective against fairies cold iron works best i said i remember even normal lead bullets would be better than silver the metal of the moon is a friend to the fey hands now or we find out how fairie flesh holds up to silver bullets he raised his hands slowly gracefully upward his hands were above shoulder level when he threw himself backwards falling down the slope i fired but he kept on rolling down the earth and somehow i couldnt quite see him it was like the air blurred around him larry and i stood at the top of the slope and fired down on him and i dont think either of us hit him he scrambled down the raw earth faster than he looked because he got harder to see even in the moonlight until he vanished into the underbrush left near the midpoint on that side please tell me he didnt just go poof larry said he didnt just go poof i said what did he do then how the hell do i know this wasnt covered in fairies i shook my head lets get out of here i dont know whats going on but whatever it is i think we lost our client you think we lost our hotel rooms i dont know larry lets go find out i clicked the safety on the browning but left it out in my hand id have left the safety off but that didnt seem wise while stumbling down a rocky mountainside even in the moonlight i think you can put the gun up now larry he hadnt put his safety on you arent but ive got the safety on oh he looked a little sheepish but he clicked the safety on and holstered it you think they would have really killed him i dont know maybe beau would have shot at him but see how much good it did us why does stirling want magnus dead i dont know why did magnus run from the police i dont know it makes me nervous when you keep answering all my questions with i dont know me too i said i glanced back once just before we lost sight of the mountaintop the ghosts twisted and flared like candle flames cool white flames i knew something else i hadnt known before tonight some of the bodies were nearly three hundred years old a hundred years older than stirling had told us they were a hundred years makes a lot of difference in a zombie raising why had he lied afraid id refuse maybe maybe some of the bodies were indian remains bits and pieces of jewelry animal bone stuff that wasnt european the indians in this area didnt bury their dead at least not in simple graves and this wasnt a mound something was going on and i didnt have the faintest idea what it was but id find out maybe tomorrow after we got new hotel rooms gave back the nifty jeep rented a new car and told bert we no longer had a client maybe id let larry break the news to him what are apprentices for if they cant do some of the grunt work okay okay id tell bert myself but i wasnt looking forward to it stirling and co were gone when we trudged down off the mountain we drove the jeep back to the hotel i was frankly surprised they hadnt taken the jeep with them and left us to walk stirling didnt strike me as a man who liked having guns pointed at him but then who does larrys room was first down the hall he hesitated with his room card in the lock you think the rooms are paid for tonight or do we pack we pack i said he nodded and shoved the card in its little slot the door handle turned and in he went i went to the next door and put in my own card there was a connecting door between the rooms we hadnt unlocked it but it was there personally i liked my privacy even from my friends and especially from my coworkers the rooms silence flowed around me it was wonderful a few minutes of quiet before i faced bert and told him all that money had just flown the coop the room was a suite with an outer room and a separate bedroom my apartment wasnt much bigger there was a bar set into the lefthand wall being a teetotaler that was a real plus for me the walls were a soft pink with a delicate pattern of giltedged leaves the carpet a deep burgundy the fullsized couch was a purple so dark it looked nearly black a love seat matched it two armchairs were done in a purple burgundy and white floral pattern all exposed wood was very dark and highly polished i had suspected i had some kind of honeymoon suite until i saw larrys room it was nearly a mirror of mine but done in shades of green a cherrywood desk that looked like a genuine antique sat against the far wall the connecting door was beside it but opened opposite so you wouldnt accidentally bump the desk monogrammed stationery graced the desk along with a second telephone line for your modem i guess i dont know if id ever stayed in a room this expensive i doubted seriously if beadle beadle stirling and lowenstein would want to pick up the tab now a sound jerked me around the browning sort of materialized in my hand i was staring down the barrel at jeanclaude he stood in the doorway leading to the bedroom the shirt had long full sleeves that had been gathered in three puffs down the length of the arm to end in a spill of cloth that framed his long pale fingers the collar was high and tied with a white cravat that spilled lace down the front of him tucked into a vest it was black and velvety with pinpricks of silver on it thighhigh black boots fit his legs like a second skin his hair was nearly as black as the vest making it hard to tell where the curls ended and the velvety cloth began a silver and onyx stickpin that id seen before pierced the white lace at his chest well ma petite are you going to shoot me i was still standing there with the gun pointed at him he had not moved he had been very careful to do nothing that could be taken as threatening his blue blue eyes stared at me serious waiting i pointed the gun at the ceiling and let out a breath i hadnt realized i was holding how the hell did you get in here he smiled then and pushed away from the doorjamb he walked into the room with that wonderful gliding motion of his part cat part dancer part something else whatever the else was it wasnt human i put the gun away though i wasnt sure i wanted to it made me feel better having it in my hand trouble was a gun wouldnt help me against jeanclaude oh if i was going to kill him it would but thats not what we were doing lately lately we weredating can you stand it i wasnt sure i could the desk clerk let me in his voice was very mild amused whether with himself or with me it was hard to tell why would he do that because i asked him to he walked around me like a shark circling its prey i didnt turn with him i stared straight ahead and let him circle me it would only amuse him if i kept him in sight the hairs at the back of my neck stood up i took a step forward and felt his hand fall back hed been about to touch my shoulder i didnt want him to touch me you used mind tricks on the desk clerk yes he said that one word was full of so much more i turned towards him so i could see his face he was staring at my legs he raised his face to mine and somehow that one quick gaze took in my entire body his midnight blue eyes looked even darker than usual we werent sure how i was able to meet his gaze i was beginning to suspect that being a necromancer had more fringe benefits than just being good with zombies red becomes you ma petite his voice had grown softer deeper he moved closer to me not touching he knew better than that but somehow his eyes showed where his hands wanted to be i like this very much his voice was soft and warm and far more intimate than his words your legs are wonderful his words were growing softer a whisper in the dark that hovered around my body like a line of warmth his voice was always like that touchable he still had the best voice id ever heard stop it jeanclaude im too short to have wonderful legs i do not understand this modern obsession with height he ran his hands just above my hose so close i could almost feel it like a breath of warmth against my skin stop it i said stop what his voice was utterly mild harmless riight i shook my head asking jeanclaude not to be a pain in the ass was like asking rain not to be wet why try fine flirt all you want but keep in mind that youre here to save the life of a young boy a young boy who may be being raped while we sit here and waste time he sighed deeply and walked towards me something must have shown on my face because he sat down in the other chair not trying to come closer you have a habit ma petite of taking all the fun out of seducing you yippee i said now can we get down to business he smiled his lovely perfect smile i had arranged to meet with the master of branson tonight just like that i said isnt that what you wanted me to do he asked his voice held that amused edge again yeah im just not used to you giving me exactly what i ask for i would give you anything you wanted ma petite if you would only let me i wanted you out of my life you dont seem to want to do that he sighed no ma petite i do not want to do that he let it go at that no accusations about me wanting to be with richard instead of him no vague threats on richards life it was sort of odd youre up to something i said he turned eyes wide long fingers pressed to his heart moi yeah you i said i shook my head and let it go he was up to something i knew him well enough to know the signs but i also knew him well enough to know that he wouldnt tell me until he was good and ready nobody kept a secret like jeanclaude and nobody else had as many of them there was no deceit in richard jeanclaude lived and breathed it ive got to change and pack before we can leave change your lovely red skirt why because i like it not just that i said though admittedly its a plus i cant wear my inner pants holster with the skirt i will not argue that having a second gun will help our show of force tomorrow night i stopped and turned what do you mean tomorrow night he spread his hands wide it is too close to dawn ma petite we cannot even drive to the masters lair before the sun rises dammit i said softly and with feeling i did my part ma petite but even i cannot stop the sun from rising i leaned against the back of the love seat hands gripping the edge hard enough to hurt i shook my head were going to be too late to save him ma petite ma petite he knelt in front of me staring up at me why does this boy bother you so very much why is his life so precious to you i stared down into jeanclaudes perfect face and had no answer i dont know he laid his hands on top of my hands youre hurting yourself ma petite i moved my hands out from under his crossing my arms over my stomach jeanclaude remained kneeling a hand on either side of me he was entirely too close to me and i was suddenly very aware of how short the skirt was i have to go pack i said why dont you like your room without moving he seemed closer somehow i could feel the line of his body against my legs like heat move i said he leaned backwards sitting on his heels forcing me to move past him the hem of my skirt brushed his cheek as i walked past you are such a pain in the ass so nice of you to notice ma petite now why are you leaving this lovely room a clients paying for the room and hes not a client anymore why ever not ma petite i pulled a gun on him his eyes widened his face a perfect mask of surprise the mask slipped and he stared at me with ancient eyes eyes that had seen much but still didnt know what to make of me why would you do that they were going to shoot a man for trespassing was he trespassing technically yeah jeanclaude just looked at me does he not have the right to protect his own land no not if it means killing people a piece of land isnt worth killing over protecting our lands has been a valid excuse for slaughter since the beginning of time ma petite did you suddenly change the rules i wasnt going to stand there and watch them kill a man for walking on a piece of ground besides i think it was a setup a setup you mean a plot to kill the man yeah were you part of this plot i may have been bait he could feel my power over the dead it called to him now that is interesting what is this mans name you give me the name of the mystery vampire first xavier he said just like that why wouldnt you give me the name earlier i do not want the police to have it why not i explained all that now the name of the man you saved tonight i stared at him and didnt want to give it to him i didnt like how interested he was in the name but a deal was a deal bouvier magnus bouvier i do not know the name should you he just smiled at me it meant nothing and everything you are an irritating son of a bitch ah ma petite how can i resist you when you whisper such sweet endearments to me i glared at him which made him smile wider there was just the faintest hint of fang peeking into view someone knocked on the door probably the manager telling me to get out i walked to the door i didnt bother looking through the peephole so i was caught off guard by who was outside it was lionel bayard had he come to throw us out in person i stood there for a second looking at him he spoke first clearing his throat nervously ms blake may i speak with you for a moment he was being awfully polite for someone who had come to kick us out im listening mr bayard i really dont think the hallway is the place to discuss this i stepped to one side ushering him into the room he stepped past me hands smoothing his tie his gaze flicked to jeanclaude who was standing now jeanclaude smiled at bayard pleasant charming i didnt realize you had company ms blake i can come back i closed the door no mr bayard its all right i told jeanclaude about our misunderstanding this evening ah yes uh bayard looked from one to the other of us as if not sure what to say jeanclaude didnt so much sit in the chair as fold his body around it the movement was almost catlike anita and i have no secrets from one another mr bayard lionel bayard he walked over and offered his hand to jeanclaude jeanclaude raised an eyebrow but took the offered hand the handshake seemed to make bayard feel better a normal gesture he didnt know what jeanclaude was how he could look at him and think him human was beyond me id only seen one vampire that could have passed for human and he hadnt been human at all bayard turned back to me adjusting his glasses which didnt need adjusting that nervous little gesture again something was up whats up bayard i asked id closed the door and was leaning to one side of it arms crossed over my stomach im here to offer our most sincere apologies for earlier tonight i just stared at him youre apologizing to me yes mr stirling was overzealous why if you had not been there to bring us all to our senses a great tragedy might have occurred i tried to keep my face blank i wanted to frown at him or look confused stirlings not mad at me on the contrary ms blake hes grateful to you i didnt believe that really i said oh yes in fact ive been authorized to offer you a bonus why to make up for our behavior tonight your behavior was fine i said he smiled modestly his act was about as sincere as faux pearls but not half so realistic how much is the bonus twenty thousand he said i stayed leaning against the wall staring at him no he blinked at me excuse me i dont want the bonus im not authorized to go higher than twenty thousand but i could speak with mr stirling perhaps he would go higher i shook my head and pushed away from the wall i dont want more money i dont want the bonus at all you arent quitting on us are you ms blake he was blinking so fast i thought hed pass out me quitting bothered him a lot no im not quitting but youre already paying an enormous fee you dont need to pay more mr stirling is just very anxious that he has not offended you i let that one go too easy tell mr stirling id have thought better of his apology if it had been delivered in person mr stirling is a very busy man he would have come himself but he had pressing business i wondered how often bayard had to apologize for the big man i wondered how often the apology was for telling a fellow flunkie to shoot someone fine youve delivered the message tell mr stirling that it isnt the gunfight thats going to make me bail i read the cemetery tonight some of the corpses are closer to three hundred than two hundred three hundred years lionel thats an old zombie can you raise them he had stepped closer hands fidgeting with his lapels he was close to invading my space id have rather had jeanclaude next to me maybe the question isnt can i but will i lionel what do you mean you lied to me lionel you underestimated the age of the dead by nearly a century not deliberately ms blake i assure you i merely repeated what our research department told me i did not deliberately mislead you sure he reached out almost like he wanted to touch me i moved back just enough he seemed terribly intense he let his hand drop please ms blake i did not lie on purpose the problem lionel is that im not sure i can raise zombies this old without a human sacrifice even i have my limits so nice to know jeanclaude said softly i frowned at him he smiled you will try wont you ms blake maybe i havent decided yet he shook his head we will do anything to make this oversight up to you ms blake it is entirely my fault that i did not doublecheck the research departments findings is there anything that i can do personally to make it up to you just leave ill call your office tomorrow to discuss details i may need some extra paraphernalia to attempt the raising anything anything at all ms blake fine ill call i opened the door and stood by it i thought it was enough of a hint it was bayard went to the door and almost backed out apologizing as he went i closed the door and stood there for a minute that little man is up to something jeanclaude said i turned and looked at him he was still curled in the chair looking scrumptious i didnt need vampiric powers to tell me that neither he said did i he rose from the chair easily if id curled up in a chair like that id have been stiff ive got to tell larry that he can stop packing i dont understand why were still hired but we are can anyone else raise the graveyard not without a human sacrifice maybe not even then i said they need you ma petite from the little mans anxiety they must need the dead raised very badly millions of dollars are at stake i do not think money is all that is at stake he said i shook my head me either he came to join me by the door what extra paraphernalia will you need to raise a threehundredyearold corpse ma petite i shrugged a bigger death id originally thought to use a couple of goats i opened the door what are you thinking about using now an elephant maybe i said we were out in the hall and he was staring at me im kidding honest besides elephants are an endangered species i was thinking maybe a cow jeanclaude stared down at me for a long space of moments his face very serious remember ma petite i can tell if you are lying whats that supposed to mean you meant the elephant comment i frowned up at him what could i say okay but just for a minute i wouldnt really do in an elephant im telling the truth yes ma petite i know i hadnt really meant the crack about the elephant not really it was just the biggest animal i could think of on short notice and if i was going to attempt to raise several threehundredyearold corpses i was going to need something big i didnt think a cow would do hell i didnt think a herd of cows would do it i just hadnt thought of a good alternative yet but no elephants i promise besides can you imagine trying to slit the throat of an elephant the logistics of just getting one to hold still while you killed it were mind boggling theres a reason why most sacrifices are our size or smaller makes it easier to hold them down we cant just leave jeff with that monster larry said he was standing in the middle of his forest green carpet jeanclaude was sitting in the corner of the green patterned couch he was looking amused like a cat that had found a very interesting mouse we arent leaving him i said we just cant go looking for him tonight he whirled and pointed a finger at jeanclaude why because he says so jeanclaudes smile widened definitely amused check the time larry itll be dawn soon all the vampires will be asnooze in their coffins larry shook his head the look on his face reminded me of me stubborn not wanting to accept it we have to do something anita we cant talk to vampires during daylight hours larry thats just the way it is and what happens to jeff today while we wait for the sun to go down his pale skin had gone almost white his freckles looked like brown ink spots his pale blue eyes glittered like angry glass id never seen larry so mad hell id never seen him angry i glanced at jeanclaude he just looked at me i was on my own wasnt i always xavier will have to sleep he wont be able to harm jeff once the sun rises larry shook his head will we get him back in time i wanted to say sure but i wouldnt lie i dont know i hope so his soft howdydoody face was set in very stubborn lines i looked at him and understood why so many people underestimate me he looked so harmless hell he was sort of harmless but he was armed now and learning how to be dangerous and in his face for the first time i saw a grim purpose building id planned on leaving him behind when i went to talk to the master of branson looking at him now i wasnt sure he was going to let me do that hed had his first vampire hunt tonight id managed to keep him out of the rough stuff until now but it wasnt going to last id been hoping hed give up the idea of hunting vampires staring into his glittering eyes i realized i was the one who was fooling myself in his own way larry was as stubborn as i was frightening thought that but for tonight he was safe you couldnt just comfort me tell me well find him larry asked i smiled i try not to lie to you if i can avoid it for once larry said id have liked to have heard the lie sorry i said he took in a deep breath and let it out slow his anger was gone just like that larry didnt know what it was to hold onto his rage he didnt brood over things one of the main differences between us i never forgave anyone for anything a character flaw to be sure but hell everyones got to have at least one there was a knock on the door larry went for the door jeanclaude was suddenly standing by me i hadnt seen him move hadnt heard his leather boots slither over the carpet nothing magic my heart was suddenly thudding in my throat stomp your feet or something when you do that do what ma petite i glared up at him that wasnt a mind trick was it no he said that one word slithered across my skin like a low creeping breeze damn you i said softly and with feeling he smiled weve been over that ma petite you are too late larry had closed the door theres a guy out in the hall says hes with jeanclaude a guy or a vampire i asked larry frowned not a vampire but if you mean human i wouldnt go that far you expecting company i asked yes i am who he stalked to the door and put a hand on the doorknob someone i believe youve already met he opened the door with a flourish stepping to one side to let me have a clear view jason stood in the open door smiling relaxed he was my height exactly not something you find in a man often straight blond hair barely touched the top of his collar his eyes were the innocent blue of spring skies the last time id seen him hed been trying to eat me werewolves will do that sometimes he was dressed in an oversized black sweater that hit him almost at midthigh hed had to roll the sleeves over his wrists his pants were leather laced up the side from waist to midcalf where the laces vanished into boots the lacings were loose enough that there was a pale line of flesh all the way down hello anita hi jason what are you doing here he had the grace to look embarrassed im jeanclaudes new pet he said the last word like it was alright richard wouldnt have said it that way you didnt tell me you brought company i said we are going to be calling on the master of the city we must make a good show of it so a werewolf and what me he sighed yes ma petite whether you bear my marks or not most consider you my human servant he raised a hand please anita i know you are not my human servant in the technical sense but you have helped me defend my territory you have killed to protect me that is the best definition of what a human servant does so what i have to pretend to be your human servant on this visit something like that he said forget it anita i need a show of strength here branson was part of nikolaoss territory i gave it up because the population density could support another group but it was still my land and now its not some view that as weakness rather than practicality so without any marks at all youve finally got me to play servant for you you manipulative son of a bitch you asked me down here ma petite a thread of warmth cut through his words he stalked towards me i am doing you a favor do not forget that i dont think youll let me forget i said he made a harsh sound as if he had no words for his anger why do i put up with you you insult me at every turn there are many who would give their souls for what i offer you he stood in front of me eyes like dark sapphires skin white as marble his skin glowed like there was a light inside him he looked like some kind of live sculpture made of light jewels and stone he was impressive and scary but id seen it before cut the vampire powers shit jeanclaude its almost dawn dont you have a coffin to crawl into somewhere he laughed but it wasnt pleasant it was bitter like the touch of steel wool something to irritate rather than entice our luggage has not arrived has it my wolf no master jason said your coffin hasnt arrived i asked either i have chosen a very lax skycab or he let the words trail off face bland and pleasant or what larry asked ma petite you think the local master took your coffin i said a punishment for entering her territory without observing all the social niceties he looked at me when he said it i suppose thats my fault i said he gave that infuriating shrug i could have said no ma petite stop being so civilized about it would you be happier if i was angry his voice was very mild when he said it maybe i said it would have made me feel less guilty but i didnt say that out loud go to the airport and find our luggage if you can jason bring it back to anitas room wait a minute you are not moving into my room it is nearly dawn ma petite i have no choice tomorrow we will find other accommodations you planned this he gave a short bitter laugh even my deviousness knows some bounds ma petite i would not willingly be without my coffin this close to dawn what are you going to do without your coffin larry asked he looked anxious jeanclaude smiled do not fear lawrence all i need is darkness or rather lack of sunlight the coffin itself is not absolutely necessary simply more secure ive never known a vampire that didnt sleep in a coffin i said if i am underground in a secure place i forego my coffin though truthfully once daylight finds me i am insensible and could sleep on a bed of nails and not know it i wasnt sure i believed him he worked harder than most at passing for human you will see the truth of my words soon enough ma petite thats what im afraid of i said you can sleep on the couch if you prefer but i am telling you truly that once full daylight arrives i will be harmless helpless if you like i would be unable to molest you even if i wanted to and what other fairy tales am i supposed to believe ive seen you move around after dawn hidden from light but you worked just fine after eight hours or so of sleep if it is still daylight i can move around true but i doubt you will stay abed for eight hours you have clients or something a murder investigation some business that will take you out and about if i leave you alone wholl see that some maid doesnt come in pull the curtains back and french fry you the smile widened concern over my wellbeing i am touched i looked at him he looked pleasant amused but it was a mask his expression when he didnt want you to know what he was thinking but didnt want you to know that he didnt want you to know what are you up to for once ma petite nothing yeah right if i find the coffin ill need to rent a truck jason said you can use our jeep larry said i glared at him no he cant think of it as expediency ma petite if jason must rent a truck then i may have to spend another day in your bed i know you do not want that there was amusement in his voice and an undercurrent of something else it might have been bitterness ill drive larry said no you wont i said its almost dawn anita ill be alright i shook my head no you cant treat me like a kid brother forever i can drive the jeep i promise not to eat him jason said larry held out his hand for the keys you have to trust me sometime i just looked at him i promise to shoot anything human or monster that threatens me while im gone he made the boy scout sign three fingers to heaven you can bail me out of jail and explain that i was just following orders i sighed alright dammit i gave him the keys he grinned at me thanks i shook my head just hurry back okay anything you say just get out of here and be careful larry left with jason trailing behind i stared at the door after it closed wondering if i should have gone with them knowing that larry would have gotten mad but mad was better than dead hell it was a simple errand go to the airport and pick up a coffin what could go wrong with less than an hour of darkness left shit you cannot protect him anita i can try jeanclaude gave that infuriating shrug that meant anything you wanted it to mean and nothing at all shall we retire to your room ma petite i opened my mouth to tell him he could bunk with larry but didnt say it i didnt really believe hed munch on larry but i was sure he wouldnt munch on me sure i said he looked a little surprised as if hed expected an argument but i was all out of argument tonight he could have the bed id take the couch what could be more innocent biker nuns from hell but besides that i could feel dawn pressing against the windows like a cool hand when we got back to my room it was very near jeanclaude smiled at me the first time i manage to share a hotel room with you and there is no time he gave an elaborate sigh things never work as i plan with you ma petite maybe thats a hint i said perhaps he glanced at the closed drapes i must go ma petite until darkness he shut the bedroom door a little hurriedly i could feel the coming light pressing around the building id noticed over the years of hunting vamps that id become aware of dawn and sunset there had been times when id struggled from disaster to disaster just to stay alive until that soft growing pressure of light could sweep the sky and save my cookies for the first time i wondered what it would be like to see it as a danger instead of a blessing after hed closed the door i realized my suitcase was in the bedroom damn i hesitated and finally knocked no answer i opened the door just a crack then farther he wasnt in there water ran in the bathroom a line of light showed under the door what did vampires do in bathrooms better not to know i grabbed my suitcase from the floor and carried it out before the bathroom door could open i did not want to see him again i did not want to see what happened to him when the sun rose when the sun had risen enough to pulse against the closed drapes like pale lemon liquid i changed into a tshirt and jeans i had a robe with me but if i was going to greet both larry and jason i wanted to be wearing some pants i called down for extra blankets and a pillow no one bitched that it was a quarter past dawn and a strange time to need bedclothes they just brought the stuff true class the maid didnt even glance at the closed bedroom door i spread the blanket on the couch and stared at it it was a pretty couch but didnt look terribly comfortable oh well virtue had its punishments of course maybe it wasnt virtue that kept me out of the bedroom if it had been richard curled up in the next room then only moral fortitude would have kept me out with jeanclaude i had never seen him after dawn when he was dead to the world i wasnt sure i wanted to see i knew i didnt want to cuddle up next to him while the warmth left his body there was a knock on the door i hesitated it was probably larry but then again i went to the door with the browning naked in my hand beau had had a shotgun last night paranoia or caution hard to tell the difference sometimes i stood to one side of the door and said yes anita its us i hit the safety and put the barrel of the browning down the front of my jeans it was too big a gun to wear in an inner pants holster but for temporary holding that worked i opened the door larry leaned against the doorjamb looking rumpled and tired he had a mcdonalds sack in one hand and four cups shoved into one of those styrofoam holders two of the cups held coffee the other two sodas jason had a large leather suitcase under each arm a battered much smaller suitcase in his right hand and a second mcdonalds bag in his left he didnt look the least bit tired a morning person even after no sleep at all it was disgusting his eyes flicked to the gun shoved in my waistband he noticed but he didnt comment point for him larry never even blinked at the gun food i asked i didnt eat much last night besides jason was hungry too larry said he came inside putting the drinks and food on the wet bar none of us drank good to use the bar for something jason walked through the door sideways with the suitcases and food but there was no effort to it he wasnt straining one little bit to carry it all showoff i said he sat the luggage on the floor this isnt even close to showing off he said i locked the door behind them i suppose you can bring the coffin up singlehandedly no but not because its heavy its just too long the balance isnt right great super werewolf though for all i knew all lycanthropes could lift that much weight maybe richard could lift coffins with one arm it was not a comforting thought jason started laying food out on the bar larry had already climbed onto one of the bar stools he was pouring sugar into one of the coffees did you just leave the coffin in the lobby i asked i had to lay the browning on the bar to sit down i was just too shortwaisted to have it down my pants larry sat the unopened coffee in front of me its missing i stared at him you found the suitcases but not the coffin yep jason said as he finished dividing the food into three piles hed pushed some of it in front of both of us but the lions share was in front of him how can you eat this early in the morning im always hungry he said he looked at me sort of expectantly i let it slide it was too easy come on i fed you that one he said you dont seem particularly worried i said he shrugged and slid onto a bar stool what do you want me to say ive seen some weird shit since i became a werewolf if i got hysterical every time something went wrong every time someone i knew died id be in the loony bin by now i thought fights for dominance in the pack except for pack leader werent to the death i said people forget he said ill have to talk to richard when i get back in town he hasnt been mentioning any of this nothing to mention jason said just business as usual great did anybody see who took the coffin larry answered his voice sluggish even with the caffeine and sugar theres only so much you can do on no sleep at all no one saw anybody take it in fact the only guy left from the night shift said i just turned away for a second and it wasnt there just the luggage standing there by itself shit i said why take the coffin he asked he drank most of his coffee his egg mcmuffin sat untouched in front of him theyd put hotcakes in front of me with a little tub of syrup beside it your breakfast is getting cold jason said he was enjoying himself too much i frowned at him but i opened my coffee i didnt want the food i think the master is flexing a little muscle what do you think jason i kept my voice casual he smiled at me around a mouthful of food swallowed and said i think whatever jeanclaude wants me to think maybe my voice had been too casual i should really give up on subtlety i just wasnt good enough at it did he tell you not to talk to me no just to be careful what i said he says jump and you say how high is that it thats it he ate a bite of scrambled egg his face peaceful doesnt that bother you i dont make the rules anita im not an alpha anything and it doesnt bother you i asked he shrugged sometimes but theres nothing i can do about it why fight it i dont understand that at all larry said me either you dont have to understand it he said he couldnt have been more than twenty but the look in his eyes wasnt young it was the look of someone whod seen a lot done a lot and not all of it nice it was the look i was dreading to see on larrys face someday they were nearly the same age what had people been doing to jason to give him such jaded eyes what do we do now larry asked youre the vampire experts im just jeanclaudes pet he said it like it didnt bother him it would have bothered me i shook my head im going to call the cops then get some sleep what are you going to tell them jason asked im going to tell them about xavier did jeanclaude say you could tell the cops i looked at him i didnt ask for permission jeanclaude wouldnt like you bringing in the police i just stared at him he blinked at me dont do it just because i said that please he knows you pretty well for someone whos only met you twice larry said three times i said two out of three times hes tried to eat me larrys eyes widened a little youre kidding she just looks so tasty jason said ive had about enough of you i said whats wrong jeanclaude and richard both tease you im dating both of them i said im not dating you maybe youve got a thing for monsters i can be just as scary as the next guy i stared at him no i said you cant thats why youre not alpha thats why youre jeanclaudes pet because you arent scary enough something flowed through his pale blue eyes something angry and dangerous sitting there with his forkful of scrambled eggs and a coke in one hand he was suddenly different it was hard to put into words but it raised the hair on the back of my neck ease down wolfboy i said my voice was soft careful i was sitting less than a foot away from him at this distance he could jump me easy the browning was an inch away from my right hand but i knew better i might grab the gun but id never get it pointed in time id seen him move before and i wasnt quick enough lack of sleep was making me trusting or stupid same thing a low trickling growl rumbled out of him my pulse beat a little faster larrys gun was suddenly pointing past my nose at the werewolfs face dont larry said his voice was low and even and very damn serious i eased back off the bar stool bringing the browning with me didnt really want larrys gun to go off right next to my face i pointed my gun at jasons chest onehanded almost casual dont ever threaten me again jason stared at me his beast lurked just behind his eyes like a wave rushing towards the shore you start going furry and i wont wait to find out if youre bluffing i said larry had one knee on the bar stool gun still pointed nice and steady i hoped he didnt fall off the bar stool and accidentally shoot jason if he shot him i wanted it to be on purpose jasons shoulders relaxed his hands unclenched leaving the fork and the drink on the bar he closed his eyes and sat very still for nearly a full minute larry and i waited guns still pointed larrys eyes flicked to me i shook my head jason opened his eyes and let out a deep sighing breath he looked normal again that tension drained away he grinned i had to try i took another step back putting my back to the wall out of reach i lowered the gun larry hesitated but followed my lead so you tried now what he shrugged youre dominant to me just like that i said would you be happier if i made you fight me i shook my head but i backed her up larry said she didnt do it alone doesnt matter youre loyal to her would risk your life for her theres more to being dominant than just muscle or guns larry looked puzzled what do you mean dominant i feel like im missing part of the conversation why are you working so damn hard at not being human jason i asked he smiled and went back to his breakfast answer me jason he finished off his eggs and said no whats going on larry said mind games i said larry made an exasperated noise someone explain to me why we had to pull a gun on someone whos supposed to be on our side jeanclaude keeps telling me richard isnt any more human than he is jasons little display helps emphasize that doesnt it wolfboy jason ate the rest of his food like we werent there answer me i said he turned on the bar stool putting his elbows behind him i have too many masters now anita i dont need another one and ive got too many monsters messing with me right now dont add yourself to the list jason is it a short list he asked gets shorter all the time i said he smiled and slid off the bar stool is anybody tired but me larry and i stared at him the werewolf didnt look tiredmore than i could say for us mere humans jason wasnt going to answer my questions and they werent important enough to shoot him over stalemate fine where are you sleeping i asked if you trust me not to eat him in larrys room no way i said you want me here with you i told him he could stay in my room on the ride over larry said that was before he pulled the werewolf crap i said larry shrugged youve got the master of the city tucked into your bed i think i can handle one werewolf i didnt think so but i didnt want to discuss it in front of the werewolf no larry he was instantly angry what do i have to do to prove myself to you stay alive i said whats that supposed to mean youre not a shooter larry i was willing to shoot him larry pointed to the smiling werewolf i know because im not triggerhappy you dont trust me to handle myself i sighed larry please if jason turned furry in the middle of the day and killed you i couldnt live with myself and if he kills you larry said he wont why not larry asked because jeanclaude would kill him if he hurt you id kill him but i dont know if jeanclaude would avenge you jasons more frightened of jeanclaude than he is of me arent you jason jason had sat down on the end of the couch on my blanket oh yes i dont know why larry said youre the one who kills for jeanclaude he never seems to kill anyone on his own larry who would you be more afraid of jeanclaude or me you wouldnt hurt me he said if you had to face one of us which would you prefer larry looked at me for a long time the anger drained away replaced by something tired and old in his eyes him for gods sake why i asked ive seen you kill a lot of people anita a lot more than jeanclaude he might try to frighten me to death but youd just kill me my mouth was open just a little if you really believe that im more dangerous than jeanclaude then you havent been paying attention i didnt say you were more dangerous i said youd kill me quicker thats why im not as afraid of anita as i am of jeanclaude jason said larry looked at him what do you mean all shell do is kill me quick neat jeanclaude wouldnt kill me quick or easy hed make sure it hurt the two men stared at each other each ones logic was sound as far as it went i was with jason if you really believe what youre saying larry then you havent seen enough vampires how am i ever going to see enough vampires if you keep me at arms length anita had i really kept him out of it that much had i overprotected him let him see my ruthlessness but not jeanclaudes and im going to the masters tomorrow night you are not leaving me behind anymore youre right i said the answer seemed to surprise both of them if you really believe that id kill someone quicker than jeanclaude would i have overprotected you you have to understand how dangerous they are larry how deadly or someday i wont be around and youll get killed i took a deep breath and let it out slowly my stomach was tight with fear fear that larry would get killed because id kept him out of it it was something i hadnt anticipated come on jason larry said jason stood up no tomorrow you can be assdeep in vampires with me watching until you understand how dangerous the monsters are i dont want you alone with them his eyes were angry and hurt id undercut his confidence his selfesteem but what else could i do larry turned abruptly on his heel and left he didnt argue he didnt say goodbye he slammed the door behind him and i fought an urge to follow him what could i say i leaned my forehead against the door and whispered damn do i get the couch jason asked i turned and leaned against the door i still had the browning in my hand though i wasnt sure why anymore i was getting tired sloppy no i get the couch where do you want me then i dont care just not near me he ran his hands down the edge of the blanket running the cloth between his fingers if youre really sleeping out here id just as soon have the bed its taken i said how big is the bed kingsize but what difference does it make jeanclaude wont mind if i share with him hed prefer it was you but he shrugged i looked at him at his tranquil pleasant face is this the first time youve shared a bed with jeanclaude no he said it must have shown on my face because he lowered the high neck of the sweater enough for me to see two fang marks i pushed away from the wall and walked closer close enough to see that the bite was almost healed sometimes he likes a snack when he first wakes up jason said jesus i said jason let go of the collar and it slid over the bite like it wasnt there the same way youd hide a hickey jason sat there looking harmless he was exactly my height and had the face of a knowledgeable angel richard didnt let jeanclaude snack on him i said no he said no thats all you have to say what do you want me to say anita i thought about that for a second i want you to be outraged angry why i shook my head go to bed jason youre making me tired he went into the bedroom without another word i didnt peek to see if he changed into a wolf and curled up on the carpet or if he crawled into bed beside the corpse none of my business or at least nothing i wanted to see i put the browning under the pillow with the safety on at home with the gun in the special holster id added to the headboard of the bed the safety would have been off but id look pretty silly if i accidentally shot myself during the nightdaytrying to protect myself from werewolves the firestar i put under the couch cushion safety on normally it would have been in my luggage but i was feeling just a little insecure the knives were in the luggage things werent quite dangerous enough to wear the wrist sheaths to bed besides they werent very comfortable not to sleep in anyway i had just settled down for a long days sleep when i realized i hadnt called special agent bradford damn i threw the blanket back and padded to the telephone in nothing but a tshirt and undies yes the browning came with me doesnt do you a damn bit of good to have a weapon if it isnt with you i dialed the number and got no answer fancy that didnt everyone work twentyfour hours a day i had his beeper number could the news about xavier wait would even having the name help them agent bradford had made it very clear that i was persona non grata first freemont had blackballed me second the quinlans were threatening to sue everybody unless i was kept away from the case id done such a bangup job protecting their family they didnt want a repeat they seemed to think id get their son killed fancy that i had bradfords beeper number hed given strict orders that if i found out anything i was to tell him and only him made me not want to tell him a bloody thing but who was i to say the fbi didnt have a vampire file somewhere maybe the name would mean something to them maybe it would help them find jeff besides jeanclaude hadnt told me not to give xaviers name to the cops i used the beeper number i left my phone number now i could either go back to bed and let his return call wake me or i could sit in the chair for a few minutes and wait i waited the phone rang in under five minutes i like a man who returns his pages promptly i said hello in case it wasnt him it was special agent bradford this number was on my beeper his voice was rough with sleep this is anita blake a moment of silence then do you know what time it is i havent been to bed yet so yeah i know what time it is another silence what do you want ms blake i took a deep breath and let it out slow getting mad would not be helpful i have a possible name for the vampire thats been slaughtering kids whats the name xavier last name vampires dont have last names as a general rule thank you for the name ms blake how did you get it i thought about that for a few seconds i couldnt think of a really good answer it sort of fell into my lap why dont i believe that ms blake i thought id made myself clear this evening you are not to involve yourself in this case in any way look i didnt have to call but i want jeff quinlan back alive i thought the fbi might be able to use the name of the vampire who took him i want to know how you got the name he said an informant id like to talk to this informant he said no i said are you withholding information from a federal investigation ms blake no agent bradford i am going out of my way to share information he was quiet again alright ms blake youre right thank you for the name well run it in the computers this vampire has a history of harming preadolescent boys hes a pedophile good lord a vampire pedophile he finally sounded genuinely interested in what i was saying and he has the quinlan boy yeah i said i would really like to talk to this source of yours he said hes a little shy around the police i could insist ms blake weve got reports that a private jet flew in last night and a coffin got unloaded its registered to a j c corporation they seem to own a lot of vampirerelated st louisbased businesses do you know anything about that ms blake lying to the fbi seemed like a bad idea but i wasnt sure what theyd do with the truth the feds were investigating vampire crime and suddenly a new vamp shows up in town the least they would do was question him the worst well there was the vampire in mississippi that had been accidentally transferred to a cell with a window the sun rose and french fried vampire an aclu lawyer had sued the cops asses and won but that didnt bring the vamp back admittedly the dead vamp was one of the newly dead jeanclaude would have escaped fairly easily but just escaping from the law by using vampire powers would get a warrant for his arrest sort of like what was happening to magnus besides a vampire had killed a cop last night the police might not be terribly careful with any vampire right now the police are only human after all you still there blake im here you didnt answer my question where was the coffin delivered i asked it wasnt it just disappeared so what do you want from me there was some luggage that went with it the luggage was picked up a little while ago by two young men the description of one of them sounds a lot like larry kirkland is that so thats so we both sat on our ends of the phone waiting for someone to say something i could send some agents down to your hotel room there are no coffins in my hotel room agent bradford you sure of that blake my hand to god do you know who runs this j c corporation no it was the truth until bradford told me about it id never heard of the j c corporation it would only have been an educated guess if id said jeanclaude owned it okay i was fooling myself but so what do you know where the coffin was delivered he asked nope would you tell me if you knew if it would help find jeff quinlan you bet alright blake but no more helping stay the fuck out of this case when we find the vampires well call you in and you can do your job youre a vampire hunter not a cop try to remember that fine i said good now im going back to sleep i suggest you do the same well find the vampires today blake and lets just say i dont believe everything freemont said well call you in for the kill thanks good night blake good night bradford we hung up i sat there for a minute just letting it all sink in if they found jeanclaude in my room what would they do id seen the cops pop a comatose vampire in a body bag transport it to the station house and wait for nightfall to question it id thought it was a bad idea because the vamp would wake up pissed it did i ended up killing it ive always felt bad about that particular kill it was an outofstate job the local cops invited me in to advise them once we found the vamp they stopped listening to my advice reminded me of now that vampire had also just been brought in for questioning i was suddenly tired it was like the entire night just hit me in one grinding wave sleep dragged at me i had to go to sleep i couldnt help jeff quinlan or anybody else until id had a few hours of sleep besides maybe the feds would find him stranger things had happened i left a wakeup call with the desk for noon and cuddled under the blanket the browning was lumpy under the pillow at least i couldnt feel the firestar under the couch cushion i half wished id packed sigmund my stuffed toy penguin but somehow having jeanclaude or jason find me sleeping with a stuffed toy bothered me almost as much as them trying to eat me what price machismo someone was banging on the door i opened my eyes to a room filled with soft indirect sunlight the curtains in here werent nearly as thick as the ones in the bedroom which was why i was out here and jeanclaude was in there i struggled into the jeans id left on the floor and yelled im coming the banging stopped then it sounded like they kicked the door was this a federal wakeup call i went to the door with the browning in my hand somehow i didnt think the fbi would be so rude i stood to the side of the door and asked who is it its dorcas bouvier she kicked the door again open this damn door i peeked through the little peephole it was dorcas bouvier or her evil twin she didnt have a weapon in sight i was probably safe i put the browning under the tshirt in the waistband of my pants the tshirt was a large and fell to midthigh it hid the gun and then some i unlocked the door and stood to one side dorcas shoved the door open leaving it swinging open behind her i closed and locked the door leaning against it watching her dorcas stalked through the room like some sort of exotic cat her waistlength chestnut hair swung like a curtain as she moved she finally turned and glared at me with those seagreen eyes that were a mirror of her brothers the pupil had spiraled downward to a pinpoint leaving the irises floating and making her look almost blind where is he wheres who i asked she glared at me and went for the bedroom door i couldnt get there in time to stop her and i wasnt willing to shoot her yet when i came up behind her she was two steps into the bedroom back rigid staring at the bed it was worth staring at jeanclaude lay on his back with the winedark sheets pulled up to midchest one shoulder and a pale pale arm were stretched across the dark sheets in the semidarkness his hair blended with the pillow to leave his face white and nearly ethereal jason lay on his stomach the only things under the sheet were one leg and barely his buttocks if he was wearing clothes i couldnt tell he raised up on his elbows and turned to us his yellow hair had fallen into his face and he blinked like hed been deeply asleep he smiled when he saw dorcas bouvier it isnt magnus she said no i said it isnt you want to talk outside dont go on my account jason said he rolled onto one elbow the silken sheet slid across his hips as he moved dorcas bouvier turned on her heel and marched out of the room i closed the door to the sound of jasons laughter dorcas looked shaken embarrassed even good to see i was embarrassed too but didnt know what to do about it trying to explain your way out of situations like this never works people are always willing to believe the worst of you so i didnt try i just stood there looking at her she wouldnt meet my eyes after a nice uncomfortable silence that caused heat to wash up her face she said i dont know what to say i thought my brother was in there i she met my eyes finally she was already regaining her composure her surety of purpose you could watch it solidify in her eyes she was here for more than rousting her brother out of my bed why in the world would you think magnus was here may i sit down i motioned her to a seat she sat in one of the chairs spine very straight perfect posture my stepmother judith would have been proud i leaned on the arm of the couch because i couldnt sit down with the browning down my pants i wasnt sure how shed take me being armed so i didnt want to show the gun some people freeze up around firearms go figure i know magnus was with you last night with me i said i dont mean heat crept up her face again i dont mean with you i mean i know you saw him last night he tell you that she shook her head making her hair slide like fur over her shoulders it was eerily reminiscent of magnus i saw you together i studied her face trying to read past the embarrassment you werent there last night where she asked i frowned at her how did you see us you admit you saw him last night then she said her eagerness came back in a rush what i want to know is how you saw us together she took a deep breath thats my business magnus said his sister was better at visions than he was is that true what didnt he tell you she asked she was angry again her emotions seemed to collide spinning too fast over her face and voice he didnt tell me why he ran from the police she looked down at her hands folded in her lap i dont know why he ran it doesnt make any sense she looked back up at me i know he didnt kill those children i agree i said surprise showed on her face i thought you told the police he did it i shook my head no i told them he could have done it i never said he did it but the detective was so sure she said youd told her i cursed softly under my breath detective freemont yes dont believe everything she tells you especially about me she doesnt seem to like me very much if you didnt tell them then why are they so sure magnus did these horrible things he would have no reason to kill these people i shrugged magnus isnt wanted for the killings anymore didnt anybody tell you that she shook her head no you mean he can come back home i sighed its not that simple magnus used glamor on the police to escape thats a felony all on its own the cops will kill him on sight ms bouvier they dont mess around where magic is concerned cant say i blame them i saw the two of you talking outside under the sky i did see him last night did you tell the police no she stared at me why not magnus is probably guilty of something or he wouldnt have run but he deserves better treatment than hes getting yes she said he does what made you think hed be in my bed she looked down at her lap again magnus can be very persuasive i cant remember the last time a woman told him no i apologize for assuming that about you she stopped glanced towards the bedroom then back to me she blushed again i was not going to explain how i ended up with two males in my bed surely it was obvious from the blanket and pillow that id slept out here surely what do you want from me ms bouvier i want to find magnus before he gets himself killed i thought you could help me how could you have betrayed magnus to the police surely you know what its like to be different i wanted to ask if it showed if she could see necromancer written across my forehead but i didnt if the answer was yes i wasnt sure i wanted to know if he hadnt run away they would have simply questioned him they didnt have enough to arrest him do you have any idea why he ran she shook her head ive tried to think of something anything but it doesnt make any sense to me ms blake my brother is a little amoral but hes not a bad man i wasnt sure you could be a little amoral but i let it slide if he turns himself in to me ill walk him into the police station but short of that i dont know what i can do ive been everywhere i can think of but hes just not there i even checked the mound the mound i asked she stared up at me he didnt tell you about the creature i thought about lying to see if i could get information but the look in her eyes told me id blown it he didnt mention any creature of course if he had told you the police would be down there with dynamite dynamite wont kill it but it would screw our magical wards six ways to sunday what creature i asked is there anything magnus told you that you didnt tell the police dorcas asked i thought about that for a second no he was right not to tell you maybe but im trying to help him now do you have a guilty conscience she asked maybe i said she looked at me her pupils had resurfaced and she looked almost normal almost how can i trust you you probably cant but i do want to help magnus please talk to me ms bouvier i have to have your word that you wont tell the police i am serious ms blake if the police interfere they could loose the thing and people would die i debated but couldnt see any reason the police would need to know okay i give you my word i may not have magnuss way with glamor but an oath to one of the fey is a serious matter ms blake lying to us tends to go badly is that a threat think of it as a warning the air moved between us like heat rising off a road her eyes swirled like miniature whirlpools maybe i should have shown her my gun dont threaten me dorcas im not in the mood the magic seemed to seep away like water running into a crack in the rocks you knew it was still there below the surface but for someone who had been threatened by werewolves and vampires she paled in comparison magnus seemed to have most of the talent in the family on the scale of scariness magnus was up there just so we understand each other ms blake if you tell the police and they let loose the creature the deaths will be on your head alright im impressed now tell me about it did magnus tell you about our ancestor llyn bouvier yeah he was the first european in this area he married into the local tribe converted them to christianity he was also fey she nodded he brought another fey with him a wife i asked no he had captured one of the less intelligent fairies he imprisoned it in a magically constructed box it escaped and slaughtered nearly the entire tribe were descended from he finally managed to contain it with the help of an indian shaman or priest but he never regained control over it the best he could do was to imprison it what kind of fairie did he bring over bloody bones isnt just the name of our bar she said its short for rawhead and bloody bones my eyes widened but thats a nursery boggle why would your ancestor want to capture one they dont have any treasure or wishes to give out or am i wrong on that no youre quite correct bloody bones has no riches or gentle magic to grant wishes then why capture it most children born of human and fairie blood dont have a lot of magic thats what the legends say i said but magnus proves that wrong llyn bouvier made a sort of pact for himself and his descendants we would all have fey power at a price she was dragging this out and i was tired just tell me ms bouvier the suspense is getting irritating has it ever occurred to you that this might be embarrassing for me to admit she asked no if thats the case i apologize my ancestor imprisoned bloody bones so he could make a potion of its blood but the potion had to be remade periodically retaken or his magic deserted him i stared at her how did the other fey take this little idea he was forced to flee europe or they would have killed him it is forbidden among us to use each other like that i can see why his barbaric act gave us glamor power but it was still purchased by blood ms blake after rawhead and bloody bones was imprisoned my ancestor gave up his potion he finally saw it as evil though his power faded his children had the power of fairie in their blood so here we are she said so youve got rawhead and bloody bones hidden in some magic box somewhere i asked she smiled and it made her face seem suddenly young and lovely i had no way of judging her age i couldnt see a line on her face when the magic failed the first time rawhead and bloody bones grew to its full size it is bigger than a person almost as big as a giant it is imprisoned in a mound of earth and magic you say it nearly wiped out an entire tribe way back when she nodded i sighed i have to see where its imprisoned you promised i promised not to tell the police but youve just told me theres a giantsized creature capable of mass destruction imprisoned near here i have to see that its secure that its not going to break out and start slaughtering people i assure you ms blake our family has managed for centuries we know what were doing if i cant tell the cops i have to see for myself she stood up trying to use her height to intimidate me she wasnt even close and youll bring the police right do you think im that stupid i wont bring the cops ms bouvier but i have to see it if it does break out and i didnt warn the cops then it would be my fault that no one was prepared you cant prepare for bloody bones she said it is immortal ms blake truly immortal it cannot die you could cut off its head and it would not die the police can do nothing but make things worse she had a point i still need to see for myself you are a stubborn woman yeah i can be a real pain in the ass ms bouvier lets not dance just take me to see the prison and if its secure ill leave you to it if its not secure enough for you she asked we contact a witch and see what she recommends she frowned you wouldnt just go to the police if my home was robbed id call the cops if i need help with magic i call somebody who can do magic you are a strange woman ms blake i dont understand you theres a lot of that going around i said do i get to see where rawhead and bloody bones is buried or not alright ill show you when without magnus were shorthanded at the bar so not today come to the bar around three tomorrow ill take you from there i have a coworker that id like to bring along i said one of those in the bedroom no why do you want to bring him because im training him and when will he ever get to see fey magic again she seemed to think about it for a minute then nodded alright you may bring one other person with you but no more trust me ms bouvier one is plenty my friends call me dorrie she said she held out her hand im anita i shook her hand she had a nice firm grip for a woman sexist but true most women dont seem to know how to give a good handshake she held my hand longer than she had to when she took her hand back i remembered magnuss clairvoyance dorrie turned those wide eerie eyes to me she held her hand to her chest like it hurt i see blood and pain and death it follows you like a cloud anita blake i watched horror seep into her eyes horror at the brief glimpse shed had of me my life my past i didnt look away if youre not ashamed you dont need to look away sometimes i would prefer a different line of work but its what i do who i am the look faded from her eyes and she blinked i wont underestimate you anita dorrie looked normal again or as normal as she had when she first came in which wasnt very now for the first time i looked at her and wondered if i was seeing what was really there was she using glamor on me now to appear normal to appear less powerful than she was ill return the favor dorrie she flashed me that lovely smile again that made her seem young and vulnerable illusion maybe until tomorrow then until tomorrow i said she left and i locked the door behind her so magnuss family were the guardians of a monster had that had something to do with why he ran dorrie didnt think it was a reason she should know but there was a feeling in the room of power gently moving on the air currents a faint whiff of magic traced the air like perfume and i hadnt known it until just before she left maybe dorrie was just as good with glamor as magnus just more subtle could i really trust dorrie bouvier hmmm why had i asked if larry could go along because i knew it would please him it might even make up for treating him so badly in front of jason but standing there sensing dorrie bouviers power hanging like a ghost in the air i wasnt sure it was a good idea oh hell i knew it wasnt but i was going and larry would go too he had a right to go he even had a right to endanger himself i couldnt keep him safe forever he was going to have to learn to take care of himself i hated it but i knew it was true i wasnt ready to cut the apron strings but i was going to have to lengthen them a bit i was going to give larry the proverbial rope here was hoping he didnt hang himself i slept most of the day and when i woke up i discovered that nobody would let me come play everybody was running scared of the quinlan lawsuit and i was persona non grata everywhere i tried to go agent bradford sent me packing and threatened to have me jailed for obstruction of justice and hampering a police investigation thats gratitude for you the day was a bust the only person who would talk to me was dolph all he could tell me was that they hadnt found any sign of jeff quinlan or his sisters body no one had seen magnus either the cops were questioning people searching for clues while i twiddled my thumbs but neither of us came up with anything useful i watched darkness fall with a sense of relief at least now we could get on with it larry had gone back to his room i hadnt asked maybe he wanted to give me some privacy with jeanclaude scary thought that at least larry was talking to me nice that someone was i opened the drapes and watched the glass turn black id brushed my teeth in larrys room today my own bathroom was suddenly off limits i just didnt want to see jason naked and i certainly didnt want to see jeanclaude so i borrowed part of larrys room for the day i heard the bedroom door open but didnt turn somehow i knew who it was hello jeanclaude good evening ma petite i turned the room was almost in darkness the only light was from the streetlights outside and the glowing sign of the hotel jeanclaude stepped into that faint glow his shirt had a collar so high it covered his neck completely motherofpearl buttons fastened the high collar so that his face was framed by the white white fabric there must have been a dozen buttons gleaming down the pleated front of his shirt a black waisthigh jacket that was almost too black to be seen hid the sleeves only the shirts cuffs showed wide and stiff covering half his hand he raised a hand to the light and the cuffs bent back underneath to give his hand a full range of motion his tight black pants were stuffed into another pair of black boots they came all the way up his legs so that he was encased in leather black on black buckled straps held the soft leather in place do you like it he asked yeah its spiffy spiffy there was an edge of humor to that one word you just cant take a compliment i said my apologies ma petite it was a compliment thank you dont mention it can we go get your coffin now he stepped out of the light so i couldnt see his face you make it sound so simple ma petite isnt it silence then so thick the room felt empty i almost called out to him instead i walked to the bar and turned on the track lighting above it the soft white light glowed in the dark like a lighted cave i felt better with the light but with my back to where i thought he should be i couldnt sense jeanclaude the room felt empty i turned and there he was sitting in one of the chairs even when i looked at him there was no sense of movement it was like a stopaction picture waiting for the switch to go on i wish you wouldnt do that i said he turned his head and looked at me his eyes were solid darkness the faint light picked up blue sparks from them do what ma petite i shook my head nothing whats so complicated about tonight i feel like youre not telling me everything he stood in one smooth motion almost like he skipped part of the process and was just suddenly on his feet it is within our rules for serephina to challenge me tonight is that the masters name serephina he nodded you dont think ill tell the cops i will take you to her ma petite there will be no time for your impatience to make you foolish if id been stuck here all day with nothing much to do but had had the name would i have tried to find her on my own yeah i would have fine lets go he paced the room smiling and shaking his head ma petite do you understand what it will mean if she challenges me tonight it means we fight them right he stopped pacing and came into the light he slid onto one of the bar stools there is no fear in you none i shrugged being afraid doesnt help being prepared does are you afraid of her i looked at him trying to read that lovely mask i do not fear her power i believe us to be near equals in that but let us say i am wary all things being equal i am still in her territory with only one of my wolves my human servant and monsieur lawrence it is not the show of force i would have chosen to confront her after two centuries why didnt you bring more people more werewolves anyway if i had had time to negotiate more of an entourage i would have but with the rush he looked at me there was no time to bargain are you in danger he laughed and it wasnt entirely pleasant am i in danger she asks when the council asked me to divide my lands they promised to set in place someone of power equal to or less than mine but they did not expect me to enter her territory so unprepared who are they what council he cocked his head to one side have you really come among us so long and not heard of our council just tell me i said we have a council ma petite it has existed for a very long time it is not so much a governing body as a court or police perhaps before your courts made us citizens with rights we had very few rules and only one law thou shalt not draw attention to yourself thats the law that tepes forgot tepes i said vlad tepes you mean dracula jeanclaude just looked at me his face was perfectly blank no expression he looked like a particularly lovely statue if a statues eyes could glitter like sapphires i could not read that expressionless face nor was i meant to i dont believe you about the council our law or tepes the last part oh i assure you we did kill him you make it sound like you were around when it happened he died in what the s was it or was it he made a great show of trying to remember you are not that old i said are you sure ma petite he turned that unnervingly blank face to me even his eyes went dead and empty it was like looking at a wellconstructed doll yeah im sure he smiled and sighed life for lack of a better word rushed back into his face his body it was like watching pinocchio spring to life shit so nice to know that i can still unnerve you from time to time ma petite i let that go he knew exactly the effect he had on me if serephina is your equal then you take care of her and ill shoot everybody else you know it will not be that simple it never is he stared at me smiling do you really think shell challenge you no but i wanted you to know that she could is there anything else i need to know he smiled wide enough to flash a little bit of fang he looked wonderful in the light his skin was pale but not too pale i touched his hand youre warm he glanced up at me yes ma petite what of it youve slept an entire day you should be cold to the touch until after youve fed he just looked at me with his drowning eyes shit i said i went for the bedroom he didnt try to stop me he didnt even try it made me nervous i was halfrunning by the time i hit the door all i could see was a pale outline on the bed i turned on the switch by the door the overhead light was glaring and merciless jason lay on his stomach blond hair bright against the dark pillows he was naked except for a pair of vibrant blue bikini briefs i walked towards the bed staring at his back willing him to breathe when i was almost at the bed i could see him breathe something tight in my chest loosened i had to kneel on the edge of the bed to reach him i touched his shoulder he moved under my hand i rolled him onto his side and he didnt try to help he was totally passive he stared up at me with heavylidded eyes two thin crimson lines flowed down his neck not a lot of blood at least not spilled onto the sheets i had no way of knowing how much hed lost how much jeanclaude had taken jason smiled at me it was a slow lazy smile are you alright his hand slid around my waist as he rolled onto his back ill take that as a yes i tried to back off the bed but his arm was firm around me holding me he pulled me down to his chest i pulled the browning on the way down he could have stopped me but he didnt try i shoved the gun against his ribs my other hand was pressed to his bare chest trying to hold my face a little above his he raised his face towards mine i will pull this trigger he stopped with his face inches from mine ill heal is one kiss worth getting a hole punched in your side i dont know he said everyone else seems to think so his face moved towards me slowly giving me plenty of time to decide jason release her now jeanclaudes voice filled the room with whispers like tiny echoes jason let me go i slid off the bed the gun still naked in my hand i need my wolf tonight anita try not to shoot him until after weve seen serephina tell him to stop hitting on me i said oh i shall ma petite i shall jason lay back against the pillows he raised one knee his hands lying across his stomach he looked relaxed lascivious but his eyes stayed on jeanclaude you are almost the perfect pet jason but do not provoke me you never said she was off limits i am saying it now jeanclaude said jason sat up on the bed ill be a perfect gentleman from now on yes jeanclaude said you will he stood there in the doorway still lovely to look at but dangerous you could feel it building in the room whispering through his voice leave us for a moment ma petite we dont have time for this i said jeanclaude looked at me his eyes were still a solid midnight blue the whites had drowned are you protecting him i dont want him hurt because he got out of hand with me yet you would have shot him i shrugged i never said i was consistent just serious jeanclaude laughed the abrupt change in mood made both jason and me jump his laughter was rich and thick as chocolate as if you could pull it from the air and eat it i glanced at jason he was watching jeanclaude the way a welltrained dog will watch its master looking for clues to what its master wanted next get dressed my wolf and you ma petite you must change as well i was wearing black jeans and a royal blue polo shirt whats wrong with what im wearing we must make a show of it tonight ma petite i would not ask if it were not important i am not wearing a dress tonight he smiled of course not just something a little more stylish if your young friend does not have anything suitable i believe he and jason are about the same size im sure we could find something youll have to talk to larry about that jeanclaude looked at me for a heartbeat as you like ma petite now if you would leave jason to dress i will stay in here until you have chosen more appropriate attire i wanted to argue i didnt like being told what to wear or what not to wear but i let it go id been around vampires enough to know they admired the spectacular or the dangerous if jeanclaude said we needed to make a show of it maybe he was right it wouldnt kill me to dress up a little it might get us all killed to refuse i just didnt know the rules in this situation i suspected that there werent any i hadnt packed with meeting a master vampire in mind so my choices were sort of limited i settled for a crimson blouse with a high collar and a spill of lace down the front there was even a little frilly cuff at each sleeve it looked like a cross between a victorian blouse and a business shirt it would have looked very conservative if it hadnt been screaming vermillion red i hated the idea of wearing it because i knew jeanclaude would like it except for the color it looked like something he might wear i put the allpurpose black jacket over the blouse with both guns both knives and a cross around my neck inside the blouse i was ready to go ma petite may we come out sure he opened the door and took it all in with a glance you look splendid ma petite i appreciate the makeup i look pale in crimson without it of course do you have other shoes i only have the nikes and high heels i move better in the nikes the blouse was more than i hoped for keep your jogging shoes they are black at least jason walked out of the bedroom he was wearing black leather pants tight enough that i knew he wasnt wearing the underwear anymore the top was vaguely oriental with one of those upright collars and one black button the kind where a loop of thread comes over the button the sleeves were full and the collar was a soft shining blue that matched his eyes to perfection it was embroidered in yellow so dark it looked gold and darker blue thread the sleeves collar and edge of the fabric were embroidered black on black when jason moved the shirt gaped just a little enough to show glimpses of his bare stomach soft black boots rode up over his knees well i know who your tailor is i said i was going to be woefully underdressed if you would fetch monsieur kirkland when he is dressed we can go larry may not want to change then he wont i will not force him i looked at him not quite sure i believed him but i got larry he agreed to go into the bedroom and see what other goodies were in the luggage but he didnt promise to change he came out still wearing dark blue jeans and nikes he had changed his tshirt for a silk dress shirt that was a rich vibrant blue it made his eyes look even bluer than usual a black leather jacket that was just a touch big in the shoulders hid his shoulder holster i guess it was an improvement over the oversized flannel hed been wearing the collar of the shirt was spread over the jacket so that it framed his face you should see some of the stuff in there larry said he shook his head as if he still couldnt believe it i wouldnt even know how to get into some of it you look nice i said thanks can we go now i asked yes ma petite we can go it will be interesting to meet serephina after two centuries i know this is old home week for you but lets remember why were here i said xavier has jeff quinlan who knows what hes doing to him i want him home safe its the second night we have to get to him tonight or find someone else who can jeanclaude nodded then let us be off ma petite serephina awaits us he sounded almost eager like he was looking forward to seeing her for the first time i wondered if he and serephina had been lovers i knew jeanclaude wasnt a virgin i mean get real but knowing he had lovers and meeting one were two different things i realized with a start that it would bother me he smiled at me almost as if he knew what i was thinking the whites of his eyes had reappeared it made him look almost human almost jeanclaude walked across the parking lot in his boots and jacket looking like someone should be snapping his picture or asking for an autograph the rest of us followed like his entourage which was what we were whether i liked it or not but to save jeff quinlan i could do a little bootlicking even i will toady a little if its in a good enough cause you driving or do i get directions to serephinas house now i asked i will tell you where to turn when it is time you think im going to run to the cops with directions to her house no he said that was all he said i frowned at him but we all got in the jeep guess who got the front seat we drove out onto the main road the strip the traffic was bumpertobumper if traffic is bad it can take a couple of hours to drive the four miles that make up the strip jeanclaude had me turn on a small road it looked like a driveway leading to yet another theater but it turned out to be an access road if you knew your way around the smaller roads you could avoid most of the congestion you would never know from the main drag of branson but just out of sight over the next hill is the real ozarks mountains forests houses where people who dont make their living off tourists live on the strip it was all neon and artifice within fifteen minutes we were surrounded by trees on a road that wound through the ozark mountains darkness closed around the jeep the only light was a spill of stars pressed against the blackness and the tunnel of my own headlights you seem to be looking forward to seeing serephina even with the coffin missing i said jeanclaude turned in his seat as far as the seat belt would allow id insisted everybody wear seat belts which amused the vampire i guess it was silly to have a dead man buckle up but hey i was driving i believe serephina still thinks of me as the very young vampire she knew centuries ago if she thought me a worthy opponent she would have confronted me or my minions directly she would not have simply stolen the coffin she is overconfident speaking as one of your minions larry called from the back seat are you sure youre not the one whos overconfident jeanclaude glanced back at him serephina was centuries old when i met her the limit of a vampires powers is well established after two or three centuries i know her limits lawrence stop calling me lawrence the names larry jeanclaude sighed you have trained him well he came that way i said pity jeanclaude made this sound like a hostile family reunion or is that an oxymoron i hoped he was right but one thing ive learned about vampiresthey keep pulling new rabbits out of their cloaks big fanged carnivorous bunnies thatll eat your eyeballs if youre not paying attention whats wolfboy in the back going to do i do what im told jason said great i said we drove in silence jeanclaude rarely sweats small talk and i wasnt in the mood we could all have a nice little visit but out there somewhere jeff quinlan had woken to a second night in xaviers tender care sort of ruined the mood for me the turn is just ahead to your right ma petite jeanclaudes voice made me jump i had sunk into the silence and the dark hush of the highway i slowed the jeep didnt want to miss the turnoff a gravel road like a hundred other gravel roads spilled off the main road there was nothing to make it stand out nothing special the road was narrow with trees growing so close on either side it was like driving through a tunnel the naked branches of trees curved around us like interlocking pieces of a wall the headlights slid over the nearly naked trees bouncing when the jeep eased over a pothole naked wooden fingers tapped the roof of the jeep it was damn near claustrophobic geez larry said he had pressed his face to the dark glass as far as the seat belt would allow if i didnt know there was a house down this road id turn back that is the idea jeanclaude said many of the older ones value their privacy above almost all else the headlights picked up a hole that stretched across the entire road it looked like a gully wash where rainwater had eaten the road away over decades larry leaned over the back of the seat straining against his seatbelt whered the road go the jeep can make it i said are you sure he asked pretty sure i said jeanclaude had settled back into the seat he seemed totally relaxed almost detached like he was listening to music i couldnt hear thinking thoughts that i never would understand jason leaned forward putting a hand on the back of my seat why wouldnt she pave the road shes been here almost a year i glanced back at jason it was interesting to find out that he knew more about jeanclaudes business than i did this is her moat jeanclaude said her barrier against the curious many find our new status hard to accept and still closet themselves away the wheels slid over the edge it was like driving into a crater miraculously the jeep crawled out the other side if wed been in a car wed have had to walk the road climbed upward for about a hundred yards and suddenly on the righthand side of the road was an opening it didnt look big enough to drive the jeep through not without scratching the paint job to hell the only thing that really told you it was a clearing was the moonlight pulsing against the darkness of the trees that much moonlight meant something was there grass had grown over a scattering of gravel that might once have been a driveway is this it i asked just to make sure i believe so jeanclaude said i eased the jeep into the trees and listened to branches slap the sides i hoped stirlings company owned the jeep and wasnt just renting we crawled free of the trees with a last metallic scritch an acre of open land spread out before us silveredged with moonlight the grass was butchered short like someone had bushhogged it last fall and left it naked and unfinished through the winter there was a neglected orchard behind the house the land rose in a gentle slope up towards the foot of a mountain just beyond the bushhogged grass was forest thick and untouched a house sat in the middle of the gentle rise the house was silvergrey in the moonlight curling flecks of paint clung here and there like the last sad remnants of an accident victims clothes a large stone porch graced the front of the house hid the door and windows in a well of shadow turn off the lights ma petite i looked at that dark porch and didnt want to hit the lights the moonlight should have penetrated those shadows ma petite the lights i hit the lights the moonlight bathed us like a wash of visible air the porch stayed dark and still like a cup of ink jeanclaude undid his seat belt and slid out the boys followed suit i got out last large flat stones were set in the grass forming a curving sidewalk to the foot of the steps that led up to the porch there was a large picture window to one side of the peeling door the glass was jagged someone had nailed plywood behind the broken window to keep out the night air the smaller window on the other side of the door was intact but so covered in grime it was blind the shadows were viscous and seemed thick enough to touch it reminded me of the darkness that the sword had come swinging out of but it wasnt as thick i could see through this darkness there was nothing there but shadows whats with the shadows i asked a parlor trick jeanclaude said nothing more he glided up the steps without a backward glance if he was worried it didnt show jason glided up the steps behind him larry and i just walked up it was the best we could do the shadows were colder than they should have been and larry shivered beside me but there was no sense of power to it as jeanclaude had said a parlor trick the screen door had been ripped off its hinges it lay on the porch torn and forgotten even with the protection the porch offered the inner door was warped and peeling exposed to too much weather leaves lay in piles at the edges of the porch railings where the wind had blown them are you sure this is it larry asked i am sure jeanclaude said i understood the question if it hadnt been for the shadows id have said the house was deserted the shadows would discourage any casual passersby i said well i wouldnt come trickortreating larry said jeanclaude glanced back at us our hostess comes the pitted broken door opened i had expected a hauntedhouse screech of rusty hinges but the door opened smoothly a woman stood in the doorway the room behind her was dark her body silhouetted against the room and the night but even in the dark i knew two things she was a vampire and she wasnt old enough to be serephina the vampire was only a few inches taller than i was she raised an unlit candle in one hand the hairs on the back of my neck stood at attention as a trickle of power slid through the room the candle flared to life leaving stars dancing across my night vision the vampire had brown hair cut so short the hair on either side of her head had been shaved silver stud earrings glittered up the curve of her ears one long earring dangled from her left ear it was a green enamel leaf on a silver chain she wore a red leather dress that was so tight on top it was how id known in the dark she was a girl the skirt of the dress fell to her ankles loose once you got past the hips a leather formal wow she grinned at us flashing fangs im ivy her voice had an edge of laughter to it but unlike jeanclaudes laugh that always felt vaguely sexual or fattening hers felt sharp as broken glass meant to hurt terrify not titillate enter our dwelling and be welcome the words sounded too formal like a rehearsed speech or an incantation that you dont understand thank you ivy for your most generous invitation jeanclaude said he was suddenly holding her hand i hadnt seen him reach for it i hadnt seen him move it was like id missed a frame of the film from the look on ivys face so had she she looked pissed jeanclaude raised her hand very slowly towards his lips he never took his eyes off her the way you bow to someone on the dojo mat because if you look away they may spill you on your ass a line of wax trickled down the side of the white candle she was holding it in her bare fist no candle holder jeanclaude slowly raised her hand and laid his lips on the back of it the wax dripped faster than it should have he released her hand in time for her to save herself but she stood there and let the line of hot wax drip down her skin only the faintest flicker in her eyes showed that it hurt she left the wax to harden on her hand a faint redness spread from the line of wax she ignored it no more wax dripped from the candle usually when a candle runs that soon it keeps running the wax made a little golden pool at the top of the candle like a drop of water under tension i glanced from one vampire to the other and shook my head does the term childish mean anything to you i didnt say it out loud though for all i knew this was some kind of ancient vampire ritual though i doubted it pretty damn sincerely arent your companions going to come inside ivy stepped aside with a swish of leather skirts holding the candle high lighting our way jeanclaude stepped to the other side of the door so we would have to walk between the two vampires to get into the house i trusted jeanclaude not to munch on me i even trusted him to keep ivy from munching on me but i didnt like how much fun jeanclaude was having made me nervous ive never been around vampires that were having a good time when it didnt get ugly jason walked between them into the house larry glanced at me i shrugged and walked inside he followed at my heels trusting that if i went inside it would be okay it probably would be probably the door closed behind us and i dont think anybody closed it not with hands anyway safe or not these little displays of power were getting on my nerves the air in the room was utterly still stale it smelled musty dry with an undertaste of mildew you knew even with your eyes closed that these rooms had been empty for a very long time there was an open archway to the left that led into a smaller room i could see a bed complete with bedspread and pillows so covered in dust it looked grey a vanity sat in one corner with its mirror reflecting the empty room there was no furniture left in the living room the wooden floor was dustcoated the hem of ivys dress trailed in the thick dust as she moved towards a door in the far wall a thin line of light showed under that door golden and thicker than electricity i was betting on more candles the door opened before ivy reached it a rich wave of light spilled out brighter than it should have been because wed been in the dark so long a male vamp stood framed in the light he was short slender with a face too young to be handsome more pretty he was so newly dead that his skin still held the tan hed picked up at the beach or lake or some other sunsoaked place he looked frightfully young to be dead he had to be eighteen anything younger and it was illegal but he still looked delicate and halffinished jailbait forever im bruce he seemed vaguely embarrassed maybe it was the clothes he was dressed in a pale grey tux complete with tails and a charcoal grey strip down the outside leg of the pants his gloves were white and matched what could be seen of his shirt his vest was a silky grey his bow tie and cummerbund were a red that matched ivys dress they looked like they were going to the prom two mansized candelabra stood on either side of the door filling the room with moving golden light the room beyond was twice the size of the living room and had probably been the kitchen once upon a time but unlike the front rooms thered been some redecorating a persian carpet was spread across the floor the colors were so bright it looked like stained glass wall hangings covered the two longest walls on one wall a unicorn fled from a pack of hounds the other hanging was a battle scene so dimmed with age that parts of the figures had vanished into the cloth bright silken drapes covered the far end of the room hung from the ceiling with heavy cords a door opened to the left of the drapes ivy sat the candle shed been holding in an empty sconce on the candelabra she moved in front of jeanclaude she had to tilt her head up to look him in the eyes you are beautiful she ran her fingers along the edge of his jacket i thought theyd lied that nobody could be that beautiful she fingered the motherofpearl buttons starting at his neck and working down jeanclaude moved her hand when she reached the last button before the shirt disappeared into his pants ivy seemed to find that amusing she stood on tiptoe leaning her hands and forearms on his chest her mouth was tilted towards him kissable do you fuck as good as you look they said you did but youre sooo pretty nobody could be that good a lay jeanclaude laid his fingers on either side of her face cradling her jawline he smiled at her her red lips curved into a smile she pressed against him letting her full weight rest against his body jeanclaude kept his light touch on her face as if she wasnt leaning full out against him her smile began to fade slipping from her face like the sun sinking below the earth she slid slowly down to stand flatfooted in front of him her face was blank and empty in the cradle of his hands bruce the vampire jerked her back by one arm ivy stumbled and would have fallen if he hadnt caught her she looked around bewildered as if she expected to be elsewhere jeanclaude wasnt smiling now it has been a long time since i was anyones meat that wanted me a very long time ivy stood halfcollapsed in bruces arms her face was harsh with fear she pushed away from bruce to stand straight and alone she tugged at the red dress as if to settle it into place the fear was mostly gone from her face just a certain tightness remained around the eyes how did you do that centuries of practice little one anger made her eyes dark you arent supposed to be able to capture another vampire with your gaze you arent he asked his voice lilting with amazement dont you laugh at me i had some sympathy for her frustration jeanclaude can be such a pain in the ass when he wants to be you were told to lead us somewhere children do so ivy stood in front of him hands balled into fists her anger spilled into her eyes and the brown irises bled onto the whites of her eyes until she looked blind her power breathed through the room creeping along the skin raising the tiny hairs on my body as if a finger had been run just above them my hand started for the browning old habits no anita that is not necessary jeanclaude said this little one cannot hurt me she shows her fangs but unless she wishes to die on this lovely carpet she had best remember who and what i am i am the master of the city his voice thundered through the house echoing in the room until the air was so thick with echoes that it was like breathing his words when the sound died i was shaking ivy had pulled herself together she still looked angry but her eyes had bled back to normal bruce had laid a hand on her shoulder as if he wasnt sure she would listen to reason she shook off his hand and motioned gracefully towards the open door we are to take you downstairs others await you there jeanclaude gave a low theatrical bow never taking his eyes from her after you my sweet a lady should always walk before a gentleman never behind she smiled suddenly pleased with herself again then your human lady can walk beside me i dont think so i said she turned innocent brown eyes to me are you not a lady then she stalked towards me with an exaggerated sway of her hips did you bring us someone who is not a lady jeanclaude i heard him sigh anita is a lady walk beside her ma petite but carefully what does it matter what these assholes think of me if you are not a lady then you are a whore you do not want to know what would happen to a human whore within these walls he seemed tired as he said it as if hed been there done that and hadnt had a good time ivy smiled at me giving me a big dose of brown eyes i met her gaze and smiled she frowned you are human you cant meet my gaze not like that surprise surprise i said shall we go jeanclaude said ivy frowned again but she stepped into that open door and down a step or two one hand on her dress to keep the hem from tripping her feet she turned and looked back at me are you coming i asked jeanclaude how careful do i need to be larry and jason came to stand beside me defend yourself if they offer violence first but do not shed the first blood or strike the first blow defend but do not attack ma petite we are playing games tonight unless you make it more the stakes are not that high i scowled at him i dont like this he smiled i know but bear with us ma petite remember the human you wish to save and control that wonderful temper of yours well human ivy said she was waiting for me on the steps she looked like an impatient child petulant im coming i said i did not run to catch up with the waiting vampire i walked at a normal pace though the weight of her gaze made my skin itch i stopped at the head of the stairs and peered downward cool damp air pushed against my face the smell was thick enclosed and mildewed you knew there would be no windows and somewhere water was eating the walls a basement i hated basements i took a deep breath of the fetid air and walked down the steps they were the widest stairs id ever seen in a basement the wood felt new and raw like they hadnt taken time to stain or sand it there was enough room for the two of us to share a step i didnt want to share a step maybe she wasnt a threat to jeanclaude but i had no illusions about what she could do to me she was a baby master not full grown yet but the power was there bubbling under the surface crawling along my skin i stopped a step above her waiting for her to go down ivy smiled she could smell my fear if we are both ladies then we should walk together come anita she held out a hand to me let us go down together i didnt want to be that close to her if she tried to jump me there wouldnt be time to do much i might get a weapon out in time i might not it irritated me that i wasnt supposed to show a weapon first and scared me one of the things thats kept me alive is shooting first and asking questions later doing it the other way around was no way to stay alive is jeanclaudes human servant afraid of me she stood there framed against the darkness beyond smiling the basement was like a great black pit behind her but she couldnt sense vampire marks or shed have known i wasnt his servant she wasnt as hot as she thought she was i hoped i ignored the outstretched hand but walked down those two steps my shoulder brushed her bare skin and it felt like worms were crawling down my arm i kept walking down the steps into the dark beyond left hand in a death grip on the railing i heard her high heels clattering down the steps to catch up with me i could feel her irritation like heat rising from her skin i heard the menfolk following us but didnt look behind to check we were playing chicken tonight it was one of my best games we went down the steps together like horses pulling a carriage my left hand on the railing her hands lifting her dress i kept up a pace that made gliding effortlessly impossible unless she could levitate she couldnt she grabbed my right arm and whirled me around to face her i couldnt go for a gun because i was wearing wrist sheaths i couldnt even go for a knife i stood there nearly face to face with an angry vampire and couldnt reach a weapon all that could save me was her not killing me trusting my life to ivys beneficence seemed like a bad bet her anger spilled along my skin heat flowed down her body i could feel her hand hot even through the leather jacket i didnt try to pull away things that can benchpress toyotas dont let go her touch didnt burn because it wasnt that kind of heat but it was hard to convince my body that it wouldnt hurt eventually years of warnings dont touch its hot heat flared along my body like i was standing next to a fire if she hadnt been doing it unintentionally it would have been impressive hell it was still impressive give her a few centuries and shed be scary as hell as if she wasnt already i could still meet her eyes drowning deep and glowing with their own light that was going to do me a hell of a lot of good when she ripped my throat out if you hurt her ivy our truce is over jeanclaude glided down the steps to stand just above us you do not want the truce to be over ivy he ran his fingertip along the edge of her jaw i felt the jolt of power jump from him to her to me i gasped but she let me go my arm was numb at my side like itd gone to sleep i couldnt have held a gun i wanted to ask what the hell hed done but didnt as long as i got the use of my arm back we could argue about it later bruce pushed between us hovering over ivy like a worried boyfriend watching his face i realized that was accurate i was betting shed brought him over ivy pushed him away so hard that he went tumbling backwards down the stairs lost in the thicker darkness everything seemed to be working on her just fine i could barely feel my fingertips heat rushed over me like a scalding wind and swept outward into the dark torches flared to life in sconces along the walls with a whoosh and a shower of sparks a large kerosene lamp suspended from the ceiling filled with fire its glass chimney exploded in a shower of glass its flame burning naked on the wick serephina will make you clean up your mess jeanclaude said he made it sound like shed spilled her milk ivy walked down the rest of the steps in a hipswinging glide serephina will not care broken glass and flame have so many uses i didnt like the way she phrased that the basement was black black walls black floors black ceiling it was like being in a great dark box chains hung from the walls some with what looked like fur on the cuffs straps dangled from the ceiling like obscene decorations there were devices placed throughout the room i recognized some of them a rack an iron maiden but most of it was like looking at bondage paraphernalia you were pretty sure what the point was but not how it worked there were always more holes than i could figure out what to do with and nothing ever seemed to come with instructions there was a drain in the floor and a thin trickle of water ran down it but i was betting that the drain wasnt there just for water larry moved down the steps to stand beside me are those what i think they are yeah theyre torture devices i forced my hand to make a fist and another one the feeling was coming back i thought they werent going to harm us he said i think its supposed to scare us its working he said i didnt like the decor much either but i could feel my hand i could have held a gun if i had to a door that i hadnt even seen opened to the left a secret panel a vampire came through the door he had to bend nearly double to make it through the door frame he unfolded impossibly tall and thin cadaverous he had not fed tonight and was wasting no power on looking pretty his skin was the color of old parchment and clung to the bones of his face like a thin film barely covering his skull his eyes were sunken and dull in his head the dead blue of fish eyes his sickly hands were long and bony with impossibly long fingers like white spiders sticking from the sleeves of his black coat he stalked into the room with the edges of his black coat sweeping behind him like a cloak he was dressed entirely in black only his skin and the short cut white hair on his head betrayed him as he moved through the black room it looked like his head and hands were floating on their own i shook my head to clear the image when i looked back he seemed a touch more normal hes using his powers to make himself look frightening i said yes ma petite he is there was something in his voice that made me turn and look at him his face was its usual lovely maskbut in his eyes for just a second i saw fear whats going on jeanclaude the rules have not changed do not draw a weapon do not strike the first blow they cannot harm us unless we break these rules why are you suddenly scared that is not serephina he said his voice was very bland when he said it whats that supposed to mean he threw back his head and laughed the sound reverberated through the room echoing and outwardly joyous but i could taste it on the back of my tongue and it was bitter it means ma petite that i am a fool jeanclaudes laughter faded away in bits and pieces like the sound was clinging to the walls where is serephina he asked ivy and bruce walked out of the room i didnt know where they were going but it had to be better than this how many torture rooms could a house this size have dont answer that the tall vampire looked at us with his deadfish eyes there was no pull nothing it was like looking into the eyes of a corpse his voice when it came was almost shocking it was rich and deep resonant but not with vampiric powers it was the voice of an actor or an opera singer i watched it come out of the thin lipless mouth and it still looked like a parlor trick like the mouth should move out of sync with the words but they didnt you must pass through me before she will see you you surprise me janos jeanclaude glided down the steps i guess we were going down pity you are more powerful than serephina how is it you do her bidding when you have seen her you will understand now come all of you join us the night is young and i want to see you all naked and bleeding before dawn who is this guy i asked i could use my hand again might as well smart off jeanclaude stopped on the last step jason moved up one step behind him larry and i stayed a little behind that i dont think either of us was too eager to go down the vampire turned his dead eyes on me i am janos dandy but the rules say you cant bleed us or anything else or did i miss something you miss very little ma petite jeanclaude said you will not be harmed against your will janos said you must all consent for any harm to befall you then were safe i said he smiled the skin of his face stretching like paper i halfexpected bone to break through but it didnt the smile was nicely hideous we shall see jeanclaude took that last step and moved farther into the room jason followed and after a moments hesitation so did i larry followed me like a trooper this room is your idea janos jeanclaude said i do nothing without my masters consent she cannot be your master janos she is not powerful enough yet here i am jeanclaude here i am jeanclaude walked around the dark wood of the rack trailing a pale hand over it serephina was never much for torture she was many things but not sadistic jeanclaude came to stand in front of janos i think you are master here and she is your stalking horse she is known as master so all the challenges come her way when she dies you will find another puppet i promise you jeanclaude she is my master think of this room as my reward for being a faithful servant he looked around the room with a proprietary smile like a storekeeper admiring wellstocked shelves what do you plan for us in this room of yours but wait a few moments my impatient boy and all will be revealed it was odd to have someone call jeanclaude boy as if he were a much younger cousin that janos had watched grow up had janos known him when he was a little vampire freshly dead a womans voice where are you taking me youre hurting me ivy and bruce dragged a young woman through the side door literally dragged her she had let her legs collapse trying to use them like a dog does when you try to take it to the vet but she only had two legs and a vampire on each arm she wasnt having much luck slowing them down she had straight blonde hair that barely touched the tops of her shoulders her eyes were large and blue and the makeup shed started the night with was smeared from crying ivy seemed to be having a good time bruce had very wide eyes he was afraid of janos hard not to be i guess the girl stared wordlessly at janos for a second then screamed ivy cuffed her absently like youd swat a barking dog the girl whimpered and fell silent staring at the floor fresh tears trailing down her cheeks there was only janos and the two youngsters in the room with us i was betting we could take them two more vampires came in but they didnt drag in the next girl she walked in eyes glittering with anger back very straight hands in fists at her sides she was short a little heavy but not quite fat as if a good burst of growth would take care of the weight her hair was a nondescript brown glasses framed small brown eyes freckles dusted her face the personality that radiated from that face was not nondescript i liked her instantly oh lisa she said get up she sounded embarrassed as well as angry the blonde girl lisa just cried harder the two vamps that were guarding the second girl were not young they were both tall around six feet dressed in black leather one with her long yellow hair in a braid down her back the other with black hair falling free around her face their bare arms were muscled and firm they looked like female bodyguards from some bad spy movie the power that radiated from the two of them was not a b movie effect it crept through the room like a current of water thick and cool when the line of power poured over my body it took my breath away the power crawled into my bones and made them ache larry gasped behind me i glanced at him just to make sure he was gasping for the same reason i was no new monsters behind us just the power of the two new vamps what are you guys doing running a halfway house for all vampires over five hundred years i asked everyone turned towards me the two female vamps smiled most unpleasantly they looked at me like i was a piece of candy and they wondered what sort of center i had soft and gooey or hard with a nut in the middle id had men undress me with their eyes but id never had anything trying to picture what id look like with my skin off yikes do you have something to add janos asked you cant just drag a couple of underage girls in here and expect us to do nothing on the contrary anita we expect you to do many things i didnt like the phrasing of that whats that supposed to mean first the young women arent underage are you girls the second girl just glared at him lisa shook her head still staring at the floor tell her your ages janos said neither of them answered ivy yanked hard enough to make the blonde girl cry out eighteen im eighteen she collapsed on the floor in a sobbing heap and the vampires let go of her so she could do it one of the female vamps said your age now her voice was like quiet thunder a warning of the coming storm the second girls eyes widened behind her glasses im nineteen there was fear now peeking out from behind her anger fine theyre over eighteen but an unwilling human is still an unwilling human regardless of age i said would you play policeman here anita janos asked he sounded amused i wont just stand here and watch you hurt them you have a high opinion of yourself anita confident i like that always so much more entertaining to break someone strong the weaklings fold and cry and snivel but the brave ones they almost demand that you hurt them he stalked towards me reaching out one white spiderhand do you want me to hurt you i remembered jeanclaudes warning not to use weapons but fuck it i was going for the browning jeanclaude was just suddenly there holding janoss wrist janos seemed impressed truthfully so was i i hadnt seen him move and apparently neither had janos a nifty trick that i let my hand relax away from the gun though i was pretty sure that drawing it would make me feel better but the purpose of tonights exercise was not to make me feel better it was to stay alive no harm to any of us that was the promise jeanclaude said janos drew his wrist from jeanclaudes grasp slowly almost lingeringly as if he enjoyed it once serephinas promise is given she keeps it then why are the young women here those two he motioned to larry and mewould truly not stand by and watch harm come to strangers he sounded surprised but not unhappy about it sadly yes jeanclaude said and if they join the fray you will come in to protect her janos asked if i must janos smiled and i could hear his skin creak with the strain of holding in his bones splendid i saw a tremor run through jeanclaudes back as if he had been caught off guard i was just plain confused the two young women came willingly into our house they knew what we were and agreed to help us entertain guests i glanced at the second girl is that true one of her vampire guards touched her shoulder lightly but it was enough we came willingly but we didnt know the vampires hand squeezed the girls face crumbled in pain but she made no sound they came of their own free will and they are of the age of consent janos said so what happens now i asked ivy chain that one over there he pointed as he said it to some furlined manacles to the left of the door ivy and bruce picked up the girl pulled her to her feet and led her stumbling to the wall her back facing the room please i stepped next to jeanclaude and whispered though i knew within reason theyd hear i dont like this nor i ma petite can we stop it without breaking the truce not unless they offer harm to us directly no what happens if i break the truce they will try to kill us most likely there were five vampires in the room three of them older than jeanclaude we would die dammit the blonde girl sobbed and struggled pulling at her arms as the vampires chained her to the wall she screamed and pulled so violently that without the fur lining shed have bloodied her wrists a woman stepped into the room from the side door she was tall taller than jeanclaude her skin was the color of coffee with two creams her dark hair fell in long cornrows to her waist she was dressed in a black patent leather body suit it left very little to the imagination she strode hard on her heels a very human walk but she wasnt human kissa jeanclaude said you are still with serephina he sounded surprised not all of us have your luck her voice was thick like honey there was a smell like spices in the air and i wasnt sure if it was her perfume or illusion her highboned face was empty of makeup and still she was beautifulthough i wondered what shed look like if she werent clouding my mind because surely no human could have radiated the raw sexuality that clung to kissa like a touchable cloud i am sorry you are here kissa she smiled dont pity me jeanclaude serephina has promised you to me before janos breaks that beautiful body of yours six vampires four of them older than jeanclaude the odds were not going in our favor chain the other girl there janos motioned to a matching set of manacles to the right of the door the girl shook her head no way she just refused to go and she struggled better than the blonde she threw her body on the ground and used every inch of it not to fight just not to go two vampires several centuries old powerful enough to make my teeth hurt and they had to pick her up from both ends and carry her to the wall shed finally started to scream one loud ragged ragefilled sound after another the darkhaired vamp pinned her to the wall and the other one chained her i cant just watch this larry said he was standing very close to me maybe he didnt know the vampires would hear his whispers it didnt really matter neither can i we were going to get ourselves killed might as well take as many of them with us as we could jeanclaude turned around as if he could smell us going for our guns ma petite monsieur kirkland do not go for your weapons they are treading legalities the women have come to help entertain they will not kill them youre sure of that i asked he frowned i am sure of nothing anymore but i believe that they will keep their word the women are frightened and a little bruised but they are not harmed this isnt harm larry asked he looked outraged and i couldnt blame him i answered him vampires have a very unique sense of whats harmful dont they jeanclaude he met my gaze i see accusation in your eyes but remember this ma petite you asked me to bring you here so do not blame this particular problem on me is our entertainment so boring janos asked we were discussing whether to kill you all now or later i said my voice very matteroffact janos gave a low chuckle please do break the truce anita i would love to have an excuse to get you on one of my novelties i think you would take a long time to break then again it is sometimes the braggarts who break first i dont brag janos i tell the truth she believes what she says kissa said yes she has a disturbing hint of truth to her janos said most tasty the blonde lisa had stopped struggling against the chains she sagged in them nearly incoherent with crying the other girl now that she was chained stood very still but a fine trembling had started in her arms and hands she balled her hands into fists but could not stop the trembling the women came for a little adventure they are certainly getting their moneys worth janos said the two female vamps opened panels in the black walls they each took out a long coil of whip neither of the girls could see i was glad i couldnt stand and watch i couldnt it would kill something inside me to just stand and watch even if it meant i died id at least go down fighting and id take some of them with me better than nothing but before we all committed suicide id try to talk if youre not trying to goad us into breaking the truce then what the hell do you want want janos said want why many things anita i was beginning to hate the way he said my name sort of halfamused and intimate like we were friends or close enemies what do you want janos shouldnt you be negotiating for your people he asked jeanclaude anita does well enough on her own jeanclaude said janos gave another rictus smile very well what do we want the vampires went to the girls they held up the whips so the two girls could see them what is that the blonde asked what is that her voice was high and bubbly with fear its a whip the second girl said firm and clipped her voice did not betray her the way her trembling body did the two vampires backed away just enough for good whipping distance i guess what the bloody hell do you want i asked are you familiar with the term whipping boy janos asked it was a person used by royalty to be beaten in the place of the royal heir very good so few young people have a sense of history what does the history lesson have to do with anything the girls are whipping boys for your two young men janos said the two vampires snaked the whips along the floor and cracked them nearly in unison but neither whip touched the girls the second girl screamed a short clipped sound when the whip whistled into the wall next to her the blonde just sank against the wall sobbing please please please over and over in a ragged voice dont hurt them larry said please would you take her place janos asked i finally understood where we were heading you cant hurt us without our cooperation you treacherous son of a bitch he smiled answer me lad would you take her place larry nodded i grabbed his arm no surely it is his choice janos said let go of my arm anita i stared at his eyes searching to see if he understood what he was doing you dont know what a whip will do to human flesh you dont know what youre offering we can remedy that janos said the vampires ripped the backs of the girls blouses with a harsh quick tearing the blonde screamed we cant just watch larry said he was right whether i liked it or not he was right ive seen what a whip can do jason said suddenly dont hurt them i stared at him you dont strike me as the selfsacrificing kind he shrugged we all have our moments would it make this an easier choice if i swore that if your young man takes the girls place we will not cripple him how about kill him i said you can die of shock from a whipping no killing no crippling we simply want our pound of flesh and a quart of blood something must have shown on our faces because he laughed figuratively speaking of course you will wear scars until you die but no greater harm this is ridiculous i said we arent going to do this if we pull our guns can we take them larry asked i looked away from his earnest eyes he touched my arm anita we can take some of them with us i said but well still be dead and once were dead wholl help the girls i shook my head theres got to be a better way larry looked at jeanclaude will he keep his word will they not kill me janoss word has always been reliable or at least it was a couple of centuries ago can we trust them jason asked no i said yes jeanclaude said i glared at him i know you would rather shoot it out but you would only succeed in getting us all killed or perhaps some of us made into vampires larry touched my shoulders he made me look at him its alright its not alright i said fine but its the best we can do right now dont do this i dont have a choice he said besides im a big boy remember i can take care of myself i hugged him i didnt know what else to do ill be alright he whispered i just nodded i didnt trust my voice and i try never to lie to my friends he would not be alright i knew it he knew it we all knew it jason walked away from us towards the vampires oh no my good shapeshifter we dont want you chained to a wall but you said i said you could save the girls but not like that let the human take his lashes all you must agree to is satisfying the desires of my two helpers bettina and pallas jason stared at the two vampires theyd turned to face us i suddenly tried to see them from the viewpoint of a twentyyearold male they were chesty slim waisted if pallass face was a little too witchylooking for my taste and bettinas eyes too small that was just me neither of them was pretty or even beautiful they were handsome in the way that some tall leggy women are handsome in a good way if they had been human jason frowned it seems im getting the better deal here would it make any difference if i said you had to do it here in this room on the floor in front of everyone janos asked jason thought about that for a minute if i say no does the girl get whipped janos nodded then i agree he said but his voice was soft and uncertain being lascivious in private was one thing doing it in public was different come then shapeshifter let the show begin janos made a sweeping motion with his white hands jason glanced back at jeanclaude like a kid on the first day of school wondering if the bullies were really going to hurt him jeanclaude gave no comfort his face was as still and unreadable as a painting he gave a small nod that could have meant anything from it will be alright to just do it i watched jasons shoulders rise with a deep breath and heard him blow it out like a runner before a race why is it that most things you might willingly do under other circumstances become distasteful when you have no choice have you ever been with one of us janos asked jason shook his head janos put a longfingered hand on jasons shoulder jason didnt seem to enjoy that couldnt blame him there are many pleasures that await you my young shapeshifter things that no human or wereanimal can give to you sensations that only the dead can offer the two female vampires had stepped to the far end of the room in a clear space on the black floor the whips lay coiled at the feet of the two girls as if they were a reminder of what would happen if anyone chickened out if jason wanted to fuck a few vampires that was fine with me besides he wasnt mine to protect but the sex wasnt going to last forever i couldnt let them have larry i couldnt stand by and watch him be tortured i just couldnt but if i pulled down the room then even if we got out of the basementhighly doubtful all on its ownwed have every vamp in the place after our ass there would be more there were always more but what had jeanclaude said if they broke the truce first we could draw weapons it had possibilities the one with long blonde hair had undone her braid she shook out her hair like it was a thick curtain of yellow waves it hid her face for a moment and she seemed softer more human maybe it was illusion whatever jason touched that thick hair wadded his hands into it then slid his hands around her waist if he was going to have to do it it looked like he was going to have fun while he did nice to see someone who enjoys his work the darkhaired vamp came in from behind pressing her leatherclad body against him jason was short enough that his face was about breast level for both of them he buried his face in the blondes chest she unlaced the front of her leather vest peeling it back so he could suck her breasts i turned away i was never much for voyeurism had an embarrassing tendency to blush ivy and bruce moved along the wall to stand near the corner next to the threesome bruce was fascinated and embarrassed but he kept looking there was no embarrassment on ivys face she moved along the wall her back pressed to it hands feeling their way along her red lipsticked mouth was partially open she slid down the wall the red dress bunching around her thighs as she went to all fours watching them move along the wall brought my gaze back to the entertainment jasons shirt was gone wearing nothing but his leather pants and his black boots he matched the two vampires he was on his knees his back arched so he was cradled against the brunette behind him she smoothed her hands down his naked chest he turned giving her his lips the kiss was long and deep and full of more probing than anybody but your doctor should be doing the blonde was sitting with her legs wide open in front of them undoing jasons pants shed already done something to her leather pants so that the crotch was open she was a natural blonde why was i surprised ivy stretched out a hand to pull at the other vampires long yellow hair ivy janos said you were not invited she pulled her hand back but didnt back away she was as close to the action as she could get and not be part of it bruce was still pinned to the wall openmouthed and a little sweaty but he didnt seem to want to come closer janos stood very calmly watching he had a tight grin on his face and for the first time there was some light in those deadfish eyes he was enjoying himself jeanclaude was halfleaning halfsitting against a metal frame that held the rough outline of a body he was watching the show but his face was still unreadable a beautiful mask he saw me looking at him but there was no change in his eyes he was as closed and solitary as if he were standing in an empty room he wasnt breathing that i could see did he have a heartbeat when he held himself so still or did everything stop kissa stood by the door that we hadnt been through she had her arms crossed over her stomach for someone that had wanted to jump jeanclaudes bones so badly she didnt seem to like the show much or maybe she was the guard to keep larry and me from running screaming from the room larry had backed as far away from the action as he could get he was pressed up against the wall trying to find something to look at but his eyes kept being drawn back to the other end of the room it was like trying not to watch a train wreck you didnt want to see it happen but if it was going to happen you didnt quite want to look away either when would you ever get the chance to see it again a mÐ¹nage Ð° trois made up of two vampires and a werewolf couldnt be that common a sight for larry it wasnt even a common sight for me the two girls still chained to the wall couldnt see what was going on probably just as well a low moan broke from the other side of the room it made me glance back jasons pants had been pulled partially down to reveal most of the smooth expanse of his buttocks his arms were braced leaving only his lower body touching the woman his body rose and fell rhythmically the blonde vampire writhed under him another low moan escaping her throat her breasts spilled out of her black leather vest like an offering as she did a sort of situp to meet jasons mouth the brunette licked a slow pink tongue along his spine his back convulsed with the sensation or maybe it was another sensation the effect looked the same i turned away but the image was burned on my mind i felt heat crawl up my neck damn larrys eyes widened and i watched the color drain from his face until his skin was the surprised white of paper and his eyes too big for his face i fought it for a minute but i turned back to see like lots wife risking it all for one last forbidden glimpse jason had collapsed his face lost in the blondes hair her face was turned to the room her skin had thinned until you could see every bone in her face her full lips had thinned back making her teeth look longer she no longer had enough lips to hide her fangs the brunette knelt just behind them her knees between both their legs she lowered her hands from her face and one half of that handsome face rotted away she ran her hand through her long dark hair and it came away in clumps she turned her face towards the rest of us the skin sloughed off the bones on the left side of her face and fell to the floor with a thick wet plop i swallowed hard enough that it hurt going down and backed up to stand by larry he wasnt white anymore he was green my turn now one of the vampires said my face turned back to the scene at the end of the room almost against my will i couldnt stand to watch and couldnt stand to look away jason rose in a sort of pushup motion he caught a glimpse of the blondes face and his shoulders tensed the line of his spine tightening he pulled away from her slowly coming to his knees the brunette ran her fingers down his naked back her flesh sloughed away leaving a trail of greenish slime behind a tremor ran through his body that had nothing to do with sex from across the room i could see jasons chest rise and fall faster and faster as if he was hyperventilating he stayed staring straight ahead making no move to turn and look behind him as if it would go away if he didnt look the brunette wrapped her decaying arms around his shoulders leaned her rotted face next to his and whispered something jason struggled away from them crawling against the wall his bare chest was covered in bits of her flesh his eyes were impossibly wide showing too much white he couldnt seem to get enough air a strand of something thick and heavy slid slowly down his neck onto his chest he batted at it like you would swat at a spider that you found crawling along your skin he was pressed into the black wall with his pants nearly to his thighs the blonde rolled off her back and crawled towards him reaching a hand out that was nothing but bones with bits of dried flesh she seemed to be decaying in dry ground the brunette was wet she lay back on the floor and some dark fluid rushed out from her to pool beneath her body shed undone her own leather shirt and her breasts were like heavy bags of fluid im ready for you the brunette said her voice was still clear and solid no human voice should have come out of those rotting lips the blonde grabbed jasons arm and he screamed jeanclaude sat there watching motionless unmoved i found myself walking towards them it surprised even me i kept waiting for the smell that should have accompanied the rotting flesh but with every step the air was clean i stood beside jeanclaude and said is this illusion he wouldnt look at me no ma petite it is not an illusion i poked him in the arm and it was hard and firm as wood it didnt feel like flesh at all is this illusion no ma petite he looked at me at last and his eyes were solid drowning blue both forms were real he stood and even standing next to him i could not see him breathe the brunette was on all fours reaching for jason with a hand that fell into wet pieces as it moved jason screamed and pressed himself into the wall as if he wanted to crawl through it he hid his face like a child ignoring the monster under his bed but this was no child and he knew the monsters were real help him i whispered and i wasnt sure which of us i was talking to i shall do what i can jeanclaude said i was staring at him when i heard the next words in my head his lips never moved if they break the truce first ma petite then you are free to slaughter everyone in this room i stared at him but his face betrayed nothing only the echo of him inside my head told me i hadnt hallucinated it there was no time to bitch about the fact that hed invaded my head later we could argue later janos that one word reverberated through the room until it echoed up the soles of my feet like a deep bass drum janos turned to look at jeanclaude his skeletal face set in a pleased expression you rang i challenge you the three words were bland they fell like offkey notes jangling along my nerves if the tone bothered janos you couldnt tell it you cannot prevail against me janos said that remains to be seen does it not jeanclaude asked janos smiled until the skin nearly snapped if by some miracle you best me what do you want safe passage for all my people i cleared my throat and the two girls and if i win janos said what do i get what do you want you know what we want say it jeanclaude said you give up your safe passage we get you to do with as we like jeanclaude gave a small nod so be it he pointed at the rotting vampires get them away from my wolf janos smiled they will not hurt him but if you fail ill make a gift of him to my two beauties a low sound like a swallowed scream crawled from jasons throat the brunettes hand started the crawl down his stomach to his privates he screamed and pushed her away but unless he resorted to violence he was trapped and if we broke the truce first we were dead but if they broke the truce jeanclaude and janos had moved back to the center of the room they stood a few yards apart jeanclaude stood with his feet spaced as if he was bracing for a fight janos stood with his feet together easy unconcerned you will lose everything jeanclaude what are you up to jeanclaude just shook his head challenge has been offered and accepted what are you waiting on janos are you afraid of me at long last afraid of you never jeanclaude not a hundred years ago not a moment ago enough talk janos his voice had gone low and soft yet it carried through the entire room and crawled up the black walls to rain down in drops of sound that were dark and angerfilled janos laughed but the sound had none of the touchable qualities of jeanclaudes voice let us dance silence fell so abruptly on the room i thought id gone deaf then i realized i could still hear my own heartbeat the blood rushing in my own head waves of something rose between the two master vampires like heat rising off summer pavement what poured along my skin wasnt heat it was power a whirling rushing storm of power id felt jeanclaude go up against other vampires and id never felt anything like this my hair streamed in a wind that was coming from the two jeanclaudes face was thinning down his white skin glowing like polished alabaster his eyes were blue flames that bled sapphire fire down every vein under his skin his bones glowed gold his humanity was folding away and it wouldnt be enough he would lose unless they broke the truce first kissa stood by the door still guarding it her dark face was impassive she was no help to me the two rotted things still crawled over jason only ivy and bruce were still standing bruce looked scared ivy looked excited she watched the two master vamps with halfparted lips her lower lip drawn under with concentration or excitement id been able to meet her eyes and that had bothered hera lot i crossed the room behind jeanclaude when i passed him the current of power lashed out and curled around me like an arm i kept walking and it slipped away but my skin shivered where it had touched me the shit was going to hit the fan unless i could stop it kissa watched me move past her with narrowed eyes i ignored her one master vampire at a time i walked past bruce and stopped in front of ivy she stared past me at the two masters ignoring me i opened my mouth as i spoke the silence split apart and sound came back to me ears with a nearly painful clap like a tiny sonic boom i challenge you ivy blinked at me as if id just appeared what did you say i challenge you i said i kept my face blank and tried very hard not to think about what i was doing ivy laughed you are mad i am a master vampire you cannot challenge me but i can meet your eyes i said i let a small smile play along my lips i tried to keep my mind blank no thought to betray me no fear to leak out but of course once i thought of fear it was there curling in my stomach she laughed high and tinkling like broken glass it nearly cut skin just to hear it what the hell was i doing the wind rushed against my back nearly flinging me into her i glanced back in time to see jeanclaude stagger and a splash of blood spill from his hand janos hadnt broken a sweat yet whatever i was doing id better do it fast after jeanclaude loses im going to ask janos to make him fuck me your master is going to be everybodys meat and so will you my eyes flicked to the rotted things clawing at jason incentive enough i turned back to ivy and met her brown eyes you wont do shit you cant even outstare one puny human being she glared at me her anger was instantaneous like fire springing out of a match i watched the brown of her irises spread across her eyes from a space of less than ten inches her eyes were shining pools of dark light my pulse threatened to choke me and a little voice in my head was screaming run away run away i stood there and stared her down she was a master vampire but a young one a hundred years from now shed have eaten me for breakfast but right now tonight maybe just maybe she wouldnt she hissed at me flashing her fangs oh thats impressive i said like a dog showing its teeth this dog could tear your throat out her voice had gone low and evil crawling along my spine until i spent most of my effort not to shiver i didnt trust my voice not to shake so i spoke low and soft and very clear try it see how far you get she darted forward but i saw her move felt her come for me i threw myself backwards away from her but she grabbed my arm and lifted me off my feet with her elbow braced so that she could hold me aloft her strength was incredible she could have crushed my arm and i couldnt have done a damn thing about it kissa was suddenly there put her down now ivy put me down she threw me across the room air rushed past me the world blurring so quickly it was like being blind the air stopped rushing and down i came falling does not cover the speed and abruptness of being thrown from less than ten feet high i smacked into the wall and tried to slam my arms and hands against it to take some of the momentum before my head smacked into it i slid down the wall though slid implies something slow and there was nothing slow about it i collapsed at the base of the wall in a crumbled breathless heap blinking at bright jarring images that didnt quite make pictures yet the first image that came clear was a rotted face with a patch of long dark hair dangling from its scalp the vamps tongue rolled behind broken teeth something black and thicker than blood spilled with a plop out of her mouth i pushed to my knees and found skeletal arms wrapped around my shoulders the blondes dried fangfilled mouth whispered in my ear come to play something hard and stiff poked my ear it was her tongue i scrambled away but claws caught in my jacket hands that should have been weak as dried sticks were like steel bands they broke the truce ma petite i cannot hold him long i had a moment to glance up and find jeanclaude on his knees with both hands extended towards janos janos still stood but he did nothing else i had a few moments nothing more i stopped trying to get free of the two vampires they swarmed over me and in the mess of arms and legs and body fluids i drew the browning i fired it pointblank into the rotted ones chest she staggered but didnt go down fangs sank into my back and i screamed a gun exploded from across the room but there was no time to look jason was suddenly there pulling the blonde off me i fired into the rotting skull of the brunette she finally collapsed onto the floor in a puddle of liquid and jerking limbs i turned back to jeanclaude and found him nearly prone on the floor a pool of blood in front of him he had one arm still held outward towards janos janos made a small flicking motion and blood flew in an arc from jeanclaudes body he collapsed to the floor and power rushed outward blowing back my hair the world suddenly stank of rotting corpses i gagged and pulled the trigger on that long black body janos turned it seemed like slow motion as if i had all the time in the world to aim and fire again but somehow he was facing me when i pulled the trigger the second time the bullet took him squarely in the chest he staggered but didnt go down i sighted on that round skeletal head his white hand came up and slashed the air and impossibly i felt like some invisible claw had slashed my arm i fired but my aim was a little off the bullet grazed the side of his face he slashed at me again and i saw blood start to drip down my hands scare tactics it didnt hurt that much not nearly as much as it would hurt if he got his hands on me for real a second gun sounded and janos staggered as a bullet took him in the shoulder larry was behind him gun out my vision faded as if fog was rolling in behind my eyes i lowered my aim to the larger target of his upper body and pulled the trigger again i heard larrys bullet go high and wide into the wall behind me a startled hey let me know jason was still back there i saw janos go for the door like watching slow motion through a fog so thick i could barely see i fired twice more and knew i hit him at least once when he was out of the room i fell forward onto all fours and waited for my vision to clear hoped it would clear through my ruined vision i saw jeanclaude still lying motionless in a pool of his own blood the question that came into my head was is he dead a stupid question about a vampire but it was still the first thing i thought of i glanced behind me and found jason scattering bits of the two female vampires around the floor he was tearing at them with his bare hands cracking their bones and throwing them far away from each other as if by sheer destruction he could wash away what theyd done to him bruce lay on his back by the wall blood had soaked into his tuxedo i couldnt tell for sure but he looked dead ivy and kissa were nowhere to be seen larry was still standing across the room gun extended as if he didnt realize that janos was gone he was frowning everybody was up everybody was moving except jeanclaude shit i crawled towards him not trusting myself to stand with my vision so spotty it seemed to take a long time to reach him as if more than my eyesight wasnt working quite right my vision was mostly clear by the time i got to him i knelt in a thick pool of his blood and stared down at him how do you tell if a vampire is dead sometimes he didnt have a pulse or a heartbeat or didnt breathe shit again i holstered the browning there was nothing here right now to shoot and i needed my hands i bled on my shirt and looked at my hands for the first time it looked like fingernails had scraped down both of them a little deeper than normal but theyd heal probably wouldnt even be a scar i touched jeanclaudes shoulder and the flesh was soft very human i rolled him over onto his back his hand flopped against the floor with a bonelessness that only the dead have some trick of the night had made his face beautiful again the most human id ever seen it except for the fact that no one was that pretty i checked for the big pulse in his neck i held my fingers against his cooling skin and felt nothing something like tears welled against my eyes and my throat was tight but i wouldnt cry not yet i wasnt even sure i wanted to when is dead dead for a vampire is there such a thing as cpr for the undead hell he breathed some of the time he had a heart and it beat most of the time not beating couldnt be a good thing i positioned his head pinched his nose closed and blew a breath into his mouth his chest rose with it i tried two more breaths but he didnt breathe on his own i unbuttoned his shirt and found the spot above his breastbone and pressed one two three four all the way to fifteen compressions two breaths jason staggered over to me then collapsed to his knees is he gone i dont know i pumped with everything i had in me hard enough to break ribs on a human being but he wasnt human he lay there his body moving only when i moved it as loose and boneless as only the dead can be his lips were halfparted his closed eyes edged with the black lace of his thick eyelashes his curling black hair still framed his pale face id pictured jeanclaude dead id even thought about killing him myself once or twice but now that his death was a fact i didnt know how to feel it didnt seem fair somehow id brought him here id asked him to come and he came and now he was dead well and truly dead and it was partially my fault partially my doing if i killed jeanclaude i wanted to actually pull the trigger and watch his eyes as he died not like this i stared down at him i thought about no more jeanclaude this beautiful body rotting at last in the grave it so richly deserved i shook my head i couldnt let that happen not if i could save him i only knew one thing that all dead respected craved blood i tried to breathe life into him one more time with one difference i smeared my blood on his mouth first my lips touched his and i tasted the sweet metallic taste of my own blood nothing larry knelt beside us where did janos go he hadnt been able to see through the fog but i didnt have time to explain watch the door shoot anything that comes through can i let the girls go sure id forgotten about the girls id forgotten about jeff quinlan id have traded them all for jeanclaude to blink his eyes at me not if the choice had been offered to me as an eitheror but just now they were strangers he wasnt more blood maybe jason said softly i looked at him you offering neither of us can feed him back to full strength without dying but ill help he said you fed him once tonight already can you donate twice im a werewolf i heal quick besides my blood has more kick to it than a humans more power i really looked at him then he was covered in slime a big black smear covered most of one cheek his blue eyes didnt look wolfish they looked haunted hurt there are things that harm a lot more than physically i took a deep breath and slid one of my knives out of its sheath i sliced my left wrist the pain was sharp and immediate i placed the wound against jeanclaudes lips blood welled into his mouth blood filled his mouth like wine pouring into a cup it seeped out the corner of his mouth and slid down his cheek i stroked his throat to make him swallow the blood how hed laugh to know id finally opened a vein for him more blood spilled from his unresponsive lips dammit i breathed into his mouth and got a taste of my own blood i made his chest rise breathing in my own blood i thought one word at him live live live a shudder ran through the body the throat convulsed swallowed i pulled back from him he caught my wrist as i moved it back from his chin his grip hurt i could feel that unnatural strength that could break bone his eyes were still closed only the grip on my wrist let me know we were making progress i put a hand on his chest he wasnt breathing on his own yet no heartbeat was that bad good indifferent hell i didnt know jeanclaude can you hear me its anita he raised up in a small motion and pressed my bleeding wrist to his mouth he bit me and i gasped he used both hands to press my wrist to his mouth and sucked me in the middle of sex it might have felt good now it just hurt damn i said whats wrong larry asked it hurts i said i thought it was supposed to feel good the blonde girl said i shook my head not unless youre under hypnotic control how long will this take larry asked as long as it takes i said watch the door which one oh hell just shoot anything that comes through it i was feeling lightheaded how much had he drunk jason im getting a little woozy here i tried to pull my wrist free but his hands were like iron forged to my skin i cant get him off jason pulled at the pale hands but couldnt budge them i could tear the fingers off one at a time and get you loose but yeah jeanclaude would be pissed dizziness was coming in waves nausea starting to build in the pit of my stomach i had to get him off me let go of me jeanclaude let go of me dammit his eyes were still closed his face blank he fed like a baby with singleminded determination but this baby was draining my life away i could feel it going down my arm my heart was beginning to pound in my ears as if id been running pumping the blood faster feeding him faster killing me faster spots were dancing in front of my eyes the darkness beginning to eat the light i drew the browning what are you doing jason asked hes going to kill me he doesnt know what hes doing ill still be dead somethings moving around at the head of the stairs larry called great jeanclaude let go of me now i pressed the barrel of the gun to the flawless skin of his forehead darkness was eating my vision in great moving bites nausea burned up my throat i leaned over him and whispered please jeanclaude let me go its your ma petite let me go i sat back up vampires coming larry said hurry up i stared down at that beautiful face locked on my arm eating me alive and squeezed his eyes flew open i moved my whole finger to keep from squeezing down he lay his head back onto the floor still holding my wrist but no longer feeding his mouth was crimson with my blood the gun was still pointed at him ah ma petite havent we done this before the gun i said but not this i drew my wrist from his reluctant hands and sat back with the browning cradled in my lap nausea and darkness flew inside my head like clouds driven by the wind i saw larry crouched by the foot of the stairs gun out but it was like looking down a tunnel distant and not as important as it should have been jason lay down on the bloody floor i blinked at him the neck hurts less he said just as if id asked jeanclaude crawled on top of him jason turned his head to one side without being asked jeanclaude pressed his bloodstained mouth over the big pulse in jasons neck i saw the muscles in his mouth and jaw as he sank fangs into the tender skin even if id known the neck hurt less i wouldnt have offered it it looked too much like sex the wrist at least let me pretend we werent doing something intimate anita i turned back to the stairs larry was crouched there alone with his gun the two girls had moved back away from the door the blonde was having hysterics again couldnt really blame her i shook my head lifted the browning in a teacup grip and pointed it at the door i needed the extra arm to steady me there was a faint tremor to my arms that wasnt going to help my aim much power breathed through the room prickling along my skin you could almost smell it like perfumed sheets in the dark i wondered if jeanclaude and i had given off that kind of power when hed fed off me i hadnt noticed it something white appeared in the doorway it took me a second to figure out what it was a white handkerchief tied to a stick what the fuck is that i asked a flag of truce ma petite i didnt look away from the stairs to that thick honeydipped voice jeanclaude sounded better or worse than ever each word like fur rubbing along my tired body his voice was thick enough to wrap around all the aches and pains he could make them go away i just knew it i swallowed and lowered the gun towards the floor stay the fuck out of my head my apologies ma petite i can taste you in my mouth feel your frantic heartbeat like a treasured memory i will curb my enthusiasm but with effort anita with great effort he sounded like i had let him have just a little sex and he wanted more i glanced at him he was sitting beside jasons halfnaked body jason was staring at the ceiling eyes heavylidded like he was halfasleep blood trickled from two new puncture wounds in his neck he didnt look like hed felt much pain in fact it looked like it had felt good id taken the edge off jeanclaudes need and jason had gotten a smoother ride bully for him may we talk a voice from the hallway a mans i couldnt place it hell i was having trouble focusing on anything let alone who the disembodied voices belonged to anita what do you want me to do larry asked its a flag of truce i said my words felt slurred though they sounded clear enough i felt almost drunk or drugged it was a bad drunk a dangerous downer magnus stepped into the doorway for a second i thought i was seeing things it was so damned unexpected he was dressed all in white from his tux to his shoes the cloth seemed to shine against his dark skin his long hair was tied back with a loose white ribbon he had the handkerchiefcoated stick gripped in one hand he walked down the steps in a graceful almost dancelike movement it wasnt a vampires glide but it was close larry kept his gun trained on him stay where you are larry said he sounded a little scared but like he meant it the gun was pointed nice and steady weve discussed the fact that silver bullets dont work on the fey who says this gun has silver bullets larry said it was a good lie i was proud of him i was certainly too gone to have thought of it anita magnus looked past larry like he wasnt there but he didnt come down those last few steps id do what he says magnus now what do you want magnus smiled and spread his arms away from his body to show he was unarmed i guess but i knew and larry knew that weapons werent what made him dangerous i mean you no harm we know that ivy broke the truce first serephina offers her most sincere apologies she asks that you come directly to her audience chamber no more tests we have all been unforgivably rude to a visiting master do we believe him i asked of no one in particular he speaks the truth jeanclaude said great let him pass larry you sure thats a good idea no but do it anyway larry pointed his gun at the floor but he didnt look happy magnus walked down the stairs smiling mostly at larry he walked past him and made a show of giving him his back it was almost enough to make me wish larry would shoot him he stopped a few feet in front of the rest of us we were all still on the floor sitting or in jasons case lying magnus looked down at us amused or bemused what the hell are you doing here i asked jeanclaude glanced at me you seem to know each other this is magnus bouvier i said what are you doing here with them he loosened the tie at his collar and spread the stiff cloth i was pretty sure what he was trying to show me but i couldnt see from the floor i wasnt at all sure i could stand without falling over if you want me to take a peek youre going to have to come down here with pleasure he knelt in front of me less than two feet away he had two healing bite marks on his neck shit magnus why he looked at me eyes flicking to my bloody wrist i might ask you the same thing i donated blood to save his life whats your excuse he smiled nothing half as nice as that magnus undid the ribbon and let his hair fall like a curtain around his shoulders he looked at me with his turquoise blue eyes and crawled on all fours towards jeanclaude he moved like he had muscles in places that people didnt it was like watching a great cat move people just didnt move like that he knelt in front of jeanclaude so close they were almost touching he swept his hair to one side and offered his neck no jeanclaude said whats going on larry asked it was a good question i didnt have a good answer i didnt even have a bad one magnus slipped off his white jacket and let it slide to the floor he undid the cuff to his right wrist and pushed the cloth back he offered his bare wrist to jeanclaude the skin was smooth and unbroken jeanclaude took his hand and raised the skin to his lips i almost looked away but in the end i didnt looking away is like lying to yourself you pretend it isnt happening but it is jeanclaude brushed his lips across the skin then released magnuss hand the offer is generous but i would be drunk indeed if i added your blood to theirs drunk i asked what the fuck are you talking about ah ma petite you do have a way with words shut up losing a quantity of blood makes you grumpy he said fuck off he laughed and the sound was sweet it had a taste just outside description like some forbidden candy that was not just fattening but poisonous but what a way to go magnus stayed kneeling staring at the laughing vampire you wont taste me jeanclaude shook his head as if he didnt trust himself to speak his eyes glittered with suppressed laughter the blood has been offered magnus crawled back towards me his hair had spilled forward on one side so one eye was lost glittering like a jewel through his hair eyes just werent supposed to be that color he crawled up to me until our faces were inches apart a pint of blood a pound of flesh he whispered it leaning in towards me as if for a kiss i leaned back away from him and overbalanced i ended up on my back on the floor it was not an improvement magnus crawled over me still on all fours hovering i pressed the browning into his chest back off or bite it magnus crawled backwards but not very far i sat up keeping the gun on him onehanded the barrel wavered a lot more than normal what was that all about jeanclaude said janos spoke of taking blood and flesh from us this night as an apology serephina offers us blood and flesh i stared at magnus still on all fours still looking feral and dangerous i lowered the gun no thanks magnus sat back on the floor smoothing his hands through his hair brushing it back from his face you have refused serephinas peace offerings do you refuse her apology as well take us to serephina and you will have done what was asked of you jeanclaude said magnus looked at me what of you anita are you content that i take you to serephina do you accept her apology i shook my head why should i anita is not a master jeanclaude said it is my vengeance my pardon you should be asking i am doing what i was told he said she challenged ivy to a test of wills ivy lost i didnt throw her across the room i said jeanclaude frowned she resorted to brute force ma petite she could not win by force of will or vampire wiles against a human being he looked suddenly very serious she lost to you so so ma petite you declared yourself a master and proved that claim i shook my head thats ridiculous im not a vampire i did not declare you a master vampire ma petite i said you were a master a master what human being it was his turn to shake his head i do not know ma petite he turned to magnus what does serephina say serephina says to bring her jeanclaude nodded and stood like he was pulled by strings he looked fresh and new if a little bloodstained how dare he look so good when i felt like shit he looked down at jason and me his strange good humor had returned he smiled down at me and even with blood staining his mouth he was beautiful his eyes glittered with some amusing secret he was full of himself in a way id never seen before i do not know if my companions are able to walk theyre feeling a little drained he chuckled at his own joke putting a hand in front of his eyes as if it was too funny even for him you are drunk i said he nodded i believe i am you cant be drunk on blood ive drunk deep of two mortals but neither of you are human i didnt want to hear this what the hell are you talking about necromancer with a chaser of werewolf a drink to make any vampire giddy he giggled jeanclaude never giggled i ignored him if you can ignore an intoxicated vampire jason can you stand i think so his voice was thick heavy but not sleepy more the languor after sex maybe i was glad my bite had hurt larry larry walked over to us glancing at magnus gun naked in his hand he didnt look happy can we trust him were going to i said help me stand up and lets get out of here before fangface busts a gut jeanclaude was doubled over with laughter he seemed to think fangface was outrageously funny ye gods larry helped me stand and after a second of dizziness i was okay he offered a hand to jason without being asked jason swayed on his feet but stayed standing can you walk if you can i can he said a man after my own heart i took a step another and was on my way across the room jason and larry followed jeanclaude staggered to his feet still laughing softly magnus was standing at the foot of the stairs waiting for us he had the jacket slung over one arm hed even found the ribbon to tie back his hair jason walked wide around the torn bodies of his two wouldbe lovers and picked his shirt off the floor the shirt covered the mess on his chest but the goo was still on his face and his hair was stiff and nearly as dark as his pants even the back of jeanclaudes clothes and hair were thick with congealing blood i had my own share of blood and goop good thing i wore mostly black tonight didnt show dirt as badly the crimson blouse was looking a little worse for wear larry was the only one without any blood or gore on him here was hoping he could keep up the good work the two girls had hidden under the stairs while we discussed things i was betting it was the brownhaired girls idea to hide lisa seemed too scared to think let alone do anything smart not that i could blame her but hysteria gets you nowhere but dead the brownhaired girl walked over to larry the blonde came along for the ride her hands dug so tightly into the other ones torn blouse it would have taken surgery to remove them we just want to go home now can we do that her voice was a little breathy but for the most part solid i stared into her brown eyes and nodded larry looked at me magnus i said he raised his eyebrows still waiting by the stairs like a tour guide or a butler ready to escort us up you called i want the girls to leave now safe he glanced at them i dont see why not serephina had us collect them mostly for your benefit anita theyve served their purpose i didnt like the way he said that last safe magnus no more harm are we clear on what that means he smiled they walk out the door and go home is that clear enough for you why so cooperative all of a sudden would letting them go be apology enough magnus asked yeah if they go free unharmed ill accept her apology he nodded then consider it done dont you have to check with your master first my master whispers sweetly to me anita and i obey he smiled while he said it but there was a tightness around his eyes an involuntary flexing of his hands you dont like being her lap dog perhaps but theres not much i can do about it he started up the stairs shall we go up jeanclaude paused at the bottom of the stairs do you need some help ma petite i have taken quite a bit of your blood you do not recover as quickly as my wolf truthfully the stairs looked longer going up than they had coming down but i shook my head i can make it of that ma petite i have no doubt he stepped close to me but did not whisper instead i felt him in my mind you are weak ma petite let me help you stop doing that dammit he smiled and sighed as you like ma petite he walked up the steps like he could have flown barely touching them larry and the girls went up next none of them seemed tired i slogged up after them jason brought up the rear he looked holloweyed it may have felt good but donating that much blood is still rough even on the temporarily furry if jeanclaude had offered to carry him up the stairs would he have agreed jason caught me looking but he didnt smile he just stared back maybe hed have said no too werent we all just being uncooperative tonight the silken drapes had been drawn aside a throne sat in the far righthand corner there was no other word for it chair just didnt cover that golden bejeweled thing cushions were scattered on the floor around it heaped like they should be covered with harem girls or at least small pampered dogs nothing sat on them it was like an empty stage waiting for the actors to appear a small wallhanging on the back wall had been pushed aside to reveal a door the door had been wedged open with a triangular piece of wood the spring air poured through the open door chasing back the smell of decay i started to say come on girls but the wind changed it blew harder colder and i knew it wasnt wind at all my skin prickled the fine muscles along my arms and shoulders twitching with it what is that larry asked ghosts i said ghosts what the hell are ghosts doing here serephina can call ghosts jeanclaude said it is a unique ability among us kissa appeared in the doorway her right arm hung loose at her side blood dripped down her arm in a slow heavy line your handiwork i asked larry nodded i shot her but it didnt seem to slow her down much you hurt her larry widened his eyes great he didnt sound great when he said it wounded master vampires get cranky as hell serephina bids you come outside kissa said magnus dropped to the cushions boneless as a cat he looked like hed curled up there before you arent coming i asked ive seen the show he said jeanclaude walked towards the door jason had moved up beside him but back a couple of steps like a good dog the two girls were holding onto larrys jacket he had been the one who unchained them theyd seen him shoot the bad guys he was a hero and like all good heroes hed get himself killed protecting them jeanclaude was suddenly at my side what is wrong ma petite can the girls go out the front why because whatevers out there is big and bad and i want them out of it whats wrong jason asked he stood a little to one side he was flexing his hands closed open closed open hed seemed a lot more relaxed thirty minutes ago but then werent we all jeanclaude turned to kissa was this one right he motioned to magnus are the girls free to go they may go so says our master he turned to the girls go he said they looked at each other then at larry alone the blonde said the brownhaired one shook her head come on lisa theyre letting us go come on she looked at larry thank you just go home he said be safe she nodded and started for the far door with lisa clinging to her they left the door to the room open and we watched them walk out the front nothing swooped down upon them no screams cut the night what do you know are you ready now ma petite we must pay our respects he took a step forward looking at me jason already stood at his side nervous hands and all i nodded and fell into step behind jeanclaude larry stayed at my side like a second shadow i could feel his fear like a trembling against my skin i understood why he was scared janos had beaten jeanclaude janos was afraid of serephina which meant she could take jeanclaude without raising a sweat if she could take the vampire that was on our side she wouldnt find us much of a challenge if i was smart id shoot her as soon as i saw her of course we were here to ask for her help it sort of cut my options the cool wind played in our hair like it had little hands it was almost alive id never felt any wind that could make me want to brush it off like an overly amorous date but i wasnt afraid i should have been not of the ghosts but of whatever had called them up but i felt distant and faintly unreal blood loss will do that to you we walked out the door and down two small stone steps rows of small gnarled fruit trees decorated the back of the house there was a wall of darkness just beyond the orchard it was a thick wall of shadows so black that i couldnt see through it the naked tree branches were framed against the blackness what is that i asked some of us can weave shadows and darkness around us jeanclaude said i know i saw it when coltrain was killed but this is a freaking wall it is impressive he said his voice was very bland matteroffact i glanced at him but even in the bright moonlight i couldnt read his face a sparkle of white light showed behind the blackness beams of cold pale light pierced the darkness the light ate away at the dark like paper burns the blackness crumbling vanishing as the light consumed it when the last of the darkness had shredded away a pale figure stood among the trees even from this distance you wouldnt have mistaken her for human but then she wasnt trying to pass a pale white luminescence swirled above her head a glowing cloud yards across like colorless neon vague figures darted out from it then swirled back is that what i think it is larry asked ghosts i said shit he said my thoughts exactly the ghosts flowed out into the trees they hung on the dead branches like a froth of early blossoms if blossoms could move and writhe and glow the strange wind blew against my face sending my hair streaming backwards a long thin line of phosphorescent figures whirled out the ghosts came sweeping towards us low to the ground anita just ignore them larry they cant actually hurt you as long as you keep moving and ignore them the first ghost was long and thin with a wide screaming mouth that looked like a smoke ring it hit me at midchest the shock ran through me like electricity the small muscles in my arms jerked with it larry gasped what the hell was that jason asked i took a step forward keep walking and ignore them i didnt mean to but my pace took me ahead of jeanclaude the next ghost swept over my face there was a moment of smothering but i kept walking and it passed jeanclaude touched my arm i stared into his face and wasnt sure what i saw he was definitely trying to tell me something he stepped out in front of me still staring at me i nodded and let him lead it didnt cost me anything i dont like this larry said in a singsong voice me either jason said he was batting at a tiny swirl of whiteness like a tame mist the more he swatted at it the more solid it became a face was forming out of the mist i walked back to jason and grabbed his arms ignore it the small ghost perched on his shoulder it had a large bulbous nose and two halfformed eyes jasons arms tensed under my hands every time you notice them you give them power to manifest themselves i said a ghost hit me in the back it was like a lump of moving ice in the center of my body it crawled out the front of my body like a cold rope being pulled through me the sensation was unnerving as hell but it wasnt permanent it didnt even really hurt the ghost dived into jasons chest and he cried out only my grip on his arms kept him from clawing at the thing every muscle in jasons body twitched like a horse being eaten alive by flies he sagged when the ghost was through him looking at me with horrorfilled eyes it was nice to know he could be scared the vampires seemed to have taken some of his courage with their rotting arms couldnt blame him id have had screaming fits too larry jumped when a ghost popped through him but that was all his eyes were a little wide but he knew where the danger lay and it wasnt the ghosts jeanclaude came to stand near us what is wrong my wolf there was an undercurrent of warning anger his pet was not living up to his reputation were fine i said i squeezed jasons hand his eyes were still wide but he nodded well be fine jeanclaude walked towards the distant white figure once more his movement graceful unhurried as if he wasnt as scared as the rest of us maybe he wasnt i pulled jason with me larry had moved to my back the three of us walked like normal human beings behind jeanclaude we looked like good little soldiers except for the fact that i was holding the werewolfs hand his hand was sweating against my skin couldnt afford to have a hysterical werewolf my right hand was still free to go for a gun or a knife wed hurt them once if they didnt behave themselves we could finish the job or at least go down trying jeanclaude led us among the naked trees with the ghosts crawling over the bare branches like phantom snakes he stopped a few feet away from the vampire i almost expected him to bow but he didnt greetings serephina greetings jeanclaude she was dressed in a simple white dress that fell in folds of shining cloth over her feet white gloves covered her arms almost completely her hair was grey with streaks of white left unadorned save for a headband of silver and pearls it wasnt a headband probably called a coronet or something her face was lined with age delicate makeup had been added but not enough to hide the fact that she was old vampires didnt age that was the whole point wasnt it shall we go inside she asked if you like he said she gave a faint smile you may escort me inside as you did of old but it is not olden days serephina we are both masters now i have many masters serving me jeanclaude i serve only myself he said she stared at him for a space of heartbeats then nodded you have made your point now be a gentleman jeanclaude took a deep enough breath that i heard it sigh from his lips he offered her his arm and she slid one gloved hand through it her hand resting on his wrist the ghosts floated downward behind her like a great flowing train they brushed past the rest of us with a skinprickling rush then floated upward hovering about ten feet off the ground you may walk with us serephina said they will not molest you comforting i said she smiled again it was hard to tell in the moonlight and ghostly glow but her eyes were pale maybe grey maybe blue you didnt need to see the color to not like the look in them i have looked forward to meeting you necromancer wish i could say the same the smile didnt widen and didnt fade it didnt move at all it was like her face was a wellconstructed mask i raised my glance to her eyes for just a moment they didnt try to suck me under but there was an energy in them a deep burning that pushed at the surface of her being like a banked fire move a log just wrong and the flames would come licking out and burn us all up i couldnt judge her age she was stopping me id never met anyone that could actually stop metrick me into believing them younger yes but not just glare at me and keep me from doing it she turned and walked through the door jeanclaude helped her up the steps as if she needed it the easy distance of the blood loss was receding leaving me real and alive and wanting to stay that way maybe it was jasons hand warm in my own the sweat on his palm the reality of him i was suddenly scared and she hadnt done a damn thing to me the ghosts flowed into the house some pouring through the door some sliding through the walls watching them pull free of the wood you almost expected a sound like a plop but it was utterly quiet the undead make no noise the ghosts bounced along the ceiling like heliumfilled balloons poured down the walls in back of the throne like milky water they were translucent near the candle flames like bubbles serephina sat down in the corner on her throne magnus curled in the cushions at her feet there was a flash of anger in his eyes there and gone he wasnt enjoying being serephinas boy toy that got him an extra point in my book come sit by me jeanclaude serephina said she motioned to the cushions on the opposite side from magnus theyd have made an interesting pair no jeanclaude said that one word was warning enough i drew my hand slowly from jasons if we really were going to fight id need both hands serephina laughed and with that sound her power broke open and crashed on us poor humans the power rode down on me like pounding horses my whole body vibrated with it my mouth was too dry to swallow and i couldnt quite get a full breath of air she didnt have to touch me to hurt me she could just sit on her throne and throw power at me she could grind my bones into dust from a nice safe distance something touched my arm i jerked and turned and it felt like slow motion it has hard to focus on jeanclaudes face but once i did the grinding power receded like the ocean pulling back from the shore i took a deep shuddering breath then another every breath was firmer illusion i whispered fucking illusion yes ma petite he turned from me and went to larry and jason who were still standing spellbound i looked back at the throne the ghosts had formed a glowing nimbus around her most impressive but not nearly as impressive as her eyes i had one wild glimpse of eyes that seemed to go on forever then i stared at the hem of her white dress as hard as i could can you not meet my gaze i shook my head no can you really be that powerful a necromancer when you cannot even meet my eyes i wasnt just not meeting her eyes i was hunched over i straightened but didnt move my eyes youre only about six hundred years old i raised my eyes slowly inch by inch up the white dress until i could see her chin how the hell did you get to be this powerful in that amount of time such bravado meet my eyes and i will answer you i shook my head i dont want to know that badly she chuckled and the sound was low and dark it slid down my spine like something loathsome and halfalive ah janos ivy so good of you to join us janos glided through the door with ivy at his side janos looked more human than he had since id first met him his skin was pale but fleshy his face was still thin and he couldnt have passed for completely human but he looked less monstrous he also looked healed shit is something wrong necromancer serephina asked i hate to waste that many bullets she gave that low chuckle again it made my skin feel tight janos is very talented he walked past us i could see bullet holes in his shirt at least id ruined his wardrobe ivy looked dandy had she run when the shooting started had she left bruce to die janos went down on one knee among the cushions ivy knelt with him they stayed there head bent waiting for her to notice them kissa moved to stand beside magnus bleeding her arm held close to her side but she glanced from the two kneeling vampires to serephina and back again she looked worried something was up something unpleasant she left them kneeling and said what business brings you to me jeanclaude i believe you have something that belongs to me he said janos she said janos rose to his feet and went back out the door he was out of sight only a moment then came back carrying a large cloth sack like something santa claus would have carried he untied the cord that held it shut and emptied the contents on the floor at jeanclaudes feet splinters of wood none of them big enough to make a decent stake fell into a mediumsized pile the wood was dark and polished where it wasnt white with new cuts with my compliments janos said he shook the last bits of wood out of the sack and knelt back on the steps jeanclaude stared down at the splintered wood this is childish serephina something i would have expected from you centuries ago now he motioned at the ghosts at everything how have you managed to subdue janos you feared him once state your business jeanclaude before i grow impatient and challenge you myself he smiled and gave a graceful bow arms out to his sides like an actor when he raised up the smile was gone his face was like a beautiful mask xavier is in your territory he said did you truly think i would feel the presence of your pet necromancer and not sense xavier i know he is here if he challenges me i will deal with him speak the rest of your business or was that it did you come all this way to warn me how touching i realize you are more powerful than xavier now jeanclaude said but he is slaughtering humans not just the attack on the missing boys home but many deaths he has gone back to cutting up his pets he draws attention to us all then let the council kill him you are master in this territory serephina it is your task to police it do not presume to tell me my duties i was centuries old when you died you were nothing but a catamite for any vampire that wanted you our beautiful jeanclaude she made beautiful sound like a bad thing i know what i was serephina now i am master of the city and follow the councils laws we are not to allow humans to be slaughtered in our territories it is bad for business let xavier kill hundreds there are always more she said nice attitude i said she turned her attention to me and i wished i hadnt said anything her power pulsed against me like a great beating heart how dare you disapprove of me serephina said i heard the rustle of her silk dress as she stood no one else moved and i heard her dress slither across the cushions sliding along the floor as she came closer i did not want her to touch me i stared up the line of her body and saw her gloved hand strike outward i gasped blood dripped down my hand shit it was a deeper cut than janos had managed and it hurt more i met her eyes anger making me brave or stupid her eyes were pure white like captive moons shining from her face those eyes called to me i wanted to fling myself into her pale arms to feel the touch of those soft lips the sharp sweet caress of her teeth i wanted to feel her body cradling mine i wanted her to hold me like my mother once had she would take care of me forever and never leave never die never desert me that stopped me i stood very still i was standing at the edge of the pillows the hem of her dress spilled at my feet i could have reached out a hand and touched her fear pounded my heart in my head i could taste my pulse on my tongue she spread her arms wide come to me child and i will always be with you i will hold you forever her voice was everything good warmth food shelter from all the things that hurt all the disappointment i knew in that moment that all i had to do was step into her arms and all the bad things would go away i stood there with my hands balled into fists my skin ached to have her touch me hold me blood still dripped down my hand from where shed cut me i rubbed my fingers into the cut making the pain sharp i shook my head come to me child i will be your mother forever i found my voice it sounded rusty choked but it came everything dies bitch you arent immortal none of you are i felt her power waver like a pebble thrown in a pool and i moved back a step then another it took everything i had left not to run from that room and to keep running to run and run and run away from her i didnt run in fact i stayed about two steps back looking around people had been busy janos stood next to jeanclaude they werent trying their vampire wiles on each other but the threat was open and there kissa stood to one side blood pooling on the pillows at her feet there was a look on her face that i couldnt read it was almost amazement ivy was standing now staring at me smiling pleased that id nearly fallen into serephinas arms i wasnt pleased no one had ever come closer not even jeanclaude i was beyond scared my skin was cold i had broken her hold over me but it was temporary she might not be able to trick me with her mind but id felt her mind brush mine if she wanted me she could have me it wouldnt be pretty no illusions no tricks just brute fucking force and she could have me i would never run into her arms but she could crush my mind that she could do the knowledge was almost calming if there was nothing i could do to prevent it might as well not worry about it worry about the things you can control the rest will either work themselves out or theyll kill you either way no more worries you are quite right necromancer serephina said we are all mortal in this room vampires can live a long long time it makes us forget that we are mortal but immortality eludes even us it wasnt a question and i agreed with everything she said so i just looked at her janos told me you had an aura of power necromancer he said he used it against you as he would another vampire i did it just now when i slashed your hand i have never known a human that could be harmed so i dont know what you mean about an aura of power it is what allowed you to slip my magic no human could have withstood me and few vampires glad i could do something to impress you i never said i was impressed necromancer i shrugged fine maybe you dont give a damn about humans or keeping a low profile i dont know about your council or what theyll do to you for not helping us but i do know what ill do what are you babbling about human i am the vampire executioner for this state xavier and his crew took a young boy i want him back alive you help me get him back alive or i go to the courts and get a death warrant on you jeanclaude talk to her or i will kill her she has the weight of human law behind her serephina what is human law to us the council says that it rules us as it rules the humans refusing the human laws is the same as breaking with the council i dont believe you you can taste the truth of my words i could never lie to you not two hundred years ago not now his voice was very calm very sure when did this new law go into effect when the council saw the benefit of being mainstream they want the money the power the freedom to walk the streets in safety they dont want to hide anymore serephina you believe what you say that much is true she said she looked down at me and the weight of that gaze even with me looking away was like a giant hand mashing me down i stayed on my feet but it was an effort you should bow down to such power grovel before it worship it stop it serephina i said cheap mind tricks wont work and you know it the cold lump in my stomach wasnt so sure you fear me human i can taste it on the back of my tongue oh goody yeah you scare me you probably scare everybody in this room so what she drew herself up to every inch of her tall thin frame her voice was suddenly soft breathing down my skin like fur i will show you she gestured outward with one gloved hand i tensed waiting for another cut but it never came a scream cut the air and whirled me around blood ran down ivys face another cut appeared on her bare arm two more on her face long slicing wounds with every gesture that serephina made ivy shrieked serephina please she fell to her knees among the bright cushions one hand outstretched towards the master vampire serephina master please serephina walked around her one gliding movement at a time if you had held your temper they would all be ours now i knew their hearts their minds their deepest fears we would have broken them all they would have broken the truce and we could have feasted on them to our bloods content she was almost even with me i wanted to move back away from her but she might see it as a sign of weakness her dress brushed my leg and i didnt care i did not want her to touch me i moved back and she caught my wrist i hadnt even seen her move i stared at that silkgloved hand as if a snake had just coiled around my wrist hell id have rather had the snake come necromancer help me punish this bad vampire no thanks i said my voice sounded shaky it matched the fluttering in my gut she hadnt done anything to me yet except touch me but touch makes all powers stronger if she tried a mind trick now i was finished ivy would have taken great delight in your pain necromancer thats her problem not mine i was staring very hard at the silky cloth of serephinas dress i had a terrible urge to look upward to meet her eyes i didnt think it was her power just my own morbid compulsion its hard to be tough when youre staring at someones body and being led around by the hand like a child ivy lay on the floor halfpropped on her arms her lovely face was a mass of deep cuts bone gleamed in the candlelight from one cheek her right arm had a cut that showed muscle twitching and bloody ivy stared up at me and behind the pain was a hatred strong enough to light a match the anger rose from her in slapping waves serephina knelt beside her drawing me down with her i glanced back at jeanclaude janos had a white spiderhand on his chest larry mouthed the word gun i shook my head she hadnt hurt me yet not yet the hand jerked my arm hard enough to wrench my head around to face her we were eye to eye suddenly horribly what i saw in her eyes wasnt horrible her eyes which i would have sworn were some pale shade looked solid wood brown my mothers eyes i think she meant for it to be comforting or seductive it wasnt my skin went cool with fear stop it you dont want me to stop she said i tried to pull my arm out of her grasp i might as well have tried to move the sun to a different part of the sky all you can offer me is death my dead mother in your dead eyes i stared into those brown eyes that i never thought to see this side of heaven i yelled at my mothers eyes because i couldnt look away serephina wouldnt let me and i couldnt fight her on that not while she touched me youre a walking corpse and everything else is just lies i am not dead anita there was an echo of my mothers voice in her words she raised her other hand as if to caress my cheek i tried to close my eyes tried to look away i couldnt a strange paralysis was sliding over my body like the feeling you get just on the edge of sleep when your body weighs a thousand pounds and every movement is nearly impossible that hand came for me in slow motion and i knew if she touched me i would fall into her arms i would cling to her and cry i remembered my mothers face the last time id seen her the coffin had been dark wood covered in a blanket of pink roses i knew mommy was in there but they wouldnt let me see no one could see closed coffin they said closed coffin every adult in my life was having hysterics the room was full of screams sobbing my father collapsed to the floor he was useless to me i wanted my mother the latches on the coffin were silver i opened them and i heard a cry behind me i didnt have much time the lid was heavy but i shoved it upward and it moved i got a glimpse of white satin and shadows i raised my arms over my head with every ounce of strength and got a glimpse of something my aunt mattie grabbed me back the lid clanged shut and she snapped the lock back in place dragging me away i didnt struggle id seen enough it was like looking at one of those pictures that you know must look like something but your eyes cant make sense of it it took me years to make sense of it but what i saw wasnt my mother couldnt be my beautiful mother it had been a husk something left behind something to hide in a dark box and let rot i opened my eyes and serephina had pale grey eyes i pulled my wrist from her suddenly loose grasp and said pain helps i stood and stepped away from her and she didnt stop me which was good because i was shaking all over and it wasnt from the vampire memories have teeth too she stayed kneeling by ivy and said most impressive necromancer i will help you find this boy you seek her sudden cooperation was unnerving why because since i attained my full powers no one has ever slipped my illusions twice in one night no one living or dead she grabbed ivy by one bloody arm and pulled her into her lap to bleed on the white dress ivy gasped remember this young master vampire this mortal did what you could not she stood against me and won she tossed her suddenly away sending her sprawling across the floor you are not worthy of my sight get out serephina stood the fresh blood stood out in scarlet relief against her white dress and gloves you have impressed us now go all of you she turned and walked back to her throne she didnt sit down she stood with her back to us one hand on the chair arm perhaps it was my imagination but she seemed tired her ghosts flowed down to meet her in a swirling white mist there werent as many individual shapes as before as if the phantoms had lost some of their solidity go she said without turning around the back door was open but jeanclaude walked to the doorway that led out the front i wasnt going to argue i just wanted out i didnt give a damn which door we took we walked coolly calmly towards the door i wanted to run larry stood next to me and i could see the pulse in his throat jumping with the effort not to bolt jason reached the door a little ahead of us but he waited and turned and motioned us through like a doorman or a butler i caught a glimpse of his eyes too wide scared and knew what the gesture had cost him we went through he followed jeanclaude brought up the rear the doors slammed behind us and we walked out just like that but for the first time i knew that id been let go i hadnt fought my way out or bluffed my way out she could be impressed all she wanted but she had allowed us to go being allowed to leave was not the same thing as winning i would never go back into that house voluntarily i would never be near her willingly because id been impressive tonight but i couldnt keep it up even now i knew that she could have me this vampire had my ticket had a lie almost worth my immortal soul damn jason walked past me into the hotel room he headed straight for the bathroom im taking a shower it was pushy but he did smell like a decayed corpse wed driven back with all the windows rolled down most of the time if you stink you cant smell someone else i had some of the rotted stuff on me but i could still smell jason some smells are too unique to ever really go away wait larry said jason turned but not like he was happy use my shower he held up a hand before i could say anything its an hour until dawn if we want everybody tucked in before that it makes sense to use both bathrooms i thought wed all sleep in this room tonight i said why he asked jeanclaude stood by the love seat looking lovely and unhelpful jason just looked impatient safety in numbers i said larry shook his head alright but i can take the werewolf next door and let him shower or dont you trust me to even do that he was getting angry again i trust you larry you did good tonight i expected a smile i didnt get it he looked very serious i killed that vampire bruce i nodded i thought we were going to have to kill everything in the room so did i he sank into one of the chairs ive never killed anyone before it was a vampire its not the same thing as killing a person yeah right and how many corpses have you given cpr to lately i glanced at jeanclaude smiling at me i shrugged just one can you give us some privacy here i asked i will hear what you are saying no matter where i stand in this room jeanclaude said illusion is all just back off i said jeanclaude bowed his head slightly and took jason to one side of the room near the windows i knew hed hear everything but at least he wouldnt be standing over us you dont really believe hes dead do you larry asked you saw what happened to those two vampires i said they are just rotting corpses everything else is illusion you think he ever looks like that i looked at jeanclaudes back for a minute im afraid i do how can you date him after seeing that i shook my head i dont know corpse or not you tried to keep him alive he reacted to the look on my face alive undead whatever you want to call it you tried to preserve it you were scared he was really dead i just looked at him so so i killed another living being or undead being hell anita bruce was so newly dead he seemed human probably why one bullet to the chest finished him how am i supposed to feel about that killing him you mean yeah they are monsters larry some of them are prettier than others but they are monsters never doubt that you can honestly tell me that you think jeanclaude is a monster it was more statement than question i almost looked at the monster in question but i didnt id looked at him enough for one night yeah i do now ask her if she thinks shes a monster jeanclaude leaned on the back of the love seat his arms crossed over his chest larry looked a little startled but he said anita i shrugged sometimes jeanclaude smiled see lawrence anita thinks were all monsters larrys not i said give him time that was a little too close to the truth i asked for privacy or did you forget i forget nothing ma petite but time grows short my wolf is not the only one that needs a bath only our young friend is still fresh i looked at larry there wasnt a drop of blood on him he was the only one who hadnt wrestled with vampires tonight he shrugged sorry i just couldnt get anybody to bleed on me tonight dont joke larry i said with serephina i think youll get another chance sadly true ma petite how long can you go without a coffin i asked he smiled concern over my wellbeing i am touched dont give me crap i opened a freaking vein for you tonight if i have not thanked you for saving my life tonight ma petite my apologies i looked at him he looked pleasant amused but it was a mask his expression when he didnt want you to know what he was thinking but didnt want you to know that he didnt want you to know dont mention it i will remember that you saved me ma petite you could have been free of me thank you it sounded sincere enough youre welcome i need to get this crud off me jason said he sounded just a touch frantic i was betting hed be trying to scrub off more than just dirt but memories dont wash that easily mores the pity go on both of you jason can scrub up in larrys room its only practical larry grinned at me thanks i meant it when i said you did good tonight i finally got the smile id expected come on jason hot water and fresh towels await larry held the door for jason and gave me a little salute geez alone again with jeanclaude would this night never end you never answered my question about the coffin i said i will be alright for another night or two how did serephina go from being your equal in power to being what we saw tonight he shook his head i truly do not know ma petite she surprised me badly she did not have to let us go tonight as long as she did not harm us we could have been her guests for the day are you surprised she let us go i asked yes he said jeanclaude pushed away from the love seat take your shower ma petite i will await the young mens return i thought you could go next wash the blood out of your hair he put a hand up to the back of his hair he grimaced at the feel of it distasteful but i want a bath ma petite it takes longer than a shower so you go first i looked at him for a long moment if you do not hurry i will not have time for a bath before dawn i would hate to sleep on your clean sheets covered in blood i took a deep breath and let it out slowly fine just be sure you stay out of the bathroom my word of honor that i will not barge in on you yeah right though strangely enough i believed him jeanclaude had been trying to seduce me for a long time a frontal assault just wasnt his style i went to take my shower ronnie had dragged me into victorias secret i had pointed out that no one would see my underwear or my nightclothes except other women in the gym locker room ronnie had replied youll see them the logic escaped me but she had talked me into a robe it was burgundy the color of winedark peonies it glowed against my pale skin and matched some of the bruises blossoming on my back nothing like getting thrown into a wall to give you a little color the bite mark on my back wasnt very deep hard for humanoid fangs to sink in from that angle the fang marks on my wrist were deeper they were two neat little holes almost dainty it didnt hurt as much as it should have maybe vampires did have painkillers in their saliva or maybe it was the fangs i still couldnt believe that id let him sink fangs into me shit i pulled the robe closer around me the material was heavy enough to be cozy on a winter evening and had wide silky cuffs and more silk lining the edges it looked vaguely victorian a little masculine i looked delicate in it like a victorian doll that hadnt gotten completely dressed yet i put on an oversized black tshirt under the robe it ruined some of the effect but it beat the heck out of wearing nothing but a robe and underwear out to greet the boys i retrieved the browning from the back of the stool where it had sat during my shower i carried it with me to the bedroom and hesitated i always went armed hell i slept with a gun but i didnt feel like slipping on a holster i put the browning away and settled for slipping the firestar into the robe pocket made the cloth hang funny but if something nasty came through the door i was ready for it jeanclaude was standing at the window when i opened the bedroom door he had opened the drapes and was leaning against the windows edge staring out into the darkness he turned when the door opened though i knew hed heard me before that ma petite you look lovely its the only robe i own i said of course he said his face had that amused mask on it again this time i would have liked to know what he was thinking his midnight blue eyes were very intense they didnt match the nonchalant expression maybe i didnt want to know what he was thinking where are larry and jason they have come and gone he said gone jason had a sudden craving and larry drove him in the jeep i just looked at him there is such a thing as room service it is the wee hours of the morning ma petite the room service menu is somewhat limited jason has donated blood twice to me tonight he needed protein jeanclaude smiled it was either takeout or he could eat larry i thought youd prefer takeout very funny you shouldnt have sent them alone we are safe from serephina tonight ma petite and as long as they stay in town safe from xavier how can you be so sure i crossed my arms over my stomach he leaned his back against the window and looked at me your monsieur kirkland handled himself well tonight i think you worry unnecessarily about him one night of heroics doesnt keep you safe i said it will be dawn soon ma petite even xavier cannot bear the light of day all the vampires will be seeking shelter they will have no time to chase our young men i stared at him trying to read past his pleasant face i wish i was as sure as you seem to be he smiled then and pushed away from the wall he slid out of his jacket and let it fall to the rosecolored carpet what are you doing undressing i jerked a thumb at the bedroom undress in there he began unbuttoning his shirt in the other room right now i said he pulled the white shirt out of his pants working the last few buttons as he walked towards me the flesh of his chest and stomach had more color than the shirt he was pumped up and humanlooking on blood part of it mine the dried bloodstains that had soaked through the shirt marred the pale perfection of his body i expected him to try to kiss me or something but he walked past me the back of the shirt was brownish with dried blood he peeled it off his skin with a sound like tearing he dropped the shirt on the carpet and walked into the bedroom i stood there staring after him there had been white scars on his back at least i thought thats what they were hard to tell through all the blood he left the bedroom door open and in a few minutes i heard water running in the bathtub i sat down in one of the straightback chairs i wasnt sure what else i was supposed to do water ran for a long time then silence then sloshing water he was in the tub he hadnt closed the bathroom door first great ma petite he called i sat there for a minute unwilling to move ma petite i know you are there i can hear you breathing i walked to the edge of the bedroom door very careful not to look inside i leaned my back against the wall and crossed my arms what do you want there seem to be no clean towels what am i supposed to do about it could you call down to housekeeping and have some sent up i guess so thank you ma petite i stomped over to the phone pissed hed known there were no clean towels before he got into the tub hell id known there were no clean towels but id been so busy listening to him splash around in the water i hadnt thought of it i was as mad at me as i was at him he was always a tormenting son of a bitch i was supposed to watch myself around him better than this i was in a hotel room that looked like a freaking bridal suite with jeanclaude all naked and soapy in the next room after what id seen with jason there shouldnt have been this much sexual tension in the air but there was maybe it was habit or maybe larry was right i just didnt believe that jeanclaude was a rotting corpse i called for more towels they would be happy to bring some up no one bitched about the time no one questioned you can always tell how much youre paying for a room by how little they complain a maid brought me four big soft towels i looked at her for a full minute hesitating i could have her take the towels into jeanclaude she said maam i took the towels said thanks and closed the door i just couldnt let a strange woman see that i had a naked vampire in my tub i wasnt even sure the vampire part was what made it embarrassing good girls do not end up with naked male anything in their bathtubs at four something in the morning maybe i wasnt a good girl maybe i never had been i hesitated at the bedroom door the room was dark the only light came from the bathroom spilling in an oblong across the carpet i crushed the towels to my chest took a deep breath and stepped into the room i could see the bathtub from here but mercifully not all of it i had a glimpse of white porcelain and a mound of white bubbles just seeing the bubble bath made the muscles in my shoulders relax a little bubbles can hide a multitude of sins i stopped at the bathroom door jeanclaude lay back against the edge of the tub his black hair was wet and had obviously been cleaned strands of it clung to his bare shoulders his arms lay propped on the edge of the bathtub his head resting against the dark tile of the wall one pale hand was suspended in midair as if reaching for something but the hand was utterly limp his eyes were closed making black halfmoons against his pale cheeks beads of water clung to his face and what i could see of his body he looked almost asleep his knee came up through the mound of bubbles a surprising glimpse of bare wet skin he turned his head and opened his eyes the midnight blue of his eyes seemed darker maybe it was the way the water made his hair seem heavier blacker i took a shallow breath and said here are the towels could you place them here please he gestured with that one halfsuspended hand here was the closed top of the toilet which was close enough to the tub for grabbing ill put them on the edge of the sink ill drip water all over the floor getting them from there he said his voice was neutral no vampiric tricks almost no tone at all he was right and i was being silly he wouldnt grab me and ravish me if thatd been the plan he could have done that years ago i placed the towels on the stool eyes studiously anywhere but the tub you must have questions about tonight he said i glanced at him the water on his naked torso caught the light like quicksilver suds clung to his chest just under one nipple i had a horrible urge to brush off the bubbles i stepped back until i was standing by the far wall its not like you to offer answers i said i am feeling generous tonight his voice had that quality that voices get when they are edging towards sleep if you werent naked in a tub of bubble bath would you be offering to answer questions he smiled then a quick familiar expression perhaps not but if i must answer your ravenous curiosity isnt it more fun this way fun for whom both of us if you would only admit it that got a smile from me and i didnt want to smile i didnt want to be enjoying watching him all soapy and wet i wanted to be afraid of him and i was but i also wanted him wanted to run my hands down his wet flesh wanted to touch what lay under those bubbles i didnt want intercourse i couldnt imagine that with him but i wanted to do a little exploring i hated that he was a corpse surely what id seen tonight convinced me of that youre frowning ma petite why i asked you if the two rotting vampires were illusion you said no i asked if your form was real you said yes both forms are real you said that is true he said are you a rotting corpse he settled lower in the warm soapy water drawing his arms into it until only his head showed above the surface of the water that is not one of my forms that isnt an answer he raised a pale hand from the water a handful of bubbles cupped like a snowball there are different vampiric abilities ma petite you know that whats that have to do with it he raised his other hand and began to play with the bubbles trailing them from hand to hand janos and his two female companions are a different type of vampire than i am than most of us are they are much rarer if you ever see me as a rotted corpse i will be well and truly dead they can rot and reform and it makes them much harder to kill the only true surety is fire volunteering an awful lot of information arent you he lowered his hands in the water washing the soap away he sat up a little straighter suds clung to his body perhaps i am afraid you will think that what happened with jason would happen with us we will never test that theory i said you sound so sure of that he said your lust perfumes the air and yet you truly believe that we will never make love how can you want me almost as much as i want you yet be sure we will never know each others bodies i wasnt sure i had an answer for that one i slid down the wall and sat with my knees drawn up to my chest the pocket with the gun in it clunked against the wall i moved the gun to a better position and said we just wont jeanclaude not ever i just cant a part of me regretted that but only part why ma petite sex is about trust id have to trust someone implicitly to have sex with them i dont trust you he stared at me with his blue blue eyes looking all scrumptious and wet you mean that dont you i nodded yeah i do i do not understand you ma petite i try but still i do not youre pretty much a riddle to me too if thats any comfort it isnt if you were a woman who had casual lusts we would have been in bed long ago he sighed and sat up even straighter in the water so it hit him just above the waist of course if you were a woman of casual appetites i dont think i would love you you enjoy the chase the challenge i said true but it is more than that with you if only you would believe me he leaned forward drawing his knees to his naked chest rounding his shoulders to hug himself white scars dribbled down his back from his shoulders to vanish into the water not a lot of them but enough what made the scars on your back unless it was a holy item you should have been able to heal them he laid his cheek on his knees so he could look at me he looked younger more human vulnerable suddenly not if the injury occurred before i died who whipped you i was the whipping boy for an aristocrats son i stared at him youre telling me the truth arent you yes is that why janos chose whips tonight to remind you where you came from yes you werent born into the aristocracy i was born in a house with a dirt floor ma petite i looked at him yeah right he raised his head if i was going to make something up ma petite it would be more romantic more entertaining than being a french peasant so you were a servant in the castle i was their only sons constant companion when he had clothes made so did i his tutor was my tutor his riding instructor mine i learned swordplay and dancing and the proper way to eat at table and when he was bad i was punished because he was their only child their only heir to an old family name people speak of child abuse now he leaned back in the tub cuddling down into the warm water they complain of spanking they have no idea what true abuse is when i was a boy parents thought nothing of taking a horse whip to a misbehaving child or beating them bloody even the aristocrats beat their children it was normal but he was the only heir the only child so they paid money to my parents and took me the lady of the manor chose me because i was fair of face when the vampire who made me sought me out she said my beauty called to her wait a minute he turned his head to give me the full weight of those dark blue eyes i worked hard at not looking away this gorgeous body and face is all vampire illusion right i mean no ones this beautiful i told you once that it was not my power that made you see me as you do not most of the time at any rate serephina said you were a catamite for any vampire that would have you what did she mean vampires kill for food but they bring others over for many reasons some for money wealth even title love but i was brought over for lust when i was young and weak they passed me around among them one would grow tired of me but there was always another i stared at him horrified youre right if you were going to make up a story this wouldnt be it the truth is so often disappointing or ugly dont you find that ma petite i nodded yeah serephina was old i thought vampires werent supposed to age whatever age we die at is the age we remain did you know serephina when you were young yes did you sleep with her yes how could you let her touch you i was given to her as a gift by a master that makes even her new and improved powers seem weak i had very little choice he stared at me she knows what you want your greatest need your most treasured wish and shell make it come true or seem to what did she offer you ma petite what could she offer you that nearly won you tonight i looked away then i didnt want to meet his eyes what did she offer you all those years ago power i looked up at that power he nodded power to escape them all but you had to have the ability to be a master vampire inside you from the beginning no one can give that to you i said he smiled but it wasnt a happy smile i know that now but then i thought only she could save me from an eternity of his words trailed off and he submerged leaving only a few black locks floating on the top of the water he sat up with a loud breath of air blinking the water from his eyes the water had clumped his thick dark eyelashes he ran his hands through his wet hair and it trailed over his shoulders your hair wasnt this long when we first met you seem to prefer longer hair on your men if youre dead how can your hair grow that is a question for you to answer he said he ran his hands through his hair again squeezing the ends out he reached out a hand for a towel i scrambled to my feet ill leave you to get dressed have jason and larry returned he asked no then i wont be getting dressed he stood drawing the towel towards him i had a glimpse of one side of his pale naked body water streaming from it the towel moved into view just in time i fled i huddled in the straightback chair farthest from the bedroom but i was staring at the doorway shit i wanted to run from the room but why it wasnt jeanclaude i didnt trust it was me fuck i touched the gun in my robe pocket it was smooth and hard and reassuring but it wouldnt help me now violence i understood sex gave me more problems i honestly didnt want to sleep with him but part of me was hoping for another glimpse of naked flesh a long line of naked thigh perhaps or maybe i put the palms of my hands over my eyes as if i could get the image out of my head by just pressing ma petite his voice sounded closer than the bathroom i didnt want to look as if just as grandma blake had said id be struck blind i felt him standing in front of me felt the movement of air i lowered my hands a millimeter at a time he was kneeling in front of me one of the thick white towels wrapped around his waist i lowered my hands to my lap beads of water still clung to his skin hed combed his hair but it was wet slicked back leaving his face plainer more unadorned than normal his eyes seemed bluer without his hair to frame them he put a hand on each chair arm and raised himself up his lips brushed mine in a soft nearly chaste kiss he moved back from me letting go of the chair i could taste my heart in my throat and it wasnt fear jeanclaude touched my hands lifted them up he placed my hands on his bare shoulders the skin was warm smooth wet he held my wrists in his hands lightly very lightly i could have pulled away at any time he ran my hands down his slick body i pulled my hands free he said nothing did nothing he stayed kneeling looking at me waiting i could see the pulse in his neck jumping against the skin and i wanted to touch it i slid my hands across his shoulders and lowered my face to his he started to move into me for a kiss but i slid my hand along his jaw and turned his head away i touched lips to his neck and slid my mouth down his skin until i could taste his pulse beating against my tongue he tasted of perfumed soap water and clean skin i slid from the chair to the floor kneeling in front of him he was taller now but not too tall i licked water off his chest and let myself do something id wanted to do for months i ran my tongue over his nipple and he shuddered against me i licked water off the center of his chest and ran my hands along his waist up the damp curve of his back he pulled the sash of my robe and i didnt protest i let his hands slide under the robe around my waist with nothing but the tshirt between his flesh and mine he ran his hands up my sides his thumbs playing over my rib cage the gun swung heavily in the loose cloth it was annoying i raised my face to his his arms slid behind my back pressing me against the long wet line of his body the towel was perilously loose his lips brushed mine then the kiss became something more harder nearly bruising with his arms locked behind my shoulders my hands slid down his waist rubbed the sliding top of the towel and found it had already slipped my hand touched the smooth top of his buttocks only the pressure of our bodies kept the towel in place he ate at my mouth and i felt something sharp painful i jerked back and tasted blood jeanclaude let me go he sat back on his heels the towel gathered in his lap i am sorry ma petite i got carried away i touched my mouth and came away with a spot of blood you nicked me he nodded i am truly sorry ill just bet you are i said do not go all selfrighteous on me ma petite you have finally admitted to yourself to me that you feel the pull of my body i sat on the floor by the chair with my robe in disarray the tshirt had ridden up to my waist i guess it was a little too late to protest my innocence fine lust you happy almost he said and now there was something in his eyes something dark and drowning and older than it should have been i can offer you my mortal body and more ma petite it can be between us much more than any human lover could offer would i lose a little blood each time that was an accident he said i stared at him all pale and damp kneeling on the floor with the white towel bundled into his lap leaving nearly every inch of him bare this is the first time ive cheated on richard i said you have been dating me for weeks he said i shook my head but i havent been cheating this is cheating then have you been cheating on me with richard i didnt know what to say to that go get dressed do you really want me to dress he asked i looked away i was embarrassed now and uncomfortable yes please he stood up the towel gripped in his hands i looked down at the floor and didnt have to see his face to picture the smile on it he walked away from me and didnt bother moving the towel around behind him muscles moved under his skin from calf to waist he walked naked into the bedroom and i enjoyed the view i touched my finger to my tongue it was still bleeding thats what i got for french kissing a vampire even thinking about it made me nervous ma petite he called from the other room yeah do you have a blow dryer in my suitcase help yourself thankfully id dragged my suitcase into the bedroom beside the bathroom door one point for laziness i was spared another glimpse of his naked body now that hormones were receding i was embarrassed i heard the dryer and wondered if he was standing naked in front of the bathroom mirror while he dried his hair i was very aware that all i had to do was go to the doorway and i could see for myself i stood up pulled my tshirt down tied my robe securely in place and sat down on the couch my back was to the bedroom i wouldnt be seeing anything else i took the firestar out of my pocket and laid it on the coffee table in front of me the gun sat there looking very solid very black and somehow accusatory the dryer stopped and he called to me again ma petite what come talk to me as the sun rises i glanced up at the window he had opened the sky outside was less black not light yet but not pure darkness anymore i closed the drapes and went to the bedroom i left the gun on the table the browning was in the bedroom anyway jeanclaude had neatly folded the bedspread and blanket at the foot of the bed only the winedark sheet covered him he lay with his black hair soft and curling over the dark pillows the sheet was bunched at his waist you can join me if you like i leaned against the wall and shook my head im not offering sex ma petite dawn is too close for that i offer you your half of the bed ill take the couch thanks anyway he smiled a slow knowing curve of lipshis old arrogance peeking back out it was almost comforting to know nothing had really changed it is not me that you do not trust it is you i shrugged he raised the sheet in front of his chest an almost protective gesture it comes fear in his voice what comes the sun i glanced at the closed drapes against the far wall they were double thick but a line of greyish light edged them youll be alright like this without your coffin as long as no one opens the drapes he looked at me for a long moment i love you ma petite as much as im able i didnt know what to say saying i lusted after him didnt seem appropriate saying i loved him would be a lie the light grew stronger a white edge around the curtains his body slumped back against the bed he rolled onto his side one hand outstretched the other curling the sheets against his chest he stared at the growing light and i could taste his fear i knelt beside the bed i almost took his hand but didnt what happens now you want the truth then watch i expected his eyes to flutter his voice to grow sluggish as if he were falling asleep it didnt happen that way he closed his eyes all at once pain flashed across his face he whispered it hurts his face went slack id seen people die watched the light fade from their bodies felt their souls slip away that was what i saw he died the light grew against the drapes and when it was a solid white line he died his breath went out of him in a long rattle i knelt beside the bed and stared i knew dead when i saw it and this was it shit i put my arms on the bed and propped my chin on them i watched him waiting for him to breathe to twitch something but there was nothing i reached out to his one outstretched arm my fingers hovered above his skin then i touched him the skin was still warm still human but he did not move i checked his wrist and there was no pulse no blood moved in this body did he know i was here did he feel me touching him i stared at him for what seemed like a long time so this answered the question vampires were dead whatever animated them was like my own power some sort of necromancy but i knew death when i saw it it gave necrophilia a whole new slant had i only imagined that i felt the brush of his soul leave his body surely vampires had no soulsthat was part of the pointbut id felt something leave if not a soul what if a soul where did it go for the daylight hours who watched all the vampires souls while they lay dead there was a knock at the door probably the other boys i stood up pulling my robe in tight i was cold and wasnt sure why i went to answer the door the cut on my tongue had almost stopped bleeding i dreamed in the dream someone held me in their lap smooth dark arms wrapped around me i looked up into my mothers laughing face she was the most beautiful woman in the world i snuggled against her body and the clean smell of her skin was there shed always smelled of hypnotique bath powder she bent and kissed me on the lips i had forgotten the taste of her lipstick the way she brushed my mouth with her thumb and laughed because shed gotten bright red lipstick on my small mouth her thumb came away with something brighter than lipstick blood dripped down her thumb shed pricked her skin with a safety pin it was bleeding she held her thumb out to me and said kiss it anita make it all better but there was too much blood it ran down her hand i stared up at her laughing face and blood ran down it like rain i woke sitting bolt upright on the velvet couch gasping for breath i could still taste her lipstick on my mouth and the smell of hypnotique bath powder clung to me larry sat up on the love seat rubbing at his eyes whats wrong did we get our wakeup call no i had a bad dream he nodded stretching then frowned do you smell perfume i stared at him what do you mean perfume or powder or something do you smell it i swallowed and nearly choked on my own pulse yeah i smell it i flung back the extra blanket and threw the lumpy pillow across the room larry swung his legs off the love seat what is wrong with you i went to the window and flung the drapes open the bedroom door was closed and jeanclaude was safely inside jason was sleeping in there i stood in the sunlight and let the heat sink into me i leaned against the warm glass and only then realized that i was wearing nothing but an oversized tshirt and my undies oh well i stayed in the sunlight for a few minutes waiting for my pulse to calm down serephina sent me a dream the smell is my mothers perfume larry came to stand beside me he was wearing a pair of gym shorts and a green tshirt his curly red hair stuck up in all directions his blue eyes squinted when he stepped into the light i thought only a vampire that had a connection with you a hold on you could invade your dreams thats what i thought i said how could i smell perfume from your dream i shook my head forehead against the glass i dont know has she marked you i dont know he touched my shoulder squeezing itll be alright i stepped away from him to pace the room it wont be alright larry serephina invaded my dreams no one but jeanclaude has ever done that i stopped because that wasnt true nikolaos had done it but that was after shed bitten me i shook my head either way it was a very bad sign what are you going to do kill her murder her you mean if larrys earnest eyes hadnt been staring at me id have said you bet but its hard to contemplate murder with someone staring at you like youve kicked their favorite puppy ill try to get a warrant i said if you cant if its her or me larry then its her okay larry looked at me sadly what i did last night was murder i know that but i didnt go in planning to kill someone you stay in this business long enough and you will he shook his head i dont believe that believe what you want but its still the truth these things are too dangerous to play fair if you really believe that then how can you date jeanclaude how can you let him touch you i shook my head i never said i was consistent you cant defend yourself can you defend which one killing serephina or dating jeanclaude either both hell anita if youre one of the bad guys you cant be one of the good guys i opened my mouth and closed it what could i say i am one of the good guys larry but im not going to be a martyr if that means breaking the law so be it are you going to get a warrant his face was very neutral as he asked he looked older suddenly even with his orangey curls sticking up he looked solemn i was watching larry grow older before my eyes not in age but in experience the expression in his eyes was older than it had been a few months ago seen too much done too much he was still trying to be sir galahad but galahad had had god on his side all larry had was me it wasnt enough the only way i could get a death warrant is to lie i said i know he said i stared at him serephina hasnt broken any laws yet i wont lie about that he smiled good when do we meet dorcas bouvier three have you figured out what you can sacrifice to raise the zombies stirling wants done he asked nope he stared at me what are you going to tell stirling i shook my head i dont know yet i wish i knew why hes so hot and heavy to kill bouvier he wants the land larry said stirling and company have been saying the bouvier family not magnus bouvier that means hes not the only one suing them so killing magnus wont solve their problems so why do it larry asked exactly i said larry nodded we need to talk to magnus again preferably without serephina around i said amen to that larry said id love to talk to magnus but before we tackle mr bouvier again id like to find some fairie ointment some what didnt you take any classes on fairies it was an elective he said fairie ointment makes you proof against glamor just in case whatever else magnus is hiding is nastier than serephina nothings nastier than that he said true but just in case he wont be able to work magic on us in fact its not a bad precaution before we meet dorrie she may not be as scary as magnus but she shines and id just as soon she didnt shine all over us you think serephina will find jeff quinlan if anyone can she can she seemed pretty confident she could take xavier but then jeanclaude had been pretty confident he could take her last night he was wrong he frowned so were rooting for serephina it sounded wrong put that way but i nodded if its a choice between a vampire that obeys most of the laws and one that slaughters kids yeah were on her side you were talking about killing her just a little bit ago i can stay out of her way until she saves jeff and kills xavier why would she kill him larry asked hes killing people in her territory she can say anything she wants but thats a direct challenge to her authority besides i dont think xavier will give up jeff without a fight what do you think happened to him last night larry asked i shook my head it doesnt do any good to dwell on it larry were doing all we can we could tell the fbi about serephina one thing ive learned is that master vamps dont talk to the cops too many years of the cops killing them on sight or trying to okay he said but weve still got to come up with something big enough to kill for raising the cemetery tonight he said ill think on it you really have no idea what to do he sounded surprised short of a human sacrifice larry i dont think i can raise several threehundredyearold corpses even ive got my limits he grinned nice to hear you admit it i had to smile itll be our little secret he put his hand out and i slapped it he slapped mine back and i felt better larry had a way of making me smile friends will do that to you dorcas bouvier was leaning on a car in the parking lot her hair gleamed in the sunlight swirling as she moved like heavy water in jeans and a green tank top she was flawless larry tried not to stare at her but it was hard work larry was wearing a blue tshirt jeans white nikes and an oversized checked flannel shirt to hide his shoulder holster i was in jeans and a navy blue polo shirt black nikes and an oversized blue dress shirt id had to borrow it from larry after my black jacket had gotten covered in vampire goop had to have something to hide the browning makes people nervous if you go around with a naked gun larry and i looked like wed dressed from the same closet dorrie pushed away from the car shall we go wed like to talk to magnus so you can turn him in to the cops i shook my head so we can find out why stirling is so hot to kill him i dont know where he is dorcas said maybe it showed on my face because she said i dont know where he is but if i did i wouldnt tell you using magic on the police is a death penalty case i wont turn him in im not the police she looked at me eyes narrowing did you come to look at bloody bones or to question me about my brother how did you know to be waiting here for us i asked i knew youd be on time her pupils swirled downward to pinpoints like the eyes of an excited parrot lets go i said she led us to the back of the restaurant where it nearly touched the woods a path began at the edge of the clearing it was barely wide enough for a man even though we walked single file the branches whipped at my shoulders the new green leaves rubbed like velvet along my cheek the path was deep and rutted down to naked tree roots in places but weeds were beginning to encroach on the path as if it wasnt used as much as it once had been dorrie moved down the uneven path with an easy swinging stride she was obviously familiar with the path but it was more than that the tree limbs that caught on my shirt didnt get caught in her hair the roots that threatened to trip me didnt slow her down wed found ointment at a health food store so the bushes moving for her and not for us was real not illusion maybe glamor wasnt the only thing to worry about which was why the browning was loaded with nonsilver bullets id had to go out and buy some special for the occasion larry was loaded up too and for the first time i wished he had two guns i still had the firestar with silver ammo but larry was out of luck if a vamp jumped us of course it was broad daylight i was more worried about fairies than vamps right this minute there was salt in our shirt pockets not a lot but you didnt need much just enough to throw on the fey or the thing being magicked salt disrupted fey magic temporarily a breeze came up the path it grew into a wind in one fitful gust the air smelled clean and fresh you hoped the beginning of time smelled like that like fresh bread clean laundry childhood memories of spring it probably smelled like ozone and swamp water reality almost always smells worse than daydream dorrie stopped and turned back to us the trees across the path are just illusion theyre not solid what trees larry asked i cursed silently it would have been nice to keep the ointment a secret dorrie took two steps back towards us she stared at my face from inches away then made a face like shed seen something unclean youre wearing ointment she made it sound like a very bad thing magnus did try to bedazzle us twice nothing wrong with being cautious i said well our illusions wont matter to you then she took off at a faster pace leaving us to stumble after her the path led into a clearing that was nearly a perfect circle there was a small mound in the center with a white stone celtic cross in the middle of a mass of vibrant blue flowers every inch of ground was covered with bluebells english bluebells thick and fleshy bluer than the sky the flowers never grew in this country without help they never grew in missouri without more water than was practical but standing in the solid mass of blue surrounded by trees it seemed worth it dorrie stood frozen nearly kneedeep in the flowers she was staring openmouthed a look of horror on her lovely face magnus bouvier knelt in the flowers on top of the mound near the cross his mouth was bright with fresh blood something moved around him in front of him something more felt than seen if it was illusion the ointment should have taken care of it i tried looking at it out of the corner of my eye sometimes peripheral vision works better on magic than straighton sight from the corner of my eye i could see the air swimming in something that was almost a shape it was bigger than a man magnus turned and saw us he stood up abruptly and the swimming air blinked out like it had never been he wiped a sleeve across his mouth dorrie his voice was soft and strangled dorrie clawed her way up the hill she screamed blasphemy and smacked him i could hear the slap all the way across the clearing ouch larry said why is she mad she hit him again hard enough to sit him down on his butt in the flowers how could you how could you do such a vile thing what did he do larry asked hes been feeding off rawhead and bloody bones just like his ancestor i said dorrie turned to me she looked haggard horrified as if she had caught her brother molesting children it was forbidden to feed she turned back to magnus you knew that i wanted the power dorrie what harm did it do what harm what harm she grabbed a handful of his long hair and pulled him to his knees she exposed the bite marks on his neck this is why that creature can call you this is why one of the daoine sidhe even a halfbreed like you is called by death she let go so abruptly he fell forward on his hands and knees dorrie sat down in the flowers and cried i waded into the flowers they parted like water but they didnt move they were just never exactly where you were stepping jesus are they moving out of the way larry asked not exactly magnus said he walked down the mound to stand at its base he was wearing the white tuxedo from last night or what was left of it the smear of blood on his shirtsleeve was very bright against the whiteness we waded through the flowers that were moving and not moving to join him in front of the mound hed shoved his hair back behind his ears so his face was visible and no his ears werent pointed where do these rumors get started he met my eyes without flinching if he was ashamed of what hed done it didnt show dorrie was still weeping in the bluebells like her heart would break so now you know he said you cant bleed a fairie in the flesh or not in the flesh without ritual magic ive read the spell magnus its a doozy i said he smiled at that and the smile was still lovely but the blood at the corner of his mouth ruined the effect i had to tie myself to the beastie i had to give him some of my mortality in order to get his blood the spell isnt meant to help you gather blood i said its to help the fairies kill each other if it got some of your mortality did you get some of its immortality larry asked it was a good question yes magnus said but that wasnt why i did it you did it for power you son of a bitch dorrie said she came down the mound sliding in the strange flowers you just had to do real glamor real magic my god magnus you must have been drinking its blood for years ever since you were a teenager thats when your powers suddenly got so strong we all thought it was puberty afraid not sister dear she spit at him our family was cursed tied to this land forever in repentance for doing what you have done bloody bones broke free last time someone tried to drink from his veins its been safely imprisoned for ten years dorrie how do you know how do you know that nebulous thing you called up hasnt been out scaring children as long as it doesnt hurt any of them whats the harm wait a minute said larry why would it scare children i told you its a nursery boggle it was supposed to eat bad children i said i had an idea an awful idea id seen a vampire use a sword but was i absolutely sure of what id seen no when the thing got out and started slaughtering the indian tribe did it use a weapon or its hands dorrie looked at me i dont know does it matter larry said oh my god it might matter a great deal i said you cant mean those killings magnus said bloody bones cannot manifest itself physically ive seen to that are you sure brother dear are you absolutely sure dorries voice cut and sliced she wielded scorn like a weapon yes im sure well have to have a witch look at this i dont know enough about it i said dorrie nodded i understand the sooner the better rawhead and bloody bones did not do those killings magnus said for your sake magnus i hope not i said what do you mean because five people have died five people who didnt do a damn thing to deserve it its imprisoned by a combination of indian christian and fairie power he said its not breaking free of that i walked around the mound slowly the fleshy flowers still moved out of the way id tried watching my feet but it was dizzying because the flowers moved yet didnt like trying to watch one of them bloom you knew it did but you could never watch the actual event i ignored the flowers and concentrated on the mound i wasnt trying to sense the dead so daylight was fine there was magic here lots of it id never felt fairie magic before there was something here that had a familiar taste to it and it wasnt the christianity some kind of death magic went into this i said i walked around the mound until i could see magnuss face a little human sacrifice perhaps not exactly magnus said we would never condone human sacrifice dorrie said maybe she wouldnt but i wasnt so sure about magnus i didnt say it out loud dorrie was upset enough already if its not sacrifice then what is it three hills are buried with our dead each death is like a stake to hold old bloody bones down magnus said how did you lose track of which hills belonged to you i asked its been over three hundred years magnus said there were no deeds back then i wasnt a hundred percent sure the hill was the right hill myself but when they raked up the dead i felt it he huddled in on himself as if the air had suddenly grown colder you cant raise the dead from that hillside if you do it then bloody bones will be loosed the magic to stop it is complicated truthfully im not sure im up to it myself and i dont know any indian shamans anymore you have made a mockery of everything we stand for dorrie said what did serephina offer you i asked he looked at me surprised what are you talking about she offers everyone their hearts desire what was yours magnus freedom and power she said shed find another guardian for rawhead and bloody bones she said shed find a way for me to keep the power id borrowed from it without having to tend it and you believed her he shook his head im the only person in the family who has the power we are the guardians forever as penance for stealing it for letting it kill he collapsed to his knees in the blue blue flowers his head bowed hair spilling forward to hide his face ill never be free you dont deserve to be free dorrie said why did serephina want you so badly i asked shes afraid of death she says drinking from something as longlived as i am helps her keep death at bay shes a vampire larry protested but not immortal i said magnus looked up strange aquamarine eyes glimmering out through his shining hair maybe it was the hair or the eyes or his being nearly covered in the strange moving not moving flowers but he didnt look very human she fears death he said she fears you his voice was low and echoing she nearly cleaned my clock last night whys she afraid of me you brought death among us last night it cant be the first time i said she came to me for my long life my immortal blood perhaps she will go to you next perhaps instead of running from death she will embrace it the skin on my arms twitched marching in gooseflesh up to my elbows she tell you that last night there is a power involved hurting her old enemy jeanclaude but in the end anita she wonders if your power would make the difference if she drank you up would she be immortal would you be able to keep death from her with your necromancy you could leave town larry said i wasnt sure which of us he was speaking to i shook my head master vampires dont give up that easy ill tell stirling that i wont be raising his dead magnus no one else can do it but me so it wont get done but they wont give back the land magnus said in his strange voice if they simply blow up the mountain the result might be the same is that true dorrie she nodded it could be what do you want me to do i asked magnus crawled through the flowers peering at me through the shining curtain of his hair his eyes were swirling bands of green and blue whirling until i was dizzy i looked away raise a handful of the dead can you do that he asked no sweat i said but will everybodys lawyers agree to that ill see that they do he said dorrie i asked she nodded ill see to it i stared at magnus for a moment will serephina really rescue the boy yes he said i stared down at him then ill see you tonight no ill be well and truly drunk again its not foolproof but it helps drown her out fine ill raise you a handful of dead keep your land safe you have our gratitude magnus said he looked feral frightening beautiful crouched in the flowers his gratitude might be worth something if serephina didnt kill him first hell if she didnt kill me first i called special agent bradford late in the day they hadnt found xavier they hadnt found jeff they hadnt found any vampires that i needed to kill and why the hell was i calling him i was not on this case remember i remembered and yes the two youngest victims had been sexually assaulted but not the same day they were killed i probably should have brought magnus in but he was the only one who understood the spells on bloody bones he wouldnt be any good to us locked up dorrie knew a local witch she trusted id thought that maybe bloody bones was our killer id never seen a vampire hide itself so completely from me as the one that killed coltrain id added it to my list of suspects but hadnt told the cops now i was glad i hadnt the sexual assault had xavier written all over it besides explaining that a nursery boggle from scotland was committing murders on the ethereal plane sounded farfetched even to me the sky was thick with clouds that glowed like jewels they shimmered and stretched across the sky like a gigantic gleaming blanket that some great beast had shredded with massive claws through the holes in the clouds the sky peeked through black with a few diamondchip stars bright enough to compete with the gleaming sky i stood on the hilltop staring up at the sky breathing in the cool spring air larry stood beside me looking up his eyes reflected the glowing light get on with it stirling said i turned and looked at him him bayard and ms harrison beau had been with them but id made him wait at the bottom of the mountain id even told him if he so much as showed his face up top id put a bullet in it i wasnt sure stirling believed me but beau had not an appreciator of natures beauty are you raymond even by moonlight i could see his scowl i want this over with ms blake now tonight strangely enough i agreed with him it made me nervous i didnt like raymond it made me want to argue with him regardless of whether i agreed but i didnt argue point for me ill get it done tonight raymond dont sweat it please stop calling me by my first name ms blake he made the request through clenched teeth but he had said please fine itll be done tonight mr stirling okay he nodded thank you now get on with it i opened my mouth to say something smart but larry said very softly anita he was right as usual as much fun as it was to yank stirlings chain it was just delaying the inevitable i was tired of stirling of magnus and of everything it was time to do this job and go home well maybe not straight home i wouldnt leave without jeff quinlan one way or another the goat gave a high questioning bleat it was staked out in the middle of the boneyard it was a brownandwhitespotted goat with those strange yellow eyes they sometimes have it had floppy white ears and seemed to like having the top of its head scratched larry had petted it in the jeep on the drive over always a bad idea never get friendly with the sacrifices makes it hard to kill them i had not petted the goat i knew better this was larrys first goat hed learn hard or easy hed learn there were two more goats at the bottom of the hill one of them was even smaller and cuter than this one shouldnt we have the bouviers lawyers present mr stirling bayard said the bouviers waived having their attorney present i said why would they do that stirling asked they trust me not to lie to them i said stirling looked at me for a long moment i couldnt see his eyes clearly but i could feel the wheels inside his head moving youre going to lie for them arent you he said his voice was cold repressed too angry for heat i dont lie about the dead mr stirling sometimes about the living but never about the dead besides bouvier didnt offer me a bribe why should i help him if he doesnt throw money at me larry didnt call me on that one he was looking at stirling too wondering what hed say maybe youve made your point ms blake can we get on with it now he sounded reasonable ordinary suddenly all that anger all that mistrust had had to go somewhere but it wasnt in his voice fine i knelt and opened the gym bag at my feet it held my animating equipment i had another one that held vampire gear i used to just transfer whatever i wanted into the bag i bought a second bag after i showed up once at a zombie raising with the wrong bag it was also illegal to carry vampire slaying stuff if you didnt have a warrant of execution on you brewsters law might change that but until then i had two bags the zombie was my normal burgundy one the vampire bag was white even in the dark it was easy to tell them apart that was the plan larrys zombie bag was a nearly virulent green with teenage mutant ninja turtles on it i was almost afraid to ask what his vampire bag looked like let me test my understanding here larry said my words fed back to me he knelt and unzipped his bag go ahead i said i got out my jar of ointment i knew animators who had special containers for the ointment crockery handblown glass mystical symbols carved into the sides i used an old mason jar that had once held grandma blakes green beans larry fished out a peanut butter jar with the label still on it extracrunchy yumyum we have to raise a minimum of three zombies right right i said he stared around at the scattered bones a mass grave is hard to raise from right this isnt a mass grave its an old cemetery that was disturbed thats easier than a mass grave why he asked i laid the machete down beside the jar of ointment because each grave had rites performed that would tie the dead individual to the grave so that if you call it you have a better chance of getting an individual to answer answer rise from the dead he nodded he laid a wicked curved blade on the ground it looked like a freaking scimitar where did you get that he dipped his head and i would have bet he was blushing just couldnt see it by moonlight guy at college whered he get it larry looked at me surprise plain on his face i dont know is something wrong with it i shook my head just a little fancy for beheading chickens and slitting a few goats open it felt good in my hand he shrugged besides it looks cool he grinned at me i shook my head but i let it go did i really need a machete to behead a few chickens no but the occasional cow yeah why you may ask didnt we have a cow tonight no one would sell bayard one he had the brilliant idea of telling the farmers why he wanted the cow the godfearing folk would sell their cows to be eaten but not for raising zombies prejudiced bastards the youngest of the dead here are two hundred years old right larry asked right i said were going to raise a minimum of three of these corpses in good enough condition for them to answer questions thats the plan i said can we do that i smiled at him thats the plan his eyes widened damn you dont know if we can do it either do you his voice had dropped to an amazed whisper we raise three zombies a night every night routinely were just doing them back to back we dont raise twohundredyearold zombies routinely true but the theorys the same theory he shook his head i know were in trouble when you start talking about theories can we do this the honest answer was no but the thing that dictated more than anything else what you could raise and what you couldnt was confidence believing you could do it so i was tempted to lie but i didnt truth between larry and me i think we can do it but you dont know for sure he said no geez anita dont get rattled on me we can do this but you arent sure im not sure well survive the plane ride home but im still getting on the plane was that supposed to be comforting he asked yeah it wasnt he said sorry but this is as good as it gets you want certainty be an accountant im not good at math me either he took a deep breath and let it out slowly alright boss how do we combine powers i told him neat he didnt look nervous anymore he looked eager larry may have wanted to be a vampire executioner but he was an animator it wasnt a career choice it was a gift or a curse no one could teach you to raise the dead unless you had the power in your blood genetics is a wonderful thing brown eyes curly hair zombie raising whose ointment you want to use larry asked mine id given larry the recipe for the ointment and told him which ingredients you couldnt mess with like the graveyard mold but there was room for experimentation every animator had their own special recipe you never knew what larrys ointment would smell like for sharing powers you used the same ointment so we were using mine for all i knew we didnt have to use the same ointment but id only shared my powers three times twice with the man who trained me as an animator each time wed used the same ointment i had acted as a focus all three times which meant i was in charge where i liked to be right could i act as a focus larry asked not this time but later if this comes up again well try it i said truth was i didnt know if larry had the power to be a focus manny who taught me couldnt do it very few animators could act as a focus those who could were mistrusted by the rest and most wouldnt play with us we would literally share our powers a lot of animators wouldnt be willing to do that there is a theory that you could permanently steal anothers magic but i dont buy it raising the dead isnt like a magic charm that someone can take with them and leave you without animating is built into the cells of our bodies its part of us you cant steal that i opened the ointment and the spring air suddenly smelled like christmas trees i used a lot of rosemary the ointment was thick and waxy and always felt cool flecks of glowing graveyard mold looked like groundup lightning bugs i smeared ointment across larrys forehead down his cheeks he untucked his tshirt and raised it so i could dab it over his heart which is harder than it sounds with a shoulder holster on but wed both worn a gun apiece i had left both knives and my backup gun in the jeep i touched his skin and could feel his heart pounding under my hand i handed larry the mason jar he dipped two fingers into the thick ointment he traced ointment over my face his hand was very steady face blank with concentration eyes utterly serious i unbuttoned the polo shirt and larry slipped his fingers inside to touch my heart his fingers rubbed the chain of my crucifix spilling it out of my shirt i slipped it back inside next to my skin he handed the jar back to me and i screwed the lid on tight wouldnt do to let it dry out id never heard of anyone doing exactly what we were about to attempt not the age part but the scattered bodies we only wanted three but there werent three intact bodies even doing them one at a time it was chancy how to raise just so much dead and no more when they were lying jumbled together i had no names to use no gravesite to encircle with power how to do it it was a puzzlement but for now we just had to close the circle one problem at a time make sure both of your hands have ointment on them i said larry rubbed his hands together like he was putting on lotion aye aye boss what next i drew a deep silver bowl out of my bag it gleamed in the moonlight like another piece of sky larrys eyes widened it doesnt have to be silver there are no mystical symbols on it you could use a tupperware bowl but the life of another living creature is going in here use something nice to show some respect but understand that it doesnt have to be silver or this shape or anything its just a container okay larry nodded why not have the other goats up here on top its going to be a trek to get them up here every time i shrugged first theyd panic second it seems cruel for them to watch their friends bite the dust knowing theyre next my zoology prof would say youre humanizing them let him i know they feel pain and fear thats enough larry looked at me for a long moment you dont like doing it either no you want to help hold or feed the carrot carrot i dug a carrot complete with leafy green top out of the bag was that what you got in the grocery store while i waited in the car with the goats yeah i held the carrot up in the air the goat strained to the end of its picket line towards the carrot i let the goat lip the leafy top it bleated and strained towards me i let him get a little more leaf his stubby little tail started wagging happy goat i handed larry the silver bowl put it on the ground under the throat when the blood starts coming catch as much as you can i had the machete behind my back in my right hand carrot in my left i felt like a childs dentist no nothing behind my back pay no attention to that huge needle except this needle was permanent the goat yanked most of the leaves off the carrot and i waited while it snaked them up into its mouth larry knelt beside it bowl on the ground i offered the meat of the carrot to the goat it got a taste of it and i drew the carrot out out until the goat strained its neck out as far as it could trying to get more of the hard orange flesh i laid the machete against the hairy throat not cutting gentle the neck vibrated against the blade straining for the carrot i drew the blade across the neck the machete was sharp and i had practice there was no sound only the shocked widened eyes and blood pouring from the neck larry picked up the bowl holding it under the wound blood splashed down his arms onto the blue tshirt the goat collapsed to its knees blood filled the bowl dark and glinting more black than red theres bits of carrot in the blood larry said its alright i said carrots inert the goats head fell slowly forward until it touched the ground the bowl sat under its throat filling with blood it had been nearly a perfect kill goats could be sort of pesky but sometimes like tonight it all worked of course we werent done i laid the bloody knife against my left arm and sliced it open the pain was sharp and immediate i held the wound over the bowl letting the thick drops mingle with the goats blood give me your right arm i said larry didnt argue he just held out his bare arm id told him what would happen but it was still a very trusting gesture his face turned up to me was without any trace of fear god i sliced his arm he winced but didnt draw back let it drip into the bowl he held his arm over the bowl all the blood was redblack in the moonlight the beginnings of power trickled over my skin my power larrys power the power of a ritual sacrifice larry looked up at me with wide eyes i knelt beside him and laid the machete across the mouth of the bowl i held out my left hand to him he gave me his right we clasped hands and pressed the wounds in our forearms together letting the blood mingle larry held one side of the bloodfilled bowl and i held the other blood trickled down our arms to drip off our elbows into the bowl onto the bloody naked steel we stood still clasped together still holding the bowl i withdrew my hand from his slowly then took the bowl from him he followed my every movement like he always did hed be able to close his eyes and mimic me i walked to the edge of the circle i had in my mind and plunged my hand into the bowl the blood was still amazingly warm almost hot i grasped the handle of the machete with my bloody hand and began using the blade to sprinkle blood as i walked i could feel larry standing in the center of the circle that i walked like there was a rope stretched between us as i walked that rope stretched tighter and tighter like a rubber band being twisted the power grew with each step each drop of blood the earth was hungry for it id never raised the dead on ground that had seen death rituals before magnus should have mentioned that maybe he hadnt known charitable of me it didnt matter now there was magic here for blood and death something that was eager for me to close the circle eager for me to raise the dead hungry i stood nearly where id begun i was a sprinkle of blood away from closing the circle the line of power between larry and me was so tight it hurt the potential power was frightening and exhilarating wed awakened something old and long dormant it made me hesitate made me not want to finish the circle stubbornness and fear i didnt completely understand what i was feeling it was someone elses magic someones spell wed triggered it but i didnt know what it would do we could raise our dead but it would be like walking a tightrope between the other spell and something i felt old bloody bones in its barrow miles away i felt it watching me urging me to take that last step i shook my head as if the fey creature could see me i just didnt understand the spell well enough to risk it whats wrong larry asked his voice sounded strangled we were choking on unused power and damned if i knew what to do with it i caught movement out of the corner of my eye ivy stood at the edge of the mountain she was wearing hiking boots with thick white socks folded over them baggy black shorts and a skintight neon pink top with a checked flannel shirt over it the chain of her dangling earring gleamed in the moonlight shed dressed herself tonight all i had to do was drop that last bit of blood and the circle would close and i could hold this circle against her against them all nothing would cross it that i didnt want to cross it well within reason demons and angels could probably cross it but vampires couldnt i felt a surge of triumph from the thing trapped in its mound it wanted me to close the circle i tossed the bowl and machete behind me towards the center of the circle away from the outer edge so no blood would fall on it ivy started towards me in a fasterthanlight display a blur of speed i went for my gun felt it slide from the holster and she smashed into me the impact knocked the browning out of my hand i hit the ground with nothing in my hands but air ivy reared backwards fangs flashing larry screamed anita i heard the gun go off felt the bullet hit her body it hit her in the shoulder twisted her body but she turned back to me with a smile she dug fingers into my shoulders and rolled us over putting me on top with one of her hands leeched to the back of my neck she squeezed until i gasped ill snap her spine unless you throw that toy away she said shell kill me anyway dont do it anita now or ill kill her while you watch shoot her but there wasnt a clear shot hed have to walk around me and fire pointblank ivy could kill me twice over before he got to us ivy forced my neck lower i braced my right arm on the ground shed have to break something to get me down to her if she broke my neck itd be over a broken arm would just hurt i heard something hit the ground a dull heavy thump larrys gun damn she pressed harder on the back of my neck i dug the palm of my hand into the ground hard enough to leave an imprint i can break that arm and bring you to me your choice easy or hard hard i said between gritted teeth she grabbed for my arm and i had an idea i collapsed forward on top of her it caught her off guard i had a handful of seconds to pull the chain around my neck out of my shirt her hand slid through my hair like a lovers pressing my face against her cheek not hard almost gentle three nights from now youll like me anita youll worship me i doubt that the chain slid forward the crucifix pooled against her throat there was a blinding flash of white white light a rush of heat that singed my hair ivy screamed and clawed at the cross scrambling from underneath me i stayed on all fours with the cross dangling in front of me the bluewhite flames died away because it wasnt touching vampiric flesh anymore but it glowed like a captive star and she backed away from it i didnt know where my gun was but the machete gleamed against the dark earth i wrapped my hand around it and got to my feet larry was behind me with his own cross out held in front of him to the length of its chain the white light with its core of blue was almost painfully bright ivy screamed shielding her eyes all she had to do was walk away but she was frozen immobile in the face of the crosses and two true believers gun i said to larry cant find it both guns were matte black so they wouldnt reflect light at night and make us a target now it made them invisible we advanced on the vampire she threw both arms up before her face and screamed nooo shed backed up nearly to the edge of the circle if she ran we wouldnt chase her but she didnt run maybe she couldnt i shoved the machete up under her ribs blood poured down the blade onto my hands i drove the blade upward into her heart i gave it that last little wrench to slice it up her arms fell away from her face slowly her eyes were wide surprised she stared down at the blade in her stomach as if she didnt understand what it was doing there the flesh of her neck was black where the cross had burned her she fell to her knees and i went with her keeping my grip on the machete she didnt die i hadnt really expected her to i jerked the blade out of her doing more damage she made a low gurgling sound but stayed on her knees her hands touched the blood flowing out of her chest and stomach she stared at the gleaming darkness as if shed never seen blood before the blood flow was already slowing unless i killed her soon the wound would close i stood over her and brought the machete back in a twohanded grip i put everything i had into that downswing the blade bit into her neck down to the spine catching on the bone ivy stared up at me with blood streaming down her neck i swung back for another chop and she watched me do it too hurt to run now i had to struggle to get the blade out of the spine and still she blinked up at me if i didnt finish her shed heal even this i brought the blade down one last time and felt the last edge of bone give the blade came out the other side and her head slid off her shoulders in a spray of blood like a black fountain that black blood poured over the circle and closed it power filled the circle until we were drowning in it larry fell to his knees the light from the crosses faded like dying stars the vampire was dead and the crosses couldnt help us now whats happening i could feel the power like water on every side choking close i was breathing it in soaking it up through my skin i screamed wordlessly and fell to the ground i fell through layers of power and the moment i hit the ground i could feel the power below me stretching downward outward i was lying on top of bones they twitched like something moving in its sleep i crawled to my knees hands digging into the earth i touched a long thin arm bone and it moved i scrambled to my feet slow too slow through the pressing air and watched bones slid through the earth like water coming together the earth heaved and rocked underfoot like giant moles were crawling larry was on his feet now too whats happening something bad i said id never seen the dead coalesce they always came to the surface of the grave all in one piece id never realized it was like putting together a macabre jigsaw puzzle a skeleton formed at my feet and flesh began to crawl over it flow like clay molding itself back to the bones anita i turned to larry he was pointing at a skeleton at the far edge of the circle half the bones were on the outside of the circle flesh crawled over this side of the bones and pushed against the blood circle the earth gave one last heave and the magic poured out over the ground i heard it pop inside my head like a release of pressure the air spread out not so drowningthick it poured over the hillside like invisible flame and everywhere it touched the dead formed bodies stop it anita stop it i cant the killing magic in the ground had stolen the reins all i could do was watch and feel the power spreading outward enough power to ride forever enough power to raise a thousand dead i knew when rawhead and bloody bones burst its prison i felt the power sag as the thing escaped then the power lashed back into this bit of ground and drove us to our knees the dead struggled from the earth like swimmers dragging themselves to shore when nearly twenty dead stood waiting with empty eyes the power flowed outward i felt it seeking more dead something else to raise this i could stop the fairie was gone out of the loop he had what he wanted i called the power back i drew it into me back through the ground like pulling a snake by its tail out of a hole i flung it into the zombies flung it into them and said live the wrinkled flesh filled out the dead eyes gleamed the tattered clothing mended itself dirt fell away from a long gingham dress a woman with midnight hair dark skin and magnuss startled eyes looked at me they all looked at me twenty dead all over two hundred years old and they could have passed for human my god larry whispered even i was impressed very impressive ms blake stirlings voice was wrenching as if he shouldnt have been there he was a different part of reality from the nearperfect zombies the fairie was out but id do my job for what good it would do any of us which of you is a bouvier there was a murmur of voices most of them speaking french nearly all of them were bouviers the woman introduced herself as anias bouvier she looked very alive looks like youll have to move your hotel i said oh i dont think so stirling said i turned and looked at him he had a big shiny silver gun out a nickelplated he held it like it was a movie kind of out in front of him waisthigh a is a big gun you dont hit much from a waist shot or thats the theory with it pointed at us i wasnt eager to try the theory bayard was pointing a automatic vaguely in our direction it didnt look like hed held a gun before maybe he forgot and left the safety on ms harrison had a nickelplated pointed very steadily at me she stood with her legs apart balanced on her ridiculous high heels she held the gun in a twohanded grip like she knew what she was doing i flashed on her face her eyes in her thick makeup were a little wide but she was rock steady steadier than bayard and a better stance than stirling i hoped stirling paid her well whats going on stirling i asked my voice was even but there was an edge of power to it i was still riding the power enough power to put the zombies back in the ground enough power to do a lot of things he smiled visibly in the bright reflected light youve released the creature now we shall kill you why the hell do you care if bloody bones is out i saw the guns and still didnt know why it came into my dreams ms blake it promised me all the bouvier land all of it the fey breaking out wont get you the land i said it will with bouvier dead the deed that got us this hillside will be found to include all the land once theres no one to fight it even with magnus dead you wont get the land i said but my voice didnt sound so sure you mean his sister stirling said shell die just as easily as magnus my stomach was tight her children rawhead and bloody bones loves children best of all he said you son of a bitch it was larry he took a step forward and ms harrisons gun swung to him i grabbed his arm with my free hand i still had the machete in my hand larry stopped and the gun stayed on him i wasnt sure that was an improvement tension sang down larrys arm id seen him angry but never like this the power responded to that anger the zombies all turned to us in a rustle of cloth their glittering eyes so alive were waiting for us move in front of us i whispered the zombies began walking towards us the closest ones moved in front of us immediately i lost sight of the guntoting trio here was hoping theyd lost sight of us kill them stirling said loud almost a yell i started to drop to the ground still holding larrys arm he resisted gunfire exploded around us and he kissed dirt flat with the side of his face pressed to the ground he said what now bullets were hitting the zombies the bodies jerked and twitched some of the very alive faces stared down alarmed as holes appeared in their bodies but there was no pain the panic was reflex someone was yelling it wasnt us stop it stop it we cant do this we cant just kill them it was bayard it is late for an attack of conscience ms harrison said it may have been the first time id heard her voice she sounded efficient lionel you are either with me or against me shit i muttered i wormed forward trying to see what was happening i pushed aside a billowing skirt just in time to see stirling shoot lionel in the stomach the gave out a booming sound and nearly jerked itself out of stirlings hand but he held on from less than ten inches away you could shoot nearly anything with a bayard collapsed to his knees looking up at stirling he was trying to say something but no sound came out stirling took the gun from bayards hand and put it in his own jacket pocket he turned his back on bayard and walked out onto the hard dry soil ms harrison hesitated but she followed her boss bayard fell onto his side with a dark flood draining out of him his glasses reflected the moonlight making him look blind stirling and ms harrison were coming in after us stirling pushed among the dead as if they were trees and he was wading through the dead didnt move for him they stood there like stubborn fleshy barriers i hadnt told them to move so they wouldnt ms harrison had stopped trying to force her way through moonlight glinted on her shiny gun as she used a zombies shoulder to sight on us kill her i whispered the zombie she was using as a sighting post turned towards her she made an exasperated sound and the dead closed on her larry looked at me what did you tell them ms harrison was screaming now high frightened shrieks she fired her gun again and again it clicked empty slow eager hands and mouths latched onto her body stop them larry said he grabbed my arm stop them i could feel the hands tearing bits of flesh from ms harrison teeth sank into her shoulder tore that tender neck and i knew when blood flowed into that mouth larry was along for the ride oh god stop it he was on his knees pulling at me begging stirling hadnt fired a shot where was he stop i whispered the dead froze like automatons stopped in midaction ms harrison slid to the ground in a moaning heap stirling came in from one side the big gun pointed very steadily at us out in a twohanded grip like it was supposed to be held hed made his way behind us while the zombies worked over ms harrison he was standing nearly on top of us it took a lot of nerve to come that close to the zombies larrys fingers dug into my arm dont anita please dont even staring down the barrel of a gun larry stuck to his morals admirable if you say a word ms blake i will kill you i just stared up at him i was so close to him i could have reached out and touched his pants leg the was pointed very solidly at my head if he pulled the trigger i was gone careless of you not to have the zombies attack both of us i agreed with him but all i could do was stare up at him i still had the machete in one hand i tried not to tighten my grip on it not to draw attention to it i must have made some betraying motion because he said take your hand away from the knife ms blake slowly i didnt do it i stared up at him and his gun now ms blake or he thumbed back the hammer on the gun not necessary but always dramatic i let go of the machete hand away from it ms blake i moved my hand away i didnt move away from him and the gun i wanted to but i made myself be still a few inches wouldnt make the gun less deadly but it might make a big difference if i tried to jump him not my first choice but if we ran out of other options i wouldnt go down without a fight can you lay these zombies to rest mr kirkland larry hesitated i dont know good boy if hed said no stirling might have killed him if hed said yes hed have killed me larry let go of my arm and moved just a little away from me stirlings eyes flicked to him back to me but the gun barrel never wavered damn larry was on his knees still moving away from me forcing stirling to keep an eye on both of us the moved an inch from the center of my forehead towards larry i took a breath and held it not yet not yet if i tried something too soon id be dead larry lunged for something on the ground the swung towards him i did two things at once i slipped my left hand behind stirlings leg and pulled and i grabbed his groin with my right and shoved with all i was worth i was doing the wrong thing to cause a lot of pain but it tipped him over he fell flat on his back with the gun swinging back towards me id hoped hed drop the gun or be slower he didnt and he wasnt so i only had a splitsecond to decide whether to try to pull his privates out of his body and cause as much pain as possible or go for the gun i went for the gun not trying to grab it but sweeping my hands into his arms if i could control his arms i could control the gun the gun went off i didnt look no time larry was either hit or he wasnt if he wasnt i had to get that gun stirlings arms were on the ground my hands keeping them there but i had no leverage he raised his arms off the ground and i couldnt stop him i shoved my feet into the ground and forced his arms over his head but it had become a wrestling match now and he outweighed me by sixty pounds drop the gun larrys voice behind me i couldnt look couldnt take my attention from the gun we both ignored him i will shoot you larry said that got stirlings attention his eyes flicked to larry for just a moment his body hesitated i kept my grip on his wrists and shoved myself forward up his body i dug my knee into his groin trying to reach the ground through him he let out a strangled cry his hands spasmed i moved my hands up and touched the gun his grip tightened he wasnt letting go i came up beside stirlings arms and braced his arms against my hip i pulled the arm against my body just one quick movement and snapped his arm at the elbow the hand went numb and the gun fell into my hand i crawled away from him the gun in one hand larry was standing over us with a gun pointed at stirling stirling didnt seem to care he was rocking back and forth over the ground trying to cradle both injuries at once i had a gun you could have just moved away from him larry said i just shook my head i trusted larry to shoot stirling i just hadnt trusted stirling not to shoot larry i had my hands on the gun seemed a shame to let it go i said larry pointed the gun at the ground but kept a nice twohanded grip on it its yours you want it i shook my head keep it until we get to the car i looked up at the zombies they were watching me with calm eyes there was blood on the mouth of the darkhaired woman it had been her teeth that tore into ms harrisons neck ms harrison was lying very still on the ground passed out at the very least the power was beginning to unravel at the edges if i was going to put everybody back in the ground it had to be now go back into the ground back to your graves go back all of you go back the dead walked upon the earth moving among one another like children in a game of musical chairs then one by one they lay down upon the earth and it swallowed them like water the earth moved and buckled in waves until they were all tucked out of sight there were no bones protruding from the earth the earth was smooth and soft as if the entire top of the mountain had been dug up and smoothed over the power shredded flowing back into the ground or wherever the hell it came from we had to get down to the jeep and start making phone calls there was a rampaging fey on the loose we at least had to get cops out to the bouviers place larry knelt beside ms harrison he touched her neck shes alive his hand came away stained with blood i looked at stirling hed stopped rolling around and was just sort of huddled on his side his arm held at an obscene angle the look he gave me was part pain and part hate if he ever got a second chance i was dead shoot him if he moves i said larry got to his feet and pointed the gun dutifully at stirling i went to check on bayard he lay on his side halfcrumpled around the wound in his belly a wide black circle showed where his blood had soaked into the thirsty ground i knew dead when i saw it but i knelt on the far side of his body so i could keep an eye on stirling it wasnt that i didnt trust larry i just didnt trust stirling there was no pulse in his neck the skin was already cooling in the soft spring air it hadnt been an instant death lionel bayard had died while we were fighting hed died alone and hed known he was dying and that hed been betrayed it was a bad way to die i stood up and looked at stirling i wanted to kill him for bayard for magnus for dorrie bouvier for her kids for being a heartless son of bitch hed witnessed me using zombies as a weapon using magic as a killing weapon was punishable by death selfdefense was not an acceptable plea i stared very calmly across at stirling and the unconscious ms harrison and realized that i could have crossed that ground and put a bullet in both of them and slept just fine sweet jesus larry glanced my way gun still steady but hed taken his eyes off stirling for a second not fatal tonight but id have to break him of it is bayard dead yeah i started back towards them wondering what i was going to do i didnt think larry would let me shoot them in cold blood part of me was glad part of me wasnt wind blew against my face there was a rustling sound in the wind like that made by trees or cloth there were no trees on top of this mountain i turned with the big in a twohanded grip and janos was just there on the edge of the mountain staring at his skeletal face i think i stopped breathing he was dressed all in black even his hands were hidden inside black gloves for one wild moment he looked like a floating skull we have the boy he said the crosses were still in plain sight they glowed with a soft white radiance no burning light not yet we werent in active danger but the cross grew warm even through my shirt janos put a hand in front of his eyes the way i would guard my eyes from the sun in the car please put those away so we may talk he hadnt asked us to take them off i could live with tucking my cross in my shirt it could come out again later i spilled the chain back down my shirt onehanded keeping the ready i realized then that i didnt know if the gun had silver ammo now was not the time to ask stirling would probably lie anyway larry slipped his own cross out of sight the glowing night was just a little dimmer alright now what i asked kissa came up behind him jeff quinlan in front of her like a shield his glasses were gone and he looked even younger without them she had his arm behind his back at an angle that could be painful with just a tug he was wearing a creamcolored tuxedo with a cummerbund done two shades darker to match the bow tie kissa was in black leather jeff stood out against her in wonderful contrast i swallowed my pulse threatened to choke me what was going on you alright jeff i guess so kissa gave a little tug he winced im okay his voice was a little higher than it should have been a little scared i held out my hand to him come here not yet janos said id tried what do you want first drop your guns if we dont i thought i knew the answer but i wanted him to say it kissa will kill the boy and you will have done all this for nothing help me stirling said shes mad she attacked ms harrison with zombies when we tried to defend ourselves she nearly killed us that was probably what hed say in court too and a jury would believe him theyd want to believe him i would be the big bad zombie queen and he would be the innocent victim janos laughed his paperthin skin threatening to split but never quite doing it oh no mr stirling i watched from the darkness i saw you murder the other man fear flashed across his face i dont know what you mean we hired him in good faith he turned on us my master opened your mind to bloody bones she freed him to whisper in your dreams about land money and power all that you desire serephina sent ivy to kill me or rather for me to kill her so shed be sure to have bloody bones free i said yes he said serephina told her she had to rid herself of the disgrace of losing to you by killing me yes what if shed succeeded my master had faith in you anita you are death come among us a breath of mortality whyd she want the thing freed i seemed to be asking that a lot tonight she wishes to taste immortal blood this is all sort of elaborate for a little extra kick in your food he gave another rictus grin you are what you eat anita think upon it i did and my eyes widened she thinks by drinking immortal blood shell be truly immortal very good anita it wont work i said we shall see he said what do you get out it i asked he cocked his skeletal head to one side like a decaying bird she is my master and she shares her bounty you want immortality too i want power he said great and it doesnt bother you that the thing will kill children that its already killed some we feed bloody bones feeds what does it matter and bloody bones is going to just let you feed off it serephina has found the spell that magnuss ancestor used she controls the fairie how he shook his head and smiled no more delays anita drop the gun or kissa will taste him before your eyes kissa ran a hand through jeffs short hair a caressing gesture it pushed his head to one side baring a long smooth line of neck no jeff tried to pull away and kissa yanked on his arm hard enough that he cried out i will break the arm boy she growled the pain held him immobile but his eyes were wide and terrified he looked at me he wouldnt plead no begging but his eyes did it for him kissas lips pulled back from her teeth in a flashy snarl fangs visible dont i said and hated it i tossed the to the ground larry threw my gun down disarmed twice in one night it was a record even for me now what i asked serephina awaits us at the party she sent suitable clothing for you you can change in the limousine janos said what party i asked the one we have come to invite you to she is delivering jeanclaudes invitation in person that didnt sound good i think well pass on the party i dont think so janos said another vampire stepped out of the trees it was the brunette that had tormented jason she stalked forward in a long black dress that covered her from neck to ankle she slid her arms around janos nuzzling his neck giving us a glimpse of her pale back only a fine webbing of black straps covered her back the dress moved like it would slide down her body at the least movement but somehow it stayed in place fashionplate magic her dark hair was in a looping braid to one side of her face she looked good for someone id seen ripped to rotting bits of flesh i couldnt keep the surprise off my face i thought she was dead larry said so did i i would never have risked pallas if i truly thought your werewolf could kill her janos said a second figure came out of the dark woods long white hair framed a thin fineboned face his eyes glowed bloodred id seen vampires with glowing eyes before but they always glowed the color of their irises no one who had ever been human had red irises he wore a proverbial black tux and tails complete with a nearly anklelength cape xavier i said softly larry looked at me this is the vampire thats been killing everyone i nodded then whats he doing here thats how you found jeff so quickly youre working with xavier i said does serephina know janos smiled she is master of all anita even him he said the last like it impressed him you wont get to munch on your fairie for long if the cops trace xavier to you xavier was following orders he was on a recruitment drive janos seemed to like saying that last bit like it was an injoke why did you want ellie quinlan xavier likes a bit of young boy now and then it is his one weakness he turned the girls lover and the boy wanted her with him forever tonight she will rise and feed with us not if i could help it what do you want janos i was sent to make your life easier he said yeah right pallas uncurled herself from janos she glided over to stirling stirling stared up at her cradling his broken arm it had to hurt like hell but it wasnt pain on his face now it was fear he stared up at the vampire all the arrogance had slipped away he looked like a kid whod discovered the thing under the bed was really there a third vampire moved out of the trees it was the blonde half of the pair she looked fine like shed never rotted right before our eyes id never known a vampire that could look so dead and not be you remember bettina he said bettina wore a black dress that left her pale shoulders bare a throw of black cloth went over one shoulder and down the front of the dress a gold belt held it in place cinching her waist tight her yellow braid was wound in a crown atop her head she walked towards us and her face was perfect the dry rotting skin had been a bad dream a nightmare i wish fire jeanclaude had said fire was the only surety i thought hed meant just janos janos reached over and grabbed jeff from kissa he gripped the boys shoulders with both blackgloved hands his fingers were longer than they should have been as though they had an extra joint against the white of jeffs jacket you could tell that the index finger was as long as the middle finger another myth that was true at least for janos those long strange fingers dug into jeff just a little jeffs eyes were so wide it looked painful whats going on i asked kissa was dressed in the same black vinyl outfit shed had on in the torture room though it couldnt be the exact same one because the first one had larrys bullet hole in it she stood beside him her hands in fists she stood very still as only the dead can but there was a tension to her a wariness she wasnt happy her dark skin was strangely pale she hadnt fed yet tonight i could always tell with most vampires there are always exceptions xavier moved in a shadow of that impossible blurring speed past stirling to stand beside the still unconscious ms harrison larry shook his head did he just appear there or did i see him move he moved i said i expected janos to send kissa out to join the others but he didnt a figure crawled over the lip of the hill dragging itself into sight like it hurt to move pale hands dug into the naked dirt pale arms bare to the spring night the head drooped towards the ground short dark hair hiding the face with one upward motion the face raised into the moonlight thin bloodless lips drew back from fangs the face was ravaged with hunger i knew the eyes were brown only because id seen them staring lifelessly at the ceiling of ellie quinlans bedroom there was no pull to her eyes but down in the dark depths a flicker of something burned it wasnt sanity hunger maybe an animals emotion nothing human maybe after theyd let her feed for the first time shed have time for emotions now everything had narrowed down to one basic need is that who i think it is larry asked yeah i said jeff tried to run to her ellie janos jerked him tight against his chest one arm around his shoulders like an embrace jeff struggled against that arm tried to run to his dead sister i was with janos on this one the newly risen have a tendency to eat first and ask questions later the thing that had once been ellie quinlan would have gladly torn out her baby brothers throat shed have bathed in the blood and minutes or days or weeks later she would realize what shed done she might even regret it go angela go to xavier janos said a new name wont change who she was i said janos looked at me she is two years dead and her name is angela her name is ellie jeff said hed stopped struggling but he looked at his dead sister with fresh horror as if just beginning to really see her people will recognize her janos we shall be careful anita our new angel will see no one that we do not wish well isnt that cozy i said it will be he said once she has drunk her fill im impressed that you dragged her this far without feeding her first i did it xaviers voice was surprisingly pleasant it was disturbing hearing that voice coming from that pale ghostly face i looked at him careful to avoid his gaze impressive i said andy brought her over and i brought andy over i am her master since andy hadnt shown up i was betting id killed him in the woods with sheriff st john probably not a good time to bring that up and who is your master serephina for now xavier said i glanced at janos you havent worked out which of you is top dog have you i smiled you waste our time anita our master awaits you eagerly let us finish this call our angel xavier held out one pale hand ellie made a noise low in her throat and scrambled on all fours over the raw dirt the long black dress tangled around her legs she tore at it impatiently the cloth ripped like paper in her hands the skirt shredding around her bare legs she grabbed xaviers hand like it was a lifeline she bent over his wrist and only his hand in her hair kept her from trying to feed on him there is no sustenance for you from the dead angela janos said feed on the living pallas and bettina knelt on either side of stirling xavier fell gracefully beside ms harrison his black cape spread out around him like a pool of blood he kept hold of ellies hair the whole way down forcing her snarling face to touch the dirt her hands dug at his hands mewling sounds crawling from her throat nothing that was human should have made sounds like that ms blake stirling said youre the law you have to protect me i thought you were going to see me in court raymond something about me attacking you and ms harrison with zombies i didnt mean it he glanced up at the kneeling vampires then back to me i wont tell i wont tell anyone please i just looked at him begging for mercy raymond yes yes im begging like the mercy you showed bayard please bettina caressed stirlings cheek he jerked like it had burned please shit we cant just watch larry said you have another suggestion you never give anyone over to the monsters not for any reason its a rule he said it was my rule id believed in it once back when id been sure who the monsters were he was pulling the chain out from inside his shirt dont do this larry dont get us killed for raymond stirling his cross spilled out in the open air it glowed like serephinas eyes he just looked at me i sighed and brought out my own cross this is a bad idea i know he said but i cant just watch i stared at his earnest face and knew it was true he couldnt just watch i could have i might not have enjoyed it but i could have let it happen mores the pity what are you doing with your little holy objects janos asked stopping this i said you want them dead anita not like this i said would you have me let you use your gun and waste all this blood he was offering to let me shoot them i shook my head i dont think thats an option anymore it was never an option larry said i let that go no need to disillusion him i walked towards pallas and bettina larry walked towards ellie and xavier cross held outward to the length of its chain as if that made it work better nothing wrong with a little dramatic gesture but id have to clue him in that it didnt really help but later the crosss glow grew until it was like wearing a watt lightbulb naked around your neck i saw the world as a black circle outside the glow xavier was on his feet facing larry but the others had crawled away from their prey beaten by the light thank you ms blake stirling said thank you he grabbed my leg with his good hand fawning over me i fought an urge to shake him off thank larry id have let you die he didnt seem to hear me he was nearly crying with relief slobbering all over my nikes back away from them please the voice was female and honeythick i blinked over the glow of the cross and saw kissa holding a gun a revolver that looked like a magnum hard to tell in the glow whatever it was itd make a big hole move away from them now i thought serephina didnt want me dead kissa will shoot your young friend i stopped in midbreath and let it out if you kill him i wont cooperate with whatever you have in mind for tonight you misunderstand us anita janos said my master does not require your cooperation everything she wants from you can be taken by force i stared at him over the shining light he had jeff cuddled against him most heartwarming take off your crosses and throw them far out into the trees janos said he ran a gloved hand along both sides of jeffs face planting a kiss on his cheek now that we know you would give up your safety for both young men we have one more hostage than is absolutely necessary he put his hands on either side of jeffs neck just holding not hurting not yet take off your crosses and throw them into the woods i will not ask a third time i stared at him i didnt want to give up my cross i glanced at larry he was still facing off against xavier his cross glowing bravely shit kissa shoot the man no i said i undid the chain dont shoot him dont do it anita larry said i cant watch them shoot you not if i can stop it i let the chain pool in my hand the cross shone with a bluewhite flame like burning magnesium it was a bad idea to throw it away a real bad idea i tossed it into the woods the cross glittered like a falling star and died out of sight in the dark now your cross larry janos said larry shook his head youll have to shoot me well shoot the boy janos said or perhaps ill feed upon him while you watch he pinned jeff against himself with one arm while his other hand dug into the boys hair holding him immobile neck exposed larry looked at me what do i do anita you have to decide this one for yourself i said theyll really kill him wont they yeah they will he cursed under his breath and let the cross fall against his chest he undid the chain and threw it out into the woods with a lot of force to it as if he could throw his anger with it when the light from his cross died away we stood there in the darkness the moonlight that had seemed so bright before was a dim substitute my night vision returned in stages kissa stepped closer the gun still pointed at us the first time id seen her she had exuded sexuality power now she was docile quiet as though some of her power had been drained away she looked pale and drawn she needed to feed why havent they let you feed tonight i asked our master is not a hundred percent sure of kissas loyalty it needed testing didnt it my dark beauty kissa didnt answer she stared at me with large dark eyes but the gun never wavered feed children feed pallas and bettina walked over to stirling they stared at me over him i stared back stirling grabbed my leg you cant let them have me please please pallas knelt by him bettina walked around to the side i was on she pulled stirlings hand off my leg the vampires lower back brushed my legs i took a step back and stirling started screaming xavier and ellie had already started to feed on the blessedly unconscious ms harrison larry looked at me hands out empty helpless i didnt know what to say dont touch me dont touch me stirling batted at pallas with his good hand and the vampire caught it easily held it at least put him under i said pallas looked up at me after he tried to kill you why show him mercy maybe i dont want to hear him scream pallas smiled her eyes flashed dark fire for you anita anything she grabbed stirlings chin forcing him to meet her gaze ms blake help me help the words died in his mouth i watched everything slide out of his eyes until they were empty and waiting come to me raymond pallas said come to me stirling sat up his one good arm embracing the vampire he tried to use the broken arm but it wouldnt bend at the elbow bettina bent the broken arm backward and forward laughing stirling never reacted to the pain he snuggled against pallas the look on his face was one of happiness joy eagerness pallas sank fangs into his neck stirling spasmed for a second then relaxed and began making soft noises in his throat pallas moved stirlings head to one side sucking on the wound but leaving enough room on the other side for someone else bettina sank fangs into the exposed flesh the two vampires fed heads so close together their hair mingled gold and black and raymond stirling made happy noises while they killed him larry walked away to the edge of the clearing hugging his arms tight across his chest i stayed where i was i watched i had wanted stirling dead it would be cowardly to look away besides i should have to watch i needed to remember who the monsters were maybe if i forced myself not to look away not to blink i wouldnt forget again i stared at stirlings happy eager face until his arm dropped away from pallass back and his eyes closed he passed out from blood loss and shock and the vampires hugged him tight and fed his eyes flew open wide and a gurgling sound crawled out of his throat fear screamed out of his eyes pallas raised a hand and stroked stirlings hair a gesture youd use on a frightened child the fear died out of his eyes and i watched the last light die with it i watched raymond stirling die and knew i would remember that last look of terror in my dreams for weeks to come there was a rush of wind that raised a fine cloud of dirt jeanclaude appeared as if conjured from the air itself i had never been so happy to see him i didnt run to his arms but i moved to stand near him larry followed me jeanclaude wasnt always the safest refuge but right now he looked pretty damn good he was dressed in one of his white shirts this one had so much lace on the front it looked fluffy a short white jacket hit him just at the waist more lace peeked from the sleeves of the jacket he wore tight white pants with a black belt the belt matched his velvet black boots i did not expect you here jeanclaude janos said i couldnt tell for sure but he sounded surprised goody serephina delivered her invitation in person janos but it was not enough you surprise me jeanclaude he said i surprised serephina as well he sounded terribly calm if he was afraid standing outnumbered on the hilltop it didnt show id have loved to know how hed surprised serephina jason walked up the far side of the hill from the direction of the jeep he wore black leather pants that looked like theyd been poured on him short black boots and no shirt there was what looked like a silverstudded dog collar around his neck and a black glove on either hand but other than that he was naked from the waist up i hoped jason had chosen his own outfit for tonight the right side of his face was bruised from chin to forehead as though something large had hit him i see your pet joined the struggle janos said he is mine in every way janos they are all mine just this once i let it go if my choice was belonging to jeanclaude or to serephina i knew what my vote would be larry moved so close to me that i could have taken his hand maybe he didnt like being included in jeanclaudes menagerie you have lost that air of humbleness that i found so appealing jeanclaude have you refused serephinas invitation altogether i will come to serephinas party but on my own with my people around me i glanced at him was he crazy he frowned serephina wanted you at the party in chains we can all live with this choice janos are you saying you would challenge us all here and now there was an edge of laughter in his voice i will not die alone janos in the end you may have me but it will cost you dearly if you will truly come of your own free will then come janos said our master calls let us answer that call janos bettina and pallas were just suddenly airborne it wasnt flying or levitation i had no word for it larry whispered dear god the first time you see a vampire fly is a redletter night the others scattered into the trees in that blurring motion that made them disappear almost as fast as flying ellie quinlan had vanished with the rest of them her brother had been carried away by janos until that moment i hadnt known a vampire could carry more than its own body weight while flying learn something new every night we found our guns and walked down the mountainside our crosses were well and truly lost even jeanclaude walked and i knew he had other methods of transportation was it considered impolite to fly when others couldnt the jeep was still where id parked it the night was still thick it was hours until dawn and i just wanted to go home i took the liberty of choosing clothes for you to wear tonight jeanclaude said they are in the jeep i locked the jeep i said he just smiled at me i sighed fine when i tried the handle it was unlocked clothes were folded in the passenger seat they were black leather i shook my head i dont think so your clothes ma petite are on the drivers side those are lawrences clothes larry peered over my shoulder youve got to be kidding i walked around the jeep and found a clean pair of black jeans the tightest pair i owned a bloodred tank top that i didnt remember buying it felt like silk there was a black duster coat that i had never seen when i tried it for length it hit me at midcalf and billowed capelike when i moved i liked the coat the silk blouse i could have done without not bad i said mine is bad larry said i dont even know how to get into these pants jason help him dress jason picked up the bundle of leather and carried them to the back of the jeep larry followed him but didnt look happy no boots i said jeanclaude smiled i didnt think you would give up your jogging shoes damn straight change quickly ma petite we must arrive at serephinas before she decides to kill the boy just for spite would xavier let her kill his new toy if she is truly his master he has no choice now dress ma petite quickly i walked towards the far side of the jeep but that brought me within earshot and nearly eyesight of larry i stopped and sighed what the hell i turned my back on jeanclaude and slid out of my shoulder holster how did you guys get away from serephina i slipped my shirt over my head i fought the urge to look back i knew jeanclaude was watching why check jason jumped her at a crucial moment it was distraction enough for us to flee but little else im afraid the room is something of a mess his voice was so mild i had to see his face i slid the red tank top on and turned he was standing closer than id thought nearly within touching distance he stood there in his white clothes spotless and perfect step a few paces back please id like a little privacy he smiled but he did what i asked a first had she underestimated you that badly i asked i changed jeans as quickly as i could i tried not to think of him watching it was too embarrassing i was forced to flee ma petite janos calls her master and he defeated me i cannot stand against her not in a fair fight i slipped the shoulder holster back on threading the belt id been wearing back through it the straps chafed a little with no sleeves but it was better than not having it i got the firestar from under my seat and tucked the inner pants holster down the front of my jeans it would show even with the duster i finally put it at the small of my back though it wasnt my first or even second choice of places i got the silver knives out of the glove compartment and strapped them to my forearms i also got out a small box it held two extra crosses vampires seemed to always be taking them from me jeanclaude watched it all with interest his dark eyes followed my hands like he was memorizing the movements i put the duster on and walked a few steps to get the feel of everything i drew both knives just to make sure the coat sleeves werent too tight i drew both guns and still didnt like the firestar i finally shifted the inner pants holster to one side it dug into my side hard enough to bruise but i could draw it in a reasonable time that was more important than comfort tonight i slipped an extra clip for both guns in the coat pockets they were loaded with nonsilver bullets it made me nervous to only have the silver bullets that were in the guns but rawhead and bloody bones was going to make his appearance sometime tonight magnus might even be there i wanted ammo for everything id meet tonight larry came out from behind the jeep i bit my lip to keep from laughing it wasnt that he looked bad he just looked so uncomfortable he seemed to have trouble walking in the black leather pants just walk naturally jason said i cant larry said he had a silk tank top that was the twin of mine except it was blue instead of red he had short black boots on the black jacket hed borrowed from jason last night completed the outfit i looked at the boots black jogging shoes perhaps ma petite but white jogging shoes with black leather i do not think so i feel ridiculous larry said how can you wear this all the time i like leather jason said we must be off jeanclaude said anita if you would drive i thought you might want to fly i said it is important we arrive together he said larry and i added salt to our pockets with the extra ammo clips in one pocket and salt in the other my coat hung a little crooked but hey we werent going to a fashion show we all slid into the jeep there was a lot of protesting from the back seat these pants are even more uncomfortable sitting down i will remember your dislike of leather in the future lawrence my name is larry i drove the jeep down the rutted road that led out of the construction site serephina wants to be immortal i turned onto the main road and headed back towards branson though of course wed be stopping at serephinas on the way jeanclaude turned in his seat to stare at me what are you saying ma petite i told him i told him about rawhead and bloody bones and serephinas plan shes mad not entirely ma petite it might not give her immortality but it would give her undreamtof power the question remaining is how did serephina grow powerful enough to snag janos before she fed off magnus and bloody bones what do you mean janos was in the old country he would not have left voluntarily he followed her where did she get the power to subjugate him maybe magnus isnt the first fairie shes fed off i said perhaps he said or perhaps she has found other food what other food that ma petite is the question that i would very much like answered thinking of changing diets i asked power is always tempting ma petite but for tonight i was thinking of more practical matters if we can discover her source of power we might be able to undo it how he shook his head i do not know but unless we can find some trick to pull out of our hats tonight ma petite we are doomed he sounded remarkably calm about it i wasnt calm my pulse was thundering so fast i could feel it in my throat and wrists hear it like a rushing in my ears doomed it had a bad ring to it with serephina waiting at the other end it had a very bad ring to it indeed we walked up the stone steps to the porch moonlight and soft darkness filled the porch there were no thick unnatural shadows no hint of what lay inside it was just an abandoned house nothing special the nervous flutter in my stomach didnt buy it either kissa opened the door candlelight spilled behind her from the open door to the far room no pretense tonight that the empty room was all there was sweat beaded on her face golden drops in the warm light she was still being punished i wondered why but it wasnt my biggest problem kissa led us through that open door without a word serephina sat on her throne in the corner of the big room she was dressed in a white ball gown like cinderella her hair piled atop her head diamonds like a string of fire glimmered in her hair as she nodded her greeting magnus was curled at her feet in a white tux and tails gloves a white top hat and a cane were laid next to his knees his long chestnut hair was the only color in the picture every master vamp id ever met had been into dramatic presentation janos and his two females stood in black behind the throne like a living curtain of darkness ellie lay on her side in the cushions looking almost alive even in her torn and stained black dress she looked content like a cat that was full of cream her eyes sparkled lips curled with a secret smile ellie alias angela was enjoying being undead so far kissa stalked to them and knelt on the side away from magnus her black leather blended with janoss cloak serephina stroked kissas sweating face with a whitegloved hand serephina smiled and it was lovely until you glimpsed her eyes they glowed with a pale phosphorescence you could still get a hint of pupil but it was sinking fast her eyes matched her dress now that was colorcoordinating jeff and xavier were missing i didnt like that i opened my mouth to ask and jeanclaude looked at me for just this once the look was enough he was the master i was playing servant fine as long as he asked the right questions we have come serephina jeanclaude said give us the boy and we will leave you in peace she laughed but i will not leave you in peace jeanclaude she turned her softly glowing eyes to me it was like being looked at by twin flashlights and just as human niÑa i am so happy to see you i stopped breathing for a second niÑa it had been my mothers nickname for me something flared in her eyes like a distant glimpse of fire then the light banked back to a cool wavering light she wasnt trying to capture me with her eyes why because she was that sure of me my skin suddenly went cold that was it i would have said it was arrogance but i believed it she offered something better than sex more fulfilling than power home lie or not it was a good offer larry touched my hand youre shaking i swallowed hard never admit how scared you are out loud larry ruins the effect sorry i stepped away from him no sense in huddling i glanced at jeanclaude sort of silently asking if i was about to break vampire protocol she has acknowledged you as she would another master answer as one he didnt seem bothered by that i was what do you want serephina i asked she stood gliding across the carpeted floor it looked like whatever was under that full skirt wasnt legs feet just didnt move like that maybe she was levitating however she managed it she kept coming closer i wanted desperately to back away i didnt want her close to me larry moved a step behind me jason moved a step up to jeanclaudes other side i stood my ground it was the best i could do something flickered in her eyes like a distant glimpse of movement through a fringe of trees eyes didnt do that i looked away and realized i didnt remember looking at her eyes so how was i looking away i felt her move towards me her gloved hand came into view i jerked back and looked up at the same time i barely glanced at her face but it was enough her eyes had fire burning down a long dark tunnel as if the inside of her head fell away into an impossible darkness and some small creatures had lit a fire against that darkness i could warm my hands by that flame forever i screamed screamed and covered my eyes with my hands a hand touched my shoulder i jerked away and screamed again ma petite i am here then do something i said i am he said i will have this one by sunrise she motioned to me she took a gliding step towards jason she caressed her gloved hand down his bare chest he stood there and took it i wouldnt have let her touch me on a dare i will give you to bettina and pallas they will teach you to enjoy rotting flesh jason stared straight ahead but his eyes widened just a little bettina and pallas had moved from behind the throne to stand a few feet behind serephina dramatic gestures are us or perhaps i will force you to change into wolf form until it becomes more natural than this human shell she slid a finger under the collar on his throat i will chain you to my wall and you will be my guard dog enough of this serephina jeanclaude said the night bleeds away these petty torments are beneath one of your power i am feeling petty tonight jeanclaude and soon i will have the power to be as petty as i feel she glanced at larry he will join my flock she stared up at jeanclaude i hadnt realized he was taller and you my lovely catamount will serve us all for all eternity jeanclaude stared down at her utterly arrogant i am master of the city now serephina we cannot torture each other we cannot steal each others possessions no matter how attractive they are it took me a second to realize the possessions he was referring to were us serephina smiled i will have your businesses your money your lands and your people before the night is out did the council really think i would be content with the crumbs from your table if she challenged him officially we were all dead jeanclaude couldnt take her and neither could i distraction we needed a distraction youre wearing enough diamonds to buy your own businesses your own house she turned those glowing eyes to me and i half wished i had kept quiet do you think i live in this house because i cannot afford better i dont know she glided back to her throne and settled onto it smoothing her skirts i do not trust your human laws i will remain the secret we have always been let others walk in the spotlight i will be here when such modern thinkers are no more she suddenly slashed out with one hand jeanclaude staggered blood flew from his face splattering on his white shirt and jacket in bright crimson flecks drops of it clung to my hair and cheek she slashed again and another cut exploded on the other side of his face splashing jason with jeanclaudes blood jeanclaude stayed on his feet he never cried out he didnt touch the wounds he stood there utterly still except for the blood there was no movement to him his eyes were drowning pools of sapphire floating in a mask of blood naked muscle twitched in his cheek bone glistened at jaw and cheek it was a frighteningly deep wound but i knew he could heal it horrible as it looked it was a scare tactic i kept telling that to the pounding of my heart i wanted to go for a gun to shoot the bitch but i couldnt shoot them all i wasnt even sure janos could be shot i dont have to kill you jeanclaude hot metal in your wounds and theyll be permanent your beautiful face ravaged for all time you can still pretend to be master of the city but i will rule you will be my puppet say the word serephina jeanclaude said say it and be done with these games his voice was bland as normal as it ever was his voice gave nothing away not pain or fear or terror challenge is that the word you want to hear jeanclaude it will do his power crawled over my skin like cool fire the power lashed out suddenly i felt it sweep past me like a giant fist it slammed into serephina scattering the air currents kissa caught the edge of it and fell back from the throne thrown nearly prone among the cushions serephina threw back her head and laughed the laughter died in midmotion gone like it had never been her face was a mask with eyes of white fire her skin seemed to grow paler whiter until it was like translucent marble veins showed under her skin like lines of blue flame her power flowed through the room like rising water deeper and deeper until when she released it we would all be drowned where are your ghosts serephina i asked i thought for a second she would ignore me but that masklike face turned slowly slowly towards me where are your ghosts even though she was looking straight at me i couldnt tell if she heard it was like trying to read the face of an animal no the face of a statue there was no one home cant control bloody bones and your ghosts at the same time is that it did you have to give up one of them serephina rose to her feet and i knew she was floating rising on tiny currents of her own power to hover above the cushions she floated slowly upward towards the ceiling and it was impressive i was babbling trying to buy time but time for what what the hell could we do a voice echoed in my head crosses ma petite do not be bashful on my account i didnt argue or hesitate the cross spilled out of my shirt in a ball of light so bright it was painful i squinted and looked away only to find larrys cross behind me blazing to life jeanclaude cowered beside me hunched away arms shielding his face serephina shrieked and halffell to the floor she could stand before a cross but she couldnt do tricks in front of one she landed in a heap of silken skirts the other vamps shielded their faces hissing magnus rose from the cushions he stalked towards us jason stepped in front of jeanclaude moving to stand in front of me he glanced at me with amber eyes his beast stared at me over the glow of the cross and had no fear for a heartbeat i was glad i had silver bullets just in case serephina said no magnus not you magnus hesitated staring at jason a thin growl crawled out of jasons throat i can take him magnus said there was a sound from the open door to the basement something was coming up the stairs something heavy the stairs creaked in protest a hand came out of the darkness large enough to palm my head the fingernails were long and dirty almost clawlike ragged clothes clung to huge square shoulders the thing was at least ten feet tall it had to bend sideways to come through the door and when it stood its head brushed the ceiling and you couldnt pretend it was human anymore its huge oversized head had no skin the flesh was raw and open like a wound the veins pulsed and throbbed with blood flowing through them but it didnt bleed it opened a mouth full of broken yellow teeth and said i am here it was shocking to hear words out of that mouth that face its voice was like the sound at the bottom of a well deep and rough and lost the room suddenly seemed small rawhead and bloody bones could have reached out one long arm and touched me not good jason had moved back a step to rejoin us magnus had moved back to serephinas side he was staring at the creature as wideeyed as the rest of us had he never seen it in the flesh before come to me serephina said she held out her hands to the creature and it moved towards her surprisingly graceful it had a liquidness to its walk that was all wrong nothing that big and that ugly should move like quicksilver but it did in that movement i saw magnus and dorrie it moved like something beautiful serephina cradled its huge dirty hand in her whitegloved hands she pushed back the ragged sleeve laying the thick muscled wrist bare stop her ma petite i glanced down at jeanclaude who was still cowering before the crosses fire what if she drinks from it the crosses may not work against her i didnt question him there was no time i drew the browning and felt larry draw his gun serephina bent over the fairies wrist mouth wide fangs glistening i pulled the trigger the bullet smacked into the side of her head the force rocked her and blood dribbled down she could be shot life was good janos threw himself in front of her and it was like trying to hit superman i pulled the trigger twice staring at his deadeyed face from just over a yard he smiled at me silver bullets just werent going to do it larry had stepped around jeanclaude he was firing at pallas and bettina they kept coming kissa stayed on the floor ellie seemed frozen in the face of the crosses bloody bones stood there like it was waiting for orders or didnt give a damn it was staring at magnus like it recognized him it was not a friendly look serephinas voice came from behind janoss protective body give me your wrist the fairie gave a ragged smile soon i will be free to kill you it looked at magnus when it said it i didnt really want something the size of a small giant mad at me but i didnt want serephina to have its power either i fired into its raw head and i might as well have spit at it the shot did earn me a dirty look i have no quarrel with you the fairie said do not make one staring into its monstrous face i agreed but what could i do whatll we do larry asked hed moved to stand nearly back to back with me bettina and pallas had stopped just out of touching range held at bay by the crosses not the guns jeanclaude had gone to his knees face cradled away from the glare of the crosses but he didnt crawl away he stayed within the protective touch of that light silver bullets wouldnt hurt the fey so i hit the button on the browning and popped the clip out i fished in my pocket for the extra clip and slid it home i aimed at the things chest where i hoped the heart was and pulled bloody bones bellowed blood blossomed on its ragged clothes i knew when it felt serephina bite into its flesh power whirled through the room raising every hair on my body for a heartbeat i couldnt breathe there was too much magic in the room for something as mundane as breathing serephina rose slowly from behind janoss dark form she levitated to the ceiling bathing in the light of the crosses smiling the bullet wound in her head was healed her eyes licked white flame around her face and i knew we were going to die xavier appeared in the door to the basement he held a sword in his hands but it was heavier softeredged than any blade id ever seen he stared at serephina and smiled i have fed you bloody bones said free me serephina threw her hands skyward caressing the ceiling no she breathed never i will drink you dry and bathe in your power you promised bloody bones said she stared at him floating her eyes of fire were even with his raw face i lied she said xavier cried no he tried to come closer but the crosses kept him just out of reach i threw a handful of salt on serephina and bloody bones she laughed at me what are you doing niÑa never break your word to the fey i said it negates all bargains a sword appeared in bloody bones hands just appeared like the fey had grabbed it out of midair it was the one id seen xavier carrying at the quinlans house how many scimitars as long as my upper body could there be he stabbed it through serephinas chest spitting her in midair like a butterfly normal steel shouldnt have touched her but backed by the fairies magic it could he pinned her to the wall driving the hilt into her chest he tore the sword out of her twisting it doing as much damage as he could she shrieked and slid down leaving a bloody trail on the naked wall bloody bones turned back to the rest of us it touched fingers to its bleeding chest i will forgive you this wound because you freed me when he is dead there will be no more wounds he drove the sword into magnus the move was so quick it looked like stop action he was as fast as xavier shit magnus fell to his knees mouth wide with a scream he had no breath to make bloody bones drew the sword upward like he had with serephina and it reminded me of the wounds that the boys had had if bloody bones would help us escape serephina and company i had no problem with that but then what it drew the sword outward and magnus was still alive staring up at me he reached out to me and i could have let him die bloody bones raised the blade back for a final blow i pointed the browning at it dont move until you kill him youre mortal and bullets can kill you the fairie froze staring at me what do you want mortal you killed the boys in the woods didnt you bloody bones blinked at me they were wicked children if you get out of here will you kill more wicked children bloody bones looked at me blinked then said it is what i do what i am i fired before i could think if it moved first i was dead the bullet took it between the eyes it staggered backwards but didnt go down ma petite the crosses or i cannot help you jeanclaudes voice was a harsh whisper i slipped the cross inside my shirt a second later larry followed suit the room was suddenly darker colder with just the candlelight bloody bones raced forward and it was just a blur i fired into it and didnt know if i hit it or not the sword swung out to meet me and jeanclaude was suddenly there hanging onto the arm sending it off balance larry moved up beside me and we both fired into the feys chest it shook jeanclaude off sending him skittering into a wall larry and i stood our ground shoulder to shoulder i saw the sword coming like a blur of silver and knew i couldnt get out of the way in time xavier was suddenly in front of me the strange sword blocking bloody bones blade the steel blade stopped an inch from my face xaviers sword was notched where the steel had bit into it the strange sword shoved upward through bloody bones chest the fairie bellowed slicing at xavier but he was in too close for the fairies giant sword bloody bones collapsed to its knees xavier twisted the sword as if hunting for the heart he jerked the sword out in a wash of gore the fairie collapsed on its stomach shrieking it tried to raise itself i pressed the barrel of the browning against its skull and fired as fast as i could from pointblank range you didnt need to aim larry moved up beside me and fired we emptied the clips into it and it was still breathing xavier drove the sword through its back pinning it to the floor its chest rose and fell struggling for air i switched the firestar and changed its clip to nonsilver three shots more and as if a critical mass had been reached the head exploded in a rush of bone and blood and thicker wetter things xavier was on its back when it blew we stood there covered in bloody brains xavier drew the sword out of its back the sword came out notched dented from contact with bone we stood there by the dead giant the two of us isolated in one clear moment of understanding the swords cold iron isnt it i asked yes he said the pupils of his eyes were scarlet as a cherry not the blood color of an albino but truly red humans didnt have eyes like that youre fey i said dont be silly the fairie cant become vampires everyone knows that i stared at him and shook my head you tampered with magnuss spell you did this to him he did this to himself xavier said did you help bloody bones kill the teenagers the children or did you just give him the sword i fed him my victims when i grew tired of them i had eight shots left in the firestar maybe he saw the thought move behind my eyes neither lead nor silver bullets will harm me i am proof against both wheres jeff quinlan hes down in the basement get him i dont think so and suddenly there was sound again movement again besides us hed bespelled me and bad things had been happening while id been caught jason was coughing blood on the carpet if hed been human id have said he was dying being a lycanthrope he might live to see morning one of the vampires had hurt him badly i didnt know which one jeanclaude was lying under a pile of vampires made up of ellie kissa bettina and pallas his voice came out in a thundering yell echoing through the room it was impressive but not enough do not do it ma petite janos stood near the throne with larry theyd tied his hands behind his back with one of the cords that held the drapes a piece of cloth was shoved in his mouth janos had one pale spider hand around larrys neck serephina was propped on her throne black blood pouring out of her id never seen anyone lose so much blood so quickly her chest was torn open so wide i had a glimpse of a frantically beating heart what do you want i asked no ma petite jeanclaude struggled to move and couldnt it is a trap tell me something i dont know she wants you necromancer janos said i let that sink in for a minute why you have stolen her immortal blood from her you will take its place it wasnt immortal i said we proved that it was powerful necromancer as you are powerful she will drink you up and live what about me you will live forever anita forever i let the forever part go i knew better she will take you and kill him anyway jeanclaude said he was probably right but what could i do she let the girls go you do not know that ma petite have you seen them alive he had a point necromancer janoss voice jerked me back to him serephina lay propped on the throne beside him blood had drenched the white dress turning it black plastering it to her thin body come necromancer janos said come now or the human suffers i started forward and jeanclaude yelled no janos slashed outward with one pale spiderhand just above larrys body larrys white shirt sliced open and blood soaked it he couldnt scream with the gag but if janos hadnt held him hed have fallen drop all your weapons and come to us necromancer ma petite do not do this i beg you i have to do this jeanclaude you know that she knows that he said i looked at him struggling helplessly under three times his body weight in vampires it should have been ridiculous but it wasnt she doesnt just want you for herself she doesnt want me to have you she will take you to spite me i invited you to come play this time remember i said its my party i walked towards janos i tried not to look behind him not to see what else i was moving towards ma petite dont do this you are an acknowledged master she cannot take you by force you must consent refuse i just shook my head and kept going your weapons first necromancer janos said i laid both guns on the floor larry was shaking his head furiously he made little protesting noises he struggled failing to his knees janos had to release his grip on his neck to keep from strangling him now your knives janos said i dont do not try to lie to us here and now he had a point i put the knives on the floor my heart was hammering so hard i could barely breathe i stopped just in front of larry i stared into larrys blue eyes i pulled out the gag somebodys silk scarf dont do it god anita dont do it not for me please fresh slashes cut his shirt more blood flowed he gasped but didnt scream i looked up at serephina you said this slashing only works with an aura of power he has his own aura janos said let him go let them all go and ill do it do not do this for me ma petite im doing it for larry doesnt cost any more to throw everybody in janos glanced at serephina she was slumped to one side eyes halfclosed come to me anita let me touch your arm and they will release them all my word one master to another anita no larry struggled not to get away but to come after me janos slashed his hand through the air and the sleeve of larrys jacket flew with blood larry screamed stop it i said stop it i stalked towards him dont touch him again dont ever touch him again i spit the last words in his face staring up into his dead eyes and feeling nothing a hand brushed my arm and i jerked gasping id let anger carry me those last few steps what i was about to do scared me too much to think about it serephina had lost a glove it was her bare hand that encircled my wrist not too tight not painful in the least i stared at her hand on my arm and couldnt talk past the beating of my own heart release him she said the minute janos let him go larry tried to come to me janos gave him a casual slap that knocked him to the floor and sent him skidding back a couple of yards i stayed frozen with her hand on my arm for one awful moment i thought theyd killed him but he moaned and tried to get back up i glanced past larry and met jeanclaudes eyes hed been after me for years now here i was letting another master vamp sink her fangs into me serephina jerked me to my knees squeezing the bones of my arm so hard i thought shed broken it the pain brought me up to meet her eyes they were solid perfect brown so dark they were nearly black those eyes smiled at me gently i smelled my mothers perfume her hair spray her skin i shook my head it was a lie it was all a lie i couldnt breathe she knelt over me and when her face came forward it was my mothers thick black hair that fell against my cheek no its not real it can be as real as you want it to be niÑa i stared up into those eyes and i fell down the long black tunnel of her eyes i fell towards that tiny flame i reached towards it it would warm my flesh comfort my heart it would be all things all people everything to me distant and dreamlike i heard jeanclaude scream my name anita but it was too late her fire warmed me made me feet whole the pain was such a small price to pay the black tunnel collapsed behind me until there was nothing but the darkness and the flicker of serephinas eyes i dreamed i was very small small enough that i fit all in my mothers lap only my feet stuck off the edge of her knees when she wrapped her arms around me i was so safe so sure that nothing could ever hurt me as long as mommy was here i laid my head against her chest i could hear the beat of her heart against my ear a strong sure rhythm that pounded louder and louder against my face the sound woke me but i wasnt awake the darkness was so complete it was like being blind i lay in my mothers arms in the dark id fallen asleep in bed with her and dad her heart pounded against my ear and the rhythm was wrong mommy had a heart murmur the beat of her heart was a fraction of a second slow a hesitation then two quick thumps to catch up the heart beating against my skin was as regular as a clock i tried to raise up off her and bumped my head against something hard and firm my hands slid over the body that i was pinned to i touched a satin dress with smooth jewels sewn into it i lay there in the absolute dark and tried to roll off her i slid into the crook of her arm her naked flesh slid along my bare shoulders boneless as the dead but her heart filled the darkness even with me struggling not to touch her our bodies were molded against each other it was not a coffin built for two sweat broke out on my skin in a rush the dark was suddenly chokingly close hot i couldnt breathe i tried to roll onto my back tried to roll off her and i couldnt there wasnt room every small struggle made her boneless body move jiggling the soft loose flesh i couldnt smell my mothers perfume anymore i smelled old blood and a stale neckruffling smell that id smelled before vampires i screamed and tried to do a pushup to get some distance and the lid moved i stayed on my arms shoving my back into the satin and wood the lid slammed backwards and i was suddenly straddling her body my upper body raised in a half pushup dim light edged the lines in her face the careful makeup looked wrong like a badly madeup corpse i scrambled out of the coffin nearly falling to the floor serephinas coffin sat on the stage in the bloody bones bar and grill ellie lay curled at the base of the stage i stepped around her halfexpecting her to grab at my ankles but she did not move not even to breathe she was the newly dead and with the sun up she was truly dead serephina wasnt breathing either but her heart was pounding beating alive why for my comfort because of my touch hell i didnt know if i got out id ask jeanclaude if he was alive if she had kept her word janos lay in the middle of the floor on his back hands folded on his chest bettina and pallas were snuggled up against him one on either side a coffin lay on the floor i had no way of knowing what time of day it was i would have bet that serephina didnt have to sleep all day i was getting out of here i told her you wouldnt sleep all day the voice jerked me around magnus was behind the bar leaning his elbows on its smooth surface he was slicing a lime with a very sharplooking knife he looked at me with his greenblue eyes his long auburn hair spilled around his face he straightened up suddenly stretching his back he was wearing one of those frilly shirts that you rent for wearing with a tux the shirt was pale green and brought out the green in his eyes you scared me i said he leaped over the bar easily landing on his feet light as a cat he smiled and it wasnt a friendly smile i didnt think you scared that easy i took a step back you recovered damn fast i drank immortal blood it helps he stared at me with a heat in his eyes that i didnt like at all whats wrong with you magnus he swept his long hair to one side he pulled the collar of his shirt until the first two buttons popped spinning to the floor there was a new bite mark on the smooth skin of his neck i took another step back towards the door so what i ran my hand over my neck and found my own bite marks so weve got a matching pair so what she forbade me to drink she said youd sleep all day that shed keep you sleeping all day but i thought shed underestimated you i took another step towards the door dont anita why not but i was afraid i knew the answer serephina told me to keep you here until she wakes he looked at me and it was a sad woebegone expression just have a seat ill fix you something to eat no thanks dont run anita dont make me hurt you whos in the other coffin i asked the question seemed to surprise him he let his hair fall back over his neck the shirt gaped open over his chest i didnt remember noticing his chest this much last time or the way his hair swept over his shoulders the ointment must have worn off stop it magnus stop what glamor wont work on me glamor would be a more pleasant alternative he said whos in the coffin xavier and the boy i ran for the door he was suddenly behind me impossibly fast but id seen faster most of them just happened to be dead i didnt try to open the door i turned into his body and it surprised him he fell into a shoulder roll almost textbook perfect i tried to throw him three feet under the floor everything i had he lay stunned for a second i flung open the door the spring sunlight poured in and fell on janos and his women janoss face twisted away from the light i didnt wait to see more i ran screams followed me out into the sunlight i heard the door slam behind me but didnt look back i hit the gravel parking lot running with everything i had i heard him pounding up behind me i wasnt going to outrun him i waited until the last second stopped running and kicked him he saw it coming and dived under it taking my other leg out from under me sending us both to the ground i threw a handful of gravel at his face and he hit me in the jaw with his fist there is a frozen moment after a really good shot to the face a moment of shock of paralysis where all you can do is blink magnuss face appeared over me he didnt ask if i was alright that had been the point he picked me up and flung me over his shoulders i got a nice view of the ground about the time i was able to move again i walked my hands up his back trying to get enough leverage to swing a twohanded grip at his shoulders i let him brace my lower body but before i could try it he kicked the door open and tossed me to the floor none too gently he leaned against the door and locked it you just had to do it the hard way didnt you i got to my feet and backed away from him which took me closer to the vampires not an improvement i backed towards the bar there had to be a back door i dont know any other way magnus he took a deep breath and pushed away from the door its going to be a long day then i put a hand on the smooth wood of the bar yeah i said the halfsliced lime and the knife lay just a few inches away i stared at magnus trying very hard not to look at the knife again to not draw attention to it which isnt nearly as easy as it sounds his eyes flicked to the knife he smiled and shook his head dont do it anita i put my hands on the bar and pushed myself up on it i heard him coming but i didnt look back never look back something is always gaining on you i grabbed the knife and rolled over the bar at the same time magnuss face appeared above the bar too fast i wasnt ready all i could do was look up at him with the knife gripped in my hand if hed been just a little slower id have stabbed him in the throat or that had been the plan magnus crouched on the bar staring down at me his aquamarine eyes glittered lights and colors played in them reflecting things that were not there he stayed on the bar above me swaying slightly on the balls of his feet one hand on the bar for balance his hair had fallen forward trailing thick strands across his face he was going all feral on me like he had at the mound but this time he wasnt trying to be one of the good guys i expected him to leap down on me but he didnt of course he wasnt fighting me he was just trying to keep me from leaving i glanced at what was under the bar liquor in bottles clean glasses a tub of ice some clean towels napkins none of it looked helpful shit i got slowly to my feet back pressed to the wall as far from magnus as i could get i began to inch my way towards the side of the bar towards the door magnus paced me sidling on the bar making the awkward movement graceful he was faster than me stronger than me but i was armed the knife was good quality made for slicing food not people but a good knife is a good knife its versatile i had to force myself not to squeeze too tight on the handle to relax id get out of this i would my eyes flicked to serephinas open coffin i thought i saw her breathe magnus jumped me his body slammed into mine and i drove the knife into his stomach he grunted and his weight rode me to the floor i drove the knife in hiltdeep his fist closed over my hand and he rolled off me taking the knife with him i scrambled around the edge of the bar on all fours magnus was there yanking me to my feet by one arm blood had soaked the front of his shirt he raised the bloody knife in front of my face that hurt he said he laid the edge of the blade against the side of my throat it felt like my pulse was jumping out to meet the blade he started backing up pulling me with him where are we going i asked youll see he said i didnt like that he wouldnt tell me his feet bumped against ellies body i could glimpse serephinas coffin behind him if i rolled my eyes hard to move your head when a knifes at your throat he pulled on my arm and i didnt go i leaned back on my heels just a little aware of the knife but i was more afraid of serephina than any blade come on anita not until you tell me what were doing i spoke very carefully around the knife ellie lay motionless boneless dead at our feet magnuss blood dropped onto her empty face if it had been one of the others they might have licked the blood off even in their slumber but ellie was well and truly dead she was the newly risen empty waiting for her personality to rebuild if it ever did id seen vamps that never recovered never became close to the human being theyd once been im going to put you in the coffin and lock it until serephina wakes up no i said magnus squeezed my arm like his fingers were searching for the bone if he didnt break it it would be a hell of a bruise i didnt cry out but it was an effort i can hurt you anita in all sorts of ways just get in nothing you can do to me scares me as much as getting in that coffin again i meant it which meant unless he was really going to kill me the knife didnt work anymore i turned my head into the blade he was forced to move it away from my skin before i drove it into myself i stared at him from about a foot away and saw something in his eyes that i hadnt seen before he was afraid bloody bones died because he shared your mortality were you harder to kill before magnus no immortality to draw from is that it you are just too damn smart for your own good he said softly i smiled mortal just like the rest of us poor baby he smiled a quick baring of teeth i can still take more damage than you can dish out if you really believed that you wouldnt be putting me back in the coffin his hand moved in a blur of speed that was almost vampirequick he hit my arm and it took a handful of seconds to realize hed cut me blood welled from the cut and dripped down my arm he switched his grip from my upper arm to my wrist faster than i could take advantage of it i watched the blood drip down my arm towards my elbow it wasnt much of a cut might not even leave a scar of course on my left arm who could tell couldnt you have cut the right arm i havent got nearly as many scars on that one he made one quick slice downward and opened my right arm from my shoulder damn near to my elbow always happy to oblige a lady the slice hurt and was deeper than the first one me and my big mouth blood ran down my arm in a thin crimson line blood on my left arm trembled on my elbow and fell with a soft plop onto ellies cheek the blood slid down her skin into her mouth a tingle of magic went up my spine i held my breath i could feel it i could feet the body at our feet it was broad daylight i shouldnt have been able to raise even a zombie let alone a vampire it was impossible yet i could feel the body feel the magic i knew it was mine if i wanted it i wanted it whats wrong magnus jerked my arm bringing my eyes back to his face id been staring at the vampire hadnt meant to it was just so damn unexpected i could feel the magic just out of reach almost there but how to push it over the edge how i smiled at magnus you planning to just whittle me down until i get in the coffin i could the only way im going in that coffin is dead magnus and serephina doesnt want me dead i stepped into him he started to move back but forced himself to stand his ground our bodies were nearly pressed against each other great i ran my hand under his shirt along his bare skin magnuss eyes widened what are you up to i smiled and traced the trail of fresh blood upward to the wound i trailed the edge of the wound and he made a small sound like it had hurt i smoothed my one free hand over his skin smearing his blood across his flesh like finger paints you saw the murder scene when you touched me and still wanted to have sex with me remember he took a breath and it trembled when he let it out between his lips i drew my bloodcoated hand out from under his shirt i held it up to him let him see it his breath came just a little quicker i knelt slowly he didnt let go he didnt put down the knife but he didnt stop me i smeared the blood on ellies mouth the magic flared sparked down my skin like cool fire it crawled up my arm and onto magnus shit magnus swung the knife at me i blocked his wrist with my arm and came up under him driving up from my knees he was balanced across my shoulders but he still had the knife i flung him on top of ellie i stood over him breathing hard ellie rise the vampires eyes flew open wide magnus started to push away from her grab him i said ellie wrapped her arms around his waist and held on he stabbed her with the knife and she screamed god help me she screamed zombies didnt scream i ran for the door magnus came after me dragging ellie behind him he was moving faster than id thought he would but not fast enough i flung open the door and a long bar of sunlight spilled in through the door i was a step out the door when the screaming started i glanced back i couldnt help it ellie was on fire magnus tried to loosen her arms screaming but nothing holds on like the dead i ran out into the parking lot niÑa dont go the voice stopped me at the edge of the parking lot i looked back magnus had dragged himself out the door and onto the gravel ellie was burning white hot magnuss shirt and hair were burning i screamed go back you son of a bitch but the same voice that kept me pinned to the edge of the parking lot kept him coming out into the light the voice came again come back to bed anita youre tired you must rest i was suddenly tired so tired i felt every cut every bruise she would make it all better she would touch me with her cool hands and make it all better magnus collapsed in the middle of the driveway shrieking the vampire was melting into him burning him alive sweet jesus he reached one hand out to me he screamed help me the vampire was melting into his flesh eating it away i ran i ran with serephinas voice whispering in my ear niÑa mother misses you i flagged a car down on the highway i was covered in dried blood cut scraped bruised and still an elderly couple picked me up who says there are no more good samaritans they wanted to take me to the police and i let them the nice policemen took one look at me and asked if i needed an ambulance i said no and could they page special agent bradford and tell him it was anita blake they tried to get me to go to the hospital but there was no time it was midafternoon we had to move before dark i asked the police to send a twoman car to make sure that no one moved the coffins i told them there might be a hurt man in the parking lot and if he was still there to call an ambulance but under no circumstances go inside the place everybody nodded and agreed with me most of the cops in the area had been through serephinas house last night and today the cops told me kirkland had brought the cops back to the vampires lair after they took me it took me a second to realize that kirkland was larry which meant serephina had kept her word and let them go the relief at knowing for sure that larry was alive made me weakkneed and i was wobbly enough as it was the cops had found over a dozen bodies buried in the basement of serephinas house she should have buried them in the woods for all i knew shed raised their ghosts i didnt know it didnt matter all that mattered was that we had a warrant of execution and the cops were listening to me today they sat me in an interrogation room with a cup of black coffee thick enough to walk on and a blanket to wrap around me i was shivering and couldnt seem to stop bradford came in and sat down across from me he stared at me with eyes that were just a little too wide the locals say you found the master vampires lair i laughed and it came out wrong almost like a sob i wouldnt say i found serephinas lair more like i woke up in it i raised the coffee to my mouth and had to stop in midmotion my hands were shaking so badly i was about to slosh coffee onto the table i took a deep breath blew it out and concentrated on taking a drink of coffee just concentrated on the simple physical movement it helped i got coffee and calmer at the same time you need to go to the hospital bradford said i need serephina dead weve got warrants for all of them all the vampires involved how do you want to do it burn them out block off everything but the front door if magnus is inside hell come out magnus bouvier he asked yeah there was something about the way he said it that i didnt like the cops found whats left of him in the parking lot it looks like something melted the lower half of his body would you know anything about that he looked at me very steadily when he asked it i took another careful sip of coffee and met his eyes without blinking what was i supposed to say the vampires were controlling him he was supposed to keep me in the bar until nightfall maybe they punished him for failing what id done to magnus and ellie was enough to earn me a death sentence i wasnt admitting that to the feds the vampires punished him he made it a question yeah he looked at me for a long time then nodded and changed the subject wont the vampires try to make a break when the fire starts sunlight or fire i said just a choice of how well done you want your vampires to be i finished the last of the coffee in my cup your protege mr kirkland said you were kidnapped from the graveyard is that your story too it happens to be the truth agent bradford it was the truth as far as it went omission is a wonderful thing he smiled and shook his head you are hiding more shit from me than youre telling me i stared at him until the smile wilted around the edges truth is a mixed blessing agent bradford dont you think he stared at me for a moment then nodded maybe ms blake maybe i called the hotel and no one answered in larrys room i tried my room and got larry there there was a moment of stunned silence when he realized it was me anita oh my god oh my god are you alright where are you ill come get you im at the police station in town im alright sort of i need you to bring me some clothes to change into the ones i have on smell like vampire were going after serephina another silence when now today ill be right there larry ill bring the guns and the knives and an extra cross thanks ive never been so glad to hear anybodys voice in my entire life he said yeah i said get here soon wait larry you need something else he said are jeanclaude and jason alright yeah jasons in the hospital but hell live jeanclaudes in the bedroom asleep after serephina bit you she hit jeanclaude with some kind of power energy i felt it and it was awesome she knocked him out and left the others went with her everyone was alive or as alive as they had started out it was more than id hoped for great ill see you soon i hung up the phone and had a horrible urge to cry but i fought it off i was afraid if i started to cry i wouldnt be able to stop i couldnt have hysterics just yet as agent on site bradford was in charge special agent bradley bradford yes bradley bradford seemed to think i knew what i was doing nothing like getting almost killed to give you credentials for once badge or no badge nobody was arguing with me a refreshing change that i did not hug larry when he brought my clothes he hugged me i pushed away sooner than i wanted to because i wanted to collapse into his arms in tears to just let a pair of friendly arms hold me while i melted down later later a huge bruise had blossomed on the side of his face from jaw to midtemple it looked like hed been hit by a baseball bat he was lucky janos hadnt broken his jaw larry had brought me blue jeans a red polo shirt jogging socks my white nikes an extra cross from my suitcase the silver knives the firestar complete with inner pants holster and the browning and its shoulder holster hed forgotten a bra but hey except for that it was perfect the wrist sheaths stung going over the cuts but it felt wonderful to be armed again i didnt try to hide the guns the cops knew who i was and i wasnt fooling any of the bad guys barely two hours after id crawled out of serephinas coffin we pulled up in front of bloody bones there were ambulances and more cops than you could shake a stick at local cops state cops federal cops it was a smorgasbord of policemen a fire truck plus fire emergency services completed the official list oh larry and me with magnus dead serephina and company were unguarded not helpless oh no nothing this side of hell would have gotten me inside that building voluntarily but there were alternatives the gas truck pulled around to the back and busted out a window i watched them snake the hose into the window of the back door and turn on the juice i stood there in the warm sunlight a cool breeze playing on my skin and whispered may you rot in hell did you say something larry asked i shook my head nothing important the hose shivered to life and the sharp sweet smell of gasoline filled the air i felt her wake up i felt her eyes open wide in the dark i breathed in the sweet smell of gasoline felt my hands gripping the coffin edges i put my hands over my eyes oh god larry touched my shoulder what is it i kept my hands pressed to my face take the guns now what do it my hands came down and i looked at him i looked at his familiar face and serephina saw him too she whispered kill him i ripped the knives out of the sheaths and let them fall to the ground i started backing up towards the cops i needed people with guns around me right now the voice in my head said anita what are you doing to your mother you dont want to hurt me niÑa help mommy oh god i ran and nearly collided with bradford help me niÑa help me my hand closed on the browning i balled my hands into fists at my side bradford disarm me now please he stared at me but he took the guns from their holsters whats wrong blake cuffs you got cuffs yeah i held my hands out to him use them my voice sounded squeezed my throat so tight i couldnt breathe i smelled hypnotique perfume tasted my mothers lipstick on my mouth the cuffs snapped into place i jerked away from him stared at the handcuffs i opened my mouth to say take them off and closed it i could feel my mothers hair tickling my face i smell perfume larry said i looked at him with wide eyes i couldnt speak i couldnt move i didnt trust myself to do anything at that moment oh my god larry said youre going to feel her burn i just looked at him what can i do help me my voice was squeezed down to a whisper whats happening to her bradford asked serephinas trying to get anita to help save her the vampires awake in there he asked yes i said serephina was out of her coffin the full skirt of her ball gown brushed the edges of the door that led to the kitchen she couldnt go closer because there was a spill of daylight from the window gasoline was pouring across the floor towards her anita help mommy its a lie i said whats a lie bradford said i shook my head anita help me you dont want me to die you dont want me to die not when you can save me i collapsed to my knees cuffed hands digging into the gravel of the parking lot stop the gasoline larry knelt beside me why it was a good question serephina had a good answer jeff quinlan is in there hes inside shit larry said he looked up at bradford we cant torch the place theres a kid inside stop the gas bradford said he walked away from us towards the truck motioning them off and i felt a surge of triumph from serephina it was a lie xavier had brought jeff over last night there was nothing alive in that building i gripped larrys arm with my cuffed hands larry its a lie shes lying to me through me get me in the back of a squad car now and torch the place he stared at me but if jeff dont argue with me just do it i screamed it burying my face between my arms trying to ignore the voice in my head i could taste hypnotique on my tongue it was too much serephina was scared larry called bradford back and they halfcarried me to a marked car i started to struggle when they tried to shove me in the back but i did my best not to fight and they closed the door i was in a metal and glass cage i gripped my fingers through the mesh in front of me digging it into my skin until it hurt but even pain didnt help the gasoline was everywhere soaking into everything serephina was choking on it niÑa dont do this dont hurt your mommy dont lose me again i started rocking back and forth hands digging into the wire back and forth back and forth itd be over soon itd be over soon i felt a gentle touch on my face a memory so real it made me turn and look for someone my death will be as real anita somebody lit it the flames roared to life and i screamed before they hit her i slammed my cuffed hands against the glass and screamed nooo heat washed over her crumbled the cloth of her dress like a melting flower and ate her flesh i pounded my hands against the glass until i couldnt feel them anymore i had to help her i had to go to her i fell to my back and kicked the window i kicked it and kicked it feeling the shock all the way up my back i screamed and kicked the glass and it cracked the glass cracked and fell outward she was screaming my name anita anita i was halfway out the window before somebody tried to grab me i let them grab my arm but pushed my legs free of the window i had to get to her nothing else mattered nothing i fell to the ground with someone holding my arm i got halfway up and threw them in a shoulder roll onto the ground i ran for the fire i could feel the heat now rippling along my skin i could feel the heat inside eating us alive someone tackled me and i beat at them with my hands made into one fist the hands let go and i scrambled to my feet shouting and someone else holding me he lifted me off the ground arms wrapped around my waist pinning my arms i kicked backwards and hit his knees the arms loosened but there were more arms more hands someone lay on top of me a hand the size of my head pressed the side of my face against the rocks hands pinned my hands against the rocks his full body weight on just my wrists someone was sitting on my legs niÑa niÑa i screamed with her i screamed while i choked on the smell of burning hair and hypnotique bath powder i saw the needle coming in from the side and started to cry no no mommy mommy the needle sank home and darkness swallowed the world a darkness that smelled like burning flesh and tasted like lipstick and blood i spent a few days in the hospital bruises cuts some stitches but mainly the seconddegree burns on my back and arms the burns werent that bad there wouldnt be any scarring the doctors just couldnt figure out how id gotten burned i didnt feel like explaining mainly because i wasnt sure i could jason had broken ribs a punctured lung and other internal damage he healed perfectly and in record time there are benefits to being a lycanthrope jeanclaude healed his face was once again that perfection that had attracted serephina to him so long ago stirlings company rebought the land from dorcas bouvier and made her wealthy with bloody bones dead she can leave the land shes free the quinlans are still suing me bert has lawyers that promise to keep us out of court though im not sure how if id walked the house personally checked every inch of it myself maybe hell even i might not have protected the doggie door maybe i do deserve to be sued i told the quinlans ellie was dead they had to take my word for it there wasnt anything left of ellie to prove it when vampires burn they burn no dental records no nothing jeff was well and truly dead too both their children were lost to them it had to be somebodys fault why not mine id raised a vampire like a zombie which wasnt possible necromancers were supposed to be able to control all types of undead but that was legend not real right serephina is dead but the nightmares live on the nightmares are tangled with the real memories of my mothers death they are a bitch for the first time in my life im having insomnia what to do with the two men in my life how the hell do i know in richards arms breathing in the warmth of his body is the closest ive ever found to my mothers arms it isnt the same because i know that though richard would give his life for me even that might not be enough when i was a child i believed it would be there is no real safety innocence lost can never be regained but sometimes with richard i want to believe in it again there is nothing comforting about jeanclaudes arms he doesnt make me feet safe in the least hes like some forbidden pleasure that you know eventually youll regret ive decided not to wait im regretting it now but im still seeing him somehow jeanclaude has crossed that line that a handful of other vampires have crossed i dont think of him as a monster anymore god have mercy on my soul
