s j a turney dark empress prologue if in her later years asima described to someone the town where she grew up which of course she wouldnt she would have been spoiled for adjectives mdahz was the last imperial town before the pelasian border and as such shared more of the characteristics of their swarthy mysterious people than of the great culture of the empire it was a border garrison a mercantile port trading post and caravanserai it smelled of spice and of sweat of work animals and of sweet meats of the sea and of the desert it was a meeting of every world and a clash of mouth and eyewatering noises sights and aromas it was a maze of narrow streets and alleys the ramshackle adobe houses often kept from toppling outwards by the heavy wooden struts that were jammed from side to side above head height throughout most of the town to ward off the worst heat of the day and the periodic cloying sandstorms from the south the people hung rugs over the beams turning the alleyways into stygian tunnels and creating a labyrinth with the exception of the main thoroughfare that ran from the port to the bab ashra the desert gate the only part of mdahz that felt open and fresh was the palace compound forbidden to all bar nobles dignitaries and the military a small and welltended garden surrounded by elegant balconied residences the compound presented a solid wall free of windows to the outside shunning the dirty smelly noisy town that teemed with life the whole town sloped downwards from the desert to the sea and it was said that a man could walk the streets of mdahz for a week without finding a road free of steps it wasnt true of course but such streets were indeed rare and every town has to have its little foibles after all the town was selfstyled as the southern bastion of the empire though in truth as much pelasian or desert nomad blood pumped in the veins of its people as that of the empire and as for bastion well the town had its walls along with three grand gates but the walls had long been abandoned as a defensive perimeter and more often served as the rear wall of a house than a barrier to potential attackers in fact for almost a third of their length the walls were now buried deep inside the town itself invisible without requesting entrance to peoples houses space was at a premium in mdahz everything clustered together as close to the centre as possible like a pile of broken pots as the people tried to distance themselves from the outskirts where the dust piled up at the foot of walls and the sand had to be swept daily from the streets there was certainly no park or garden no green space no fields or orchards but then everything the people needed came from trade dates and fruit and meat brought by caravan from the oases inland or grains and meats by ship from pelasia and the great imperial cities people who visited asked merchants how anyone could live in the conditions they encountered at mdahz but then the merchants would arch their eyebrow and ask in a concerned voice how anyone could consider living anywhere else mdahz was dirty noisy smelly at constant risk of sandstorm barren and dry but mdahz was life in its rawest form asima would never speak of these things or how she began as the daughter of a humble seller of animal feeds before her rise to courtesan concubine and finally empress part one childhoods end in which journeys are started they were seven years old when asima first began to notice a change in the way the boys looked at her it was not the lust desire or hunger she would so often encounter later in life but rather an indefinable need to be near her and to seek out her attention and approval she would find in the coming days that she enjoyed their attention but on that first day it surprised her particularly given the strange timing that exhibited a subtle shift in the attitude of both boys apparently independently it was a summer afternoon in mdahz though only a local would have noticed much difference between the seasons in this arid searing land the heat was already unbearable to most folk and only children slaves and the dutybound were in evidence beneath the fiery orb of the sun the noise of the town was muffled as it rose from the stifled and shady alleyways beneath their coverings of rugs and blankets a distant gong announced the call to temple for the faithful of the pelasian divinity but the subsequent clangs were lost among the noise of a town where life continued apace beneath the shady covers asima turned to samir shading her eyes from the worst of the glare the smaller of the two boys samir held the attention of girls older than he there was something about that face the way his mouth turned up slightly at the corners as though he wore a permanent knowing smile there was a delightful if wicked twinkle in his eye at all times and his bronzed skin and short straight black hair were smooth neat and perfectly complemented his fine oval face his clothes for some reason looked stylish and carefully chosen despite the fact that asima knew that they were little more than rags handmedowns from distant friends of his mother washed so many times they had lost all shape and colour and yet something about the way he wore them made them look princely samir smiled and winked as he dropped into a crouched position his muscles bunched and his tendons twanging asima nodded and turned to her other side ghassan was already is position as he turned to smile at her samirs brother was while officially a twin nothing like his smaller sibling this was good according to the traditions of the desert people from whom the boys paternal line had sprung twins who were too similar were bad luck bad magic it was not unknown for the nomads to leave children to die in the sands because of their tragic similarity but ghassan was different for sure already a head taller ghassan had a slight curl to his hair and some parts of it jutted out in random directions no matter how much their mother flattened brushed waxed or washed it parts of ghassans hair were untameable his skin was marked from an illness as a baby and yet the marks did not make him ugly or ruin his appearance somehow the imperfections added to the rugged power of his appearance and lent him a gravity he would otherwise have lacked where samirs mouth turned up to a smile ghassans was straight and flat his expression serious he was handsome in a way that appealed to some of the girls of mdahz and mothers nodded sagely as they foresaw an eminently marriageable boy there and yet somehow while ghassans clothes were almost identical to samirs on the taller boy they hung like badly sewn bags asima almost laughed as she nodded and faced forward dropping to a crouch herself the girl was already pretty and was coming to realise it even at this young age she had perfect skin with a creamy texture that required surprisingly little upkeep though her father chided her anyway for the amount of time she spent primping her almond eyes were beautiful dark and warm her lips a perfect bow her hair was long and carefully combed and pinned back never cut more than a shaping trim as was the tradition of the pelasians for asima had pelasian blood on her mothers side the only fault that marred her appearance in any way was her fingernails her mother before she had passed last winter had disciplined her repeatedly for the damage she was doing biting her nails down to the quick though it had never stopped her she was dressed in a manner that would cause her fathers heart to skip a beat in just a white cotton vest and knee length trousers of the same thin material her feet bare and her sparse jewellery removed and lying on the pile of more acceptable clothing by her feet she had jested time and again with the boys that her father would marry their mother one day and so she could never kiss them since they would end up being her brothers but it was friendly banter and they all knew it while the boys mother was a handsome woman still in the bloom of late youth she was poor almost to the point of slavery eking out a living as a washer woman for the mercantile classes indeed it was at their mothers work where asima had met the boys her father being a factor for a pelasian trader of fruit and having paid their mother a little extra to keep his daughter busy while he sorted problems with deliveries her father was far from a rich man but his business kept him well enough that asima really should not have been socialising with the likes of samir and ghassan but in that timeless fashion the universe over such boundaries of class meant nothing to the children and forbidding them to play together merely drove them closer and closer for the last year the three had become inseparable and even their parents had thrown their hands in the air in defeat and allowed the friends to continue their association albeit restricted to times that neither adult was in sight and so here they were the boys mother worked her fingers raw in the cleaning vats beneath the blanket roof of the cloth market despite the heat of the day while asimas father busy as always met with the captain of a ship newly arrived from germalla across the sea to the north and the three unsupervised children go as asima shouted the three figures crouched and tense on the flat roof of the copperware shop in the street of a hundred martyrs raced off across the dusty and hot surface their bare feet hardened to the extreme heat radiating from the roof each week the route of the race changed chosen by a different competitor the three making sure that each of them had a fair say though it was becoming clear that samir was playing with them in designing his routes the last two occasions that samir had laid out the plan both his companions had drawn a worried and surprised breath at some of his decisions the first jump was simple across the three roofs to the next street the street of the northern dunes northern dunes was a narrow alley and the carpet covering was only four feet below the rooftops here as a safety net ghassan was first over his long and powerful legs giving him the thrust needed to easily clear the gap coming down with a light thud and hardly breaking his pace before he sped up and was off again toward the tower of the pelasian temple asima was next across her small frame light and lithe she landed awkwardly and stumbled for a moment but was quickly up and off again behind her she heard the telltale thud and rumble of samir landing and smoothly rolling to his feet once more without a halt in pace across the rooftops they ran gradually increasing in altitude as per samirs route the temple tower passed by on their right as they leapt across the nine sisters stairway one of the few jumps with no carpet safety net and one of very few places on their run that could conceivably cause serious injury by now samir was at her heel like a terrier while ghassan maintained a short but convincing lead asima was trying to picture the path ahead to identify any place where she could use her intimate knowledge of the town to gain the lead where would she was so surprised when ghassan lost his footing and tumbled to a heap on the flat roof that she almost fell over him leaping into the air at the last moment and performing a graceful manoeuvre as she skipped twice and then used her new momentum to clear the next street she laughed as she landed on the other side and turned to see her lead over samir had widened and that ghassan having pulled himself to his feet was now clearly at the rear of the group turning her attention back to the terrain ahead she drew a deep breath she was in the lead now and had to maintain her advantage she had only won two races this year and they had both been on routes she herself had set to maintain face she had to win one of samirs routes asima could hear the laboured breathing of the smaller brother close behind her so close biting the inside of her cheek she ducked sharply to the right around the upper storey of the templehospital of belapraxis with its roof herb garden full of plants with bittersweet smells and healing properties it was oh so tempting to stop for a moment in the blessed shade cast by the extra level of plaster wall but there was too much at stake today asima slowed as she neared the edge of the roof between this wall of the hospital and the grocers at the other side of the street a single beam ran across carrying the water pipe that fed the hospital from a cistern at the highest point of the town with the increased altitude of the buildings here the carpet ceiling was a good fifteen feet below and the fall would hurt even if she landed well a bad landing on one of the supporting struts would be crippling if not deadly really samirs routes were getting crazy taking a deep breath and offering up her prayers to the four gods whose names leapt easily to mind she stepped out onto the beam and began to slowly inch across placing her bare feet close in front of each other almost half way across she paused and dipped her feet in the open section of water channel to clean and cool them samir was close enough behind her she could hear him breathing tightly as he traversed the beam there was no sound from further back than that biting her cheek once more she risked turning her head to gauge her pursuit samir was perhaps twelve feet behind her his short legs went against him in a straight run but his catlike grace and reflexes allowed him to pick up the pace in places like this of ghassan there was no sign where had he gone surely he had not been so slow that they had lost him she swallowed nervously the alternative was unpleasant had he fallen at one of the jumps if so then dear gods please let it be a good fall at one of the places where the carpets were close there was no time to worry now samir was closing turning carefully she set off once more her cool feet refreshed her grip would have been lessened by the slippery wet were it not for the interminable dust that settled on every surface of mdahz and gave her good purchase on the wood she concentrated hard staying ahead of samir was important but so was making it across safely finally after what seemed like an age she reached the hot white roof of jamals grocery store and stretched gratefully for only a second before setting off at a run on the last leg of the route up over a low dividing wall past another roof garden and a quick though awkwardlyangled jump across the alley of the coppersmiths a quick s shape between the locked stairway entrances of three buildings and then a sharp corner next to a long drop curse samir for his insane routes one more flat roof brought the last jump a wide but straight leap across the stairway of sidi mdekh she smiled there was no way samir could catch her now she was home free she began to laugh wildly as she rounded the last corner to see the pole with the red rag that marked the end of the race and her face fell ghassan grinned back at her where he stood casually holding the rag and leaning against the wall in the cool shade how had he done that she racked her brains to try and work out where he had gone how had he taken a short cut it was theoretically a cheat but there could have been no quicker way to get back up to the roof if he had fallen than the route they had both taken how she demanded ghassans smile all the more genuine for its rarity held her for a moment as he bowed and proffered the red rag to her i would turn the world upside down to see your face from this angle asima she blinked for a moment and then smiled as ghassan burst out laughing you should have seen your face when you turned the corner and found me he howled she shook her head as samir arrived and patted her on the back no i dont know how he does it either its that brain of his the three children collapsed to the floor in the shade and scanned the rooftops at this one of the highest places in mdahz the pelasian bell tower was just visible around the edge of the building as were various turrets and high rooftops but the main obstruction on the skyline here was the palace compound and it was the looming and intriguing walls of that forbidden complex that captured the gaze of the three runners one day both asima and ghassan turned to look at their companion samir shrugged weve been almost everywhere there is to go above the town but weve never set foot in the compound before the summers out i want to walk on the governors roof asima and ghassan nodded sagely each privately considering the almost negligible chances of that ever happening but there was something in samirs eye that afternoon in the high places of mdahz something that made asima certain that nothing in the world of human endeavour was beyond samirs reach if he put his mind to it nothing in which changes occur a year had passed the rooftop chases had tailed off in the late wintertime though not due to the conditions after all in mdahz the deepest winter was almost indistinguishable from high summer to all but the natives no somehow the thrill had gone without them ever having set foot on the governors roof as samir had vowed oh they still ran occasionally perhaps once a month now and it was always samir who set the routes these days but when the joy of the rooftops had palled a little the three had sought out new thrills games had come and gone as the seasons turned and had culminated in this their latest test of nerves the port district of mdahz was a maze of warehouses offices palisaded yards harbours dry docks houses and taverns every open space seemed to be filled with people busily striding around with papers boxes and sacks local merchants on business errands factors visiting ship captains dockers loading and unloading vessels and filling and emptying warehouses and of course there were the fascinating visitors few of the foreigners that landed at the port made it into the depths of the city staying close to their ships and cargoes and to the drinking pits that entertained them among the busy and narrow thoroughfares where ropes coiled around bollards and crates lay in abandoned unruly piles asima samir and ghassan picked their way carefully repeatedly ducking back and dodging the unheeding feet of sailors and slaves the boys dressed in the clothing of peasants would be entirely unnoticed in the streets under normal circumstances but asima wore a shabby cloak over her good cotton clothes and had removed her jewellery once again so as not to stand out ahead lay the warehouse complex of master trevistus owner of four merchant galleys native of the imperial capital and probably the richest man to currently walk the streets of mdahz asima swallowed nervously as the three of them ducked once more into the shadowy recesses of an unknown building out of the press of sweaty workers this may be stupid samir the lithe young man turned and grinned at her your definition of stupid is a little looser than mine getting caught would be stupid ghassan smiled enigmatically she might be right brother this is a powerful man one slip and we could be watching our hands as theyre separated from our arms samir shook his head firstly were too good to be caught secondly no one can hold on to me for long im part eel you know that thirdly were children this man is a family man from the northern cities and theyre all soft and sentimental a sob or two from asima and hell send us on our way with a smile ghassan looked distinctly unconvinced but shrugged and then nodded asima rolled her eyes and finally gave her consent the three took a deep breath and slipped back into the busy street a few more minutes and the high walls of trevistus compound loomed samir had thoroughly checked out the location yesterday within the enclosure stood four structures one at each corner leaving an open space in the centre that cluttered and emptied with goods and equipment like the tide closest to the single wide and strong gate stood the two storey building with an external staircase that held the offices of the merchant his factor and the various clerks in his employ on the other side of the gate stood the bunk house that catered for the crew of the merchants ships when in port a building busy at all times barring mid evening when the men caroused in the local taverns in the opposite corner stood the wealthy and elegant house of trevistus himself lived in for only a few weeks each year and maintained the rest of the time by a permanent staff of servants and slaves the final corner the object of samirs main investigation was dominated by an enormous warehouse ducking into a narrow side alley the three crossed to the next street from where the gateway of the compound was visible guarded by mercenaries of foreign extraction powerful and blond samir waved his companions back into the shadow of a porch projecting from the front of a smelly building called the laughing mermaid any time now the others nodded and watched with growing nervousness and excitement in roughly equal quantities tense moments passed as workers and slaves traipsed past along the road carrying goods or going about their various tasks none interested enough to accord the three peasant children more than a passing glance somewhere a horn sounded announcing the arrival of another vessel at this meeting place of worlds samir tapped his foot impatiently and looked up at the sky trying to gauge the time by the angle of the sunlight hitting the building opposite were here on time they must be late ghassan beginning to twitch slightly pursed his lips and frowned i cannot help but wonder how you came across detailed transport schedules for foreign merchants asima shrugged be sure theres some clerk somewhere wondering where his important papers are ghassan she turned and smiled knowingly at the smaller brother you are a menace samir and possibly a genius samir grinned and put a finger to his lips gesturing over his shoulder with a thumb in the street four wagons loaded to a point where the wood groaned uncomfortably trundled past with interminable slowness each drawn by an ox with a stoically resigned expression remember quiet until were left alone take only one thing and nothing that will be missed this is a game a test not a theft ghassan nodded and pointed the third wagon no guards just a driver samir smiled and stepped backwards into the street hidden from view of the general populace by the wagon itself gripping the side boards he hauled himself with ease from the murk of the road and tipped over the edge into the mass of grain sacks ghassan shared a look for a fleeting moment with asima hes going to get us all killed one day she said with mock seriousness ghassan glanced past her at the cart and quick as a flash and with no warning tipped his head forward and kissed her a brief peck in the manner of a nervous child and then he was past her hauling himself up into the cart asima stood in the shadow for a moment her eyes wide as she reached up in surprise and touched her lips the world slowed as her mind reeled sssss snapping her head round in the mist of confusion asima saw the brothers peeking over the side of the wagon and beckoning as the vehicle had almost rolled on past the tavern shaking her head to clear it she ducked out of the shadows and leapt onto the side of the cart a hand appeared to help haul her up she gazed upward into ghassans eyes and taking a deep breath clasped her hand in his suddenly samir was there also helping haul her in among the sacks of grain just as the cart passed from the buildings shadow and into the clear view of the public once more asima lay in the sacks mulling over what had just happened above her apparently unaware of what this meant both boys peered between the boards to see ahead asima touched her lips again she found herself smiling without the intention of doing so somehow she had been waiting for a year for this to happen and yet had been completely unaware of her yearning until it had occurred she looked up at ghassan unkempt and powerful his noble brow and serious face intent on the task ahead and then samir turned and unleashed a smile upon her and her surety exploded in splinters and vanished she frowned as the boy turned back to his contemplation of the compound that rolled toward them with its looming danger shaking her head she gritted her teeth no time for this now she chided herself and clambered across the sacks to a position beside the boys the front cart was being led inside while a clerk went through some papers with the driver of the second vehicle at a gesture from samir the three children nestled down among the comfortable bags covering themselves as best they could minutes passed as they lay there staring up into the endless blue while the noises of the port went on around them and slowly finally the cart trundled forward the three held their breath as the clerk approached stopping only a few feet from them as he checked the manifest and clearances with the teamster such a short time passed and yet to the three of them it seemed an age of man had gone by finally an agreement was made and the cart trundled slowly into the compound as samir had explained drawing on information from his unknown source the four carts would be drawn into the central space not far from the warehouse where there was sufficient space for unloading with the minimal distance to the place of storage the teamsters their job done for now were given a chitty and escorted from the compound where they would visit the nearest tavern while they waited for their carts to be emptied with a quick glance samir checked the compound over the top board someone presumably an overseer had gathered the workmen near the lead cart and was speaking to them in quiet tones the teamsters were departing while the labourers instructions were given and the halfdozen guards at the gate bored beyond tears watched the few women pass by in the street outside with halfinterest at best with a grin samir beckoned to the others and clambered over the side of the cart dropping lightly to the ground and running toward the warehouse its great wide open doors welcoming him ghassan and asima followed suit their hearts racing as they slipped from the cart across the open space unobserved and into the shadow of the warehouse the three ducked around the inside of the doorway and stood with their back to the wooden walls drawing a deep and relieved breath as they scanned the interior what now ghassan whispered theyll be here in minutes to unload samir shook his head we have at least ten minutes they unload the carts onto small trailers and then wheel them in here its a complex business but weve plenty of time to find something and slip out besides he added with a smile it looks like theyve got some sort of trouble that man outside is keeping the workers busy youve still not explained how we leave here ghassan sighed samir grinned and pointed to the ladders that reached into the darkened upper corners of the warehouse where they hooked onto the walkways from the top level we can slip onto the roof from there were the right height to cross the outer wall and drop into the alley thats a long drop samir winked not where i put the crates ready to drop onto it isnt asima smiled samir always claimed to be the quick one while ghassan had the familys brains to her acute eye however it was clear that the brothers shared every talent in equal amounts for all their differences they were every bit the match for one another samir wandered along the wall among the crates peering into occasional ones while trying to decide what trophy was most fitting with which to make off with a shrug ghassan followed suit while asima remained standing by the doors there was more to think about today than mere trophies with a sigh she picked up a small amphora of olive oil that would do her heart skipped a beat as a man strode into the warehouse mere feet away from where she lurked she had been so absorbed in their task shed not heard him approach besides there should be no one coming here yet silently holding her breath she dropped down behind the crates cradling her amphora like a newborn as she vanished from sight she noted with relief that the boys had already disappeared behind obstructions they must have sharper hearing than her the man was tall taller even that the nomads of the south though he was clearly a man from across the sea to the north unusually large and imposing he was dressed in dark leathers and a black shirt with a finelycrafted chainmail shirt over the top a curved sword hung at his belt high and angled across him in the manner of a pelasian he had unremarkable brown hair short and straight and a neat beard covering a suntanned jaw he walked as though he owned the world upon which he trod though he was clearly no merchant with bated breath she watched as a second man entered this person was more than a head shorter and with blond hair dressed in fine clothes and unarmed gripped at his elbows by two unsavourylooking men with pelasian features and drawn blades asima bit her lip as the warehouse doors were closed ominously behind them by an unseen hand the party of four men stopped in an open area of the warehouse and the rich man was dropped unceremoniously to the floor trevistus the tall man said shaking his head with mock sadness what am i to do with you the smaller man coughed and asima was shocked to see blood trickle from his mouth flowing through a gap afforded by two missing teeth i can pay you handsomely kaja the man replied his gapped teeth whistling unpleasantly theres no need for this antagonism im a man with connections the tall man kaja as he had been named shook his head you used your connections to set a bounty on me a large and very ostentatious bounty things like that can ruin a mans day you have piles of money but then money doesnt buy me peace of mind or heal my reputation now does it trevistus the merchant his panicked eyes darting back and forth stammered asima shrank down fearing that somehow the desperate man would see her through the crates but wh what can i do ive sent a message cancelling the bounty i am a man of means you were a man of means trevistus the merchants eyes widened and he assumed the bravado of the cornered man you cant do this kaja i have friends on isera in the government itself my factor lives in the palace he knows minister sarios even the emperor the tall man smiled a horrible feral smile emperor quintus has enough on his plate at the moment i hear his generals are now in open rebellion the empires collapsing in on itself my dear trevistus and the time has come for men like us men of independent means and supreme selfinterest well for men like me at least goodbye my unfortunate friend asima closed her eyes as a brief whimper gave way to a gasp and was silenced with a slicing noise there was the dull thud of a padded weight falling to the floor she couldnt believe what she had just heard and offered thanks to every god that might be listening that she at least had not seen what just happened she almost shrieked as something touched her elbow snapping her head round in panic her eyes met those of samir who was gesturing urgently for her to follow him beyond him ghassan nodded sharply the lightstepping journey around the periphery of the warehouse hidden by crated goods was tense and slow and the three heaved a sigh of relief that by the time they reached the nearest ladder and prepared to climb the warehouse doors had opened and the occupants had left with their grisly burden a gloomy silence accompanied the children on their unnoticed escape in which relationships are forged the next winter would turn the boys world upside down asima had spent less time with the brothers since the incident at the warehouse and when they had seen her she wore a haunted look her eyes had darkened as though she slept little and she had become taciturn on the few occasions she had visited she looked uncharacteristically frail and frightened and had taken to sitting wrapped in ghassans arms samir had pondered on this for a while but had finally nodded and accepted that perhaps asima currently needed ghassans sober strength more than his own optimistic humour then late one evening as their mother was preparing the main meal and the boys sat alone in the communal room there was a knock at the door knowing that their mother would be too busy to answer and that she would become angry if she had to ask them ghassan and samir rushed to the front of the house where the illfitting wooden portal kept the worst of the weather out a visitor was an exciting prospect asima rarely came to the house and would certainly never knock at the front door where her arrival would be noted by their mother as the door swung open the brothers looked up into the weathered face of a tall man dark hued and imposing he wore the travelling garb of a desert nomad a bag slung over his shoulder he was otherwise unburdened before either boy could speak the man smiled his teeth surprisingly straight white and neat the effect against his dark face was unsettling to say the least but the smile seemed genuine you boys have grown beyond measure and expectation his voice was rich and deep with a touch of humour and warmth the boys stared and there was a crash from the kitchen as their dinner hit the floor in its earthenware pot shards scattered across the tiles samir and ghassan were still looking up in silent confusion a moment later when their mother came running across the common room and jerked to a halt breathing heavily behind them faraj the mans grin merely widened as he now stepped back to take in the three of them at the same time ghassan tugged at his mothers belt who is faraj he was rewarded with a brusque cuff around his ear as their mother stared at the man various expressions pulling at her face the visitor opened his arms and spread them wide in an almost placatory gesture whereas you my dear nadia remain unchanged by the oh seven years since we last met while ghassan irritably rubbed his stinging ear and glared furtively at his mother samir was paying closer attention to the visitor his sharp eyes had already picked out three details that had led him to form his own conclusions uncle faraj he hazarded ghassans head snapped round and he stared at his smaller brother samir smiled as the visitor raised an eyebrow in surprise you look a little like father did he explained and youre a nomad with a barelyconcealed sword on your back and youve not seen mother for seven years yet she dropped dinner at the mere sound of your voice faraj laughed and turned back to their mother hes sharp this one samir risked a glance at his mother but she was too busy staring at her brotherinlaw to care about disciplining the boys now shaking her head she gestured to invite their guest inside as she rushed to make the cushioned seating area as comfortable as possible the big man shuffled inside ducking his head at the threshold dropping his bag to one side and unslinging the sword from his back he winked at samir and patted ghassan on the head as he stretched the boys looked at one another shrugged and closed the door before rushing over to join the adults as they reached the communal seating area their mother pointed to the kitchen dinner is made but the rice will have to be washed thoroughly if it can be saved go to it and serve on four plates and then you may join us the boys nodded unhappily and as they hurried off toward the kitchen their mother called after them there is a bottle of date wine i have been saving fetch it and two mugs ghassan rushed about collecting the bottle and mugs while samir gathered the fallen rice bowl the container had smashed into three sizeable pieces but much of the rice with its rich herbs and spices had been contained within the surviving arcs and along with the spare that was being saved for the next day there would be enough for four dinners the boys went about their tasks in desperate silence as they listened in on the conversation from the other room you once said i was always welcome their mother drew a deep breath and i meant that faraj but you should have come before when your brother passed you should have come some time to see the boys they were babes the last time you were here you have been gone so long and with no word i didnt even know you were alive there was a brief uncomfortable silence you are right nadia my absence and lack of communication has been inexcusable i have been fighting along the pelasian borders in the southern desert near the shana oasis the pelasian satrap of the area has been encroaching on imperial lands and we have defended as best we could he sighed but that has now changed again there was a silence changed how why are you here faraj the desert soldier shook his head sadly seen from behind by the boys as they toiled in the kitchen to finish the dinner preparations the limitani are to be disbanded the governor will not continue our contract we have been told that payment for all limitani from the capital has stopped payment for almost everything from the capital has stopped they say velutio and isera are in chaos that the emperor is at odds with his court and his generals and that we are a stones throw away from collapse there was a brief nervous laugh from their mother people say such things we have heard tales before many times this is different faraj objected the empire has abandoned us to our fate on the border even now the more ambitious satraps are crossing the border and claiming parcels of imperial land and we are not there to stop them and so i have turned to the city i must find employment the boys fascinated began to ferry the dishes of food into the other room trying to be unobtrusive while taking in everything they could you will not return to the nomadic life their mother asked faraj shook his head it is too dangerous now the satraps are looking for cheap conquests in their own bids for power only in the deepest desert would we be safe or here where imperial power still holds sway i will hire myself out in mdahz in whatever manner i can he smiled sadly i do not wish to burden you unnecessarily however i would ask to stay here until i am employed and have a little money then i can either find my own accommodation or pay upkeep towards yours and stay as the boys brought in the final dish and sat crosslegged on cushions opposite the two adults their mother shook her head i will not hear of it faraj you will stay here like the family you are it will be good to have your company and the boys will prosper with a mans influence she flicked a look at the two boys that made them turn their attention studiously to the food bowls in their lap the brothers were well aware of the freedoms their mothers busy schedule afforded them and of the chance that the arrival of their unknown uncle would curb the more excessive of their activities i thank you my sister faraj beamed you are generous as ever he reached forward to pour the wine and as he did so caught and held the eyes of the twins while continuing to address their mother the boys must miss their father terribly i will do my best to fill that gap ghassans heart almost burst as he saw the wicked little secret smile their uncle flashed at them as he winked before straightening his face and turning away with the wine samir and ghassan listened halfheartedly to the rest of the conversation while sharing looks and unspoken thoughts the meal progressed in quiet and polite tranquillity while their mother and uncle passed on every snippet of news they could think of and relived tales and events that predated the boys they waited patiently once they had finished until their mother noticed them and waved them casually away without interrupting her flow samir and ghassan rushed up the narrow stair case and into the small room that they shared with its single rickety cupboard and two sleeping pallets covered with blankets as soon as they closed the door samir turned to his brother and spoke excitedly under his breath hes a swordsman ghassan a soldier he can teach us to use a blade he grinned at his brother but realised that ghassan had hardly heard him and was staring over his shoulder turning he saw asima sitting in the darkness of their room wrapped in a blanket against the night chill that blew in through the window from the wide desert samir rolled his eyes as his brother walked over to the bed sat against the wall and wrapped his arms around their guest samir his own mind racing through the days to come imagining lessons in swordplay and uncle faraj taking them to exciting places and buying them treats sat across from the pair and pulled up his own blanket against the breeze he must have nodded off for he woke with a start shivering as he tightened his blanket outside the town had gone quiet just the distant ring of a bell or shout of a drunken reveller breaking the silence the only other noise was the sound of quiet conversation floating up the stairs from the room below squinting into the darkness he glanced across at the other bed ghassan was fast asleep still slumped against the wall and with his arms protectively around asima who hunched beneath a blanket gripping his wrist lightly but her eyes were open and they were fixed on samir he blinked in surprise the smaller brother always lauded his twins intelligence but he knew with unashamed certainty deep in his soul that while ghassan had a logical and retentive brain and would learn fast and easily samir was brighter he would never remember a poem parrotfashion like ghassan but his mind bridged gaps solved puzzles and connected dots with lightning speed and he suddenly knew just from one quick glance at asima that the girl may be seeking comfort from the strong brother but her heart was already racing toward him a problem to be solved another day he closed his eyes and within moments he was dreaming once more of swinging a curved sword and standing on the ramparts of mdahz defying the pelasian warlords as they swarmed below him some say that dreams can hold portents glimpses of the world to come samir dreamed of many things that night the last night the three would sit easily together in which things are learned for better or for worse the spring morning was glorious it held that perfect blend the sun shone bright in a deep blue sky and though that was far from unusual in mdahz the wind had turned northeasterly and was carrying a slightly salty but fresh and cooling breeze across the town and into the heartland of the desert the meeting of scorching sun and cooling breeze was a welcome relief to the people and a note of positivity hung over the population as they went about their daily tasks the breeze was particularly strong up here on the tower of iron eagles one of the more intact of the derelict turrets on the disused defensive walls of the town the timber roof of the tower groaned under the load but faraj had assured the boys it was strong enough to take their combined weight several times over samir squinted into the sun as he glanced along the line of the defences he had dreamed more than once now of standing on these walls and fighting a heroic defence of mdahz fanciful of course from where he stood the walls disappeared among the buildings of the city after the next two towers where they had been used as the supporting walls of shops and houses in the other direction the defences had entirely vanished after this point leaving a long stretch of open land the clearing of a throat brought him back from his reveries he turned to see uncle faraj watching him with a raised eyebrow while ghassan swept his wooden sword back and forth in practice swings over the late winter and early spring faraj had quickly become an integral part of family life the boys had almost forgotten what it had been like to have a father around but everything had come flooding back with a welcome familiarity the brothers had been as well behaved as possible for their uncle reining in their more excessive habits in return faraj had been thoughtful and kind and had begun taking the boys with him to interesting places and when the occasion presented itself buying them sherbet treats and fresh dates but this was new and heartstoppingly exciting it was what samir had been hoping for since that winter night when their uncle had first arrived it had taken only a few days after his arrival for faraj to secure a position as a mercantile bodyguard with reasonable pay and good working hours and as the boys had watched him over the months they had realised why faraj had experienced no difficulty in finding worthy employment one evening as they had been returning from the late market a slightly inebriated cutpurse had dashed out from an alley and attempted to rob them at knifepoint by the time the boys had realised what was happening it was already over faraj had the man pinned to the wall by the neck with the flat of his sword still in its sheath and attached to his belt he had been that quick samir believed that it was this incident when the boys would have been in grave danger without their uncle present that had led eventually to the exsoldiers decision to teach them the rudiments of sword fighting samir threw out his arm and shook it freeing his muscles as much as possible the wooden sword felt exceedingly heavy to him but was excellently made had faraj had a carpenter produce them or had he carved them himself noting the glint of excitement in ghassans otherwise sombre face he stepped forward and hefted the sword this is so heavy if i swing it i shall fall over uncle faraj laughed then you will have to learn balance quickly the sword is heavy yes heavier than a real blade that size what you have there is a replica imperial short sword at oneandonethird weight bear in mind that the curved desert sword on my back weighs more than twice that but youre right you will find that the real imperial blade is much lighter and easier to handle ghassan frowned then why practise with these their uncle smiled because you are lithe but not strong either of you quick and supple but without bulk to hold your own in a real fight you will also need power and using this heavy sword will build your muscles more than that when i finally deem you ready for a real blade you will find them so easy to use after the training sword that you will already have an extra edge samir nodded it made sense he stepped forward once more and now the brothers faced one another across a short space faraj nodded very well you are not armoured and these swords will hurt if swung with enough force they will break a limb so we are going to start light and slow there will be no contact until i say that you are ready he stepped between them and held out a long and sturdy stick swing your blades down and hit that with some difficulty samir lifted the heavy sword having to employ both hands as it neared head height with some relief he let it drop ghassan managed with one hand his larger frame lending him extra strength but the sweat on his brown told of the strain he was hiding neither blade connected with the stick as they fell this may take some time faraj laughed the sun rose slowly to its zenith and was already beginning its descent when the boys uncle allowed them to rest for more than a minutes breather samir sat on the low wall at the towers edge his arm ached more than he had believed possible and though faraj had made sure they had regular draughts of water he found himself salivating at the thought of the water melon that he knew waited at home ghassan was beginning to sag initially his large build had lent him an advantage but their uncle was no fool and had pressed the bulkier brother to reach higher and swing faster thus placing a roughly equal exertion on both boys the man smiled as he watched the two boys faces while they ate their bread and nowwarm cheese and drank their tepid water as would a man who had just crawled out of the deep parched desert he stood leaning on his long stick as he watched them in such a short time he had grown very close to his brothers family and had occasionally to remind himself that these were not his own sons not that it made a jot of difference to how he treated them he was firm when necessary but generous and kind when the opportunity presented itself swordtraining though was a time for firmness not kindness once the boys had finished and were leaning back on the stonework breathing heavily he cleared his throat now my boys time to start the real work both brothers made an exasperated face and shared a look that they hoped faraj would not see come on i have here padded leathers now i only have jackets and gloves no helmets or leg guards and it will be extremely warm work under all that extra clothing but youll need it as the boys staggered wearily to their feet and hefted their wooden blades as well as their screaming muscles could manage faraj dropped a heavy padded leather jacket in front of them both you need to be careful here your mother does not know that i am doing this and she would most certainly disapprove if i have to take either of you home with a staved skull or a broken leg we shall never get to do this again the boys blinked and their uncle laughed i do not mean to worry you boys the jackets are strong and the swords are blunt so long as you keep your aim between neck and waist we shall all be fine he smiled as samir and ghassan wearily hauled the heavy padded leathers onto their backs and fed their arms through the stiff sleeves before tying the thongs and donning the gloves very well their uncle nodded we shall begin this by proving it doesnt hurt i want each of you to take a swing at the others arm only the arm mind no leg or head blows gingerly samir pulled back his blade and swung landing a light blow with a thud that shook ghassan a little ghassan grinned and returned the swing as they smiled the brothers turned to look at their uncle faraj had one eyebrow raised and looked distinctly unimpressed hardly a real fight is it now swing again but this time put a little effort into it samir nodded and smiled at ghassan ready ghassan laughed hit me brother samir pulled back and swung again this time the blow hit with a heavy thud that knocked his brother to one side ghassan laughed and swung back before he had even righted himself the return blow threw the smaller boy aside the two burst out laughing and allowed their swords to tip downwards faraj sighed i recognise that this is exciting for you but i must remind you that it is not a game you are holding back because you are brothers and while i understand that you need to throw yourself into this if you are serious about learning samir shrugged we are doing our best uncle faraj tapped a finger to his lips i do not think that this is true i want you both to try keep your blows in the torso region but swing as though your brother is trying to kill you imagine that is not ghassan before you but some pelasian soldier intent on rape pillage and murder there was a brief silence as the boys glared at each other and then ghassan pulled a face and both burst into hysterical laughter faraj sighed i am sorry about this boys but if you are going to learn anything more than fancy posturing you need to be willing to strike at each other as though it was your deepest hearts desire to kill him on the spot and to do that were going to have to stop you kidding around the boys slowly recovered from their laughing fits and straightened trying to hold a serious expression on their faces faraj shook his head i need you to concentrate on something that irritates you about each other there must be something you argue over a toy a piece of clothing the boys shook their heads but as their faces came up again ghassan saw something in samirs eyes something dark something worrying there is nothing we argue over is there samir the smaller brother shook his head no brother nothing but ghassan could not tear his gaze from those eyes something had cast a shadow over samirs soul moments ago and ghassan for the first time in his life began to fear his brother there was something in samirs gaze that he couldnt quite define and he would shun any attempt to name it the two continued to lock eyes for a minute and ghassan was forced to turn away from that look uncle faraj unaware of quite what had transpired between them nodded thoughtfully good now that you have finished giggling like a pair of school girls we will try once again he turned to ghassan you first swing at samir as though your life depended on it ghassan hefted the sword as samir stepped slightly closer he darent meet his brothers gaze swinging the sword back he let it go with as powerful a swing as he could really justify looking up and meeting samirs gaze only as the heavy blade closed on its target the result was a loud thud that knocked the smaller boy from his feet taking a deep breath he reached out and proffered his hand to help samir up the smaller brother shook his head and looked up at ghassan whose face was a mask of concern close to panic samir sighed and looked back down at the sandy timber beneath him ghassan was his brother they were family and asima could do as she pleased but samir would never again consider what he had just now contemplated in the darkest recess of his mind he smiled at ghassan the warmest smile he could manage and almost laughed out loud at the relief that flooded his brothers face is that all you can manage id have knocked you to the next tower in fact i believe i will do just that in a moment he grasped ghassans hand and hauled himself to his feet my turn lumbering brother he grinned at ghassan and the taller boy smiled back uncertainly despite the jovial face and voice there was still something lurking beneath the surface of samir that unnerved his brother uncle faraj ghassan propped his wooden sword against the low wall im not feeling very well do you think we could call an end to today the weathered warrior raised an eyebrow perhaps it would be better to begin again on a morning when it is cooler the afternoon heat is rather intense let us return to the house and see what your mother plans for supper the boys helped faraj gather the equipment and their uncle forced most of it into a huge bag that he slung across his back with a last check that they had forgotten nothing he set off toward the stair well at the corner of the tower samir hurried along behind carrying the wooden swords neither of them was aware of the appraising look ghassan cast at his brothers back while he hauled the food bags onto his shoulders and set off behind them something had passed between them on the tower top that day and although he knew beyond doubt what had been at the root of it he could not bring himself to ponder too deeply on the matter suffice it to say that while he loved his brother beyond almost all else eight years of trust had wafted away in the light breeze this afternoon in which the world is seen to turn the past three months had wrought huge changes both physical and emotional in the brothers and no one had noticed the differences more than asima she had begun to spend more time with them again these days and passed many hours sitting in the shelter of their small room while her father intent on some business errand or other merrily presumed her to be in her room reading and playing she lay on the floor on a thick blanket her head cradled on samirs crossed ankles the smaller brother had changed the most the physical training and exercise that their uncle was putting them through had bulked samir out where he had been small and reedlike now his muscles rippled beneath his shirt sleeves he could lift asima from the floor by one hand without breaking a sweat he was toned and at the peak of his physical fitness if rooftop chases had still held any interest for the three of them asima was sure that samir would be unreachable but the greater change was in the boy himself something had changed in samirs soul it was as though a candle in his heart had been snuffed oh he was still a loving and charming person and many candles still burned within him but occasionally when caught off guard she could see the effect of that one light that had vanished there was a shadow that haunted him sometimes to begin with she had feared this change in samir and recoiled deeper than ever into ghassans arms but then one evening when she had seen samir alone she had seen that darkness cloud his eyes and on an impulse she had clutched him and held him so tight that she felt him gasp as she looked up she saw those shadows melt away and a light stronger than ever shone from within those sparkling eyes and that was it she knew now that only she could heal whatever had broken inside samir they never spoke of it but when he needed her she made sure she was always there she looked across at ghassan who sat smiling at them and she was sure his smile was false the larger brother had become powerful indeed they were approaching ten years of age now but ghassan was already a physical match for most of the men of mdahz indeed he was already taller than some of the foreign merchants from the north and yet his impressive physique was tempered now with a gentleness and humility he often deferred to samir when choices were made and seemed at times almost to be in awe of his brother strange changes indeed but there had been changes in asima too ghassan had held everything she needed still did there was nothing she could look for in a boy that she would not find in ghassan and yet the darkness within samir fascinated and pulled at her and she found herself more often in samirs arms that those of the taller brother these days and ghassan must recognise that it must sadden him and yet he said nothing and merely watched them both with a fraternal smile it was a warm evening and the breeze had died down just before dusk leaving a cloying stillness that hung in the air as though the world held its breath the faintest streaks of pink and azure hung in the west as the sun journeyed to the underworld for the night where it would be renewed by the hammer and forge of the fire god soon the boys would be called down for their evening meal once faraj had returned from his duties and asima really should go although recently the boys mother had become aware of her evening visits and while raising the occasional meaningful eyebrow at her had kept remarkably silent on the subject so she would probably wait here while dinner was prepared and as was now often the case nadia would set out the meals and then call to the girl she knew was lurking upstairs she would have automatically set a spare place for asima with the extra income faraj brought into the household they now ate well and could afford a little generosity and her own father was so busy trying to keep his business afloat in what he kept referring to as the turbulent climate that he often forgot to feed them and they had to rely on a late supper of salad and cold meat faraj would be weary but pleasant he always finished late as there was ever much to do in the port district he she blinked as she heard the door open faraj was early nadia children their uncles voice held an ominous tone that made asima sit up she had been around the family often enough to know that children meant the three of them and that faraj presumed she was there had he meant the brothers he would have said boys ghassan and samir began to move clearly they also had recognised something in the mans tone the three children hurried down the stairs asima keeping to the rear to find faraj having hung his sword and bag by the door seated with crossed legs by the low table bowls and plates had been laid out in preparation but the food was far from ready by this time the boys mother had appeared from the kitchen and padded quietly over to sit at the table gesturing the children to join them what is it faraj their mother raised the question it would have been impolite for one of the children to do so their uncles brow was low and troubled and his eyes were dark he reached for the date wine in the centre of the table and poured himself a long draught from which he took a pull before speaking i am not sure where to begin faraj many rumours are flying around mdahz and you will hear all of them within the next day but i have the grains of truth at the centre of the rumours i have confirmed this from several solid sources and the news is not good there was a silence around the table as everyone waited impatiently and you will like my decision even less than my news samir and ghassan shuffled in their seat something leaden had settled in the pit of their stomachs they waited what seemed an eternity for their uncle to take another swig and then continue the empire we serve and that shelters us has broken word arrived today at the port directly from the capital the emperor is dead general caerdin has revolted and burned the palace to the ground general avitus has named him traitor and declared martial law in the capitol the army is in chaos the family and their visitor stared in astonishment at faraj as they listened to his tidings of course he went on this was all days ago probably more than a week it takes that long to sail from velutio to mdahz and for those of us on the empires periphery things become bleaker still he took another swig the imperial navy has been recalled to the capitol without them ships are prey to both pirates and pelasian raiders and so on the dawn tide when the last imperial warship in mdahz sails north all the imperial merchants sail with her they will not risk staying this close to the border without protection the garrison of mdahz had been recalled to calphoris by the southern marshal the town is now defenceless and there is no protection for merchants by land or by sea you know what that means all of them nodded sombrely with no protection and so close to both pelasian lands and pirate waters merchants would stop using mdahz as their marketplace the desert caravans would dry up and the port would languish emptily all trade would stop and the town would die samir shrugged uncomfortably there are two possibilities then a good and a bad faraj nodded in the best future the crisis in the capital will be resolved a new emperor will be crowned the navy will be redeployed and everything will return to normal that is possible but it relies on many things beyond our reach and our control he took a deep breath alternatively pelasia will take advantage of the situation and annexe as much land as possible mdahz will then be the first to go but at least it will survive as a pelasian town rather than vanishing under the sands again silence reigned and his audience dropped their eyes to the floor ghassan looked up worriedly at his uncle his lip quivering slightly as he spoke and what is your decision uncle faraj shook his head sadly the wealthy will flee mdahz probably to calphoris many of the poor will go too but where they have homes and jobs here they will become beggars there we cannot flee or we will lose the little we have and so we must fight to preserve what we can as soon as the sun rises i go to the port to join the militia their mother shook her head the militia are like thugs they are barely paid and poorly trained and mannered they are little more than a dog running alongside the imperial garrison faraj shook his own head in return and slapped the flat of his palm on the table no more from the morning the militia are the only army and navy mdahz has all of those bodyguards exlimitani and pensioned soldiers in the town are joining tomorrow we have to change the militia we have to make it a force capable of holding off both pelasia and the pirates until the empire can heal its wounds and breathe life back into the port and markets of the town there is nothing else it is decided tomorrow i leave with the militia we will be active by both land and sea and likely always busy but i shall return as often as the gods grant me the opportunity to see my family the boys were both crying now and despite her familial distance and the likelihood that her father could easily shift his business interests to calphoris asima found that she was weeping openly for what would happen to faraj and the brothers their uncle straightened i must do this though i will be torn from this household i must go in order to protect it so that there is still a house to return to when everything recovers brushing back the tears ghassan was the first to straighten and nod bravely we are too young to join you uncle i realise that but you have trained us well and we will continue to learn and practice in your absence and if the trouble persists until we are a little older and the militia will accept us then we will come to stand by you faraj glanced at their mothers horrified face and her open mouth and quickly cut her off before she could speak this will be over long before then so make no unnecessary promises i am pleased that you are both strong quick and bright and can take care of yourselves and your mother and even young asima here if she requires it survive and stay out of danger so that we can be together again when the next emperor sends his forces to save us samir nodded we will uncle silence fell over the room once again and was finally broken when their mother addressed the children in a small and cracked voice will you go to your room and leave me with faraj for a time i will call you when i have prepared the dinner nodding unhappily asima and the two boys untangled themselves and plodded slowly up the stairs to their room once inside they could hear the inevitable explosion of tears and wailing from below before the door shut samir turned and looked at the others you know what this means asima nodded my father will move out in a matter of days and we will head to calphoris if we ever see each other again it will be when this is all over and my father returns if he even does that i fear that we only ever stayed in mdahz because the place reminds him of my mother she dropped to her knees on one of the blankets i cant leave mdahz i dont want to live anywhere else i dont want to move and i dont want to leave you she wasnt entirely sure at whom that last was aimed but the brothers both nodded sagely samir was the first to break the silence that followed as he sat next to her and took her hand whatever happens is uncertain only the gods know what lays ahead not us but the three of us are bound by bonds stronger than any empire and i tell you now that we will be together for many years to come suddenly ghassan was sat at the far side holding her other hand samir is right we have braved injury and even death many times together and we are here now stronger than ever if you go to calphoris then we will just have to come and find you when the time is right asima snuffled gently she had begun to cry and was trying desperately to hold back the tears and despite everything that had just happened a world shattered into chaos a future cast to the winds and a loved one to be ripped away from them something deep inside her that she was not sure she liked felt a solid satisfaction that both boys were clinging to her as though their life depended on her in which the field is levelled the past two days had been chaos in mdahz the military garrison had pulled out with no ceremony merely collecting everything of value from their barracks in the palace compound hauling it onto their backs and setting off along the dusty road east to calphoris that was the day after the news broke like a wildfire across the town that same day the imperial navy abandoned anything that did not belong on board their ships hauled anchor and sailed north accompanied by every merchant who had managed to liquidise his assets in time the town was already beginning to collapse the militia had been called to the palace where the local governor was on the verge of panic the man had been sent by the imperial government many years ago and though subordinate to the provincial governor at calphoris had sole control and responsibility for mdahz its port military all local settlements trading stations and border patrol units when he had arrived as an eager young politician it had been a dream appointment for a pasty northern youth now as a middleaged and slightly portly gentleman the position had suddenly become a disaster with vast responsibility for the lives of many innocents and no power or hope the governor had given the militia their orders with a note of sadness he had spent hours during the night trying to allocate the meagre resources he was left with to control the trade routes the town and the pelasian border and had been left with an inescapable truth he barely had enough men to control mdahz itself the militia were to abandon the border the desert roads and any outlying settlements split into two groups one unit would begin to restore the city defences tearing down houses to clear the walls of obstructions and building makeshift barricades where the lines of defence had long gone the other unit would commandeer the six vessels that belonged to absent foreign merchants and that remained in port and form a navy to protect those few who still had mercantile interests here mdahz lived on trade and if they could secure safe sea routes to the port they could perhaps entice some of the other traders to return then and only then could they turn to protecting and building the desert trade links once more it was an ambitious plan and almost certainly doomed to failure faraj had been assigned to the navy and had embarked on a ship named the pride of serfium heading out to his new career with a sad wave at the children standing at the port with their mother jostled by the crowds of desperate folk seeking a safe way out of mdahz already the markets were empty and many doors and windows hung open the buildings abandoned as the inhabitants fled the perilous border region for the relative safety of the provincial capital of calphoris in just two days the life had left mdahz asima hammered on the door of her fathers study there had been a great deal of crashing and thumping half an hour ago and then the house had slid into an ominous silence father it had taken some time for asima to pluck up the courage to knock her father was a serious man disapproving of his child when she spoke out of place but now she was worried father are you alright her heart beating fast the young girl leaned close to the door and placed her ear by the lock the key was in the door at the other side she could perhaps push the key out but there was no gap at the bottom of the door so that would hardly achieve anything she could hear no noise from within just the background sounds of the town coming in through the rooms only window sounds of despair and desperation but gradually as she listened she could pick out other sounds faint sounds from within father snuffles and wheezes her father was crying crying and scribbling desperately on paper at his table father please let me in im frightened there was a long pause true silence now and finally the sound of a chair scraping back quiet slow footsteps and then the turning of the key asima stood back expectantly but the footsteps retreated once more and there was a further scraping of chair legs on the flagged floor the girl stood for a moment at the top of the stairs uncertain of what to do and then finally took a deep breath chewed on the inside of her cheek and reached out for the door turning the handle slowly and swinging the door open as quietly as she could the scene within was a chaos that echoed the state of the town outside the window had they not been on the third floor in a locked room asima would have assumed that a brawl had broken out in her fathers study he sat at the table opposite with his back to her shaking slightly and occupying the only surviving chair the other two were among the splintered and fragmented furniture scattered across the floor amid the general mess her father had clearly spent some time destroying his study father gingerly she approached stepping carefully between the debris a bulky man her father sat hunched over something on the table he made no effort to acknowledge her presence and once more asimas heart skipped a beat slowly but with a determined gait she stepped to one side and reaching the end of the table stood quietly the man looked up sharply and asimas heart threatened to break her father had never been a man given to open displays of emotion and even less so since her mother had died but the last time she had seen grief like this assail the quiet man was on that day when her mother had been bound in linen placed in a casket and buried feetdownwards in the pelasian manner in the cemetery of mdahz father what is it please talk to me when the man spoke he voice was hoarse and cracked his shaky hands gripping the edge of the table hard enough to whiten the knuckles asima my dearest darling girl the light of my life and the song in my soul you are your mother in all things and it breaks my heart to see it father asima i just dont know how to tell you this how to explain the young girl bit her lip nervously whatever it is father we can get by you know that we are strong you are strong my love he sighed and leaned back in his chair his fingers detaching themselves from the table and sliding away the pen and the ledger over which he had been hunched asima i have nothing we have nothing i do not understand father my business asima my business is as a factor for a pelasian trader but i have received word that with the withdrawal of imperial support the market in mdahz has collapsed and my esteemed colleague will no longer trade across the border he has no further use for me i had other interests with imperial traders but they have now fled across the sea to the north taking their business with them asima shook her head but father you have stores of goods still in mdahz your wares will keep us until you can find new sources the tiredlooking man shook his head sadly i believed so but the boat i have a part interest in has been commandeered by the militia with no recompense the traders at the oasis that owe me small monies will not venture close enough to the town to see me and my store of fruit and perishables that is still worth a small fortune has been looted and devoured by the mob of waifs and strays at the port there are no guards there to protect such interests now i have been through all of my logs for import and export i have nothing my dear only what is in this house we have no more than those people who stole my food we cannot leave mdahz i cannot pay passage anywhere and we have nowhere to go asima stood stoically her jaw set firm and folded her arms you are seeing only disaster father but remember this we are both alive and healthy we have a good house and clothes you have possessions that are beyond the means of many that we may be able to sell given enough time and investigation you still have a solid reputation and the future is not set in stone who apart from the gods knows what lies around the corner in a few days a new emperor could appear and bring peace and prosperity once more to mdahz her father stared at her such insolent words went against everything he had taught her and yet it was sense it was also precisely what her mother would have said to him had she still lived without a word he reached across and wrapped asima in a bear hug that almost crushed the wind from her you are brave my little jewel asima laughed i was not looking forward to calphoris anyway father the boys there are said to be pigs he pulled his head back for a moment and stared at her in surprise then suddenly in a burst of unexpected and rare emotion he burst into raucous laughter as he laughed he rocked back and forth still gripping her tightly slowly the mirth subsided and he released her and sat back in his chair very well my dear i can see that in recent months while i have been chasing gold coronas with open hands my little girl has grown wise and strong where i have failed alone we shall now succeed together if we are to make a go and survive in mdahz we will have to work hard and i shall need you asima nodded thoughtfully do you trust me father for a moment the mans brow furrowed as though he failed to understand the question finally he nodded and smiled i have always trusted you asima enough to allow you to make your own entertainment around the town without my supervision but now for certain i trust you more than ever my girl what have you in mind asima gave an enigmatic smile it is time to work out what we have an inventory of everything her father nodded i shall do so he raised an eyebrow at his daughter i too have my sources she replied still with that enigmatic smile she turned and left her father in his study while she ran down the stairs and out into the street padding through empty alleyways and down numerous flights of steps she made her way to the house of nadia and her boys as was her custom she approached the house from a rear street climbed a ramp to a second tier of buildings and sidled along a ledge formed by illplanned housing until she finally reached the window of samir and ghassans room the boys were sitting on one of the beds throwing small darts carved from cedar wood into a cork board they looked up at the noise from the window and smiled asima we thought you would be packing we were going to come and see you after dark the girl grinned you were worried that i would sneak away to calphoris without saying goodbye to the boys i love she ignore both the looks the boys gave her at those words and the small wicked feeling of satisfaction they elicited from deep within her smiling she took a deep breath i shall not be leaving mdahz father and i are to stay here ghassan blinked but your fathers business samir grasped his wrist has failed hasnt it asima she nodded of course clever samir would be a step ahead as always the smaller brother nodded thoughtfully looters or the military she shrugged a mix of them both unfortunately along with some bad luck she straightened and folded her arms however i look at this as not so much an end as a beginning where there is chaos and desperation there is always an opportunity father still has some resources and inventory what we need to do is build on that to find a market for the things we have left but father only knows of finance and trade whereas you and i know mdahz the real mdahz not the one that rich traders know i know that between the three of us we can turn a small store into a large profit ghassan smiled so you need our help youll have it of course samir nodded emphatically but asima shook her head smiling my father will not understand such a thing but employees he understands i am here on his behalf to offer you a job the three of us will work for father she sighed of course at the moment he cannot afford to pay you you would have to wait until we are successful for a wage but i truly believe we can do this samir shook his head i have no need of your fathers money you both need it more than us their friend gave a short light laugh thats not exactly true is it samir since your uncle left most of the money has gone once again from this house come now accept the deal ghassan nodded and proffered his hand samir following suit you speak a lot of sense asima what is the first step then we need to go and visit father he is drawing up a full inventory of what we have once that is complete we will go out into mdahz and find buyers for everything samir grinned we shall crack mdahz like an oyster and collect the pearl from inside in which tidings are brought the town of mdahz languished hopelessly for the next few months eking out an existence from the few desert traders desperate enough to sell their wares that they would brave coming this close to the troubled border and from the occasional calphorian merchant willing to face the possibility of pirates and pelasian patrols for the high prices they could charge in the region it was far from a comfortable life but it was a life when all was said and done after an initially hopeful start when the seaborne section of the militia impounded two vessels and brought the navys strength up to eight ships they soon encountered violent resistance from both pirates and a few pelasian vessels that felt confident there would be no reprisals now after four months of campaigning the militia had achieved a few small victories but were back down to a strength of four vessels and were beginning to lose heart the defences of the town had been bolstered by the land militia the new walls were poor and badlyconstructed when compared to the heavy fortifications from the height of imperial power but they enclosed the nervous population and were wellpatrolled by armed militia mdahz endures the people said it was the only positive thing anyone could really find to say these days and so the people said it often asima and her two partners stood on the jetty waiting for the fleet of small twoman fishing boats to return the flotilla speckled the water near the horizon and would reach the dock in ten or fifteen minutes at which point the three children would fill the baskets in their cart with fish and take them back to the secure warehouse the past four months had seen an almost spectacular revival of her fathers trading interests after a slow start business had picked up rapidly for them and asima had even talked of employing others though had finally decided that the business should be kept between them the girl was shrewd and with the addition of samir and ghassans quick minds her father was astounded at how rapidly his stores replenished and his coffers refilled samir and ghassan as the months went by were repeatedly taken aback by just how vicious and cutthroat asima was capable of being in business deals she showed no sign of sympathy or compromise in her dealings despite the fact that the people they were trading with were often old acquaintances of her father and most were in a similar financial state to themselves desperately trying to survive in the impoverished town still it was samir and ghassans knowledge of the city and their intuitive ideas combined with asimas strength and wily approach to business that had turned her fathers meagre surviving assets into a going concern once more they may not like having to be hard on people with whom they sympathised but it was doing so that was pushing them into a more comfortable position themselves and tonight their fish stock would go into storage so that tomorrow it could be distributed among the market traders and fill the everhungry bellies of mdahz samir frowned and held his hand to his brow shading his eyes from the late afternoon sun something was wrong ghassan hmm his brother turned from the warehouse wall at which he had been idly staring counting the bricks ghassan his brother repeated look at the flotilla what do you see ghassan they had discovered had the sharpest eyes of the three of them and was probably the most observant he had spotted the bad dates they had been about to purchase last week and a month ago had spotted a pirate vessel on the horizon in plenty of time to get word to the calphorian captain with whom they had been dealing to bring his boat back in to dock ghassan peered out into the bright light trying to make out the many small shapes amid the glittering sparkling waves muttering under his breath finally he removed his hand from his brow and shrugged twenty eight small fishing boats all very heavily laden bodes well for us brother samir shook his head tensely im not so sure ghassan twenty eight you say and youre sure i could count them again but there are twenty eight why are some missing samirs jaw hardened quite the opposite there are only twenty three fishing boats in mdahz ghassan blinked i know these things samir shrugged i pay attention he turned to find asima who was standing a few feet away from them by their cart involved in yet more dealings with one of the dock workers i think we may have trouble he called to her asima waved away the worker and joined samir who explained the discrepancy as ghassan once more shaded his eyes and stared out across the water definitely twenty eight and heavily laden there must be so much fish he bit his lip as he scanned across the boats once more they were far too heavily laden the flotilla was getting closer now and more detail was visible twenty eight boats but not twenty eight fishing boats samir had been right twenty three fishing boats for sure and five lifeboats ghassan suddenly found that his heart was racing he knew what was weighing the boats down now even before he could confirm it with his eyes he turned to the smaller brother his mouth dry samir theyre lifeboats samir stood still and silent as his eyes drifted from ghassan and back to the bay where they slid across the open water to the collection of small vessels rowing their way to land rowing their way to safety ghassan turned his own gaze back to the flotilla and nodded wordlessly as he confirmed with horror what he already knew to be true the boats were devoid of fish the men of mdahz rowed for land but their cargo lay in bloody soaked heaps among the ribs of the vessels not all were corpses though most were clearly beyond hope a few of the men rowing were bloodied and wet but alive and making for home militia all men of the militia of mdahz and as they came closer and closer to the docks every face was bleak and hopeless samirs own mouth was now dry as he stared out among them asima was between the boys now her hands on their shoulders in a gesture of strength and support it could have been any of the militia ships she said hopefully samir shook his head unable to speak in more than a low croak ghassan reached across and squeezed his brothers wrist before turning to asima and shaking his own head each of the militia ships carries only two lifeboats that was all that could be drummed up he turned back to the fleet that were now jostling and manoeuvring into position by the jetties five lifeboats means at least three of the four ships asima fell silent once again not trusting herself to speak any further quietly and unhappily the men from the boats climbed onto the jetties and went about the sad and grisly business of finding carts to transfer their bloody cargo from the boats the brothers watched with bated breath their eyes playing across the crowd of sailors looking for the man they somehow already knew would not be there as the last figure shuffled up the wooden walkway samir collapsed backwards onto a sack of grain awaiting removal silently he sat there staring at the chaos as ghassan hurried down the jetty and began to examine all the bodies piled in the boats asima gripped samirs hand she didnt know what to say but the chances were not good she watched and realised she was biting her cheek once again a habit she had been trying to kick recently she had realised that many of her little habits were signs of weakness or insecurity and as the main negotiator for her fathers business she could no longer afford such girlish tendencies she continued to watch clutching the silent samir while ghassan ran from boat to boat stopping the men as they carried their ghastly cargo from the dock to the carts and checking each body finally he stopped and shuffled slowly back towards them hes not there brother samir sagged a little more but asima straightened purposefully well thats good then faraj may be alive his ship may be intact ghassan shook his head sadly the insignia theyre wearing are from all four ships no one escaped if uncle faraj is not there his voice cracked and tailed off he sat with a heavy thump next to his brother if hes not there then he either drowned or hes been captured he took a deep breath and given what the pirates are said to do to their prisoners best to hope that he drowned asima stared at the taller of he two brothers but realised that samir was nodding sadly pirates the three of them turned at the sudden rude interruption a militiaman bleeding profusely from a cut above the eye and with a damaged arm tucked limply into his belt stopped on his way to a cart pirates you say ghassan nodded uncertainly and the man shook his head no pirates lad this was pelasia asima blinked but they wouldnt dare even with the army gone calphoris is only a day distant with the governors forces the man laughed a hollow and unhappy laugh calphoris will be looking to its own defence now theyll not sally forth to protect a thirdrate little crossroads like mdahz the man sighed pelasia comes my dear pelasia comes now and there is no one to stop them the satraps have made their opening move and destroyed our ships best get indoors and stay as quiet as possible and hope the invasion is quick and painless with a last sad look at the three children the militiaman shambled off among his peers while their small exchange had occurred one of the men must have announced the news as roars of distress and groans of despair went up among the civilians among the docks and as the three of them sat on the grain sacks the world exploded around them people ran in panic this way and that rushing to find their loved ones and either hide within the houses of the town or flee and hope they would make calphoris before the satraps of pelasia could catch them ghassan nodded sadly as he watched the people rush in a mindless panic and turned to samir will the rest of the militia fight do you think brother samir nodded they are men like our uncle can you imagine faraj rolling over and showing his belly to the pelasians he sighed no they will fight he swallowed sadly and they will die ghassan shrugged and we will fight and die with them as samir nodded asima turned to them a shocked expression on her face what the two boys merely shook their heads sadly but youre ten years old she barked the militia will send you home samir sighed asima when the pelasians come it will make no difference we can fight as well as any man in the militia now faraj trained us well and we have to try for you and your father for mother but youll die ghassan nodded sadly once again but samir turned to look at her i have been dreaming of this for a long time i had always assumed it would be glorious and we would be the victors but that seems unlikely now and yet many times in my mind i have stood on the walls and watched the pelasians come it no longer frightens me he grasped ghassans wrist let the pelasians come in which mdahz changes the last twenty four hours had been frantic for most folk at samirs estimate a third of the towns population had left through the east gate for calphoris the road between the two places must be thronging with refugees a few of the hardier folk had found weapons and joined the remains of the militia where they gathered at the great market to plan the next step the commander of the mdahz militia was a man named cronus a mercenary from the northern lands who had settled in the town over a decade ago he had proved to be a strong and intelligent commander and had as soon as the militia had mustered gone to see the towns governor only to find that the palace compounds gate had been shut and barred no amount of cajoling had drawn a response from within the governor had withdrawn in solitude the militia were on their own and so cronus had found himself and his men in sole charge of the defence of mdahz no questions had been asked of anyone who joined them and no one regardless of age or ability had been turned away by the time the sun had set last night every body the militia could muster had been given a position on a wall or tower or in one of the makeshift temporary redoubts in the port no one returned home now should it be days waiting the men of mdahz would wait in place on the walls huddled in blankets against the cold desert night and sweating through the heat of the day but the wait would not be long outlying scouts had returned around dawn to report a pelasian army on the move and already in imperial lands the desperate and wildeyed rider had reported a veritable sea of blackswathed bodies on the move and when the commander had asked how many the army numbered the scout had merely replied all of them and gathered his own gear to flee the town there had been a few desertions during the night in fact from their current position the boys could see gaps that had opened in the line of defence even now some of the men on the defensive circuit glanced wistfully over their shoulder at the dubious safety of the narrow streets it seemed curiously fitting that the brothers found themselves stationed with five other men on the very tower where uncle faraj had begun their sword training those months ago now though as they glanced left and right the wall was clear of obstructions and where there had been open land before there was now a new gate and a hastilyconstructed wall all with their own guards do you think their navy will attack the port at the same time samir shrugged at his brothers question who knows theyd be stupid not to but thats if they have a navy i heard cronus talking about them there are three satraps around the border area but only one of them rules coastal land so what were facing depends on who it is thats coming it might be one satrap or two or possibly all three he sighed the one thing the commander said is that this must have been started without the consent of the pelasian crown apparently their godking is an ally of the emperor was an ally the taller brother corrected there is no emperor now as they say in the gambling pits at the port all bets are off the boys fell silent indeed no man on the walls spoke in the eerie and oppressive morning light the only sound that accompanied their tense anticipation was the gentle rumble of the wind blowing over the sand dunes and through the empty ways of the city samir shuddered the dunes are noisy ghassan frowned too noisy thats not just the wind as samir fell silent and held his breath the taller brother shaded his eyes and gazed into the distance in their current position they were on the highest part of the defensive circuit of mdahz with the road into the deep desert heading out in a diminishing line before them marching off to the oases and their date farms the dunes came very close to the city here where the desert met the sea more than a century ago an enterprising civic leader had created a levee of stone to keep the drifting sands away from the town the levee had been buried beneath the endless dunes for many years now so high were their crests and so deep their troughs sailors from the north who bothered to venture to this side of mdahz were often amazed by the desert it was said that the sands south of mdahz formed waves higher than were ever seen on the seas and it was from one of the deep troughs that ghassan watched the first pelasians emerge tales of the pelasian armies abounded in the folklore of the south they were said to go to war with more pomp and splendour than the retinue of most kings in the old stories the column of blackclad warriors was preceded by chariots bearing banners and effigies musicians and acrobats highstepping painstakinglytrained horses would convey the armys leaders to the conflict the old tales were wrong there was nothing splendid about the flood of black that washed like a sick tide from the deep sands like a million locusts swarming across the sea of gold so thick that hardly a grain was visible between them descending on mdahz to strip it bare no musicians no banners and acrobats just company after company of blackclad deathbringers spearmen then archers then heavilyarmoured infantry three varieties of predator in waves over and over again and alongside escorting them in longfiled companies came the cataphracti cavalry so thoroughly armoured that every inch of both man and horse was covered with shining steel plate untouchable and along the periphery the light skirmishing cavalry in small parties the sight was breathtaking terrifying and marvellous at the same time and despite the certain dread of death that grasped samirs heart and pulled it down deep into his gut all he could find to think was how hot those cataphracti must be under the desert sun ghassan was breathing heavily close to his ear groans could be heard along the wall from the less disciplined militiamen in his head samir performed a couple of swift calculations based on the size of each infantry and cavalry unit he could see he whistled through his teeth even counting only the enemy he could see and there were clearly more yet to arrive the pelasians must number more than ten thousand men he had performed a headcount at the market meeting and estimated the militia to number a little less than three hundred the odds were around thirtyfive to one while he had been under no illusion that the militia could hold the forces of pelasia away from the town the truth of their predicament suddenly struck home it was like a rat trying to hold back the sea if this satrap simply wished it he could dismantle the entire town in less than a day with no appreciable loss of men are we foolish ghassan his brother blinked in surprise what are we making a brave last stand to prove our worth as men he asked or are we simply throwing ourselves onto the pyre of our pride ghassan opened and closed his mouth a few times but no sound was forthcoming he stepped next to his brother and watched as the last of the enemy came into view at the rear of the great army came a small mounted party with one man clearly at the centre as the army drew itself to a halt beyond the missile range of the wall the man on his single gleaming black steed rode forth from his group accompanied by half a dozen riders with large oval shields they trotted through the deep sands past the many units and out into the open land before the walls as the man came closer the brothers peered down at him assessing this man who posed such a great threat he was tall dressed in fine though understated clothes and armoured only with a shirt of interconnected steel leaves a black scarf wound around his head and neck and covered the lower half of his face against the abrasive sands a long curved sword hung at his side though he had several men with him armed with great shields he rode alone into arrow range apparently unconcerned and finally stopped ten yards from the gate his horse snorting and prancing impatiently the impressive satrap looked up at the defences for a long time there was a tense and uncomfortable silence and then finally he unwound the black scarf and leaned back in his saddle rubbing his smooth cleanshaven chin boys he called out in a strong surprisingly light and almost musical voice boys old men and merchants there was another uncomfortable silence i have claimed mdahz and its surrounding lands as part of my demesne in the name of pelasia and the godking i care not what you think or call yourself but you and your land and possessions are now pelasian there was a low rumble of dissent among the defenders but with no identifiable source or audible words the satrap nodded as though answering some internal question i give you a very clear choice you many fight to defend your precious hive though if you choose to do so you will all die i will take no prisoners then your women and children those few of you old enough to have children a condescending smile crossed his face will have to face a life without you poor and alone until they die unremembered he drew a dagger from his robe and threw it point first into the sand before him or you can surrender the walls of your town open your gate accept your satrap willingly and you may return to your life he allowed his horse to prance dramatically for a moment as his words sank in and then settled to stillness once again and lifted his face i know that your town is dying a slow death since the empire left you pelasia offers rebirth we bring trade peace and prosperity once again he grasped the loose end of the scarf and began to wind it once more around his neck or we bring death fire and oblivion the choice is yours you have five minutes without waiting for an answer and apparently unconcerned for his safety the satrap turned his horse and walked slowly away from the walls ghassan and samir watched as the man approached a low pavilion that was in the advanced stages of construction at the near periphery of the pelasian army food and drink was being unloaded and delivered into the heavyframed tent and the satrap dismounted and entered brushing aside the hanging door and disappearing from view ghassan continued to stare at the enemy conflicting emotions and thoughts battling in his mind he hardly noticed as samir dashed over to the rear edge of the tower ghassan he turned at samirs hissed whisper and joined his brother at the parapet down in the shadows behind the gate commander cronus was standing at attention with three of his senior men alongside him along the street from the centre of the town a small party was approaching the boys had rarely ever seen the governors guard a handpicked mercenary unit from the northeast they were resplendent in silver and white with plumed conical helmets and banners flying from their pikes and in their midst came the governor none of them were mounted it was simply impractical in the streets of mdahz what will he do dyou think samir asked quietly his brother shrugged what can he do he must surrender or join us on the walls the imperial party stopped below the gate and while the white guards stood stiff and proud the governor strode out forward to meet the militia commander for some reason he looked ludicrous to the boys an overweight man of more than middle years used to good living and peaceful bureaucracy in a white uniform armed and armoured and with a plumed helmet beneath his arm the two commanders entered into a brief muttered conversation and finally cronus stepped back and saluted ghassan squinted into the shadows and was almost relieved to see the strained look of deep melancholy on the commanders face hes going to surrender samir i dont think cronus likes it but hes acquiesced ghassan clearly hadnt realised how loud his voice was for men nearby turned sharply to face him accompanied by an audible sigh of pentup dread being released the tall boy lurched back from the wall as the governor and his militia commander threw their heads back and gazed up toward the source of the comment the brothers held their breath for an eternal moment and the strain slowly passed below the governors voice demanded that the gate be opened ghassan and samir rushed to the far side of the tower and gazed down into the bright sunlight as the governor along with cronus and the whiteclad guards strode out onto the sand the gate remaining wide open behind them there was a brief flurry of activity around the pavilion and casually and without fuss the satrap emerged unarmoured stretching he gestured to the guards nearby as the brothers watched their breath held the pelasian guards turned a number of crossbows on the approaching nobleman secure and safe the satrap stepped to the edge of the carpet keeping his unbooted feet out of the rough sand governor talus how good of you to come his expression was hidden as he bowed deeply with an almost ophidian fluidity the governor and his party came to a halt a respectful distance away as the white guardsmen came to attention the governor stepped forward drawing his sword for just a fleeting moment ghassan pictured the defiant governor skewering the blackclad satrap but no in an ageold gesture the governor stepped a little closer reversed his sword dropped to one knee and proffered the hilt to his enemy in the name of the imperial governorship and the people of mdahz i hereby offer you my sword as your vassal mdahz is yours my lord satrap i offer you not only my loyalty but that of my people in the hope that you will accept us as vassals and not prisoners to join your lands and bring glory and prosperity both to our town and to its new master samir whistled through his teeth again it was a bold stroke to not just surrender but try to maintain mdahz as his own command under pelasian rule samir found he was holding his breath once again audacity like that could just as easily be punished as rewarded for a long moment the satrap glared at the governor before finally pursing his lips and nodding i will accept your offer talus with conditions if you wish to continue to govern mdahz for me i will hold you responsible for everything that happens here i keep things tightlyreined and peaceful in my demesne and i expect you to do the same for every incident of unrest or dissent of which i hear i will carve a piece from you to remind you of your situation do you understand he stepped back and as his face came into view samir found he was biting his tongue the satrap that had been so smooth and calmlyspoken was more than he had initially appeared there was something about his expression that sent a shudder down the boys spine something snakelike and cold this was not a man to cross nor he mused was this a man he was inclined to trust they watched as the governor nodded and swore an oath wordlessly the satrap reached down and accepted the hilt of the imperial sword holding it between thumb and forefinger as though it were something dirty and unpleasant and tossed it carelessly into the pile of debris resulting from the pavilions construction ghassan turned to samir when i look into those dead eyes i suddenly find i envy those who fled mdahz samir nodded thoughtfully watching their new ruler we need to find asima and tell her the news in which pelasian might is encountered asima looked up at the whiteclad guard as she grasped the handles of her bag where are we going the guardsman turned his strange pale blue eyes on her and shrugged beneath his cuirass of iron plates fast his accent was strange and thick like date wine that had been left too long in the open air in the aftermath of the pelasian arrival samir and ghassan had dropped in breathless to deliver the tidings before running off to find their mother and the guard had arrived ten minutes later with orders to collect asima and her father they had been allowed a brief pause to collect one bag of possessions to take with them no more the guard had been silent and singularly unhelpful in reply to their questions likely the man spoke their language badly for a few minutes her father had argued with him but had soon given up these were the governors own guard and there was no one safer in mdahz in whom to place ones trust she hefted the weighty bag on her shoulder despite her acquisitive nature asima had been totally unaware of just how many possessions even treasured possessions she had selecting few enough to fit in the bag had been a tough and heartbreaking task made all the more painful by the irritated glares and impatient shuffling of the guard her father appeared in the doorway his own considerably smaller bag over his arm come on asima we must go but where a note of petulance had entered her voice where else girl to the palace this is the governors guard now stop arguing and hurry asima fell silent her lips flattening in an angry line and strode past the two adults into the stair well behind her her father and the guard shared a look and then followed on outside in the street the guardsman drew his blade a northern sword longer than a standard imperial one hefting it meaningfully he pointed up the street and the three of them set off through the winding maze of alleys and passageways toward the high walls of the palace compound along the thoroughfare they turned left and climbed the stairway toward the next highest level of mdahz the guards face when asima occasionally saw it was set in a grimace as though he were expecting trouble at any moment indeed the way he held his sword suggested he was prepared for constant attack strangely there was no sign of movement in the streets clearly over a half of the towns population had abandoned their lives and fled to calphoris but there were noises among the streets and buildings of mdahz noises that didnt bear too much listening to a scream cut through the general hubbub and now that asima concentrated she realised that most of the sounds were those of wanton destruction and sobbing a sudden shout attracted her attention as they passed an open door risking a quick glance at the interior she caught a brief sight of a blackclad figure raising something metallic there was a gurgle and asima turned her head away and closed her eyes fervently wishing she had not looked in the first place as they strode on she found herself and her father drawing closer and closer to the whiteclad guardsman what was going on this appeared to be the looting and pillaging of a victorious army she had heard stories of what the soldiers of a conquering force were capable but from what the boys had said this had been a peaceful surrender and takeover of power the governor was nominally still in charge of mdahz there was a dull thud from an alleyway on her right she noticed the guardsmans head snap round towards it and kept her own gaze locked on the way ahead biting her cheek once again what was going on slowly and nervously the three of them climbed the streets to the palace compound the gates always shut against the possibility of theft or wilful damage were wide open where previously no guards had been visible from outside now blackclad pelasians in shirts of splinted mail stood by the gateposts watching the street carefully within the walls the only figures visible were blackclad pelasians asima looked across sharply at the guardsman walking with her but the man kept his expression neutral and his eyes straight ahead as they approached the gate the pelasian soldiers shifted quickly as if to bar their way but relaxed as they recognised the white and silver uniform of the governors guard the guardsmen gave a professional salute to the two men who merely glanced at him and then waved uninterestedly toward the internal buildings inside asima sized up the situation in short order there were several buildings in the compound and she was aware of the purpose of most black figures strode in and out of them often carrying goods one way or the other even in the guards barracks the only building that seemed to be escaping the worker ants of the pelasian force was the governors residence tall and elegant and with four whiteclad guardsmen standing to attention around the entrance watching the activity in the courtyard with distaste as the guard led them across the courtyard toward the governors building asima glanced around her and noted with interest the small party of four people just arriving at the gate well dressed and carrying bags escorted by another whiteclad guardsman as they reached the entrance to the house and the guardsmen stepped aside the next group caught up with them a nod of recognition passed between her father and the portly gentleman in the other party what do you suppose this is all about her father enquired quietly not sure but im damn glad im here and not one of the poor folk being beaten to death that we passed on the way asimas heart skipped a beat ghassan and samir and their mother were out there somewhere why are they doing this the man asked ive no idea her father replied shaking his head but i suspect were about to find out the guards escorted them up the ornate steps and into the house the first storey consisted mainly of a large hall with several doors leading off a floor of decorative multihued marble lay beneath them while wide beautifully curved staircases rose to both sides meeting at the far end to create a wide balcony that overlooked the hall guards stood on the platform while the hall itself below thronged with people all well dressed and from the lower nobility or wealthy mercantile class in this one room stood most of the wealth of mdahz asima and her father along with the new arrivals tried to find enough space to stand comfortably minutes passed accompanied by a low murmur of troubled conversation and heads turned occasionally as further groups of blessed citizens arrived and were ushered into the room finally there was a brief conversation in some strange guttural language between the guards outside and one of them stepped forward and closed the door asima cursed her imagination was it her own thoughts or the influence of samir and ghassans quick minds that made the situation suddenly worrying and uncomfortable it occurred to her momentarily that everyone in mdahz who was of worth to a conqueror was gathered in one room the old adage of eggs and baskets leapt to mind and she found herself looking carefully around the stairs and at the guards searching for something that might signal a doom for those present her imaginings of a gruesome end flittered away as the door above the stairs opened and the governor with two of his aides stepped up to the balcony rail and waited for silence to fall across the hall once the assembled crowd had noticed the new arrival and every face was tilted up toward governor talus the man cleared his throat i expect everyone here would like an explanation there was another unhappy murmur that came and went quickly satrap maahd has set his men loose in the city i have lodged the strongest complaint with his second but the satrap is unwilling to grant me an audience asima noticed for the first time the tired and defeated expression on the governors face it seems the man continued that the satrap had promised his men a sacking of mdahz and he intends to keep his word despite my attempts to end this without incident he took a deep breath and asima noted the way though his face maintained a strained composure he repeatedly slapped his palm on the balustrade in irritation i am quite simply unable to protect the people against this wanton destruction but i have done what i can i have taken in those we deem the most valuable of our citizens to protect you from the worst of these troubles he glanced sidelong at the guard commander next to him i can only hope that my doing this without seeking the satraps approval is not enough to anger him as that may well place us all back in direct danger he straightened i have had rooms prepared for you all in this building there is little space and things will be cramped you are sadly required to share living space i can only apologise for the conditions but i had to try and save as many people as i could once i leave here my staff will help you all settle in and see to the provision of food and bedding i regrettably must visit our new overlord and attempt to smooth things over and secure your safety if all goes well the satrap is mollified and the army run out of places to loot and rape then it is my fervent hope that you will all be able to return to your houses in a matter of days thank you for your patience and i hope that we will ride this through safely with a bow and a sombre look the governor turned and left the balcony there was a long uncomfortable silence and then suddenly the noise burst like a dam and angry and despairing voices flooded the room asima looked up at her father who had remained silent and gaunt she had her own worries samir and ghassan burst through the door to find their mother sitting crosslegged by the wall rocking slowly back and forth ma the woman raised her face sharply and the boys saw with heartbreaking sadness the tears running down her cheeks samir sighed what more could the gods have thrown at their poor mother her husband had died long before his time and left her all but penniless to bring up two headstrong boys there had been a brief interval when faraj had returned and things had once more become easier and hopeful and then the empire had left and faraj had gone off to fight and die and then her boys began to follow in his footsteps they had prepared themselves for death this morning it had seemed inevitable she had ordered and then cajoled and finally begged samir and ghassan not to go with the militia but they had been defiant and proud strong like their father and their uncle and then they would be dead like their father and their uncle likely their mother had spent the morning preparing to be utterly alone but miraculously they had survived nadia wiped the tears from her face and blinked samir ghassan as the boys ran across the room and threw themselves at her their mother opened her arms and turned to them then there is no invasion but i can hear fighting samir hugged his mother with ribbreaking force ghassan sat back a little his face was not the mask of joy she had expected not entirely mother the governor has surrendered mdahz to pelasia but their army is laying waste to the town anyway it is the pelasian way when victorious to sack the conquered town they will harm us and destroy our property throughout today and tonight tomorrow they will stop samir nodded it is horrible but it is true so we must leave here we are a way down the slope of the town from where the army entered but they will reach here long before nightfall and when they do his voice tailed off but all of them knew what would happen when hungry pelasian soldiers spotted the stillhandsome nadia according to some stories that were told about the pelasian men it was possible even that samir and ghassan would also be in danger weve been thinking as we came back ghassan said grasping his mothers wrist nowhere in mdahz will be safe until at least dawn so we must leave the town nadia shook her head you think fast my boys but their army surrounds the town there is nowhere to go samir grinned yes there is mother there is only one place that is safe tonight he shared a glance with ghassan and they both nodded the satrap led his entire force across the desert this means he has no navy we take two or three of the small fishing boats some heavy blankets and food to last a day or more and we row out from the port and along the coast until we find somewhere safe to moor ghassan smiled at the relief on his mothers face we can return once the town has settled nadia had to smile at her sons they were often a source or worry or grief but then when troubles seemed insurmountable they were also a source of wonder and pride in which asima denies the gods asima crouched by the window hugging her knees and gazing out between the filigree shutters the past eight months had plodded by in a blur of misery not only for her but for every captive soul in this benighted place governor talus had visited the satrap in the wake of that disastrous first day and made his case for the safety of the people in his care his presumption had cost him his left eye burned out with a heated blade on the floor of the council chamber of mdahz and yet the sacrifice of that eye had bought the safety of those in his house the satrap had granted sanctuary to anyone in the governors mansion but had made it perfectly clear that this rule applied solely to the building itself the looting burning and abuse had slowed through that first night and had stopped the next morning leaving mdahz damaged burned and in a state of shock one or two of the more daring refugees in the house had taken this as a sign of safety and had collected their belongings despite the warnings of the guards and left the complex returning to the town severed heads both old and young decorated the main gate for weeks thereafter as a reminder that sanctuary stopped at the governors doorstep as the weeks rolled past and the captives mooched around their packed quarters despair became the theme every morning was greeted with sobbing from somewhere in the building and every night ended with a tense and oppressive silence broken only by the pelasian temple bells the first two months saw a thinning of the crowds in the house a few brave adults had left at night climbing down the outer wall and running through the maze of alleys in an effort to flee the cursed town and reach calphoris perhaps they made it certainly their heads never returned to the spears above the gate others enterprising as they were had brought great wealth with them to the palace and had visited the pelasian overlord and bought their freedom with breathtaking sums sadly others had succumbed altogether to despair and had taken their own lives quietly in the night the months had not been kind asima sighed she had no idea what was happening out there were her friends still alive she wondered what of her house this whole situation set her teeth grinding her mother was pelasian and had been a beautiful and kind woman merchants from across the border had traded at mdahz for centuries the pelasians she had known had always been a kind and exotic people so why had the gods seen fit to send the most heartless and twisted son of a whore in the whole world to crush the people of mdahz three satraps held lands at this border so why him and not one of the others she knew why not of course because gods did not exist and misery and cruelty were the baseline of the world she had toyed with the idea that gods were a fiction when her mother was taken from her years ago and nothing she had seen since had given her cause to change her conclusion as she sat staring across the roofs something fell into place in asimas mind she had always been fast and smart perhaps not quite as fast or smart as samir but she would always come out on top because samir was soft asima was and she recognised this in herself quite capable of hardening her heart and combining an iron will with her other talents to achieve her goals and that was why she would survive all of this maybe the boys would or maybe not she could no longer afford to gaze longingly out of the window and hope for them whether they were alive and well or not they were lost to asima now and unless she wanted to sit here and wither away in the shadows she was going to have to do something to save her father and herself she turned to look at him sitting dejected in the shade by the wall she had not seen a hint of a smile in eight long months and the light had all but gone out in his eyes a quick glance around told her that they were practically alone the only other occupants of their living space currently standing out on the roof and breathing clear air father mmm the man looked so much older now and had lost a great deal of weight father i want you to listen to me he turned to frown at her a year ago he would have disciplined asima for speaking to an adult in such a fashion now even the thought seemed absurd he merely frowned and shrugged father i am going to do something and i want you to be prepared as i am not sure how this will work out you wont like it but we have no choice a raised eyebrow only she squared her shoulders and went on there is no magical solution coming father no gods or heroes are going to strike down the satrap and save us he is not going to have a sudden change of heart if we do not do something we will slowly wither away in this building until we crumble and die for a moment it looked as though he might argue but slowly unhappily and silently he nodded so father i intend to seek an audience with the satrap i am the daughter of a pelasian i have pelasian blood in my veins and i need to make him see that asima no father i know what you are about to say but this is the way there is no luck and no fate father we make our own futures and i for one do not intend for mine to be as a prisoner asima you cannot his voice tailed off as the girl stood proud and defiant she was eleven years old still a girl in two or three years time he would normally have been looking for a husband for her but now while there was no longer any hope of that she had blossomed in captivity grown adult too early there was something about her that reminded him so much of her mother and the thing that he knew clearest without a shadow of a doubt was that he could no more stop her now than he could stop the sun setting biting his lip worried he nodded tenderly she reached down to where he sat on the floor and placed her hand on his shoulder leaving it there for a moment before she straightened held her head high and strode from the room in a mix of pride and fear he watched her go asima strode from the room and round the corner into the corridor before she stopped and allowed the violent shaking to take hold she could force herself to appear confident in front of her father had to in fact or he would stop her but now that she was alone she could allow the fear she felt rooted in her belly to manifest just for a minute she leaned against the wall and rubbed her temples before folding her arms around her chest and fighting the rising gorge of fear she couldnt allow herself this kind of weakness straightening she shuffled along the wall to the large mirror where she examined herself carefully despite her complexion she looked decidedly pale she thought pinching her cheeks she carefully repinned her hair and reappraising herself nodded in satisfaction bracing herself and clenching her teeth she strode to the stairway and began to descend on the ground floor half a dozen whiteclad soldiers eyed her with surprise as she approached the one nearest the door bearing a black and white striped crest on his helmet stepped in front of the doors you need to stay in house dangerous out asima found herself blinking in surprise in her time here shed not heard any of the northern guardsmen speaking her language though now she thought about it some of them must do in order to communicate orders she smiled at the guard officer thank you for your warning kind sir but i must insist on being allowed out the guard shook his head and smiled a condescending smile in return to her own run along girl go to father bridling asima felt the heat rise in her cheeks how dare this man talk to her like that she made to step forward but the guard reached down and gently held her back she stopped struggling and stepped back this was both ridiculous and undignified the guard would clearly not accede to the demands of an eleven year old she could hardly face her father and ask him to speak to the guards biting her cheek and then chiding herself irritably for it she glared at the guard officer and then turned and stalked away back up the stairs months of being trapped in this luxurious prison had given her endless time to explore with the exception of the governors own rooms on the top floor and the temporary guard quarters on the ground she had examined every nook and cranny of the building and with her customary cunning had long since discovered three private routes out of the building frowning as she reached the top of the stairs asima glanced this way and that the easiest exit from the first floor balcony onto the roof of the stables was blocked as a couple of other prisoners occupied the terrace looking out across the compound clicking her tongue in irritation she made her way up the next flight of stairs the third route would be dangerous and should be avoided if at all possible hurrying now she turned along one of the corridors on the second floor and rushed along to the end from here she could edge along the roof of the balcony below where the couple stood and reach the exterior wall from there she could walk safely around the perimeter high above the stable block and descend next to the council buildings where the satrap now held court asima was so busy planning her route from the window that as she rounded the corner she walked straight into the elderly nobleman and his wife i am dreadfully sorry master maam the man barely glanced at her passing her by and hurrying along the corridor toward the stairs the woman however grasped her by the shoulders whatever are you doing alone child asima floundered i ah come with me we must find your father shaking her head asima tried to find words an excuse to deny this lady i have something to do maam my father knows the lady turned her forcefully and began to propel her along the corridor in the direction from which she had come asima blinked in surprise and made protesting sounds the lady stopped turning her by the shoulders and glaring at her this is not the time to throw a tantrum young lady asima was so surprised at the force in the older ladys voice that she stopped struggling as she was turned once more and directed along the corridor behind the old man you are the daughter of the merchant that resides in the room of glittering peacocks yes again asima was taken aback had she been that noticeable yes maam the woman nodded and gestured to her husband pass the word on i will return this wayward stray and then join you the man nodded and made his way toward the higher level and the governors rooms while asima and her escort made for the descending staircase maam asima began in a questioning voice something about the ladys manner was beginning to alarm her the noblewoman cut her off with a waved finger it is not becoming of young ladies to question their elders come along asima hurried on with the lady as they turned corners and marched along corridors until once more she entered the room where her father sat staring into nothing as the two approached the man looked up in surprise lady shereen he struggled respectfully to his feet and bowed his head even in their current circumstances there were matters of etiquette when dealing with someone of the ladys stature i have come to return your precocious little jewel she is i fear up to no good given the desperate attempts she made to lie about her reasons for sneaking around the corridors asimas father nodded meekly i apologise for her lady the woman shook her head that is not necessary master merchant she is headstrong and clever this one and in our dire circumstances she can be forgiven many things she sighed now however is a bad time to be wandering alone something is happening in the great square we have seen from the roof there is fire and the noise of combat pelasian soldiers are mobilising in the courtyard we may all be in danger asima blinked again and craned her head to stare at the lady behind her now that she concentrated she could hear many things distantly across the roofs of mdahz there were sounds of fighting and screams closer by on the balconies above she could hear worried conversation and groans warning bells chimed around the pelasian barracks of the city and soldiers gathered in the complex outside shouting orders something was happening and from the sound it was something dreadful in which unrest occurs samir and ghassan crouched in the shadow of the vinecovered pergola on the roof of a low building fronting on to the great square of mdahz from their earliest days out and about in the town they remembered the square as a place of life colour noise and commerce the grand bazaar was located here on an almost permanent basis only closing up when the public space was required for festivals or parades in these oppressed times however the bazaar was strictly controlled and only licensed on two week days flags of pelasia and the satrap maahd festooned the walls and poles a constant reminder to the people of their new master but not today it had begun only a few minutes ago although the boys had been aware of the plan for some time the resistance which had begun on the night of the invasion under the mercenary captain cronus had been slow and careful in developing as pelasian soldiers had burned raped and murdered their way through the town that night cronus already disenchanted with the manner in which the government had yielded and capitulated to the invaders had gathered the militia near the docks a decision had been made and the resistance movement that resulted had steadily grown in strength and number over the succeeding months after just two days hiding out in a secluded cover two miles from the walls the boys and their mother had slowly and cautiously taken their boat and returned to the town under cover of darkness as soon as ghassan discovered what the militia were doing he and samir had approached cronus and volunteered the grizzled mercenary had accepted them as scouts and since that day the boys had quietly gone about their business in mdahz attracting no unwanted attention and yet gathering information through watchful eyes and attentive ears the resistance was now twice the size of the militia who had initially stood on the walls and watched maahd and his men arrive whereas three quarters of the satraps force had returned to the family holdings in pelasia the odds while still steep were considerably better now than they had previously been many of the members of the resistance spurred on by pelasian atrocities were twitching with the need to make a move but cronus had expressly forbidden any such activity it was all about subtlety and timing the force had picked up more and more members over the months and had received illicit caches of arms from both seaborne and desert sources and had kept them in hidden locations around mdahz preparing for one great event and this morning had been a flurry of hidden activity as resistance cells across the town gathered their arms and moved silently through the streets the plan was simple some had complained about it of course but cronus had been adamant it had to be simple welltimed and above all it would require sacrifice volunteers had been called for for the demonstration in all likelihood many would not survive this but the demonstration was necessary a diversion for the main event grinning at samir ghassan opened his shuttered lantern the light from the candle burning within hardly visible in the brilliant sunshine samir tipped a small amount of his precious oil flask onto the pelasian flag that hung from the spar that jutted out just below the roof line glancing across the square to other rooftops he smiled now ghassan nodded and withdrew the candle touching the burning wick to the flag the great heavy banner leapt ablaze fire rippling across the surface and roaring in the silence with perfect timing all around the square pelasian flags burst into flame as scout groups of men too young for cronus to accept them as soldiers carried out their own acts of defiance with a roar the main group of protesters rushed into the square from three side streets converging among the burning banners and made for the pelasian guard barracks that occupied the once proud civic hall the two blackclad guards on duty beside the door took one look at the advancing mob and disappeared inside closing and bolting the door samir could not see their faces but smiled grimly as he imagined their panicked expressions the force of over a hundred protesters rushed up to the building and began to hammer at the doors and windows others rushing to the buildings on either side to gain access to upper floors ghassan nodded with a deep sense of satisfaction finally they would get to do something they just had to hope now that cronus had been right and that the pelasians would react in the predicted manner ghassan and samir dropped below the low parapet and watched tensely as events unfolded the barrack was a three storey building standing proud into the square but abutted on either side by houses and shops of two storeys the pelasians had taken some pains to bolster the defensive capabilities of the building reinforcing the doors placing bars on the windows and heavy wooden shutters it would take an hour for the rebels to gain entrance but the pelasians would now begin to panic there was no rear exit from the building as they had walled it up as part of their defensive adjustments and they were outnumbered two to one by their attackers so issuing forth from the building would be extremely unwise they may be able to hold it for a long time but the building had no well and would burn easily the mob could quite simply torch the building samir and ghassan knew that wouldnt happen it could turn into a blaze that destroyed half the city but the pelasians didnt know that they would have to do something and cronus had predicted what that something would be samir counting under his breath grinned as he saw the door on roof of the building fly open he turned to his brother the captain underestimated them they panicked quicker than he said they would ghassan laughed and focused his exceptional gaze on the three figures that issued from that door just as cronus had said they would two of them hauled up to the parapet one of the great horns that were once used to warn ships away from port during sandstorms shaped like a narrow cone six feet long and supported at the flared end on a hinged iron pivot the great horn took a great deal of effort to get a powerful sound from indeed as the boys watched with quiet mirth the three men took turns breathing deeply and blowing into the horn there were a number of low honking noises loud certainly but not loud enough to reach the reinforcements they needed at the palace complex finally after a little discussion one of them seemed to arrive at a conclusion and positioned himself the blare that issued was still quieter than the port hornsman would have managed but would carry a warning to the complex and that was all they needed satisfied the three men blew a half dozen more blasts gradually increasing in volume and then returned to the open doorway ghassan slapped samir on the back thats it its all in cronus hands now samir nodded and was about to reply when where was a cry of alarm from the square turning he gazed down once again just in time to see an arrow pass through the neck of one of the resistance oh no ghassan lunged to the edge and joined him staring down in dismay the pelasians didnt carry bows in the town they were of little use in the narrow streets so the guards relied on their spears and swords and slings if needed so why did they have bows now as he watched he realised with cold dread that he already knew the answer groups of a dozen blackclad and heavily armed pelasian soldiers had appeared in all the side streets blocking the exits from the square as the boys watched more arrows whispered their deadly song as they emerged from windows all around the square and thudded into the crowd of protesters outside the barracks its a trap already the numbers below were thinning out but samir stared in horror as he saw more guards emerge from the doorway on top of the building most ran to the edge and began to drop stones onto the crowd but two were carrying a huge copper pot slung between two poles and which judging by the way it swayed was very heavy samir averted his eyes this was one of the oldest of defensive manoeuvres but samir had no wish to watch its grisly effects ghassan grasped his smaller brother we have to go samir was shaking gently theyll burn theyll all burn ghassan hauled the other boy to his feet and glared at him drawing his hand back he gave samir a stinging slap across the face wake up brother they have seen the flags they know were up here we have to go now or we will burn with them samir stared at him shocked for a moment and then nodded as they rand across the roof heading for one of their old routes that would take them unnoticed far from this place of danger and high above the ground samir shook his head sadly how could they have dared to hope now the resistance was finished mdahz was lost for the first time in many years samir found himself crying as he ran across the town and far up the slope of mdahz captain cronus and the commanders of the resistance crouched behind doors and walls and listened to the stifling silence punctuated only by occasional mutterings of the guards at the palace complex nearby a distant boom from the horn in the main square rang across the town and cronus clenched his teeth and made several hand signals to the nearby commanders the signal at last now the civic barrack block in the square was under siege and the pelasian soldiers outnumbered almost two to one would be trapped within the barracks cronus found himself thinking sadly on those hundred volunteers in the square they would have to keep pounding at the doors until the first sign that reinforcements were on the way as soon as the pelasian soldiers appeared in the square they would have to run for their lives and few would escape he ground his teeth but their sacrifice would draw the soldiers from the palace leaving the satrap and his upper echelons badly protected and at the mercy of the honest citizens of mdahz once they had the commanders they could call an end to this and drive the invaders out and when that was done no other satrap would consider attempting a repeat of this horrible mess as he watched tensely there was a blast on a horn within the complex and the gates opened a swathe of heavilyarmed blackclad soldiers marched out of the encircling wall in columns turning and splitting into three groups that took separate roads toward the square to speed their arrival and deployment cronus watched them go from his position behind the low wall making a rough count of the men as the last men filed out of the gate and left the small plaza outside the complex he made a quick mental calculation almost a thousand men that would be most of the pelasian complement in mdahz now there would be a thousand or so more stationed in various places around the walls and at the port and sundry other locations but there couldnt be more than a couple of dozen left in the complex to stop the almost four hundred conspirators this was it they finally had a chance cronus watched and listened carefully taking a deep breath he cautiously crept from his hiding place along the wall and to the low gate a quick glimpse and he could see that the gate guards were standing at attention the sounds of the soldiers marching away seemed to have faded now was the time the captain took a deep breath and then bellowed now the resistance poured from gates and doors in the surrounding buildings and ran out into the street converging in the small circular public space and running for the complex gate it was a strange sight cronus thought as they ran hundreds of heavilyarmed men charging into battle but doing so in relative quiet the pelasian soldiers may be out of the way and marching to the diversion in the square but there was no reason to test their hearing and risk tempting them back the two guards at the gate disappeared within as soon as the mob entered the open spare the gates began to close very slowly cronus had been counting on that the portals were heavy constructed of solid wood reinforced with bronze plates there was no chance of them being closed in time triumphantly the mass of elated citizens ran through the gate brandishing their weapons ready to deal with whatever defence remained for the satrap cronus was due to his positioning in the square among the rearmost of the converging units and what happened next unfolded with the dreadful efficiency of a carefullylaid plan the charge came to a sudden stop in the courtyard of the complex as the ground burst into flame a huge horseshoe of oil that arced out from the side wall was now a deadly blaze a wall of fire blocking any hope of access to the interior buildings of the compound already the momentum of the charge had driven dozens of the attackers into the flames and their screams were echoing from the walls of mdahz cronus came to a halt his world shifting to slow motion and he turned with a cold weight in the pit of his belly somehow knowing what he was going to see every street that led from the small piazza was filled with black figures silently marching back toward them how could they have known someone had betrayed them someone had sold out any hope of the freedom of mdahz with a sickening finality he turned to face the nearest pelasian unit and straightened his back if were going to die lads lets make them remember us eh amongst cries of rage and hatred and screams of the dying the last defenders of free mdahz charged to their doom in which endings become beginnings samir and ghassan trudged through the street with heavy hearts their heads bowed and watching only the feet of those in front of them there had been no escaping this time and no hope of being saved by the resistance every last man involved in either of the attacks had been butchered mercilessly and their bodies carted several miles into the desert where they had been left to rot there had been a pregnant pause for a few hours after the incident during which the brothers had dared to hope that repercussions would be limited to the resistance themselves such was not the case the gates and harbour had been sealed off and patrols increased around the edge of mdahz during that quiet time that deep indrawn breath before the real evil began then during the height of the afternoon heat the pelasian military had begun to sweep through the town this was no victory looting or search for culprits but a simple rounding up of every living being in mdahz so thorough had the satraps men been that even the infirm had been rounded up their relatives or neighbours forced to carry them newborn babes cried in their mothers arms even the homeless beggars were collected every last soul in mdahz was gathering by the southern desert gate as samir and ghassan knew they had the best hiding places of anyone in the town and the best knowledge of the hidden ways and yet even they and their mother had been found behind the garden wall on the roof of the neglected imperial cult temple and now here at the gate finally were gathered all of mdahz samir shook his head slightly not true he corrected himself those who lived now in virtual seclusion in the governors palace complex were not here what had happened to them would remain a mystery he looked up at ghassan who was examining the ranks of the pelasian guards who surrounded the sadly depleted population of mdahz he had once heard someone estimate the population of the town at something like twenty thousand people at a rough estimate he would guess there were less than three thousand people here and that was everyone orders were being given by the gate but that was on the other side of the crowd and the boys could not hear the details from where they stood something was happening though as they watched the first few of the population were led up the staircase on the inner side of the south gate slowly and dejectedly they trudged up the steps to the top of the wall where they were then directed out along the parapet ghassan ground his teeth whatever theyre going to do it will not be pretty samir nodded grimly i know what theyre going to do so do you ghassan closed his eyes and shook his head how did it get this bad brother every time i think mdahz has reached the bottom of the well of the damned we get kicked down a little further samir nodded it continues to grow more and more hopeless ghassan but when things are truly hopeless that is when you need hope more than ever before we will do whatever it takes for as long as it takes endure whatever the gods and the satrap can throw at us and we will survive because all things change and one day things will be better ghassan stared down at his smaller brother in surprise there was a strange certainty about him something that actually gave the taller boy just a flicker of hope a tiny light in his heart wrapped in pride things will be better samir though as they nodded and returned their attention to the activity ahead the very idea of things improving seemed impossibly far away samir continued to watch as the scene unfolded while ghassan averted his eyes sadly as the folk of mdahz were led along the wall there was a scream samir nodded sadly to himself as he watched the first person in the line plummet from the wall to land on the rocky ground below his head smashing like a watermelon the fall was perhaps forty feet few would survive the drop and many of those that did would be smashed beyond repair surely the satrap did not intend to execute them all who would he have to be merciless to as he watched the line of prisoners was marched along the wall and the next few were directed to the steps to descend to ground level once again samir clenched his teeth and counted as he watched one two three four as the smaller brother peered between the figures before him he saw the fifth prisoner jabbed with a staff and pushed across the parapet by one of the guards the man made no sound as he fell though samir would never forget the sound as he landed was he brave to have held his silence or perhaps stricken by such shock that he was unable to speak one two three four another scream this time a womans voice he was unable to see as a large bald man obscured his view at the last moment every fifth person ghassan one in five the taller brother shook his head in disbelief then we have to leave to escape samir pursed his lips not possible ive looked at every angle i can think of but the satraps got us covered the only way out of here is along the wall or through a thousand heavily armed guards someone has to do something samir shook his head hes broken us have you not seen months ago the guards would have had to physically push the people up the stairs not now though theyre acting like cattle the satrap points and the people walk mdahz is done for when we get through this we need to make some rather important decisions my friend when we get through this one in five the odds arent too bad ghassan stared at his brother suddenly the crowd nearby was beginning to move the pace along the wall was picking up one two three four scream one two three four scream there was something sickeningly comforting about the one two three and four ghassan continued to stare at his brother as samir turned to face the now moving crowd and walked forward the taller brother stared for a moment and then turned to look up at their mother who had been silent throughout the whole exchange she hardly appeared to notice him her expression dead and glassy was unchanged by the horror around her and the only hint ghassan could detect that she was even aware of her surroundings was a slight twitch at the corner of her eye with each fresh scream from the wall with a deep breath he turned to face the horror and took a step forward slowly with solemn and dreadful certainty the entire crowd shuffled forward gradually filtering into a line as their neared the gate and its stairs samir turned as the ascent grew ever closer and locked his gaze on his brother things will be better remember hope ghassan nodded and clasped his brothers hand tight as samir shook and then let go they both turned to look up at their mother as the satrap had broken mdahz the whole experience had broken nadia such was clear her eyes stared ahead in their glassy oblivion not even flickering down toward her children mother ghassan reached out and grasped her hand mother i dont want to do this without hearing your voice again there was no reaction her eye twitched once again at the shriek from close by mother please speak to me a tear welled up in ghassans eye and he started as samir grasped his shoulder and turned him forward once more leave her alone ghassan i cant you must samir grasped his shoulders the whole line coming momentarily to a halt mother is gone ghassan shes not here any more and shes better off wherever she is dont bring her back and make her face this its not kind ghassan stared at his brother but we cant let her go on like this yes we can ghassan when we get through this we can take care of her get her some help but right now the best thing you can do for her is leave her alone the taller brother continued to stare as samir turned his back once more and picked up the pace to catch up under the watchful dark eyes of the guards by the gatehouse tower taking a pace forward his toes touched the first step slowly with his heart pounding samir began to climb the staircase behind him he could hear ghassans breath fast and close to panic by the sound moments passed and finally he was high enough to see along the wall a woman was thrust out into open space as his eyes settled on the queue without even realising he was doing it he counted the intervening prisoners eighteen his mind raced ghassan it would be ghassan ghassan wouldnt let him change that his brother was too noble in his heart to let samir do it so it would have to be quick fifteen very quick there were five guards at the point where people were being thrown off they were busy in solemn conversation but looked up regularly to examine the queue samir was pleased to note that they did not look happy with their lot perhaps there was hope for these people after all gritting his teeth he waited for a moment until they looked away and suddenly ducked to the side and came back up behind his brother ghassan looked round in shock what why the taller boy suddenly realised what his brother had done eleven no samir ghassan tried to push past his brother but one of the guards rushed across his attention once more on the queue and separated them no one changes the pelasian said flatly nine a man ghassan thought he recognised as a shopkeeper on the street of wild winds disappeared with a bellow from the parapet samir the smaller boy shook his head hope ghassan look after mother for me samir seven the taller boys eyes were wide as he stared at his brother he couldnt let this happen hed always assumed that if it came down to that he would be the one to sacrifice himself for samir and not the other way around four there was a shriek from ahead horribly close ahead three ill see you on the other side ghassan two ghassan stared at samir as the smaller brother was suddenly pulled away from him nadia pushed the boy behind her and looked down at her son for the last time the guard made to change the order back but another blackclad pelasian stopped him and shook his head sadly survive my boys survive and prosper ghassan reached out tears streaming suddenly down his face but his fingertips failed to reach her as one of the guards hauled him back and pushed him on toward the stairs as she stopped and with deliberate slowness the soldier pulled back his staff nadia turned her back on the weeping boy being taken further away to safety and looked down at samir the smaller boy always she thought the stronger one had a single tear in the corner of his eye he gave her a sad smile goodbye mother she gave him a sad smile and without waiting for the guard took a step from the wall into the open air samir turned away and blocked out the next moments as best he could before walking on toward his brother who shuddered his way toward the stairs hope there had to be hope in which asimas life takes an unexpected turn the attempted coup by the mdahz resistance changed everything in the town the satrap having spent so many months as a barelydisguised tyrant ruling through the powerless governor finally abandoned all pretence of care the morning after the executions posters went up across the town reminding the population that mdahz was a pelasian city now in the province of the satrap maahd and warning that the last quarter he would ever consider giving had now been given any further individual infraction of the strict rules to be imposed would be rewarded with a very painful and public death and any largerscale civil disobedience would result in the systematic extermination of every last occupant of the city and their replacement with pelasian settlers the dead from the southern wall were left where they fell for seven days by order of the satrap and no one was allowed near them to the horror of those who lived nearby not all of the victims had died when they fell but lay among the stinking grisly remains of those who did limited by shattered limbs as they wailed and begged for days until the heat starvation and wild creatures of the desert who dared come so close to the walls finally killed them off asima had heard the tales of what had happened and how it had been dealt with and found herself curiously unmoved a trait she was seeing more often in herself and that she felt should worry her more than it did while she recognised what a horrifying thing the satraps judgment had been she could not help but blame the stupidity of the plotters why had they tried if they had just tried to reason with the satrap none of this would have happened anyway besides she had heard pelasian soldiers in the compound close by the governors house talking about the incident and many of them had privately and out of earshot of their superiors spoken of their own dismay over the events of that day not all pelasians were cruel and if people had only given maahd no cause for alarm he would likely have soon returned to his hometown and left the governor to run mdahz then everything would have been more or less back to normal but no because of the idiotic activities of the socalled resistance the satrap had instead rooted himself ever deeper in mdahz and had brought the rule down harder than ever on its inhabitants but while these fools could bang their drums and shout their slogans and continue to bring down the wrath of the conqueror upon their heads asima was resolved to make her and her fathers lives easier however she could the problem was that the actions of those idiots in the militia had placed the satrap in a particularly angry and unresponsive mood and just how she could go about approaching him now was a thorny issue she sat on the decorative chair staring at her reflection in the mirror she had always known she was pretty and the way samir and ghassan used to look at her had confirmed that this was not merely narcissism but an accurate appraisal of her appearance and yet even being conservative with her opinion she could see that she had begun to change over this past year and was filling out becoming voluptuous and more truly beautiful than girlishly pretty the timing was unfortunate when she thought about it objectively another year or two and she could probably have had the satrap eating from her hand she smiled i will have him eating from it regardless her attention was drawn to a sudden intrusion in the corner of the mirror for a moment in a fashion that threatened to worry her she was irritated at her father for having interrupted this introspective viewing of her face she turned and smiled her most devastating smile asima father my dear you have been sent for and i do not know whether you should go she laughed lightly what are you saying father satrap maahd has ordered that you present yourself i know that that is what you have been intending to do anyway but for all your wits and precociousness my dear you are still a girl and still my daughter i fear that perhaps you should flee instead asima laughed again flee where father and how her fathers brow furrowed i know that you have your ways secret ways in and out of the building use them asima get away before maahd gets his claws into you father you worry too much straightening she walked across the room and patted him on the shoulder things will be fine father i am of pelasian blood remember with a last glance back she checked her reflection in the mirror and nodded with satisfaction she needed to look her best for this along the corridor and out into the main hall she was busy planning how she would sweep into the satraps presence like a graceful swan it was all about impression it was about making herself important and worthwhile it was she stopped for a moment at the balcony above the stairs there were blackclad soldiers marching around the ground floor of the governors residence surely they did not mean to break their promise and invade the governors own house because of the acts of a desperate group of lunatics and yet as she watched she realised that there was not a single whiteclad imperial guardsman to be seen the pelasian army was in the mansion frowning and scanning the soldiers she spotted a particular figure in the centre of the ground floor hall directing the men this way and that she recognised the bald head and aquiline features of jhraman the satraps chief vizier jhraman had been the man who over the past months had delivered the conquerors words to the captives here and who had listened to their questions and requests and delivered them back to his master always a shrewd judge of character asima had early formed a favourable opinion of this small hawklike man while he was utterly loyal to pelasia and his satrap he was a man of reason with a remarkably light sense of humour and a kindness of spirit that his master lacked her eyes locked on him she quickly and quietly descended the staircase instinctively as she reached the bottom of the sweeping stairs her gait dropped into a sweeping ladylike manner and she flicked her hair back just as jhraman turned to see her asima he smiled you are looking as glorious and radiant as the daughter of the sun just as you always do master jhraman she replied lowering her eyes while flicking her lashes dangerously thank you for your kind words i believe the satrap has requested my presence you require so many men to escort me the vizier gave a tight laugh something in his manner warned her not to play too many games with him today hardly asima the news will be circulating soon enough i am sure but sadly i must inform you that governor talus hanged himself last night in a testament to her iron composure asima barely blinked though her mind raced through many avenues before arriving at a conclusion she darent voice instead she feigned shock but why jhraman shook his head the reason is immaterial regardless he is being cut down and will be taken to a place of burial today with appropriate honours sadly this means that his guard are no longer appropriate here and are being deported back to imperial territory asima nodded sagely whatever the satrap would secretly have liked to do with the whiteclad imperial guardsmen he would not dare risk it even with the empire in chaos as it was said to be maahd would not push his luck any further the emperor had abandoned mdahz but these soldiers were citizens from the north likely their presence in mdahz was an ongoing impediment to the satrap perhaps that was even the reason maahd had had the governor take his own life she blinked as she realised the implications of all of this no governor meant no guards but it also meant no sanctuary no protection the satraps men were here because they were commandeering the mansion they would then eject the occupants at the very best at the worst that just did not bear thinking about she frowned at the vizier may i enquire as to why the satrap has sent for me jhraman shook his head and sighed i believe your father mistook the request i made you are not to present yourself to him child but to me an alarm went off deep inside asima but she maintained her composure her frown still aimed at the small man before her master jhraman the vizier cast his eyes back and forth furtively they were practically alone with the few soldiers nearby busy and at the edge of earshot his majestic and imperial highness the godking himself is i fear displeased with the manner in which the satrap has conducted this affair i have advised my master that a gift or donation to an appropriate value will buy the satrap his majestys support for the coming year i am to be a gift asima mentally chided herself such an outburst was hardly productive and she had almost shrieked like a fishwife several of the guards glanced in their direction and she blanched at the look of displeasure in the viziers face be quiet and calm child or i shall have to discipline you his shoulders relaxed a little as the guards went about their business once more his majesty is a good man with a strong appetite for healthy young women he concluded colour rising in his swarthy cheeks asima blinked you mean yes the man replied with an embarrassed smile you and three other young ladies of my choosing will be sent to akkad to the harem of the godking by pelasian law no girl of less than thirteen years of age may be taken to a mans bed but rest assured that it will take at least two years for you to learn the ways of the court asima found she was shaking her head you have no choice in the matter asima accept it and be pleased whatever you may think of this now be assured it is a good thing you will be taken from this barren cesspool and to a place of unimaginable wonders and delights he smiled a very genuine and warm smile and your father being the father of someone so potentially important will be well looked after i will see to it myself asima stared at the man before her when do i leave she asked in a small voice jhraman pursed his lips tonight take a few hours to say your farewells and gather anything of personal value travel light though as many of your things will be inappropriate and upon you arrival you may be made to discard them an hour before sunset a caravan will leave accompanied by cataphracti and soldiers the journey will take many days but with the consignment being so delicate and valuable you will travel only in the late afternoon and evening time and early in the morning when the sun is still cool pelasian way stations will shelter you for the nights asima found she was shaking her head again thought not in denial already her lightning mind was racing ahead planning the coming days she would not be alone three others who would very likely all be beauties and probably wealthier and higherborn than her but they would not be as bright or as cunning by the time the caravan reached akkad they would be to her as crows are to eagles she must be as her father used to say the best thing on the menu akkad had best prepare itself the pelasian capital held many of the great wonders but it had never tried to contain someone like asima in which childhood ends samir sat by the low table in the common room of what he used to think of as their family home i couldnt find her ghassan the taller of the two boys shrugged thats probably a good thing brother i want to remember her as she used to be not as how the jackals and buzzards have left her she needs to be buried ghassans brow furrowed and his eyes took on a hard edge she needs to be avenged samir not buried samir sighed vengeance is hollow brother survival is important that is the lesson she taught us the last lesson the two lapsed into silence for a moment something here felt wrong it had been days since the horrors that had ended their mothers life and any hope for a free mdahz the dynamic between the brothers felt strained and odd their whole life there had been a third person oh there had been occasions when the two brothers had been alone for certain but not for a length of time and never with important decisions to be made their father had been there and then their mother and uncle faraj and even asima but now they were utterly alone do you think asima will return samir blinked at his brothers question would you he sighed no asima will not return to mdahz the important question and the one that we seem to continually dance around is what we should do now another uncomfortable silence followed as the brothers met each others gaze since the deaths the boys had grieved in their own way and subtle changes were now evident in ghassan who had become quieter and more serious than samir had even known him and his eyes held an iron resolve that worried his brother samir swallowed nervously this had to play out exactly right whatever we do we will need to do it soon samir the supply of food is dwindling and we will not be able to afford to eat in a few days i have no intention of surviving the invasion and the horrors of maahds reign just to die of starvation in a back alley samir nodded agreed but the question is what theres nothing in mdahz we can do short of crime and those folk who fled to calphoris are probably as poor and hungry as we are if faraj was still alive ghassan nodded in silence we have to leave mdahz though samir his eyes darkened we need to avenge mother whatever you say survival not vengeance ghassan both the taller brother straightened ill bet the imperial army is still functioning in calphoris we can sign up with them and protect the rest of the empire against pelasia possibly even drive maahd back out of mdahz in time samir shook his head even if the army is still in calphoris if we signed up theyd send us to the other side of the world where the men are all pale with fair hair and it get so cold the water becomes solid but calphoris will have lost imperial support by now brother the empire is so far away and crumbling calphoris will be on its way to becoming what mdahz is now ghassan shrugged perhaps that would be better still they will still have a militia and will be watching the satrap carefully and their militia will be far larger and stronger than ours as calphoris is a big city and if its the militia we can probably lie about our age easier samir was still shaking his head thats not the way ghassan to sell ourselves into military service its a waste of our talents there will be other paths that will open to us the taller brother shrugged we have to leave mdahz that is clear samir south into the deep desert is unthinkable neither of us has the slightest idea how to survive there west is pelasia and given our current situation i do not think that would be an advisable choice no ships that dock here travel across the sea to the north and anyway the north is cold and their water turns solid and chills the bones that just leaves east to calphoris whether you think the army or the militia are a bad idea or not there is now simply nowhere else to go my brother samir sighed and nodded that much is true yes though i would rather try to make my fortune there than become a soldier and die in a border war for someone elses good we are clever and enterprising ghassan we saved asimas father from poverty they lapsed once more into an uncomfortable silence the subject of asimas father was a touchy one that neither brother felt comfortable dealing with at this point they had become aware of asimas fate when those who had been under the governors protection found themselves suddenly without support a few had disappeared without trace presumably having fallen foul of the satrap for some reason but the rest had been forcibly ejected from the complex into the town their more valuable belongings impounded beforehand to make their way as ordinary citizens the boys had spoken to a group of survivors eager for news of the friend of whom they had seen nothing in so many months the fact that asima and the other girls had been sent to akkad for the godkings pleasure was something that neither brother had so far allowed themselves to ponder on still this meant that she was safe at least her father however had been found by the satraps vizier and had last been seen disappearing into maahds palace very well ghassan stretched we can agree that whatever we do next we need to do it in calphoris samir frowned and bit his lip the idea of abandoning everything and committing to the provincial capital for the future felt like a betrayal and though ghassans logic was unassailable samir had his plan finally he nodded we head east have you given any thought to how and when ghassan shrugged as soon as possible and on foot i suppose its not as though we can afford camels or horses samir smiled and reached behind him rummaging in his pack a moment later he withdrew a small hessian bag that was clearly heavy and which clinked when he dropped it to the table ghassan stared thats money samir nodded from where it belonged to asimas father i doubt it will do him any good right now wherever he is you stole from asimas father outrage pushed ghassans voice up a notch and the question ended in almost a squeak after a fashion they had already gone to the palace when i found this their house had been turned upside down by pelasian soldiers and i can assure you that they took everything he had that was of any real value so how did you find that samir gave a cheeky grin ive known where he kept his emergency fund for a long time ghassan he straightened and this is an emergency removing two pouches from a nearby cupboard he neatly divided what looked to ghassan like a small fortune dropping half into each container with a nod he slid one pouch across the table to his brother and tied the thongs of the other to his belt tucking the pouch down into his pocket for added security ghassan frowned why are you splitting it now for a moment samir flinched slightly then he smiled just in case one man carrying too much money is asking for an unfortunate accident he straightened once more we will need to leave tonight while it is dark in fact if we wait until the early morning we can leave when the moon passes to the underworld that should give us almost two hours at this time of year to get past the walls and out along the coast before sunrise that seems sensible ghassan agreed we should leave as far from a gate as we can the port is out of the question though as ive heard maahd is having shipping watched and searched now samir nodded theres a place not too far from the eastern end of the port where the walls are very close to a number of warehouses we can get into the warehouses before the moon rises fully and wait out the night there well need some rope to get down the other side of the walls but then we can be half a dozen miles away from mdahz before the sun comes up about ten miles along the coast is a village with an animal market asimas father used to trade with them ive never been there clearly but i suspect his name will carry some weight there he picked up the pouch in front of him and tied it to his belt and now we can afford a horse samir answered with a grin his heart racing now this was the time there is one more thing though ghassan shrugged yes i have something else to do before we go and it could be dangerous the taller boy frowned what samir winked and touched the side of his nose im afraid i cant tell you yet ghassan but i will reveal all later how am i supposed to help if you wont tell me what youre doing youre not supposed to help samir countered sorry ghassan but im doing this alone go to the warehouses in the street of running dogs as soon as the sun sets there are three buildings in a row the central one was a grain warehouse and has the best access to the wall theres only a jump of about four feet we can do that in our sleep and there should be a lot of rope in there for us to use ghassan held up his hands to object but samir pushed them out of the way this is not a negotiation ghassan i will meet you at the warehouse before the moon sets and we will run for calphoris but and this is important if anything happens and i cannot get there you cannot afford to wait if the moon sinks and i am not there you must go if i can i will find you in calphoris later the taller boy was still shaking his head and objecting vehemently ghassan samir said quietly you must do this as must i do not panic i will in all likelihood be there ghassan continued his refusal how in the name of the seven faces of harish would you find me in calphoris there are more people there than anywhere else on this continent you know me brother i could find a single rock in all of the deep desert if i set my mind to it now promise me wait for me but only as long as you can when there is full darkness whether i am there or not you will run for calphoris ghassan remained silent his eyes locked on his brother ghassan alright but you had better be there or i shall curse your name to the gods samir grinned tonight we end the curse ghassan from tonight we will be blessed changes things will be better remember ghassan took a deep breath and nodded then i will run to my errand and i will see you by moonlight in the grain warehouse on running dogs yes ghassan nodded once again and the pair clasped hands with a smile samir hoisted his pack over his shoulder cast one last look at his brother and then walked slowly to the front door and left the house in which we look to the future samir strode down the empty dark street a hundred yards from the house without looking back at the corner where the street of dancing fools ran back up the hill toward the gate that faced akkad and pelasia he crouched and withdrew a bag a cloak and a sheathed sword from behind a stack of boxes he took one last sad look back up the street it was sad for certain but ghassan would never understand or approve life in mdahz would change sooner or later and samir knew with certainty that he was one of very few souls who could survive this and prosper he would find a way to live in the town and eventually to turn things around but the way ahead of him was for the foreseeable future a life of running and hiding of consorting with thieves and murderers and living on the very edge of the law until the laws were once more worth abiding by ghassan was too noble in thought for that he was too straight and would never even think of what samir was proposing to do his brother would be safer in calphoris with his precious militia wearing a uniform and living to a code of duty one day when everything was put right and the wounds that had been torn in their home had been healed he would find ghassan and they would return to the house of their mother after all they were family with a sigh he hefted the sword and tore his eyes from the house where his brother waited before making his way down the street toward the port the last rays of the sun had left the streets of mdahz almost an hour ago ghassan crouched in the rafters of the grain warehouse peering out through the hole in the roof at the citys defences and leaning on his pack for support the pelasian soldiers patrolling the wall passed every ten minutes or so and there would be plenty of time for him to sling over a rope and drop to safety if he placed it right the rope would remain unnoticed at least until sunrise it saddened him a little that the walls of his hometown were patrolled like a prison the watchful guards directing their gaze inward more often than out preventing their captive populace from fleeing the clutches of the twisted satrap maahd he sighed and fought back the panic once more he knew with cold certainty that samir would not come whatever his brother was planning it was clear to ghassan that he had no intention of meeting at the warehouse the dividing of the purses the enforced promises most of all the look on the smaller boys face as they had clasped hands that last time samir would not come but ghassan knew with equal sureness that he had to go he had to do this even if he never saw samir again someone had to find a way to bring the hand of imperial justice at calphoris against this pelasian butcher who had destroyed everything and murdered everyone that they had loved maahd would pay for his crimes the desert nomads have a saying when something is broken it should never be discarded so long as the pieces remain the whole can be remade the moon set slowly over mdahz and a new day dawned part two making ends meet in which samirs plans are changed samir shook his head to free it of the fuzziness and regular pounding stupid really he should be more careful hed end up in trouble one of these days six months had passed since he and ghassan had gone their separate ways and samir would have to admit to himself eventually that he had squandered and wasted most of the time the first few nights he had frequented some of the less reputable areas of the port district hoping to make contacts or even friends among the criminal classes at the age of twelve samir was still small for his age though the events of the preceding years had given him a slightly drawn and haunted look that advanced his years somewhat in addition dark facial hair had begun to manifest recently surprising samir somewhat it had taken some work regardless of these developments to gain and maintain access to the drinking and gambling pits of the port even with the pelasian control and a seriously diminished population these establishments managed to survive in fact given the level of misery in mdahz their patronage had actually increased rather than falling off at first samir had been content to sit and take in the general atmosphere trying to work out the associations and connections between the various unsavoury patrons he had selected as likely contacts and listening intently to any snippets of conversation he could catch soon however he came to realise that someone such as he stood out in these establishments and not because he was small or young given the state of mdahz these days there were many waifs and strays that made their way here looking for work or a handout no what made him stand out was the way he always sat on his own never drank and was seen to be paying too close attention to things that did not concern him the issue had become clear to him after he was dragged from one bar and beaten repeatedly in an alleyway he had not returned to that establishment turning his attention to alternative locations and in what he thought of as phase two several weeks after ghassan had left he began to throw himself into the part learning some of the games that went on in the gaming pits and trying several of the drinks on offer until he discovered what was palatable and what was not and as he had gradually become accustomed to the drink and the games and experienced a little success in the gambling dens he had finally begun to fit in two months into his new life he had at last reached the point where people paid no attention when he entered or left a bar soon he found he was being offered work by some of the other occupants just small things to begin with the running of an errand delivery of parcels or messages he began to carry his sword with him where he could and a sharp knife everywhere else gradually he became indistinguishable from those other young men who performed small tasks for the underworld of the district but what had begun as an attempt to ingratiate himself into the habitat of the criminal classes had quickly grown beyond his control as the weeks passed samir found that he was so busy running dubious errands making money and maintaining his persona as a small time crook that he had no time to apply what he was learning to any of his grand plans for the future of the town there was simply not enough time to try nudging these people toward his goal guerrilla activity against the pelasian masters and yet with this new life came a certain respect albeit from the lowest orders of the town and money and influence of course only two months down the line samir had already reached such a stage in his career where he now had three boys running errands for him he had unquestioned access to most places in the port district and the ear of some of the most dangerous men in the town what came along with this as baggage was the carousing the late nights gambling and drinking were changing his habits and he had become more or less nocturnal having to allow at least two hours of an afternoon to clean himself up and let the thumping hangover fade before looking to his daily tasks he had sought to infiltrate the criminal classes in mdahz half a year later however he had become the criminal class of the town ghassan would never have recognised his brother now and yet with all his late night forays and sessions last evening was unquestionably the worst he had yet suffered he couldnt even remember leaving the last place there had been a fight over a purse of coins he remembered that and felt his upper lip wincing as he found the bloody cut and the missing tooth that explained some of the throbbing even wincing made his head hurt his entire body ached as though he had been attacked with branches which was distinctly possible given the events of the night that he could remember and the length of time as yet unaccounted for he tried to smile to himself but the pain this brought in his gums lip and head made a smile beyond hope he was obviously still somewhere close to the port from the briny smell at least the gulls were being silent which was a blessing the usual morning squawking of a thousand gulls might just have killed him this morning samir shuddered and very slowly and with great care pried open his eyes trying to ignore the fresh waves of pain and nausea that light and colour brought with them hes awake samir blinked a face several feet away from him grinned a malicious grin showing several missing teeth the pain in his mouth face head and screaming muscles forgotten in an instant samirs reactions took over scrambling from his side onto all fours he backed away and felt himself bump into a wooden structure what in the name of the great mother was going on his eyes became accustomed to the low light and he focused on the face before him as the other figure came up from floor level into a crouch the lad was younger than him though probably bigger regardless he had clearly seen the losing side of several fights by the marks and old wounds evident on his face and arms he wore a cloth wrapped around his forehead and a leather waistcoat that allowed him to display the several gold chains hanging round his neck and the bronze armlets and bracers he wore who are you the boy ignored him and grinned again awake and conscious good replied a voice from the shadows behind the boy samir squinted and tried to make out the shapes in the shadows there were more than one perhaps a dozen people who are you and where am i there was a chorus of laughter this is not as funny as you think samir barked im an important man there are some very dangerous people who will miss me and be extremely unhappy with you the laugher moved up a notch and for the first time in many months samirs confidence foundered he licked his lips nervously and winced as his tongue touched the fresh cut slowly the other figures moved forward out of the shadows in other circumstances samir might have laughed they were such an assorted bunch he had once seen a carnival when the great religious festival had been celebrated to mark the millennium of imperial foundation his father had called it the freak show and this reminded him so closely of it that he found it impossible to avoid smiling tall fat short thin some missing limbs some with one eye some with misshapen body parts not a one of them older than fifteen at a guess samir sighed i am tired and hung over i have a lot to do and no time to play if you intend to rob me do so now i have nothing on me of value barring a few coins left over from the evening if youre just wanting to pick on me then lets get this over with so i can get to my work the laughter from the second boy who had spoken was deep and rich and disturbed samir further there was something about this he didnt like at all he had dealt with bullies many times this was somehow different this other speaker was clearly the leader older than most and taller than all he was bulky and lighter skinned than the rest almost like the foreign merchants from the north one side of his face had been tattooed with intricate designs and whorls something about the boy suggested he was not one to be taken lightly show him afad the leader said without taking his eyes from samir samir kept this tall boy in his sight while trying to follow the movements of the one who had watched him awake this afad made his way across to a wall in the shadows there was a bang and a creak and suddenly a square hatchway opened in the wooden wall light poured in illuminating the face of the smiling boy and picking out sharply the shape of the others samir shrugged so youre all very pretty im sure the leader laughed you misunderstand go and look trying hard to keep his eyes on the rest of them samir backed away along the ribbed wooden structure behind him toward that small square of white light and the grinning boy next to it as he approached he made motions for the other to move away and with a shrug afad shuffled back toward his companions samir closed on the light feeling around his belt as he did so no surprise there his knife had gone as had his purse and then he reached the hole and quickly so as not to grant too much opportunity to the potential attackers he peered through the hole as his world shattered and the shards fled from him the gathered children in the dark almost entirely forgotten samir blinked at the foamy water and the wake flowing past the wooden hull shit once again a chorus of uproarious laughter burst out in the shadows shit you may have been important in mdahz little one but here youre just fresh meat samirs heart raced he was good under pressure and he knew it but this was so far beyond his territory he really had no idea how to react he swallowed the important thing was to stay in control of himself that way he had a hope of gaining control of the situation as time progressed setting his jaw stubbornly he turned to the assembled crowd fighting down the panic and compacting it in his gut into a hard resolve very well were obviously some distance from mdahz now youre clearly not a pelasian vessel and the empire wont be sending ships here these days the militia have gone and merchants are not in the habit of pressing unconscious drunks into service he smiled a smile that he hoped was as irritating and condescending as it felt i assume therefore that this is a pirate vessel and i am now whether i like it or not in fact a pirate though no one replied there was a chorus of vaguely affirmative noises from the other occupants of this dark space irritating because now samir was going to have to build up the respect of his peers from scratch once again and learn the ropes of this place clearly short of a suicidal escape attempt to swim dozens of miles of open sea he was stuck here for now and would have to make the most of it he smiled to himself perhaps this was actually a blessing in disguise while he had entered his new life at mdahz with great plans of using the criminal classes of the town to foment rebellion against the pelasians he had to admit how easily hed let himself slide into the simplicity of a life of few morals and lost sight of his original purpose pirates pirates could be a great deal more use than a few smugglers and thieves his smile widened all the more reason to push this as far as it would go if you needed respect the first thing to do was to test your limits once you knew how far you were allowed to go you knew what you had to continually exceed to gain respect or at least fear ive met pirates several times saw a captain behead a merchant in mdahz once and since pirates are in my experience grown men with brains and cunning i can only assume that you are either captives or that perhaps you clean the shitters yes several growls greeted this comment samir began to relax some crowds were so predictable it was almost a shame to play them well any of you young ladies got enough of a voice to tell me what ship this is the leader at the back folded his arms and sat back on a crate you are either exceptionally brave or monumentally stupid boy my lads will tear you to pieces for that samir shrugged bring it to me i have gutted pelasian captains learned to fight well from a desert warrior and dirtily from the docks of mdahz and i am not remotely afraid of any of your catamites my friend the figures barring the leader who remained seated on his crate began to step slowly and purposefully forward from the shadows samir nodded to himself this was going to hurt but it was the first step to gaining a level of control with a smile he scanned around and found a ribshaped piece of timber perhaps two feet long and slightly curved part of a broken barrel probably he hefted it for a moment and turned to face the advancing crowd alright whos first the white horses of possibility rushed along the side of the ship as they danced from crest to crest keeping pace with the beatings just audible from within the hull of the great dark vessel on the raised rear section of the deck beneath the large buildinglike canopy captain khmun shifted his gaze from the wide horizon ahead to the two sails which billowed were losing the wind sharimi break out the oars he cupped his hand round his ear and grinned and youd best go break up the fight the boys need to take their seats the first officer returned the sly grin and bowed as he ran off shouting commands khmum rubbed his bristly chin and stared off ahead into the distance focusing on the island that would not be visible for days yet the dark empress was heading home in which a journey is completed and one begun ghassan stared up in wonder although his whole life he had heard the merchants in mdahz talk of the glorious city of calphoris as though it made his home town look like a desert hovel hed not been truly prepared for what he saw now it had been so long since he had set off in the dark moonless night from the walls of mdahz with visions of a quick run and then a five day ride along the coast to the capital of the province that he had lost count of the sunrises and sunsets he had seen what had begun easily had soon been complicated beyond belief he had run through the night and had hoped to come early the next morning to the trade station where he would buy a horse or possibly a camel for his ongoing journey the light had gradually grown with that first dawn and he had approached the trade post with some caution even though the chances were that even if the rope had been found the pelasian military would hardly expend men on a manhunt unless someone important was found to be missing there was no reason to tempt the lady of fate the station had been quiet and as hed approached he had realised just how quiet no trading post was that silent let alone one that specialised in animals obviously the place was still used since the smell of dung had been fresh and pungent enough to assail him as he reached even a hundred yards distance perhaps now that there were so few traders on the roads this place was only maintained by nomads who would need to stay there occasionally biting his lip he had approached slowly and in a crouched tense manner somehow he hadnt believed his rationalisations something had been wrong with the place and as hed reached the boundary wall that formed part of the horse corral he had spotted the first signs of trouble a broken blade lay partially covered by the sand once again he had found himself thanking the gods for the gift of sharp eyes ten minutes he had waited obscured by that wall listening for any sign of movement before he had ventured within the post formed of three buildings and two tents with four separate corrals and an enclosing wall the trade station had clearly been occupied continuously by a number of men and a great many animals of different sorts up to a matter of days or even hours before equally clearly the peaceful occupation of this mercantile centre had ended quickly and violently not a single animal was to be found at the site and no bodies had been in evidence though ghassan had found a number of ripped fragments of garments and shards of metal belonging to weapons and armour most disturbing had been the gobbets of fresh blood on the floor of the main building clearly where the fighting or more likely the executions had taken place despite the lack of corroborating evidence he had become convinced almost immediately that this was the work of the pelasian invaders probably in some form of revenge for the attempted coup in the town whatever the reason he had now been faced with several weeks walk to the city of calphoris a walk along the coast down near the shore and away from the road where patrols might find him sighing ghassan had set off and headed east once again later that afternoon he had almost walked to his own demise a whole day of repetitive terrain and the quiet lapping of waves on the sand had become like a mantra driving the young man into a stupor as he plodded ever on it was almost soporific and he had his head lowered and his thumbs tucked into his belt as hed rounded that headland as he thought back on it now he became certain that hed even been whistling a childhood ditty as he went and there on the beach beyond the headland had been a patrol of blackclad pelasian light cavalry cooking freshlycaught fish for their lunch he had been so surprised shocked out of his mental haze that hed stood there like some sort of practice target silhouetted against the sapphire sky as the first rider had spotted him ghassan was far from a stupid young man and years of having to keep up with the mercurial thought processes of his clever brother had honed his instincts shaking his head slightly he had turned and run up the slope toward the road inland making sure he moved far enough back west as he went so that hed disappeared from their view as soon as hed done so he had then ducked back the way he came and dropped to the ground to peer over the headland sure enough the riders had clambered onto their horses and ridden towards the road with a smile ghassan had then run down onto the gravelly shore briefly hed considered stealing the fragrant baked fish but quickly rid himself of such dangerous ideas keeping his eyes darting around the periphery for warnings of the scouts coming back this way he had carefully run across the beach to the opposite headland making sure to keep to the hard stony part of the shoreline and stay off the sand that would betray signs of his passing after that incident he had travelled much more slowly and very carefully it would take the best part of a month at that rate for him to reach the city but he would be more likely to arrive unharmed besides he could catch and cook fish as he went which would prevent him from starving and fresh water could be supplied using an arrangement of three pots to boil sea water and then collect the dripping steam a trick any desertcoast dweller quickly learned many times over the next three weeks of travel he had considered alternative routes the road would have been so much quicker but several times he had spotted pelasian scouts or patrols so the idea had been quickly shelved the only other possibility had been deeper into the southern desert but while he was almost guaranteed to see no pelasians there the desert held its own perils he knew where the oases were supposed to be and in principal at least knew how to extract water from succulents he might find but it was very easy to lose your way in the desert and the chances were that hed be walking to his death besides if you were not a native of the dunes there was every chance the sand devils would catch you and ghassan had no intention at this pivotal point in his life of being eaten and left a stripped carcass in the deep sands and so the days had dragged on and on he had begun by keeping a rough track of the time but towards the end of the first week he had given up such meaningless ideas and merely settled for whether it was morning afternoon or night by the end of the second week hed given up trying to remember what day it was and had vowed that when he finally reached his destination whether he became a soldier or a mercenary whether he was rich or poor or somewhere in between he would make sure that he never ate another chunk of baked bream or boiled seaweed again as long as he lived and now here he was with a sigh of relief ghassan let his pack fall to the floor beside his leg his legs ached a little but the constant daily exercise had built up his muscles enough that he hardly noticed it any more and he was finally safe from pelasian patrols standing before the great white marble gates of calphoris the massive arch rose up above him to a height of perhaps a hundred feet the sides of the gatehouse had once been great cylindrical white towers though in more troubled times some governor had given them a great dark square buttressed stone casing that covered the lower half the top of the gate resplendent in its white marble battlements was surmounted by five great golden figures as he examined them it occurred to ghassans jaded mind that the chances of them being anything but highlyburnished bronze was tiny no amount of guards in the world would stop a good thief from taking pieces off the statues if they were really gold the walls of calphoris made mdahz look like a poorlyprotected village inside the tips of a multitude of white and bronze towers rose toward the azure heavens the great gates themselves were clearly bronzeplated and heavy enough to stop the hardiest of battering rams calphoris had money glory a past he smiled a future approaching he took careful note of the two men in uniform standing in a bored fashion to either side of the gate they were not members of the imperial army certainly ghassan had seen enough of the empires soldiers in his youth in mdahz that he knew not only the insignia for the southern marshals army but also of half a dozen of the specific units based in the south their rank insignias and their armour standards while these two were clearly professional soldiers their tunics and cloaks clean and pressed their armour polished and correct the insignia and some of the equipment was different ghassan was immediately impressed these were obviously the militia as it existed in calphoris certainly a step up on that of mdahz clearly then imperial support had pulled out of the provincial capital too taking a deep breath ghassan straightened and tried to look as adult and serious as possible the guard to the left of the gateway watched as he approached his expression carefully neutral ghassan swallowed as he came to a halt his pack over his back and the sheathed sword hanging conspicuously from the bundle excuse me i need to know where i would go to sign up the guard blinked clearly surprised at the question though his composure never faltered how old are you lad for a moment ghassan wondered about lying would it stand him in any better stead but the only real way forward if he was going to commit to this properly would be honestly i am almost thirteen sir a slight exaggeration but basically true the guard nodded ghassan had truly expected the man to laugh and was further impressed by these men as the soldier looked him up and down with a professional eye you might be better coming back in a few years to be honest lad if you sign on now youll have seniority when you hit sixteen and we get the new recruits but it means youll have three years of getting the shitty end of the stick all the nasty jobs ghassan shrugged as professionally as he could manage and almost lost control of the heavy pack on his shoulder im willing to do whatever comes my way i just want to sign up the guard nodded again fair enough lad go through the gate and head up the street until you pass through the arch of the old walls you cant miss it the next street on the right after that leads to the military compound he laughed and the spice market but im guessing youll be able to work out which is which ghassan smiled thank you sir why so determined asked the soldier as ghassan shouldered his pack once more preparing to set off im from mdahz ive watched the place collapse under the pelasians and i want to protect the empire and make sure mdahz is as far as they get i heard things in mdahz were pretty dire if youre hoping for revenge this isnt the way though ghassan frowned and the guard shrugged this isnt the imperial army any more lad we dont go conquering enemies now this is the army of calphoris and we fight to protect our city our lord and our territory whether it be from pelasians desert nomads pirates or even other imperial cities you might as well know that before you sign your life away as a scout in the cavalry or a skivvy in the navy ghassan smiled there was no humour about his feral look and for a moment it even shook the guard at the gate sir i will do whatever is required of me for now but i can assure you that some day i will march back into mdahz and i will kill any pelasian who gets in my way he gave a small bow his teeth still clenched in that nonsmile thank you for your assistance taking a deep breath ghassan straightened once more and strode purposefully through the gates of calphoris toward his future whatever it may hold in which pelasia opens her arms asima was tired of travel by the time the armed caravan arrived at akkad but not half as tired as she was of her companions the journey had taken three weeks most of which had involved travelling with interminable slowness through a constant monotonous sea of sandy waves punctuated by the pelasian way stations though comfortable these establishments mostly built around oases or crossroads were home to cackling old men who made their living from the government supplying shelter for the military and those who could pay their way they made a healthy living so she felt safe knowing they would do nothing to jeopardise that but this did not stop them leering and making vaguely suggestive comments the seeminglyendless tracts of sand began to show signs of tailing off after two weeks and the last few days she had noted each morning a more fascinating world passing them by they approached a low mountain range passing through it across a saddle and from that point on the landscape changed beyond the mountain range were low hills and as they made their way toward the capital reaching out on its promontory into the sea she began to see farms and fields of wheat she had been told by her father that pelasia was the worlds greatest supplier of grain but had always assumed this to be an exaggeration given the fact that it lay at the edge of the great southern desert she might have enjoyed that last week as they passed inhabited towns and actual rivers with fishermen she might have marvelled at the almost miraculous changes in the landscape unfortunately after two weeks trundling across the desert in the company of the vapid witches she had been saddled with she had almost lost the will to live let alone any hope of taking interest in her surroundings asimas fears that she would have to work to become the shining jewel among the gift sent to the godking were soon assuaged sharra clearly the eldest of her companions was the only one that seemed to have been gifted with the ability to outthink a dormouse she would be the only real competition and asima was hardly worried about her sharra was tall and elegant and had skin the tone of dark honey with long lustrous hair she was wellspoken educated and from a wealthy family of mdahz however she was also clearly mad she had spent the entire journey separating herself more and more from the others and complaining and moaning to the escort she had no intention of abasing herself in akkad prideful and rebellious she had tried to escape no less than five times during the journey despite her looks and her intelligence asima smirked at the thought that sharra would be lucky to last five minutes in the sort of situation they were heading for kala the youngest was there was simply no way to put it kindly she was a moron pretty certainly though not the prettiest of the four she had been confused from the beginning unaware that pelasia was not part of the empire she had smiled as they left and asked sweetly if she would get to meet the emperor asima had sighed in despair kala was woefully unaware of her own gender and the role they were to play in akkad indeed asima had in a fit of sympathy begun to try and explain why they were being taken to the godking but after having to explain in intimate detail some of the terms she was forced to use she soon gave up and told kala that she would find out soon enough nima completed the tragic group nima was the closest to asima in age appearance and social class she could have been a real problem had she not been prey to no less than three problems her speech impediment was subtle and no true issue until one was forced into say three weeks close confinement with her and so long as she tried to avoid words with an r in them she would be fine there her memory on the other hand would cause more issues she had continually forgotten her companions names throughout the journey and often couldnt think of the correct words for the simplest things the great tragedy of nima though was that she was friendly in the way an excitable puppy was friendly and this led to her talking fast nima loved to talk and when her companions finally became tired of the endless stream of prattle she would look out of the wagons window and talk to herself at these times asima would try her hardest to shut out the noise the three of them had driven her mad throughout the trip one sulking and complaining and trying to run away slowing down the journey on several occasions the other two chattering away like some sort of trained birds in a market and making about as much sense at times she had found herself wondering whether the vizier jhraman had selected the three prettiest and bestbred girls to send with her without actually speaking to any of them or whether he had been exceptionally kind in sending her off with women that would be no competition to her asima sighed when they arrived she would find out more of what she was up against the women in the harem of the godking would be a different proposition entirely to these three mindless drones that she had been sent with it occurred to her briefly that if she really wanted to cause trouble for maahd she should be equally disagreeable and make the satraps gift into a joke angering the godking but mdahz was not her concern asimas chief concern had to be her own future now they arrived at the great gates of the pelasian capital in the late afternoon as the sun sank behind the great white city people said that akkad was built of marble it was called the white city or the city of cloud but asima realised as they passed through the bulbarched gate much of that was a facade the city walls were of stone and mudbrick whitewashed while the gates were faced with marble the various government military or wealthy buildings they passed were certainly white either marble or faced with it but the majority of the ordinary buildings of the working folk of akkad were of brick yet asima could see how the name had come about from a first impression the city dazzled the visitors eyes with the walls the high palaces and towers all gleaming in the sunset and the brick walls down at street level and hidden from view the gate led to a wide boulevard lined with cypress trees at regular intervals the road was paved with perfectly flat interlocking stones in a manner that asima had never seen before the pedestrian walkways to either side where the trees marched ahead up a gentle slope were of a white stone that looked a little like marble but was a powdery white and failed to gleam at regular points along the street rings were driven into large blocks for the tethering of horses and the evidence of an advanced drainage system pointed clearly to the fact that akkad at least occasionally experienced rainfall the mese as she would later learn its name passed through the city from the south eastern gate crisscrossed by many other thoroughfares major and minor and met with another great road coming in from the south west the resulting street also called the mese marched up a continual rise until it reached the great promontory that jutted out into the sea and held the palace of the godking along with the architecture of government and many gardens and terraces the ride through the town was she would have to admit one of the high points of asimas life not only was akkad magnificent in every way visually and architecturally with wide clean streets beautiful white towers surmounted by bulbshaped domes temples and columns statues and arches but there was more than just the sight of glory used to dusty and dry mdahz with its mix of animal and spice smells asima simply could not believe that a city that was home to more than a million people a centre of trade and the home of one of the worlds greatest militaries could smell so fresh the gentle sea air was infused with a flowery aroma lotus and jasmine filled the streets in carefullypositioned gardens and the smell was heavenly there was a slight tang from the spice market but the heady mix merely added to the fresh and scented air rather than ruining the experience asima was astounded to find that she was relaxing despite the constant prattle of her companions ignoring them she leaned out of one of the carriage windows and cast her gaze over the people they passed the pelasians seemed to be quiet gentle and happy a far cry from the satrap maahd and his wicked machinations it was more than possible that life here could even drive the memories of the past few years from her the road finally reached the top of its incline passing out onto the plateau of the headland the centre of the promontory was given over to a great plaza of gleaming white surrounded by fruit trees laden with oranges lemons and limes ahead the most ornate gateway asima could ever have imagined stood amid walls of white marble and bronze decoration above the gate with its statues and friezes its peacockfeather columns and golden latticework rose a great gilded cage with its own bulbdome songbirds twittered and flapped within gracing the square with their musical dialogue off to the left to this side of the great walled enclosure stood the temple district with the great temple of the maker in all its pink marble glory and many many slender belfries the right hand side was occupied by the arcade that marked the near end of the great circus of akkad used for horse racing and public displays she had little time to marvel however the carriage was escorted to the ornate gateway where the godkings personal guards stood here the cataphracti on their armoured horses bowed and took the rest of the escort with them riding off to the rear to some unseen barracks as asima watched with interest a unit of the godkings guard appeared through the arch of the gate after a short pause and took up position around the carriage and the wagon behind them there had been a full minute in between guards when any passerby could have approached the travellers and it was a testament to either the reputation of the godkings guard or the lawabiding nature of the citizens that the carriage remained unvisited throughout the handover process an officer gave the order and the guards began to march forward the carriage trundling between them beneath the great decorative arch of the royal gate with its aviary within the palace was a maze of beautifullytended and carefully organised gardens and lawns punctuated by scattered trees that smelled of fresh citrus fruit between these gardens stood various ornate and beautiful white and pink buildings with apses and arches and rows of windows a grand theatre rose from behind a row of poplars the seating visible between the trees the carriage rolled forward along a wide pathway between two great structures with ornate windows inside the wittering of the two girls was becoming hard to ignore overriding the sounds from outside asima sighed and pushed open the grill on the window drawing aside the net that kept the sand out during desert travel one of the godkings guards walked alongside only a few feet away she smiled at him though he kept his eyes firmly forward am i allowed to ask anything the guard remained stony silent and asima sank back into her seat the place was beautiful and exciting and she was genuinely interested in the buildings they passed still there would be time for her to learn more later the column continued on through the gardens and between buildings for a full five minutes before coming to a stop in front of a huge building square and unexciting this structure stood at one edge of the peninsula a steep incline running from its foundations down to the sea and the rocks below regardless of the inaccessibility of the slope the defensive walls had been continued precariously around above the waterline on a ledge after the wondrous buildings of the palace complex asima was a little disappointed by the great grey square edifice which showed little evidence of decoration or exterior windows they being few and far between she made to enquire of the guard as the carriage door was opened but then changed her mind he would not answer anyway and she had no intention of showing an enquiring mind in front of the vacant passengers that accompanied her she had made sure she was ready and was therefore the first to exit the carriage stepping lightly down to the foldout stair she alighted with the soft crunch of gravel beneath her sandal she raised an eyebrow questioningly at the guard but before she could ask anything a sharp feminine voice snapped from nearby do not dawdle your belongings will be brought on now follow me and be quick about it asima keeping her face carefully neutral stepped around the carriage to see that the doors of the great square building had opened guards stood by the entrance but the figure addressing them from the doorway with its jarring hawklike voice was not exactly what she had imagined instead of the gaunt thin woman with a stern topknot that she had seen in her minds eye the figure in the doorway was a middleaged man quite rotund and dressed in elegant silks and satins as she hurried toward him the other three hot on her heels she studied the man he was wearing makeup and she had to admit grudgingly it was beautifully chosen and applied as she came to a halt before his upraised hand she glanced through the door behind him and was relieved to see that the interior of her future home was in fact beautiful gardens and lawns could be seen within surrounded by porticoes and balconies of course this was not designed to be dull for the occupants but to hide the glories that lay within she smiled wipe that inane grin off your face girl the portly man sighed in a feminine fashion and placed his fists on his hips i am mishad your overseer and tutor i can see we have a lot of work to do so wed best get started you have a long afternoon ahead of you ladies but first we had best peel you out of these things he eyed their attire with distaste and have you bathed oiled and perfumed then perhaps my nose will unblock itself as he turned the guards approached to close the doors behind them you will note that the guards do not follow us he said as he walked through the arched hallway toward the garden there are no guards within the building no men are permitted within the harem kala blinked and turned to tap asima on the arm surreptitiously why is he allowed in then asima sighed and rolled her eyes once weve had a little rest kala and were alone ill explain it to you in which advancement is earned the dark empress rode through choppy waters samir stood near the prow he had been aboard for several weeks now and things were not improving that first morning he had taken the beating of a lifetime though he still remembered with satisfaction how when they had been pulled off him by the first officer he had inflicted enough damage on his attackers that four of them were unable to take their place rowing for a few days now as he prepared to haul on the rope when the shout came he was still a little bruised and numb that first day had been a lesson to his equals on board they had attacked him a number of times since then but these days they did so in small groups with someone on lookout and they only attacked when they were sure of catching him off guard on the bright side they stuck to body blows these days in an attempt to keep their bullying hidden from the elders such behaviour was a double edged gift or burden for samir he had to be watchful and had avoided several attacks through his quick wits and periodically suffered a flurry of clandestine blows but despite this he still considered there to be upsides that he was worthy of such effort suggested that they felt threatened by him which was a powerful thing to know it also cleared his conscience there was nothing that would stop him using them when the opportunity presented itself and thirdly he was pretty sure that one of the crew a man called marcus with one eye and a scarred scalp was aware of the troubles he had caught an occasional look from the man and was at fairly sure he had a potential ally there so now it had become a waiting game he just needed the opportunity to present itself and give him the legup he was looking for in the meantime the enmity of these boys was useful in ways they were unaware of he peered into the spray and the mist which hung low over the sea here and meant they were nearing lassos samir was eager for a glimpse of this almost mythical place the ship had docked there four days after his arrival but at the time hed been suffering rather badly with three broken ribs a puffed up and closed eye an immobile arm and numerous cuts and bruises the ships doctor had refused to let him leave the room put aside for him until he could pass three very simple tests of strength and agility hed almost passed one at the time and been put back down by the doctor until he was better healed since then the dark empress had been back out on another unfortunately unproductive patrol for weeks before returning to its home port as a child in mdahz he and ghassan had heard of lassos of course the pirate isle was infamous in legend of the southern continent somehow though within only a few days striking distance of numerous ports the mysterious island had remained hidden from the navies of two empires and numerous inquisitive explorers some said that the island moved that it drifted on the mist samir had his doubts hed always had his doubts about the reefs of the dead also though weeks onboard had now shaken that from him subtle and careful questions around some of the older sailors made it perfectly clear that whatever he might think they themselves were in no doubt and so as they now approached this most mysterious island samir realised he was holding his breath in anticipation of what he might see you get aloft samir turned in surprise but it seemed the pirates command had been addressed to one of the other young mates nearby samir returned his attention to the prow and tightened his grip on the rope all hands prepare there was a long moment of ominous silence made all the more uncanny by the mist that was now beginning to envelop the prow of the ship samir listened desperately and kept his eyes peeled he could now see only twenty yards in front of him and as he quickly turned his head at most a third of the length of the deck stretching out behind him before it became lost in the wispy grey he whispered a quick prayer to the luck goddess and peered ahead once more bring to the cry went up from the stern commands were relayed in short order around the ship but samir was already hauling on the rope and beginning to furl the sail before he was told as the rope tightened he found himself drawing close to one of the men he didnt know who was busy doing something arcane with a rope on the other side of the mast samir smiled at the man but was ignored as he continued about whatever the task was he continued to haul on his rope and turned briefly to look out over the prow the ship was slowing to a halt now as the sails already deprived of wind in this still environment were furled the twenty or so rowers who had been sent to their seats ten minutes ago were rowing gently against the direction of travel bringing the whole ship to a halt samir dropped the rope in an instant the cord burning his hand as it ran through his palm until he caught it again back he bellowed as loud as he could the man nearby looked up in surprise and then followed samirs gaze and dropped his own rope cupping his hands round his mouth abaft take her abaft the man rushed over to samir who stood gripping the rope mesmerised with fear at the jagged black glistening rock that drifted toward them with slow and deliberate momentum behind them desperate orders were bellowed out shit shit shit shit shit he looked around at the voice and realised the man next to him was making signs to ward off evil gods wont help now samir said quietly and grasped the tip of one of the half dozen spare oars that were sheathed beneath the rail down the side of the ship near the front hauling on it he heaved it over the rail surprising himself with the strength he appeared to find from nowhere gritting his teeth he jammed the oar in a dip between the rails and aimed for the rock that was now almost upon them throwing all his weight behind the oar with a worrying cracking and crunching noise the oar struck home on the rock for a horrifying second samir was convinced it had broken at the end of the blade and they would run afoul of the hazard then the full solid wood of the oar shaft hit the rock and samir was physically lifted from the deck by the blow and hurled several yards back against the mast as he picked himself up he realised the other man had gripped the oar and was desperately fending off the rock the now desperate rowing and careful manoeuvring combined with the push of the oar turned the ship slightly and the rock came alongside drifting along the side of the hull like a menacing sea beast the man let go of the oar and the item dropped into the water and bobbed away slowly once again the ship came to a halt the man was saying something to samir but his attention was otherwise engaged the young man stared out from his position at the rail into the mist this was no solitary rock the reefs were here and as dangerous as imaginable glistening obsidian points rose from the turbulent waters white froth dancing around them and fading only to be replaced by more as the next wave hit the rocks were everywhere ahead of them and beside them behind them somehow and he turned to confirm this yes at the other side too how in the name of the seven faces of harish had they got here right amid the rocks his mind reeled it was he supposed theoretically possible for a ship to fit in some of these narrow gaps between the pointed hazards but the empress was not a small ship and it would be difficult under even the best circumstances in the mist never but the reefs regardless of their danger were only rocks samirs gaze only took them in in passing figures stood on the shards all around them figures in dark wet drab clothes many appeared to be wearing grey robes like those of a priest but duller and darker and wetter and infinitely more frightening the silent figures watched the dark empress as she sat motionless among the rocks and the mist toward the rear of the ship someone was shouting orders sounded like the first officer the commands were very precise how many degrees the wheel needed turning how many rowers should begin and in which seats how many strokes a minute the man at the drum should beat out none of the commands would affect samir in his role here not that he would be listening even if they did his attention was riveted on the figures staring at the ship staring he felt directly at him or into his soul he shivered the nearest figure he hadnt noticed at first and let him to question his eyes a girl of perhaps seven years of age sat in her ragged clothing on the very rock that had almost fouled them her arms reached up outstretched beseeching inviting he shuddered once again as he realised he could just make out the reflection of his silhouette at the boat rail in the girls glassy black eyes sunk deep in her grey face this was clearly impossible not only could he not imagine the ship managing to get into this strangely cramped position but the girl had not been there when hed pushed the oar at the rock somehow this whole thing must be some kind of illusion frowning he picked up a spare belaying pin and cast it at the rock smiling as he realised how simply he had seen through this trickery the wooden pin bounced from the glistening rock with a noisy crack and disappeared into the water with a plop samir sagged slightly impossible yet definitely real the man nearby thumped him lightly on the shoulder dont throw things at them you hit one and youll have some bloody bad luck he looked around nervously maybe well all have some bloody bad luck samir blinked hed been looking forward to seeing this mythical place and suddenly now while he was this close something was making the hair stand up on the back of his neck and he would just as rather be almost anywhere else it felt like he would never be warm or see the sun again such was the damp cold of the mist that stuck his shirt to his chest and the dismal grey all about them fucking captain samir blinked and turned to look at the man that had just smacked him on the shoulder what captain khmun came in too fast should know better samir bridled though he wasnt sure why someone with an ounce of sense ought to knock him down and take over someone who actually knows how to sail opportunity knocks so rarely that sometimes you miss it samir had seen opportunities slip past him several times in his life unaware at the time that they were important the events of the last year however had taught him the value of luck and opportunity and he had been actively waiting for a moment like this for weeks of agonising beatings luck presents opportunities but you still have to grasp them shut up he said vehemently and louder than hed intended without waiting for a reply from the surprised man he turned the other belaying pin hed been grasping on the rail now gripped tightly in his hand he spun with no warning his arm swinging out with its heavy timber weapon his aim was true his aim was always true the narrow end of the footlong heavy wooden pin smashed with force into the mans face there were two instantaneous cracks samir was agonisingly aware that one of them was his finger caught between the mans cheekbones and the timber the other judging from the explosion of blood that showered his own face was the mans nose shattering beyond repair samir straightened and watched as his victim unconscious instantly from the blow toppled backwards onto the deck landing like a sack of grain without turning he closed his eyes biting his lip against the pain in his hand the captain was so close behind him he could feel khmuns eyes boring into his neck almost feel his breath opportunity knocks why borderline mutiny sir with respect you need to watch him the captain fell silent though samir could almost see him nodding thoughtfully when weve docked clean yourself up and tell the watch that i want to see you samir turned slowly and carefully keeping his eyes deferentially low and nodded of course captain khmun laughed the bowed head is a nice touch you i can use samir smiled to himself all you have to do is answer in which pecking orders are established asima stood by the golden latticework window and peered down there were precious few external windows in the royal harem and most of those were inaccessible to the girls it had taken her a long time to find a window that looked out toward the rest of the palace complex rather than over the sea such a window was to be found in the antechambers of the mistress of the gates the woman whom the girls had privately nicknamed the witch of akkad was in charge of the security of the harem and the keeping of order and initially asima had run afoul of her several times she had been trying hard to fit in and to become a model occupant and yet the rules were so strict or at least those enforced by the witch were that asimas natural curiosity had led her into conflict until she began to learn how to play the game fortunately over those first few weeks a greater problem arose for the mistress of the gates in the form of the continually rebellious sharra who seemed to have little regard for personal safety and no fear of punishment the girl had made four bungled attempts to leave the harem in the first week including a laughably traditional blanket rope down the walls to the precipitous sea cliffs and so asimas curiosity had begun to go overlooked she had explored every place she could get to within the harem though there were a number of doors that were securely locked and barred that sealed off whole areas in this time of adjustment her opinions of the whole situation here and of the nature of the pelasian royal household had been changed rapidly as her eyes had opened to what pelasia had to offer other than the wicked satrap maahd she had taken the natural leap in assumptions that the harem was little more than a decorative prison to contain those women the godking took to his bed how wrong she had been the harem was so much more truly it was home to those women who were wives and concubines of the godking or lovers who had the potential to become one of the official companions but the harem was more than this it was also the home to the female members of the godkings family including his mother four aunts two sisters and six girl children more than a prison the harem was a place of protection and seclusion for the royal women and a place where girls were taught the ways of the court and pelasian society in order to make them fitting brides for the godking or for other nobles or princes if the godking decided not to take them so asima had learned over those first few weeks that most of her waking time was already allotted to lessons in etiquette history deportment the application of makeup massage and the use of oils the geography of pelasia literature and so much more she had never dreamed there could be so much to learn it had been at least two weeks before she had settled in enough to plan her time efficiently there were twelve hours of lessons each day given that the daily routine for bathing dressing and making up took a little over two hours that meals took up at least an hour of the day and that the girls were expected to sleep for eight hours to prevent unsightly shadowing of the eyes that left asima with less than an hour of freedom each day careful planning had led to a streamlining of the preparation process which granted her an extra hour in the morning and to the discovery that there were three hours in the late evening once the girls were assumed to be settled in bed when the witch and her cronies would play games of dice drink sweet wines and smoke the water pipe and the corridors were free to roam and so it was the late evening when asima did her exploring three weeks or so after her arrival asima had been sneaking around the upper galleries above the gate area the night indeed when she had discovered the very window she now stood at when she had bumped into yasmin for the first time she had nearly died of fright as she slowly and silently crept around a corner walking on the sides of her feet to keep the pressure she applied to the floorboards as narrow as possible and collided with a smaller girl coming the other way they had both made an involuntary squeak the sort that someone who is where they know they should not be makes when they manage not to shriek as the two had picked themselves up they had looked one another up and down appraisingly yasmin was beautiful and obbviously lithe she had to be a little older than asima but was clearly still a student here as asima had seen her in classes in a mere glance the girls had instantly summarized one another both clearly aware of what the other was up to a smile had broken the moment and a wary alliance had quickly formed between the two girls as the older girl yasmin would be presented to the godking a year before asima she would therefore have seniority and a full year to ingratiate herself before asima became a threat thus yasmin was comfortable with the newcomer for at least a couple of years similarly asima knew there was nothing she could do about her new ally at this point short of physical violence and that yasmin would know many things about the harem and could be of use for the moment the two girls recognised that they were the cream of the crop among the young ladies waiting for their time after that things had become easier and much more interesting yasmin had warned asima who to watch for and who could be trusted over the following weeks a campaign of advancement had begun as far as the other occupants of the harem were concerned asima and yasmin barely knew one another even by sight and such anonymity granted surprising power messages were passed secretly and evidence planted to lower the status of those who currently stood out above the two girls ladies who were so straight and noble asima wondered how they managed to bend in the middle found themselves disciplined for possession of stolen sweetmeats and smoking pipes gradually and slowly and with infinite subtlety asima and yasmin moved up the ranks of the almost four dozen girls in training each year on the feast of the maker the girls of age would be presented to the godking in the temple and he would choose three in sacred memory of the three aspects of the creator three girls would become wives or concubines out of perhaps twenty or more the rest would wait until the next state occasion when they would all be presented at the palace to the hungry eyes of princes satraps and senior commanders of the pelasian military as potential brides or concubines asima and yasmin had been determined to be among those chosen and since they would be selected a year apart they were no threat to one another until they were both in the royal court almost two months after she arrived at akkad asima had caught sight for the first time of the godking of pelasia he was nothing like she had expected for no real reason the picture she had formed in her mind was of an overweight overbearing and overdressed fop who would have carpets rolled out before him as he walked and rose petals cast beneath his feet the ancient tales in the empire spoke of the pelasian godkings as such this man was so far from that asima had found she had trouble adjusting her thinking she had been standing and recovering with three of her classmates after a gruelling athletics lesson at the edge of the gardens and close to the gate passage when the gate had been opened and the light from beyond flooded into the dark aperture picking out the decoration on the walls and ceiling the godking had come for one of his wives asima had learned that no king of pelasia retained his name to call him by name was disrespectful he was simply the godking but even he as a man was forbidden entry to the harem not that he would have tried it seemed pelasias absolute ruler was a man in his early sixties at a guess he could be older and very well preserved but he was certainly no younger tall and lean he dressed in simple black almost like one of his soldiers the only thing that marked him being the symbols of the royal line stitched into his cloak in gold and the very simple gold circlet on his brow he was clean shaven and with short grey hair and piercing bright green eyes that reminded asima of a cat caught in the light almost the precise opposite of asimas imagined ruler the godking was a simple and noble man handsome in an almost indefinable way who carried such weight and gravitas that even standing in a room full of kings emperors and princes he would still stand out asima instantly recognised that this was a rare figure indeed and could understand now why the wives and concubines she had occasionally encountered spoke with such love and reverence of the man asima had smiled at that moment and had settled into her role determined that her future would be at the side of this unsettlingly attractive older man asima and yasmin after the second month began to divide their time better now that the order of precedence in the harem had changed enough to move them both close to the top their campaign of character assassination slowed now they need only keep themselves among the top runners while allotting more time to learning those things that would make them stand out among their contemporaries since that day she had seen the godking before the harem gates several more times it transpired that one of his most favoured pastimes was hunting and once he had returned from a morning out with his court he would often call at the harem and take one of his wives or concubines with him to the palace until the morning discrete enquiries had further strengthened her resolve and bolstered her favourable impression of the godking it would appear that despite his reputation for his appetite seemed the most appropriate word the godking was charming and respectful and often took one of his favourites merely to spend the evening playing games of towers or listening to poetry or taking night time walks among the gardens by the start of asimas fourth month at akkad she had been a little disturbed to realise that she was happier now than at any time in her life moreover she had more direction determination and resolve that ever before and the potential for a fabulous future living beyond the imaginable means of even the wealthiest merchant toward the end of the fifth month however the pace in the harem changed in seven more weeks the festival of the maker would begin in akkad and across the country there would be a series of events in the capital over several days culminating in the events at the great temple where the godking would choose three new ladies preparations in the harem became manic and lessons would be cancelled for the younger students for a whole month in order to concentrate on preparing those older girls for the upcoming event asima had suddenly found she had unexpected time on her hands and saw considerably less of yasmin it was good to become accustomed to that though for in the very near future she would likely see nothing of her for a while those girls who were being groomed for the festival began to be taken out of the harem on escorted occasions and shown other areas of the palace introduced to those people they would need to know they were permanently occupied with preparations and the younger girls virtually ignored and that was why it had been such a surprise when yasmin had found asima daydreaming in one of the solar rooms and dragged her hurriedly to the stairs and back up to the very corridor where they had first collided along a little further and they had reached the witchs antechambers and this very window and now asima stood at the window frowning at the palace grounds as yasmin tapped her fingers on her folded arms tensely what are we waiting for just be patient the other girl replied they could hear muffled by the distance and corridors the ringing of bells asima shook her head thats your call yasmin you have classes i dont care asima blinked if you miss your classes youll be punished and it will be noted among the people that really matter here yasmin smiled broadly yes i know what asima said incredulously are you trying to ruin everything weve been working towards as a matter of fact i am asima turned her head and stared in the shadowed hall at the nearest thing she had in akkad to a friend what gently but firmly yasmin grasped asimas shoulder and turned her back to the window look asima baffled and shocked did as she was told a small group of riders had come in from somewhere out of view to the left there were eight no nine their horses were steaming and had obviously been ridden hard all of them wore the plain black of soldiers though one wore a cloak with gold designs similar to that of the godking and as he dismounted and slowly removed the black scarf wound around his head also wore a circlet asima stared and the strangest thing happened the man with the circlet turned and cast his gaze across the wall of the harem almost as though he knew he was being observed asima caught her breath the man was like a younger version of the godking himself handsome and tall he was clearly one of the royal line not one of the godkings sons though since they both had yet to reach manhood while this specimen had clearly done so a while ago who is he yasmin grinned he is the reason i miss my lesson he is the reason i shall be punished several times in the coming weeks and he she sighed and asima recognised the hopeless adoration in the sound he is the reason i shall not be selected by the godking yasmin i will grant you that hes handsome but the godking is both god and king there is no one in all the world higher than he why settle for the moon when the sun is within reach yasmin stared at her as though she were insane look at him asima just look at him he will be mine you can have the godking i will have prince ashar parishid for my own you know him yasmin nodded grinning like a fool we have spoken he has been in the palace for a while during our escorted visits he apparently used to spend much of his time at velutio but since the empire has collapsed hes come home i stumbled on a walk through the main palaces garden the witch went to whack me but prince ashar stepped in and stopped her he helped me up asima a prince helped me up asima smiled a calculating smile as she examined the man below then i hope things go well for you yasmin i really do and she really did she knew the ropes in the harem well enough now and had no use for yasmin and the idiot girl had just taken herself out of the running there was nobody left that asima considered a threat she would be a queen soon enough in which calphoris encounters pelasia the ship lunged forward through the waves like a hungry animal in sight of food the call had gone up a few minutes ago that a pelasian sail could be seen around the headland and the wind of god a former imperial navy vessel now crewed by the calphorian militia furled the sails and began to hammer out a rhythm for the three banks of oarsmen ghassan too young still to serve in an official capacity with the militia stood ready in the stern of the ship resigned to his lot after months of bailing out water by hand during heavy storms scrubbing the deck in the searing sunshine and helping clean the wooden bowls after the serving of meals he was really rather grateful to have such an exalted position as rudder monitor while there were officers marines pilots oarsmen and so many other important positions on board ghassans most important duty to date appeared to have been sitting quietly out of the way and making sure that no lines or random flotsam became entangled with the rudder a month ago one of the militias ships had encountered just such a problem during an engagement with pirates and had been unable to manoeuvre they had been lucky to escape with their lives and now it was standard practice for one of the juniors to be set on permanent duty during any engagement watching for exactly that problem ghassan clicked his tongue irritably as he glared malevolently at the rudder the wind of god and he still had no satisfactory answer as to which god that was anyway had so far in his five months of service tracked two pirate vessels and lost them in the open sea apprehended a smuggler in a small trading ship and driven off several unlicensed fishing vessels and now that they finally were facing a pelasian he was at the back in the dark watching a plank of wood still back here he was close enough to listen in on the conversation of the officers on the deck above its a pelasian alright and a military vessel to boot were on a line for attack captain but you need to give the word ghassan sitting in the shadows beneath separated from the oarsmen further forward by wooden bulkheads nodded vigorously to himself and willed the captain on its a thorny problem sater the captain replied in the silent darkness ghassan shook his head these are contested waters what we do here sater will set a fairly important precedent if we attack and the satrap of mdahz has his vessels in these waters with the full backing of his government we could find that weve inadvertently started a war between calphoris and pelasia ghassan could almost hear the first officer nodding thoughtfully but if hes just testing the waters captain and we let him be were more or less granting the pelasians control of these waters can we afford not to act sir the captain made a grumbling sound and then shouted along the deck whats she doing still coming on slowly sir shes not picked up speed i dont think shes in an attack position but shes definitely a military vessel the captain replied yes sir new too didnt think this satrap had such big new ships ghassan frowned and listened on sater i need your honest opinion the captain said flatly our lives and careers might all ride on the next few minutes there was an uncomfortable silence ghassan glared angrily at the rudder as though it were trying to ruin his life how could they not see did they not know the pelasians before he even realised what he was doing ghassan was on his feet the perils of clogged and tangled rudders entirely forgotten as he passed the doorway between the bulkheads he entered the main rowing section of the ship powered by both sail and oars depending on requirements these daram vessels as they were known in the south were the standard military ship of the old empire equipped with a ram three banks of oars three sails a housing at the rear for all senior command functions and a tower amidships armed with ranged weapons they were the perfect military vessel the problem was that over the centuries since their innovative appearance the style had been copied and converted for their own use by the pelasians and private fleets indeed many pirates used daram they had captured the oarsmen turned to stare as this young man strode insolently past them though they never once faltered from their professional rhythm along the length of the hull below decks the first two ranks of oarsmen sat the inner row several feet higher than the outer and interspaced so that the oars had plenty of room without acknowledging any of their looks ghassan stormed past them and to the stairs that led up on deck as he climbed towards the daylight ghassan swallowed nervously he wasnt absolutely sure what he was doing but someone had to do something and nobody else seemed to want to act still it was a dangerous choice to leave his post was to invite a flogging alone for though still underage for active service he was still paid by the militia and had taken the oath to approach the captain and speak out of turn well if he was unlucky he might find himself in an hour or so bobbing around in the middle of the wide sea with nothing but a plank to call friend as he reached the deck he turned for a moment and glanced over his shoulder the pelasian ship was heading straight for them and he knew couldnt say why or how but he knew with absolute certainty that if they didnt act fast the pelasians would be on them captain he now began to run along the deck the top row of oarsmen in the open air stared at him in surprise the upper deck rank would only join the beat and dip oar to water when full speed was called for now some of the junior officers were stepping to intercept him he could see the marines standing in position they were formed up but clearly not ready for action their weapons sheathed the captain and first officer turned to look at him as he ran toward them he managed to get within almost ten feet before the crew grabbed him and pulled his arms round behind his back what the hell do you think youre doing boy the speaker was a marine officer the commander of a boarding party by the emblem on his upper arm ghassan had a good memory for insignia with respect sir i must speak to the captain the man grinned condescendingly oh you must must you what is the meaning of this bellowed sater the first officer as he approached the fracas urchin from below says he must speak to the captain sir sater looked ghassan up and down the first officer had a good reputation among the men and ghassan bowed his head respectfully talk to me boy ghassan nodded this was more than he could hope for sir i dont know how to explain this but youve got to attack the various men holding him laughed though ghassan noted with a small amount of relief sater did not and why does a rudder monitor sitting in the dark barely old enough to shave believe he has reason and right to dictate command policy the comment sounded condescending and yet there was something about the way the first officer looked at him that suggested it was a truer question than the others knew moreover ghassan had presumed a boy like him was basically invisible to the senior crew and yet sater had known his job respectfully sir im from mdahz ive met the satrap maahd stood with our militia against him i know how he thinks and what hes capable of go on imperceptibly the officers grip on his arms loosened enough to prevent the discomfort he had been feeling sir maahd didnt have ships before the invasion and the only coastline he controls is mdahz its common knowledge that mdahz has been abandoned nobody raised an eyebrow when he invaded us and theres virtually no trade traffic at the port these days so he has no real need to defend his territory besides sir these waters dont even belong to mdahz he swallowed also maahd is not popular with the pelasian godking he had to send offerings to mollify him after invading mdahz so its very unlikely this incursion is supported by the pelasian government then theres the fact that this is a brand new ship that means since maahd has no other coastline that hes set up a military shipyard in mdahz if he just wanted to protect the port itself hed have bought second hand ships off one of the other satraps sater was nodding to himself as he listened ghassan rattled on sir maahd is almost unstoppably greedy conniving and treacherous he is by now aware that mdahz is hardly the prize he expected and is probably already deciding which tower of calphoris would look best with his banner hanging from it sater frowned i understand what youre saying lad but why then send just one vessel into our waters its not a tactically sound move ghassan fell silent he honestly didnt have an answer to that but he knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that the closing black sail meant grave danger the quiet was broken by the captain ghassan hadnt even been aware that the man had joined them its quite simple when you think about it if the boys right and maahd is building a fleet with the intent of conquest then he cant make a play for somewhere as important as calphoris without his godkings backing if hes unpopular then he needs an excuse a reason for invasion to take to his godking sater shook his head in amazement hes expecting us to attack them theyll fight us off and then run away then well have initiated combat and hell have his excuse then we must sail on by we cant attack them sir the captains face was a mask of doubt and ghassan realised he had reached a crucial moment with respect sir all that may well be true but i know how maahd works if you dont attack him theyll have the advantage on you and well never leave here to tell the tale he wont want word of their presence leaking out or his plan falls through both sater and the captain were nodding now the marine officer narrowed his eyes permission to have my lads stand to and load the artillery captain the captain frowned for a moment and then nodded very well we cant stand down or they may just sink us without a fight and we certainly cant let them get away if we do fight so quite simply we have to win and we have to sink them he turned to the others around him have the men stand to and everything made ready but do it carefully subtly and quietly dont let them know were preparing ghassan felt the grip on his arms disappear you the captain said pointing at him you have an uncanny insight into this get aloft in the rigging and keep your eyes open ghassan saluted and as he ran off he heard the captain ordering someone else to the rudder things were looking up as he ran past the midship fortification he saw the artillery master loading the giant crossbows and the catapult and most impressive of all rolling the massive inflammable ball of wadding onto the firing mechanism while a man stood to with a lit taper he scrambled with a recentlypracticed expertise up the rigging to the spar at the top where the current lookout an older boy nearing active service age nodded a greeting whats up ghassan pointed at the evernearing ship seen anything odd yet not really the other boy shrugged where are the marines then ghassan asked with a grin thats a military vessel about to meet a potential enemy in open sea the marines should be on deck as the lookout blinked in surprise and nodded ghassans smile widened weve got them by the balls without offering any further explanation and leaving the lookout with a blank expression ghassan jumped down from the spar and slid down the ropes as fast as he could go dropping the last ten feet to the deck he went into a roll and came up running until he reached the artillery master with his crew among the wooden battlements amidships sir the officer turned and frowned at the grinning boy what we can end this in minutes sir he noted the doubt on the mans face and pointed back at the pelasian ship no sign of their marines sir but a ship like that should be ready with them on the deck that means theyre hiding ready to board sir and they cant be below deck cause they wouldnt have time that means they have to be crouched down among the upper deck oar seats along the edge the artilleryman frowned you sure about this if youre wrong we could be in real trouble ghassan grinned im not wrong aim the catapults and the firethrower along the gunwales and well take out most of their marines in two shots after that she should be easy sir the officer frowned for a moment and then nodded youd better be bloody right lad ghassan his grin still wide saluted and tuning ran to climb the rigging once more he was right he knew beyond certainty that he was right he also knew that the captain was watching him with interest and that any minute now and because of him they would sink the first ship satrap maahd had sent to the east first blood maahd this one was for his mother and all of those who died on the walls of mdahz that terrible day in which five years have passed asima sat back against the red velvet cushion and examined her nails critically no matter how much time she spent on them they never quite seemed to look right tetchily she reached around for the goblet of rich sweet palm wine and took a less than ladylike gulp she also noted with a strange mix of irritation and nostalgia the slightly crooked angle of the index finger on her left hand as she buffed a smile crept across her face as she remembered that time three years ago when she had been among the girls taken to the great temple for the choosing she had and this had really surprised her been entirely unaware of the conspiracy of hatred that had grown among the other girls during those two years of preparation she hadnt realised just how petty angry and even subtle the others had been the morning before the ceremony while the festival was in full swing outside the girls had been allocated five hours to prepare themselves and asima had discovered with growing impatience that everything she needed to help her get ready had been vandalised or disposed of the fight that had ensued had ended satisfactorily for asima in most respects she had managed to acquire everything she would need from the four girls she knew to be behind the worst of the activities she had fought hard but had been clever keeping her blows to areas that would not show and would be hard to prove the only permanent mark she had received had been her own fault a broken and now slightlymisaligned finger from a badlyaimed blow that she would need to keep hidden for a time the others however had fought like wildcats randomly and angrily their blows had been aimed for maximum discomfort instead and asima had smiled through her painful split lip as she returned to her room she knew exactly what she was doing at the mirror she had examined the mess the girls had made of her reaching down with the brush she had been about to apply the concealing makeup over the already blackening eye but had smiled wiped the blood from her lip and tended instead to her hair once they were ready the twenty six girls had been taken to the gate of the harem where the witch had examined the ranks critically she had moved down the two lines nodding with satisfaction until she reached asima her eyes had bulged so dangerously that asima had been afraid she was going to have some sort of attack but instead she had merely shaken her head in despair as she noted the bruises and the red weal on asimas forehead the mistress had long since given up any hope of impressing her will on this one and then the guards had escorted the girls across the paths and between the lawns to the private gate that led from the palace grounds directly into the precinct of the great temple without having to enter the public square asima had smiled to herself once again as they mounted the steps and entered the narthex keeping to one side and out of sight of the closed doors into the temple proper there they had rested for several minutes awaiting their cue asima had been aware of the girls glaring at her and had given them a surreptitious wave and a sweet smile that had reopened the lip and send a slow trickle of blood across her teeth a huge gong had announced that the ceremonies had reached the appropriate point and two of the lesser priests had opened the gate as the royal guard lined the narthex along either side they couldnt enter the church under arms at any time and were here merely as an escort but the girls hardly needed them two years of training had prepared them thoroughly for this moment as the doors swung wide the two lines of girls side by side had entered the great domed temple walking slowly and solemnly down the open walkway between the rows of seated nobility priests and wealthy citizens the godking still in plain robes yet oozing a commanding presence stood on the dais to one side of the altar attended by three priests and his nephew the prince ashar asima sighed as she looked around the rows of so many people as subtly as possible yasmins hopes of becoming ashars princess had been dashed last year she had carefully worked everything out and deliberately failed to appeal to the godking when she along with the other girls had been presented to the nobles the month after she missed the godkings selection she had positioned herself and pouted just enough to attract the princes attention and ashar had chosen her for the first dance asima watching from the gallery where the younger girls were to observe the events of a state occasion had initially been pleased for her friend but yasmins hopes had been shattered a moment later she had smiled up at the prince and slowly as passionately as she could she had pursed her lips and leaned in to kiss the prince ashar had pulled back ever so gently he had not made it obvious for fear of embarrassing her but had clearly rejected her even from the gallery asima had seen the look of confusion and dismay in yasmins eyes the prince had leaned forward and whispered something to her six days later yasmin had entered the harem to collect her things and follow her new husbandtobe the satrap khelid and asima had stopped her im sorry about ashar she had confided but you know many of the noblemens preferences lie in another direction yasmin had smiled sadly not ashar asima but he put me straight he doesnt like the court or these occasions hed only been there because the godking asked him and he said quite clearly that he was not looking for a wife for many years yet i had the distinct feeling he was already pining for someone else the witch had appeared then and hurried yasmin along to the satrap who waited patiently outside the harem for her and after all that time here was yasmin once again in the great temple watching events unfold for asima and standing at the side of khelid not far from the dais asima had been pleased to see what appeared to be a genuine smile on her friends face khelid was a handsome enough man and as he had turned and looked down at yasmin there was adoration in his gaze asima had smiled as the lines approached the dais slowly in time with the quiet beat of the drums the girls had stepped into position and then turned bowing from the waist to the assembled crowds before returning to face the godking the prince and the priests the high priest had rattled on with an incantation and then a speech that asima only half heard she wasnt a follower of any god let alone the pelasian maker patiently she had waited aware at all times of the warm gentle trickle of blood into her mouth the speech had finished and finally the godking had stepped forward here goes asima had said to herself and held her breath only to discover that the godking had begun to make a speech now too shed sagged slightly and then remembering where she was had straightened slowly finally the speeches had come to an end and a fanfare blared asima had found her patience ebbing and hoped this would be it finally the godking had taken one more step and reached the end of the front line of girls slowly he had moved along the row casting his gaze over them the rear line in which asima had been disgruntled to find herself had been spaced so that they were fully visible between the front girls asima determined had smiled but with an air of insolence given her condition a meek wet grin would hardly give the right effect the godking had nodded and whispered things in his nephews ear ashar had shrugged a couple of times and whispered back clearly the godking valued ashars opinion highly with a nod they had come on ponderously this was no mere ceremony for the godking the decisions he made here would affect his personal life for at least the next year more nods and consultation and then the godking had stopped directly in front of asima it was the first time he had come to a complete stop during the ceremony asima had smiled in satisfaction as the godking had reached across to ashar who was busy studying the girl they had last discussed and tapped him on the upper arm pointing at asima the music in the background would make it exceedingly difficult for anyone close by to hear let alone the general public in their seats but asima was close enough and sharp enough to catch the whole exchange spoken beneath their breath look at this one ashar had peered at her and despite her resolve and her surety asima found herself suddenly experiencing doubt there was something about the blackclad prince that unnerved her it was as though he was staring directly into her soul and dissecting her motives the prince frowned at her and shook his head he knew he couldnt possibly have known how asima had schemed and worked everything since her arrival here how she had ruined the chances for her main competitors and played every opportunity to her own advantage even that mornings beatings but somehow prince ashar parishid distrusted her this one is more trouble than shes worth uncle sometimes a little trouble is good for the soul ashar the prince had nodded unhappily that is very insightful and certainly true my king but mark my words this one will do you no good her smile is bright and her mood is mischievous but her soul is black take her if you must but remember what i say the godking had straightened and in a breach of etiquette that had never been seen in generations of this ritual he had spoken to one of the girls he had smiled at asima and addressed her directly my nephew warns me off you young lady what have you to say for your unique appearance this morning asima had lowered her head slightly in respect and taken a deep breath majesty i am considered a threat by many of my peers and they act according to their fears i do not fear and shall not hide what i am if your majesty deigned to choose me you will know from the very beginning what i am the godking had laughed outspoken and honest that will truly be a change among my companions he had given her a nod of respect and moved on along the line ashar however had let his glance stay on her for some time boring into her very being finally he had shaken his head sadly honest indeed it had not been meant to be heard but asimas hearing was sharp as the ceremony had concluded one of the priests had come along the lines and selected the three girls that would be taken in by the godking and his household asima had been so sure that she had already been stepping forward when the priest came to her she had noticed that day in the great temple that one of the other two chosen girls was sharra her companion now for years and the most rebellious and insolent girl that the witch had ever dealt with clearly the absolute ruler of pelasia had a soft spot for insolence a bird flew past the ornate window casting its shadow briefly over asima and pulling her back in from her reverie she sighed and left her nails alone at last turning her attention ostensibly to the book before her but in truth looking over the top at the three girls at the other end of the solar the game had been far from over when she had been selected no indeed the game had then begun in earnest in the three years she had occupied the concubines section of the harem she had continued her campaign of discrediting the competition though any activity she undertook outside the harem remained above board due to the watchful eyes of the everpresent prince ashar she smiled behind the book as she examined lady dierra her next target she had been itching to cause a fall in the standing of the godkings favourite concubine for months though dierra kept asima at arms length and was guarded about her actions news had arrived this morning that prince ashar was to leave akkad for a time on a mission to velutio the capital of the empire and with no ashar to watch over the godkings women asima would move swiftly up the ranks she was no longer a girl but a woman of sixteen years and some weeks and she was already a concubine to the most powerful man in the world given enough time to manoeuvre within a month or two she would be in a position to be taken as wife instead of concubine then would be the greatest challenge of all to disband the harem and become sole queen in which we see that the years have been kind to samir the dark empress lunged violently through the water rounding the sandy spur that jutted from the island ten minutes ago they had been plodding along using only two sails and no oars the crew resting and relaxed trying to decide whether to drop anchor and go ashore to collect fresh water and then the boy aloft above the main sail had called out a merchantman had appeared around the far side of the island visible over the humped sandbank only from the lookouts position within moments captain khmun had called the orders the sails had been unfurled and altered three rows of oars extended and dropped into the water and the empress sallied forth to confront the target not many years ago samir thought as he watched the boys with the rigging he would have been there hauling on ropes and climbing the sails strange how things worked out but then hed been planning his advance on board since the day he arrived and here he was now at sixteen years old still short for his age but lithe and wiry with his straight hair brushing the base of his neck and shoulders samirs face had filled out giving him a heavy jaw and dark bristles that defied his attempts to stay clean shaven attempts that had ceased a year ago now with a sigh he squared his shoulders allowing the chainmail shirt to settle into a more comfortable position over his heavy tunic blinking away a sudden spray of salty water he grasped the hilt of the heavy blade at his side and cast his glance over the men on the deck before him alright lads lets not have any cockups like last time a sailors precious little use with one arm felix and his men will take the wheel and rudder and then move to the sails and the hatch our job is to neutralise whatever marines they have on board so that felix can do his job got it there was a rumble of assent from the men of samirs boarding party theyll probably not have any marines anyway samir he narrowed his eyes its possible but not likely in the last couple of years weve earned a bit of a reputation jaral ive heard the merchants have started to eat into their own profits to hire mercenaries and guards chances are therell be warriors on any vessel in these waters again there were nods of agreement samir sighed it was definitely getting harder khmun and sharimi had consulted with the senior sailors and suggested the possibility of heading east or north moving to more traditional imperial waters where the dark empress was as yet unknown they could still be just about within reach of lassos and yet raid waters towards germalla samir had panicked for a moment at the thought of moving so far away from mdahz his intention had always been to reach a position among the pirates of lassos in which he could begin to use them to move against maahd and reclaim his home he had already allowed himself to lapse once into a wasteful life in the docks of mdahz and forgotten his overall purpose he would not allow himself to do that again marshalling every argument at his disposal samir had turned his considerable talents at persuasion to keeping the captain and crew of the empress close to the southern coast soon though he would have to find a way to gather the various captains together and move on mdahz the idea of promoting it to them as a second lassos a potential pirate haven in the border zone had played around in his mind a few times but the position was so dangerous and the fight to claim it would be so tough that he would need a great deal more incentive to make it an attractive proposal he shook his head in the meantime he had a job to do everyone ready there was a murmur of assent from his men once again they would not shout no reason to risk giving too much warning to the oblivious merchant merrily wandering along at the other side of the sandbank slowly almost ponderously the merchant came into view around the slope at the end of the sand bar there was as always a pregnant pause while the quiet predator raced in at an angle toward them then suddenly someone on board must have spotted the dark empress for cries went up aboard and there was a sudden burst of panicked activity the merchant began to lean away from them and turn on an escape path samir laughed quietly this was a slow mercantile vessel little more than a barge with a sail theyd not get very far before the swift exmilitary empress was on them obviously their military complement was not overly large given their desperate attempt at flight the boarding party were clearly as eager as he and as he listened he could hear someone in felixs party abaft urging the empress on toward her prey he smiled as he stood tensely watching the impressive speed with which the powerful pirate vessel gained on the cumbersome merchant as the minutes passed the details became visible on the target ship the crew were running around as though their panicky desperation could prevent the inevitable samir gripped the rigging next to him as the empress lurched slightly in the wake of the merchant the trader captain had done very well to turn such a slow beast away from them in this time and in such a tight curve he must really be very good he nodded to himself as he watched he was about to ruin a mans livelihood but such were the perils of the sea and better they met the empress than some of the other ships that worked out of lassos khmun had once been part of the imperial navy long ago and held certain principals that were sadly lacking among most of the pirate captains the captain of the dark empress while now infamous for the sheer number and value of his achievements had also managed to maintain a reputation that unchecked would turn him into some sort of folk hero samirs captain always gave the opposition the opportunity to surrender their cargo without further incident if this was not acceptable then he would take the vessel and its cargo by force but always with as little injury and loss of life as possible most of the captains would simply kill most of the captives ransoming the more important ones khmun held to the principal of mercy and always allowed the crew to leave on board their own lifeboats if the enemy had been particularly courageous and deserving he may even take their cargo and leave them with their ship intact this set of very military principals had spread to one or two of the other captains who could see logic as well as mercy in the method dead merchants were no danger but neither could they buy new ships reequip and then bring fresh cargoes your way there was a small movement of what samir considered gentlemen captains among the more vicious cutthroats of lassos another lurch and they were almost on the enemy vessel with a few crisp commands from captain khmun the empress swung out sharply to starboard and then back on line within a few moments they would start to come alongside the merchant at which point samir and his boarding party would swing over and put paid to the marines on board clearing the way for felix as the two ships closed something occurred to samir they would have to manage the boarding action very carefully as the side of the merchant vessel was considerably higher than that of the empress he frowned how could that be this was a laden and slow merchant it should be floundering around several feet below their own deck level and the empress was light and riding tall shit the men of his party turned to him in surprise sir somethings wrong rin i think were in trouble without waiting for questions samir ran across the deck and glanced up at the lookout can you see anything unusual the lookout looked down in surprise and then quickly spun around and cast his gaze across the horizon samir heard the string of expletives very clearly you blind ass he bellowed up how many and of what by now other members of the crew had caught on to the sudden flurry of activity amidships the lookout shook his head one ship but shes a daram the same as us flag the lookout squinted and shaded his eyes with his free hand cant quite see sir but i think its pale green or pale blue samir was already running toward the captain at the stern before the boy had finished sir daram closing in behind us and the idiot boy lookout cant tell who it is but its clearly not pelasian could be calphorian or some private force also the merchants got far too much freeboard whereas she should be wallowing low in the water sir shes not carrying any cargo were in the jaws of a trap khmun rubbed his chin for a moment any marines on board the trader not that ive seen sir i think it was just bait the captain nodded then felix can board her well set her crew adrift and fire the vessel if we can get her ablaze we might be able to use her against the other daram in the meantime though well have to fight them off and make sure they dont board us think you can do it samir samir laughed soldiers dont know how to fight dirty captain well keep them quite busy until youre ready for whatever you want to do the captain clasped hands with him for a moment and then turned his attention to shouting commands among the crew on the way back to his men he passed the second boarding party and felix grasped his elbow as he passed im overmanned for the job samir if theres no marines on there i only need a dozen men you take the rest with you youll need em samir considered arguing for a moment but felix was right he beckoned to half the men in the group and they followed him back along the ship to where samirs party stood waiting the heavy military daram was bearing down on them with speed and purpose any minute now they would be in trouble unless samir and his men could keep them occupied and the captain came up with one of the clever manoeuvres for which he was famed samir turned to his men were going to have to board them to give the captain time to do what he needs to if we just try to stop them getting aboard us well end up fighting among our own oarsmen so as soon as the damn ship gets close enough i want everyone over there once were across gather into groups and we can start doing some damage three groups one by the main sail amidships one making their way toward the rear where the officers are and the third in between alright there were shouts of agreement and samir turned back to examine the ship bearing down on them certainly calphorian what the hell were they doing so far to the west in which a rift forms ghassan leaned against the rail and watched the pirate ship intently the captain was good the moment the lookout had spotted the wind of god the men on board the ship had reformed very quickly rather than panic and try to run which would have been disastrous for them since the militia vessel was running at maximum pace while the pirates had slowed to deal with the merchant as they pulled alongside the captain of the dark empress had continued what he was doing but reorganised his men captain hes only sending a few men on board the decoy hes formed the rest up to stop us the captain nodded sagely he had come to rely quite heavily on the sharp mind and eyes of ghassan and within a year of reaching full service age the young recruit had already been promoted to a junior officer position suggestions ghassan shrugged we still outnumber them sir and this khmun seems to be a clever and honourable man i dont think hell make it a fight to the death we just need to prove to him that we are not willing to back down and hell do so to save his crew the captain continued to nod the militia warship closed with impressive speed on the pirates ghassan twitched as he gripped the hilt of the blade he carried ready he would lead the second boarding party having considerably less experience than lieutenant shufi the empress came ever closer and with a nod ghassan had one of his men ready the grapples as the gap between the two vessels rapidly narrowed ghassan realised flames could be seen beyond on board the merchant ship the bastards have fired her i hope khmun let the crew go first or ill skewer him myself there were nods of agreement among his men he counted down under his breath the seconds until the pirate ship with its complement of mismatched criminals lining the rail reached the point where grapples could be thrown four three two he blinked in surprise as the first rope from the pirate ship crossed the gap and the heavy iron grapple fell among his men what he bellowed in disbelief as he and his men were forced to drop their own grapples and duck out of the way of the iron missiles that shot over from the pirate ship scraping across the deck and anchoring themselves among the rowing seats and on the rail theyre boarding us are they insane there were cries from the men on board the dark empress and the militia vessel lurched as twenty strong bulky pirates hauled on the ropes and dragged the two ships together several of ghassans unit lost their footing as the two vessels met with an almighty crash this khmun was supposed to be unpredictable and clever but this was plain crazy and with no further pause the world exploded into a chaos of noise movement and violence without an order being given the pirates hurled themselves across to the militia ship taking advantage of the surprise and the fact that the soldiers were temporarily off balance behind the boarding party the top deck oarsmen on the pirate vessel currently superfluous unshipped their oars and stood ready to repel any militia boarders that made it past the initial attack given the fact that theyd taken the pirates by surprise with little over a minute to react ghassan couldnt help but be impressed by the precision and coordination the men of the dark empress exhibited he had no time to appreciate the matter as he suddenly found himself under the direct attack of a crazed and excessively ugly pelasianlooking man with a jagged saw edged sword desperately he jumped back out of the way of the first swing of that horrible weapon righting himself he felt the mast behind him taking a deep breath he let a blank mask fall across his face and waited as though in terror the pirate grinned and swung the terrible blade again in a sharp movement ghassan ducked to one side and the blade bit into the heavy timber mast the pirate started in surprise and ghassan righted himself and lunged with his own blade the ugly fellow was surprisingly quick though and as this officer went for him the pirate grasped one of the soldiers by the shoulder and hauled him between them as a shield forcing ghassan to arrest his blow sharply or face impaling one of his own men with a laugh the sawblade pirate flicked a mock salute at him and then disappeared in amongst the flurry of men ghassan took advantage of the brief pause to take stock of the situation the pirates had used the confusion to form into three distinct groups the first was engaged here amidships with ghassans men the mess was wellplanned preventing the other militia boarding party from getting involved instead the second militia unit were trapped behind his own trying in vain to cross between the two ships but held at bay by several rowers flailing dangerously over the gap with their heavy oars he turned to look back along the rear of the ship and saw that the other two groups of pirates were also well placed the furthest group were now engaging the officers at the rear and keeping the helm busy the wind of god would be unable to manoeuvre until the area was freed of attackers but the third group had positioned themselves between the two areas of fighting like a wall of ugly and were severing the ropes and rigging that controlled the sails ghassan shook his head in amazement despite being outnumbered and in a poor position the pirate captain had managed to turn things to his advantage the militia troops were trapped and mostly useless while the pirates were rapidly gaining control of the helm but this was all temporary as soon as the first group here broke under the weight of militia numbers the soldiers would begin to sweep along the deck and would soon deal with them all what did they hope to gain by preventing the militia from manoeuvring what with a sinking feeling ghassan grasped the rigging by the main mast and hauled himself a couple of feet higher so that he could see over the fighting oh shit nearby one of his men looked around in surprise only to be dispatched by a pirate the merchant hulk now fully ablaze was being led around the stern of the pirate ship with ropes and kept at a safe distance with oars slowly but with infinite menace the roaring timber inferno was rounding a corner and bearing down on the bow of the militia ship the pirates werent trying to take the ship they were stopping the wind of god escaping the oncoming flames ghassan dropped back down and brushed his dark curls from his eyes he saw one of his lieutenants pull back from the action and grabbed him by the shoulder simos we need to break through to the captain and get that rudder turned theyre bringing a fireship down on us a frightened look passed across the mans face dont panic ghassan yelled at him just get the men formed up and have them begin trying to turn the tide back so that we can push through until they break the man looked at him in momentary confusion and then saluted and started bellowing orders ghassan nodded all they needed to do was break through they didnt have to kill all the pirate boarders just get through them and help recover the helm and the senior officers the next problem was to buy them some time to pull it all off taking a deep breath he climbed the rigging and began to pull himself along it above the heads of the fighters hed momentarily considered using this route to get to the rear but the middle group of pirates who were not engaged in combat had now fully severed the rigging preventing just such a possibility irritably he clambered toward the bow where the other militia unit were disorganised some of them fighting off the swinging oars of the pirates across the narrow watery channel others trying to get involved in the main melee and yet more merely standing and staring in horror at the blazing inferno bearing down on them shaking his head he caught sight of his opposite number shufi get your men organised you need to get the oars out and use them to try and hold that thing off were trying to free the helm the officer stared up and him and then nodded and began issuing the appropriate orders satisfied that there was little else he could do to improve the situation ghassan once more cast his glance around the ship trying to take stock of how things were progressing he was lucky indeed to have chosen that moment to look around as he saw the knife hurtling toward him through the air in time to avoid it the blade sailed between the ropes where the young man had been moments earlier and clattered down to the deck harmlessly as ghassan dropped to the ground and drew his sword to deal with the new assailant brother ghassans eyes opened wide at the voice as his head came up to see the source of the thrown blade his mouth fell open samir had changed for certain with the passage of so many years but there could be absolutely no doubt as to who this was his knifethrowing hand still frozen in the air the other gripping the blade at his side samir the smaller brother laughed you went to join the army what are you doing at sea ghassan shook his head angrily i went to join the militia and that is what i did to fight pirates ghassan growled and changed hands with his sword we fight whoever needs fighting weve already taken blood against maahd several times but you samir was disappointed to hear a mixture of astonishment and disgust in that last word that was almost spat at him you ghassan repeated you became a pirate you abandoned me to the desert to live a life of crime mother would disown you samirs face hardened thats not true and i never intended this things just happen sometimes ghassan but my goal is ever the same as it was as yours even to take the fight to maahd and free mdahz ghassan spat on the floor crap youre a killer and a thief now when we retake mdahz its people like you well be keeping out samir shook his head sadly these soldiers have you thinking too simply ghassan you fight your war and ill fight mine in a few minutes well be free of you and well leave and because were thinking and reasoning people well leave you be and go our own way we dont need to fight thats a coward talking ghassan growled youre supposed to be a pirate samir a killer samir shook his head i am what i am brother but ill not fight you with a sad look samir turned his back and sheathed his sword striding toward the gap between the boats as he went he called out to his men theyve got enough to deal with now lads get back aboard and cut the ropes well be a long way from here before they can get going he clambered up to the rail and stopped in surprise at the sudden pain in his neck he turned astonished to see ghassan behind him sword raised and blood running down the razor edge dripping to the timbers of the deck ghassan samir put his hand to his neck it was just a small flesh wound that would heal quickly but it was a wound nonetheless he glared at ghassan and spoke through clenched teeth you will have to sort out your rigging before you can make sail again youll have to be careful around the burning merchant and our men have put your artillery out of commission and jammed your rudder you wont be able to follow us or fire on us he growled were leaving now ghassan for the life of every one of your men do not try and follow us across or we will be forced to take a more violent approach he wiped the blood from his neck and flicked it at ghassan spattering red droplets across the uniform and there is blood between us ghassan for the sake of mother at her rest i will not kill you now but rest assured that the next time we meet i will give you no quarter nor i you barked ghassan samir turning to make sure the last of his men were disengaging and crossing back to the empress threw a last vicious glare at his brother and jumped across some days were designed just to test a person to his very soul in which the wheel has turned many times samir prodded the fresh wound above his right eye the last engagement had been one of the most precarious yet he smiled weakly as he looked down into the foamy water racing past below the rail yesterday had been his twenty second naming day and the event had passed him by entirely unnoticed for most of the day indeed hed still not have thought about it now had the crew not made something of it when theyd scuttled the pelasian merchant yesterday afternoon they had cast the survivors adrift in the lifeboats and then spent the next hour stacking and storing the booty that would have to be transported back to lassos where the affectionatelynamed eyeball could add them to the empress takings roster and move them through his channels to various ports of dubious ethics on the eastern coast a few hours later samir had been examining the cargo when he had been accosted and dragged back kicking and arguing up the stairs to the deck it had been a natural assumption that his time had come hed risen through the ranks on board the empress so damn quick that hed put a lot of peoples noses out of joint in the process indeed when sharimi had been laid to rest two years ago the victim of a heavy artillery bolt during a boarding action khmun had barely glanced at any of those who probably had much better claim to the position and had promoted samir to first officer without a moments pause of course it turned out as he was dragged blinking into the sunlight that they had a few naming day surprises for him several uncomfortable and even painful practical jokes and games at his expense and then enough date wine and powerful spirits that he felt lucky to be alive this morning that being said there was a reason hed spent the last hour leaning over the rail and alive might prove to be a relative term he spat away the unpleasant taste in his mouth as he drifted off once more into musings on past events it was no surprise to samir really that khmun had chosen him on sharimis death he had proved himself time and time again over the years his uncanny knack for tactics combined with khmuns genius for innovative thinking in combat had resulted in the empress racking up almost twice as many captures as any other vessel that worked out of lassos the name scourge of the seas had been heard applied variously to the empress herself to captain khmun and recently to his infamous first officer samir and yet despite their fearsome reputation the officers and men of the dark empress were proud of the fact that they could sometimes take a merchant down without inflicting any permanent harm on the crew often the mere threat of violence combined with the name of the dreaded vessel was enough to bring about a peaceful surrender certainly their kills were among the lowest in the ledgers of lassos it all went to bolster samirs growing reputation those who had beaten samir repeatedly in those first weeks on board had changed as much as he the weak greedy or stupid ones had died early on through bad luck or their own actions while the clever and loyal ones had been finally forced to accept the fact that samir appeared to have been born for this life indeed several of them professed a grudging admiration for this man that they had tormented as a boy afad the first face hed seen on board was now a boarding party chief and a trusted lieutenant of samirs he turned his rubbery sweaty pale grey face to the water once more and groaned as a fresh wave of sickness overtook him and all thoughts but the regret of the morning after were forced aside a full minute of such horrendous activity and he finally settled back in ragged breaths to feeling weak and draping himself over the rail occasionally he would hear a gentle laugh somewhere it wasnt that he couldnt hold his drink so much as no one could hold that amount of drink he would occasionally look up when he heard a laugh and give the man a weak smile he could have disciplined them for taunting a superior but this wasnt the navy order relied as much on trust and respect as on discipline besides his head might crack if he tried to shout at someone now where was he ah yes every man on board could be considered a rich man by the standards of samirs youth certainly any one of the officers could have afforded to buy asimas father he blinked and focused on the water rushing past curious while he had been forced to think about ghassan quite a lot over the years hed not given a thought to their childhood friend for so long that it took a moments dredging of memory to construct a reasonable image of her in his head he smiled as he remembered her headstrong and controlling almost always he realised these days playing the emotions and affections of he and ghassan against one another his thoughts drifted to the sands of pelasia for a moment and he wondered how she was doing now even what she was doing now was she still in the harem of akkad knowing her steadfast refusal to bow to the will of others she may well have been executed by the vicious satraps or the royal family by now that thought brought with it an unexpected sadness but he soon brushed that aside no she would be alive probably alive and well asima was a survivor as much as samir probably more so she would probably be running pelasia before long she must be a stunning woman now samir realised with a laugh that he was starting to drool and hoped beyond belief that this was a further effect of the hangover and not some childish infatuation coming back to haunt him besides shed been closer with ghassan most of the time ghassan why the hell had he had to join the naval militia of all the stupid brainless things to do samir had been pressed without choice ghassan could have done anything but no and calphoris liked to think of itself as a continuation of the collapsed empire that continued to wallow treating its militia as if they were still the imperial army all straight laced and order and discipline if only ghassan could see that the driving principals of the militia allowed for no grey areas and had killed off his ability to reason beyond the blind acceptance of orders then he and ghassan his jaw hardened no samir was sick of feeling guilty and sorry for his brother it had been ghassan that had drawn blood when samir refused ghassan had been the one to label him a murderer and bring their mother into it samir had been happy to let things go over the last few years with the increasing reputation of the empress and her crew interest in her capture had grown and it had become the life goal of many militia captains and probably among the pelasians too to capture the pirate ship and put an end to her activity the ridiculous thing was that with such attention being paid to samirs ship those captains who had fewer morals were considerably freer to go about their bloodthirsty and murderous business samir had seen some of the nastiest captains at lassos buy khmun a drink for taking the heat off them the last half dozen years had brought a few near misses between the brothers samir had privately explained the situation to khmun and the captain had agreed that in addition to the desire to save the crew from unnecessary loss of life the fact that someone on board the wind of god may be able to predict their tactics meant that they should avoid contact with that particular vessel at all costs on a personal level samir knew he must stay out of contact with ghassan what had been done could not be undone and they had both sworn to give no quarter when next they met as far as samir was concerned that simply meant that they must under no circumstances meet there had been a number of engagements with ships of the calphorian militia and black vessels bearing the flags of the satraps of pelasia but in all this time khmun and samir had succeeded in pulling out of any engagement that involved ghassans ship the closest samirs brother had managed to boarding the empress was last year when they lay in wait hiding in a cove near the current arbitrary border of satrap maahds lands they had just been getting underway when the wind of god appeared around the headland at full speed and ready for action the artillery master on board the militia daram had managed to strike their foresail with a flaming mass and the resulting combustion and panic had almost cost them their lives khmun and samir thinking quickly had sacrificed a lifeboat to save the ship filling it with combustible materials and quickly severing the ropes so that it dropped to the water behind the dark empress as they did so afad and his men managed with only a few minor wounds and burns to cut the flaming sail free as the drum began to beat out the rhythm and the oarsmen rowed as though the guardian of the underworld were slavering at their heels the crew dumped the burning mass into the lifeboat and watched it explode into a fresh inferno the wind of god had been forced to reverse their oars and arrest her speed as much as possible in order to give them the time and space to turn and avoid the burning obstacle by which time the empress was already accelerating and racing across the waves to freedom by the time theyd gone half a league the replacement sail was already up and the artillery armed and positioned twice in samirs time on board they had come very close to disaster with ghassans ship and both times they had been saved by fire the time was coming when he would have to deal with matters though he would soon be forced to move on either ghassan or the satrap maahd samir had tried several times both on board and back in port at lassos to persuade the captains that mdahz was a prime target and that maahd needed removing for their own safety that last was true as well maahd had constructed quite a navy over the years since he had taken mdahz and the black ships plied the coast dangerously close to calphoris and even close to the island of lassos though should they ever find it which was said to be impossible they could never navigate the reefs of the dead there was another long pause in samirs train of thought as he retched repeatedly failing to bring up anything he slumped once more his mind spinning what was he thinking about oh yes the reefs no maahd that would have to wait hed finally realised until he was a captain in his own right though such a time may not be far off though khmun had made no announcement things were falling into place that suggested a certain sequence of events in the coming days firstly khmun had over the last year increasingly involved samir in his strategy and planning meetings the captain had shared what wisdom he had with his first officer and seemed to samir to be grooming him for the position secondly there was the wound a few years before a lucky shot from a defender on a calphorian ship had sent a missile through khmuns leg and the arrowhead had lodged in the mans knee though it had been removed and the captain had made what he deemed to be a full recovery samir had noted the wincing that went on whenever the ship lurched or shook moreover khmun had acquired that ageold mystical ability to predict cold and wet weather by the discomfort in his leg khmun was starting to tire of life aboard ship finally there was the matter of the council of twelve the council was to the pirates of lassos what a government was to a country and the head of the council a retired captain by the name of surafana was ailing fast word among the drinking pits of lassos was that khmun was the favourite to replace him of course the moment samir could be sure would be when khmun gave him the compass in seven years of serving in various capacities on board the empress samir had never found anyone that could tell him how the captain navigated the reefs of the dead and it had only been with his ascension to the position of first officer that things had been made relatively clear to him on every ship based in lassos only two men knew the secret for centuries the captains had used the socalled dead mans compass to find their way through the reefs there were said to be only two of them and no more would ever be created and even as first officer in two further years samir had never seen the compass but in a way that was comforting the day samir knew that khmun was ready to retire and samir to take his place as captain of the empress would be the day that khmun showed him the compass and explained its use the time was coming for samir to take on the ultimate challenge that life on board the empress had to offer and when that time came he would use it to turn the wrath of the most dangerous men within a thousand leagues on the satrap maahd whatever ghassan thought he was doing samir had not lost focus on the goal ahead soon maahd soon in which a fleet is found the wind rushed through ghassans hair as he leaned over the prow and gazed ahead without taking his eyes off the black sail some distance in front he sniffed there was a barelyperceptible change in the wind and he bellowed commands over his shoulder back to the men under his command captain jaral way back at the stern with the other officers would receive any appropriate information passed from man to man along the deck while relevant instructions would reach the correct people enroute since ghassans promotion to second in command this summer there had been a shift in the purpose of the wind of god that only he and the captain seemed to have recognised there had over the last year or more been fewer and fewer complaints among the merchants of calphoris concerning pirate activity looking into the incidents that had been reported along with information from other sources it was clear to ghassan and his captain that the pirates of the coastal waters had inexplicably turned their focus toward pelasian shipping inexplicable to most but not to ghassan on first discovering the situation he had recognised instantly the hand of samir in this somehow probably through gaining higher rank ghassans brother had managed to steer the pirates to more pelasian targets oh it wasnt a black and white situation by any means since there were still incidents with imperial merchants even horrible ones but the frequency had declined moreover ghassan had noted with a sense of optimism the dark empress had not been in a recorded incident with imperial shipping in at least a year samir had turned his attention at last to the wicked satrap maahd and that suited ghassan just fine the end result of this shift in pirate activity was that ghassan had managed to persuade the captain also to take more of an interest in the movements of pelasian shipping though in truth he hadnt taken much persuading over the years they had located and chased down the empress numerous times they had almost caught her once but the pirate crew seemed almost prescient they were always either already running when the militia turned up or prepared to get away at a moments notice though ghassan had tried to take the pirate vessel to the best of his ability he found that somewhere deep inside he was profoundly grateful that theyd never managed to capture samir besides the pelasians were making a nuisance of themselves these days though years ago the militia had put paid to maahds attempt to extend his territory east sending missives after that first meeting to the godking in akkad demanding that he keep his satraps under control there was still a constant threat a line had been drawn metaphorically speaking watch posts of both the calphorian militia and the pelasian satrap had been constructed from the coast into the desert sands glaring at one another warily over a half mile of unoccupied land less defined was the sea border and while maahd had irritably agreed to keep his shipping in pelasian waters when pressed by his godking his interpretation of what constituted pelasian waters was fluid at best so the wind of god had taken it upon itself these past months to patrol the border region between the two powers making her presence known and making sure she was to be found whenever a pelasian ship crossed the line chasing them back into their own territory ghassan and the captain had considered what they would do if ever a pelasian vessel decided not to run or if they ever caught up with one while still in their waters to leave it unmolested would be to invite further incursions but to attack and sink the vessel might be considered an act of war by the godking it was a thorny problem and the compromise had been a decision that in such circumstances they would capture a vessel strip it of anything useful and valuable and then escort them to their own waters before releasing them a solution nobody could legitimately complain about and now it looked as though they would have their first opportunity to test the theory the wind of god had come entirely by surprise upon the pelasian scout half an hour ago clearly a long way inside calphorian waters much further in than any vessel they had previously spotted the arrival of the militia daram around a headland had shocked and panicked the pelasians and the scout had turned as sharply as possible and begun to rig their sails to flee as fast as the wind would take them the daram was already at speed and bearing down on them but the scout was light and fast it would be a race and so for just over a half hour they had been chasing down the small singlesailed ship there had been an appreciable closing of distance between them but the result would be tight in just over five minutes they would reach the contested waters and then the political ramifications of what they did would be less sure but the artillery master had reliably informed them that within a couple of minutes they would be in range to fire at that point the sails would be targeted and then the hull the scout would flounder and slow until they caught and dealt with it as long as the artillerists were on form anyway ghassan his teeth clenched and the spray lashing him repeatedly across the face leaned further forward urging the daram on desperately the time had come to chastise these bastards for continually pushing acceptable boundaries besides it was ghassans life goal to twist the knife in the side of the satrap maahd until he could be properly dealt with minutes it would all come down to a matter of minutes there ahead was the headland that marked the end of official calphorian territory beyond that lay half a mile of free waters before they entered those belonging to pelasia minutes ghassan frowned the headland was the point at which the border towers ended this spur held an imperial watch tower the promontory at the far end of the next bay would hold the pelasian one the cove between was anyones water but safer for everyone to stay out of it such was not the cause of ghassans frown there was activity on the watch tower he frowned and shaded his brow from the bright sun focussing his exceptional vision on that small wooden tower with its roof of thatch its small palisaded compound that sheltered the complement of three men and its array of signalling devices he had realised that one of the men in the tower almost half a mile away was waving frantically he was trying to discern the situation when he suddenly turned completely blind damn it the men in the tower had resorted to the signalling mirror flashing the reflected sunlight at the ship and directly into ghassans eyes half a mile was too close for the heliograph to be used that was for longdistance signalling the morons he turned away blinking and could see nothing but amorphous purple and green blobs continuing to blink trying to restore his sight he reached out for the rigging boy he knew to be nearby feeling the boys shoulder he grasped see the signals coming from the tower there was a silence and it took a moment for ghassan to realise the boy was nodding he grunted tell me what they say staring down into the shadowy area of deck and blinking was rapidly restoring his sight but there was no way he was about to risk that again the trick when at such a short distance from the source was to look in the right direction but not directly at the signal its warning us to turn round sir ghassan frowned do they say why there was a silence and ghassan was trying to decide whether the boy was waiting for more message or had merely nodded or shaken his head he looked up and the blurred shape resolved itself into the rigging boy staring off into the distance fleet ahead sir fleet ghassan replied incredulously yessir ghassan still blinking looked toward the tower as the warning was repeated the boy hadnt misinterpreted that was clearly the signal ghassan shook his head what to do could they afford to just let this go he ground his teeth there was simply no choice it was possible the message was false what if the pelasians had taken control of the tower that was unlikely if there was a fleet here though it had to be pelasian and why in the name of the seven faces of harish would they build up a fleet in sight of the calphorian watchtower the questions were simply more numerous than any hope of answers take the word back to slow her down not to stop but to slow the pace and be ready to come to a full stop or full speed at any moment and hurry ghassan watched tensely as the headland neared while the distance between the wind of god and its quarry continued to close his sight was improving all the time come on he found himself whispering under his breath willing the ship to slow he realised he was now actually nervous of what might be waiting around the headland as he watched the ship showed signs of slowing the gap between the pelasian scout and themselves opening up finally hearing footsteps running up behind him he turned coming face to face with the captain sir whats going on ghassan we almost had him the artillery masters about to explode ghassan nodded sagely i can understand that sir i was looking forward to this myself but we were warned off by the watch tower why ghassan opened his mouth to reply but as he did the answer appeared before them stretching across the waters of the bay shit both officers turned to look at one another as the wind of god continued to slow drifting forward the headland passed by ponderously on their left ahead the small black scout vessel sailed into unclaimed waters out of their jurisdiction and directly toward the mass of black sails that dotted the seas surface like an ebony disease thats one hell of a fleet the captain said shaking his head in disbelief looks like three fleets massed together sir howd you work that out the flags captain flags that i can see of three different satraps the captain turned to the men gathering behind them and silently staring back to your places men pass the word to turn as sharply as possible and get the hell out of here he turned back to ghassan do you think well have time to rescue the guards from the tower ghassan shrugged i dont think theres any rush sir what i dont think were in any immediate danger the captain boggled at him ghassan what are you blathering about if that fleet was gathering to come against us firstly they would have removed the watchtower guards so they couldnt warn anyone secondly they wouldnt have ships in our water just in case this very thing happened thirdly they would be gathering the fleet in pelasian territory out of sight of our scouts by the time they got here theyd be at full speed and it would be too late to warn anyone he frowned and a slow but uncertain smile spread across his face i think were looking at a symptom of civil war captain there are no ships there flying the pelasian flag or the godkings banner just three satraps and i think theyre all unpopular border lords theyre gathering in unclaimed water so that no pelasian sees them in advance those bastards are being gathered to go against their own captain its the only answer the captain narrowed his eyes i hope youre right ghassan the young first officer nodded theyre not bothering with us theyve seen us but theyre not even sending a scout out toward us they just dont care its simply not about us any more the captain smiled we may just have caught a break here ghassan a civil war in pelasia would keep them occupied and off our back for a while give us a breather im not too sure about that sir the authority of the godking is the only thing thats keeping the worst of the satraps under control right now i dread to think what these three lords would be up to if they didnt have to answer to the throne the captain blinked you really think theyd have a chance against the crown satrap maahd doesnt do things unless he is fairly sure of success sir it may be then that the man weve been watching anxiously for the last decade is our main hope gods i hate it when politics gets too involved in the military ghassan shrugged an image of asima being dragged from a burning palace rose unbidden in his mind its in the hands of the gods sir not us in which samir has to move fast the dark empress rushed across the sea bouncing from crest to wave crest and throwing spray up in a wall that burst over the prow and washed across the deck samir grinned a feral grin as he set his gaze on the black sail ahead it had taken a great deal of wheedling and arguing to persuade captain khmun to come this far into pelasian waters khmun had now been confirmed as the successor to surafana on the council of twelve and was uneasy straying too far from lassos at this juncture the captain had been dubious about samirs unwavering desire to take the empress against any black sail to be found at sea and the very idea of heading deep into pelasian waters was just asking for trouble still samir had persisted and had finally won the day he had wanted to see mdahz even if only from a distance the port must now be churning out pelasian ships and a hive of activity given the number of relatively new vessels they had spotted bearing the insignia of the satrap maahd finally samir had sold the idea to khmun as a scouting mission highlighting the need to know more about what the satrap was up to with these new ships he was building in truth there was some validity to that mission goal but what samir really wanted to achieve was twofold to see mdahz once again after a decade gone and to insult the satrap as much as possible by sinking his ships preferably within sight of the town and two leagues from shore they had spotted a pelasian scout ship at such a distance samir couldnt quite make out the pennant and the vessel could belong to any satrap but it was clearly pelasian at that point they had been a little to the west of mdahz not far from the old imperial border and their quarry had taken flight as fast as the small nimble scout could manage heading directly south toward land samir wary of getting too close to land so far west had requested a decision of the captain though khmun had deliberated surprisingly little the vessel had seen them and it was a matter of pride to chastise them for that the empress had a reputation to maintain after all it was also a matter of pride to the officers and men of the dark empress that no vessel in the sea of storms could match her for speed khmun had set his considerable naval expertise to streamlining the hull reworking the sails and masts and organising the placement of his oarsmen to maximise their strength every time the empress chased down a fast ship or escaped one due to an extra turn of speed on the oars those men were put down for an extra ration of liquor or share in the booty the incentives had impressive results so despite the impressive pace of the lightweight pelasian scout the pirate vessel continued to gain on them closing the distance as the miles rolled past the ships had quickly come into full sight of the coast previously visible only as a thin line of hazy brown on the horizon in what appeared to be a pathetic attempt at evasion the scout tacked to port and began to run along the coast some distance from shore at this point the hills and dips of the coastline had become distinguishable and a dark smudge rising from the horizon some distance to the east had to be mdahz samir smiled if they timed this right they could sink the scout within plain sight of the port watchtowers the dark smudge that samir shook his head his eyes must be playing tricks on him the smudge had moved if only he had ghassans sharp eyes no the smudge was definitely moving and that meant that it wasnt mdahz at all he frowned and his eyes widened they were ships there were definite sail shapes that could be made out if you looked carefully enough shiiiiiit samir turned and ran along the deck shouting to the captain but khmun was already busy samir realised with horror that the lookout aloft on the main mast was shouting warnings but pointing astern oh no his heart sinking samir ran to the rail casting his eyes to the wake behind them and then with growing dismay in a wide arc out to sea on the port side of the empress the shapes of black pelasian vessels were dotted on the horizon in every direction what had to be a sizeable fleet was moving up from the east the smudge on the shore while a wide cordon of pelasian warships tightened a net around the pirate ship they were coming from almost every angle he ran to the shelter at the rear where khmun was slamming his fist on the balustrade in anger should have stayed away from the shore samir what was i thinking samir shook his head my fault sir i dragged us into this question is how do we get out the captain shrugged theres no simple solution there samir whichever way we turn theres trouble best hope is to pick a target and try and break through where the cordons weakest thats not going to work captain and you know it by the time we meet them even the thinnest area will mean three to one odds there has to be another way come on sir you can do this samir tried to keep the note of desperate hope from his voice but had clearly failed by the look on his captains face you wanted to fight pelasians samir now might be the time the young first officer growled and shook his head i didnt mean a suicide engagement captain khmun shrugged again nothing else for it at least well take one or two of them with us turning to the deck the captain began bellowing orders samir ignored them settling down to think as quickly yet clearly as he could west and north there were haraqclass warships south was the coast and east was the fleet hed mistaken for mdahz mistaken as a blur on the coast the coast he turned back to the captain taking a deep breath pardon this sir but he turned to the crew and raised his voice belay those orders take us in toward the coast at full speed there was a strangled silence khmun stared at samir but noting the grin spreading across his first officers face he nodded do as he says lads as the changes were made swiftly and efficiently and the dark empress gave up pursuit of the scout angling directly toward the coast still two miles away the captain dropped down from the raised deck platform to where samir stood grasped his shoulder and pulled him over to the rail whats your plan we can slip by them sir he shrugged are you mad khmun blinked at him slip by where samir grinned alright sir ive got good eyes but it took me a while to realise that black smudge was ships and not the town the heat haze on the land makes everything a little blurred and uncertain from out at sea we need to get to shore as fast as possible then well turn sharp west and head out deeper into pelasian waters with any luck theyll continue to close on where they think well be im sure they wont expect us to head further west khmun slapped his forehead you know why that is samir because theres more and more pelasian warships that way weve no idea what well be sailing into besides you mistook the fleet because it was black against the brown land our sails are white well be visible for miles samir laughed id rather sail into the unknown than into what we do know and if we furl the sails and rely on the oars well be almost invisible against the shore trust me captain i know we can do this khmun stared at him for a moment and finally shook his head in amazement you really are something samir if you and that brother of yours were on the same side no other ship on the ocean would be safe very well lets do it your way better than being sunk by a pelasian haraq while trying to break out they returned to the raised command platform that gave a clear view to every direction not obscured by a mast the coast brown and speckled with rocky coves and inlets and low headlands raced toward them growing every moment samir smiled to himself for every foot the coastline seemed to grow to him the empress would shrink to the slower warships closing in behind any moment now even the masts would be visible against the backdrop of cliffs rather than sky now was the time to pull his little manoeuvre furl the sails the crew taken by surprise rushed to follow orders and in a testament to their abilities moments later the three heavy sails crashed to the deck and were shuffled out from underfoot alright men samir shouted keep the sails ready well need to raise them sharpish when were out of danger so that we can run were going to head toward land for another minute or two and then bank sharply west along the coast during that minute i want anything white or colourful or brightly polished below deck level were going to blend in with the coast and slip past them so we need to be as brown and unobtrusive as possible there was a note of relief to the low comments and affirmative noises among the crew clearly they had been hoping for one of khmun and samirs miraculous ruses and it looked as though the first officer had a trick up his sleeve as samir watched tensely the men went about their tasks stowing anything that might draw unwanted attention and preparing everything for a sudden turn of speed the moment it was needed counting down under his breath samir watched the cove and the headland looming ever closer this had to be done right they had to be as close to land as it was possible to be but not quite close enough to beach or theyd really be in trouble in his head he tried to estimate the distance to shore and then calculate the depth of the water a dromon had a shallow draft for such a large ship but this was still very tight he took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment expecting the crunch of gravel at any time starboard sharp the oarsmen and the rudder master responded instantly and without the wind in the sails to push them off course the ship turned tightly and mercifully without the sound of wood grazing on gravel within a heartstopping half minute the ship was turned and racing along the coast toward akkad and the heart of pelasia hold it steady now lads he and the captain shared a look for long moments and as the ship battered on in silence khmun glanced up and called to the lookout what are they doing the lookout remained silent for a moment and then replied i think theyre continuing on sir there was a long tense pause yes sir theyve not turned i think theyve lost us an explosive venting of air echoed round the ship as almost every member of the crew released the breath they had held for over a minute samir there are times when you surprise even me the young first officer grinned at his captain and turned to look along the deck things were back under his control where he liked them a quarter if an hours journey along the coast and theyd be well away from any pursuers then they could set sail once again and head out into the open sea his need to see his home town had almost cost them his train of thought was interrupted as an arrow came from nowhere and thudded into the railing a few inches from his head he snapped his head round in shock to see a scout party of pelasian riders on the headland firing from horseback there were only perhaps a dozen but pelasian horse archers were renowned the world over for their accuracy and rate of fire from the saddle the empire had employed them as mercenaries many times and with the speed the empress was currently achieving the archers would have no trouble choosing targets get us out of arrow range of the coast but no more scanning back along the deck he spotted the artillerists loading the fire thrower and growled loudly stop that if you fire that thing well be spotted five leagues away the artillerists taken aback by the ferocity of his tone changed tasks and began loading the bolt throwers and taking pot shots at the horsemen they would never hit them a moving target from on board a moving vehicle but it was making the pelasians wary and causing them to pull back a little which would give the empress time to get out of range once that was done in half a minute nothing would catch them he turned sighing with relief to ask the captains opinion on keeping the bolt throwers loaded while they travelled the shoreline and realised in horror that khmun was not where he had been his eyes dropped to the deck the captain lay propped where he had fallen by the railing an arrow protruding from his neck and blood running down his throat and back and soaking his tunic captain khmun issued a wheezing noise and grasped samirs breeches hauling him down to deck level in a hollow voice accompanied by an unpleasant bubbling noise the captain addressed him face to face and very quietly get them home samir get them to lassos you know where the compass is and how to use it now time to practice the hard way samir nodded absently as he started to pull away ill fetch the doctor khmun rasped what could have been a laugh ill be dead before he gets here samir the young man suddenly found he had tears in his eyes most unfitting for a pirate officer and yet it had happened again every father figure he found was taken from him every father figure he found was taken from him by pelasia he growled and the flow of tears stopped i will get them back for this captain i will string up every last pelasian east of akkad for this khmun made that rasping bubbling sound again it was a laugh oh samir whatever had been the captains last planned words however would never be heard with a rattling sound khmun passed to the other world supported by the rail and his trusted lieutenant and now samir had to do the worst thing imaginable to tell the crew their captain had died captain samir of the dark empress his face bleak and angry bent and gathered up the body of the fallen captain all free hands to the stern another death for which to repay maahd the focus of the dark empress was about to narrow in which asima progresses the harem was a place of rules and discipline but those rules changed depending on the position and rank of the occupant and if one knew how to play the game well they were surprisingly flexible asima had learned early on in her days as an official concubine of the godking that she had a great deal more freedom and authority than before though the women who lived at this exalted rank took various differing viewpoints on their newfound power tanita one of the other two women who had been chosen alongside asima seemed to drift happily along content with her role and enjoying what freedoms she had sharra as always continued to complain about her captivity and seemed to have taken this authority and used it to separate herself from the others asima saw in the relaxing of control the opportunity to advance it had taken her a couple of years to get to know all of the wives and concubines their foibles and traits and to work out exactly where in the line of seniority they all stood this was only partially important to her plans of course since some who were considerably more senior than asima were now old or ugly or both and therefore posed no great threat to her barring one keshia was now sixty three and frankly not looking her best asima had initially placed her under the people not to care about heading but had learned quickly that keshia held a special place in the heart of the godking she had been his first wife and they had married before he had even ascended the high throne he must have been so like prince ashar in those days keshia despite her age was as much a threat as those eight years of chosen that followed asima and the many that came before and yet many of them were so mundane that they blended in with the wall decorations there were to asimas surprise more than a hundred women in the harem that the king had apparently never sent for and who lived lives of anonymity and great freedom it had been this that had given asima her greatest idea there were one hundred and seventy of the godkings women in the harem of those a little more than sixty ever actually saw him and those women were divided in asimas mind into those above her those level with her and those beneath her the more than thirty women beneath her she kept her eye on just in case they decided to make a play of the others six women asima believed were as favoured as her in the godkings eyes and only one of those was a wife rather than a concubine the rest eighteen women who outranked asima were all wives and while a wife officially held higher rank than a concubine such distinctions were quite blurred in the palace of akkad now the only way to compete with the rest was to change her status completely which meant either raising her own or lowering that of those above her over the past six years she had moved gradually up the ladder until it was often her that the godking sent for when he needed companionship moreover flatteringly it was as much her advice and conversation that he required as her beauty and her other talents now however she needed to become a wife once that happened she would be perhaps tenth in line and would be in a position to jostle her way higher and so here she was strolling out of the great private palace at the centre of the complex her hand resting lightly on the godkings arm timing was everything and it had taken every tool in her arsenal to keep the ruler of pelasia busy until the appointed time finally she had smiled and told him sweetly that she was ready to return to the harem now what route shall we take my dear the handsome man had asked the jasmine by the loggia of the winds is particularly fragrant at the moment asima had as always marshalled every argument and conceived of every possible problem before joining the godking tonight she shook her head quietly and smiling gestured out north i would rather if it suit your majesty pass by the orchard the smell of the lemon trees between the observatory and the harem is fresh and pleasing this time of year and to visit the loggia we would have to pass the kitchens of the public palace at the time the slops are discarded the godking had laughed and squeezed her hand then the observatory and orchard it is i might if time allows go inside and see what patterns the stars have formed for me tonight she had smiled that wouldnt happen not tonight and so now they walked down a paved white path between rich lawns and toward the northernmost point of akkad ahead the great pentagonal towers of the palace walls rose up like the great horns of some silhouetted beast the crown of its head formed by the dome of the observatory away to the left beyond the citrus grove stood the sombre bulk of the harem the moon was intermittently covered by scudding clouds that prevented too much silvery light from playing across the gardens and asima had to narrow her eyes discretely to pick out any details on the observatory a relic from the days of the godkings grandfather the observatory was a three storey structure of white marble and porphyry octagonal each face was smooth punctuated between floors with purple decoration and surmounted by a domed grey roof with portions formed of delicate glass the ruler who had originally had the curious building constructed had been convinced that the stars held some power over events in the real world and that if man only learned how to read their patterns he could predict the future it was a belief that was commonly held to be erroneous though nobody would say so in relation to the godkings family tonight however there was a certain ring of truth to this the observatory if everything was going according to plan would herald certain future trends and foretell at least one specific event they strode down the gentle slope from the palace toward the structure and its adjacent orchard the king humming a tune that the musicians had played through dinner while asima smiled and kept herself as calm and steady as possible periodically she looked up with her head lowered casting surreptitious glances at the observatory there was nothing to be seen there not a surprise there would be in a minute but not if the godking kept up that irritating humming listen majesty do you hear the gentle song of the nightingale the godking tilted his head slightly you must have good hearing asima i hear nothing it is faint majesty but beautiful her companion fell silent listening intently for the birdsong that existed only in asimas head at least he was quiet he may be handsome and kind but the ageing ruler of pelasia had what asima considered to be some of the worlds most irritating habits she would cope with them in return for the power they brought but really she would have to do something about changing him once she was in charge they approached the marble octagon moving now into the shadow cast by the palaces high walls the paved route would take them around the building to the door on the north side and from there they could walk across the springy turf between the citrus trees back to the harem well she could the godking would be busy almost there and asima found she was holding her breath silently she admonished herself and tried to relax appearance was all too important right now and it was with a happy smile and an easy pace that she and the godking rounded the octagon and came facetoface with the couple in the shadowed doorway the godking was so startled that he almost cried out for the guards one of which would be patrolling the wall top nearby asima allowed her face to slip into the practiced look of horrified disbelief at the sight of shalah the kings second wife locked in the embrace of one of the black white and goldclad royal guard the godkings face was everything that asima had hoped if she picked apart his expression she could find horror anger betrayal disbelief and sadness though as she watched the proportions of those emotions changed in a split second from heavy disbelief to extraordinary anger the couple tightly held took a second to notice the godking shalah had been so involved in their kiss that she had been making strange squeaking noises as the full knowledge of what had befallen them spread across her face the second most powerful woman in the harem five years older than asima and a born princess in her own right fell to her knees her forehead touching the floor abasing herself before her master it was impossible in that frantic moment to identify the soldiers expression as most of his face was hidden in shadow and they only saw a flash of his eyes and a brief blur of his skin before he turned and ran silently into the shadows of the orchard the godking despite his fury ignored the soldier as he ran and instead turned his gaze downward to glare angrily at the woman on the floor shalah the woman made whimpering noises but no identifiable words came out she would be terrified beyond her wits end the penalty for adultery among the godkings women was to be crushed to death there would be no trial no alternative and no hope of reprieve a small part of asima that was still the girl that had played jumprope and raced around the roofs of mdahz with the brothers felt sorry for shalah and the fate she now faced but the part of her that mattered mentally ticked a box on a chart and shuffled names on a list she held her silence maintained her look of shock and horror and stepped back disassociating herself from events as the godking grasped his second wifes wrist and hauled her to her feet his face white with rage instead she thought deeply about what she would need to do now once the godking had brought the guards and had the woman detained it had taken asima three months to find a guard who was greedy and amoral enough to consider enticing the queen and playing the gigolo with her it was a dangerous task and she had been paying the soldier a small fortune each week for his continued help and his silence of course she had left nothing with him that could be proof of her complicity if he had spoken of her requests but it was better that he hadnt for otherwise plans would not have been brought to fruition and this would never have occurred tonight there would be two or three days of chaos in the harem and the palace as the king raged shalah would be repeatedly interrogated and tortured until her nails were gone her fingers broken her nose slit and all manner of horrible acts perpetrated she would be able to say no more than that the guard had wooed her and she had accepted his attentions for that was exactly what had happened the gentle manoeuvring and prodding that had come from asima would be forgotten as mere generalities in harem life she had been careful to be as subtle as a woman could be no no trace would lead back to her the only loose end left would be the young guard who had courted her but that was hardly a worry for asima during their last meeting tonight to finalise the arrangements she had taken the opportunity to slip him a cup of wine laced with a lethal but slowacting poison he would first notice the cramps in an hour or so and would then be dead within minutes she had practiced dosage and timing on a variety of animals in the gardens over the past three weeks and was satisfied that the guard would never have the opportunity to tell anyone what had happened of course he wouldnt anyway for he would then be staring death in the face alongside shalah but this way was more sure as an additional touch she had left the vial of poison in his room when the body was found it would be assumed he had taken his own life after realising what he had done in the aftermath a week or so from now the order in the harem would change drastically far from everyone moving one place closer to the most favoured position around a dozen of those wives above her those who were known to be close to shalah and would now be tarnished by her failure would fall from favour that would be enough given asimas recent good favour and the gifts and surprises she had in store to push her into the top few of the godkings chosen within a month she would now be taken to wife of that she was certain she allowed her thoughts to return to the present guards were now rushing through the trees and across the grass to their masters calls shalah sagged in his grasp broken and hopeless sad in a way as shed always been nice to asima and so perky and full of life not for long though the next challenge would be to deal with the sixtythree year old favourite keshia tonight asima would move on to her new project in which asimas world changes once more asima woke to commotion and instantly settled into an evil mood she needed her rest it had been five days since shalah had been executed and things had only just begun to settle down in the harem after the tremendous shake up that had resulted asima needed her sleep in the name of all that was sensible gritting her teeth she pulled the satin pillow over her head and pressed its smooth cold exterior over her head squeezing her eyes tight and willing sleep to come back in what was clearly a futile gesture almost two minutes she lay there the noise and what noise it was muffled by the pillow but far from silenced finally an expression of indignant anger on her face she hauled herself out from beneath the lustrous expensive covers and crossed the room to her robe which she threw on furiously someone would pay for this possibly even with skin and hair growling like some predatory wildcat asima strode to the door of her room and was about to throw it open and demand silence of the chattering creatures obviously filling the corridor outside when suddenly some sixth sense made her stop and take her hand from the latch that was not excited chatter or happy conversation what was going on out in the corridor though she could not make out the words was evidently shocked and panicked babbling in a moment of awareness of her vulnerability she slipped the second additional lock shut and backed away from the door why so many in the corridor outside her apartments the answer was clear as it dropped into her thoughts with her current high position she had managed to acquire rooms away from most of the others and with one of the few external windows there was no reason for other girls to be anywhere near her apartment but the corridor outside also held two more windows that faced north over the cliff and the walls far below and out to sea what had happened had one of the girls in despair thrown herself from the window it had happened before and more than once from this very corridor the fall was invariably fatal from here her heart in her throat asima rushed back through her ornate rooms past the bed so recently disturbed and into her day room where the window looked out over the sea in a breathtaking panorama there were crimson drapes heavily backed to cut out the light when necessary but asima never bothered closing them she slept in a different room and was not in the day room when she sought darkness wondering what sight grisly or exciting awaited her she crossed to the window and cast her glance immediately downwards the moonlight was bright and illuminated everything below and before her the ground outside the harem wall continued level for only a few feet and then fell away precipitously becoming rocks and jagged cliffs and ending twenty feet above the water in a ledge upon which the walls strode around the bluff there was activity on the parapet perhaps someone had thrown themselves off after all asima her interest piqued glanced right along the wall to see the faces of several of the lesser concubines projecting from the windows they were not looking down with a strange sinking feeling asima turned her head and followed the direction of their gaze she must have been blind not to notice it immediately the open sea beyond the walls was dotted with vessels some ablaze others gradually sinking to a watery grave as she watched in shock a ball of burning mass shot up from one of the haraq warships and gracefully arced out over the sea its reflection in the black waves eerie even at this distance before it came down smashing through sails and rigging on board an identical ship what the hell was going on it registered in mere moments that all of the vessels involved in the huge and vicious naval engagement below were pelasian with the traditional black sails from here she would have no hope of identifying the flags on board but some of them must be the royal fleet based here at akkad it was unrealistic to believe such a fight would occur below the city without the royal fleet being involved and that meant pelasians attacking akkad which meant only one thing civil war what was it with the men ruling this world all asima wanted was a happy and rich life of peace and plenty and every time she managed to find a niche and start decorating it the way she liked some mindless ruler attacked and wiped everything out she growled first satrap maahd at mdahz and now someone else here the empire was known to have well and truly collapsed nearly two decades ago but why did pelasia feel the need to follow suit no asima barked to herself she was not having this not again she was damned if shed spent so much time and effort hauling herself up the ladder only to have the wall moved away as she neared the top she had dishonoured destroyed and downright murdered over a dozen people to get where she was now she paused and frowned as she realised how bad this sounded when she said it flatly there were extenuating circumstances besides she said to herself soothingly thats how the game is played i just play better than most setting her jaw she examined herself in the mirror and tutting irritably lit the lamps to give herself a clearer view could be worse her hair long and straight and dark stayed relatively neat no matter how disturbed her night was and a few quick strokes with the brush and two or three of her golden pins would soon make her look divine once more a servant eunuch had laid out her clothes for the morning and since she had a lunchtime engagement with the godking they were among her best and most enticing that would be fine and as for the making up well asima had the practice down to such an art these days that she could accomplish a better look than most professionals in a mere couple of minutes she set to work with a vengeance and within five minutes was ready giving herself a last critical look in the mirror yes that would do she had to be prepared for anything but whatever happened tonight she had to look divine enough to come out on top of the situation smiling wickedly she paused at the door and sprayed herself with a light burst of perfumed oil fragranced with musk poppy and jasmine and then she was out it gave her a small feeling of satisfaction to note the baffled and amazed expressions on the faces of her lessers as she swept regally past them in the corridor perfectly attired and made up and smelling of heady nights in the harem gardens perhaps the thing that astounded them the most would be that they panicked and wailed as they watched what could be the end of everything while asima maintained her usual calm composure she knew some of the younger girls had spread a rumour that she wasnt entirely human and she had done nothing to discourage the talk a little mystery and fear all added to her power leaving the gaggle of hysterical women behind her asima strode along the corridor down the two flights of stairs and out from the hall through the decorative archway and into the central courtyard as she approached the main exit of the harem in its dark recessed tunnel one of the eunuch doormen armed with a long curved knife stepped in front of the door he looked distinctly unsure of his situation and had to glare at his companion guard and motion before the other eunuch joined him asima came to a halt a few feet from them and folded her arms defiantly a thousand pardons lady asima but you know the rules asima laughed with absolutely no humour get out of my way you pointless poisonous halfman the eunuch stayed where he was a shocked expression spreading across his face asima sighed in case you were unaware we are being attacked by a force of traitors by sea and therefore almost certainly by land as well if akkad is about to fall i will stand by the side of my godking and face it with him the humourless smile returned if you do not step aside i will take your knives and use them to remove any parts of you that still protrude the guards likely awed by her reputation as much as her ferocity shared a look and wisely turned the gate key before stepping aside delaying for a moment she took the time to give the guards a good hard stare before striding away into the night the trick was in paying attention and devoting time to the details that one last glance would stay with the guards for years and add to her reputation so long as there was a future for her reputation to carry into the gardens were strangely quiet and yet busy as asima strode with purpose along the direct path to the royal residence she saw small groups of servants and guards going quickly and resolutely about their business in a worried silence and yet despite the flurries of activity everywhere the only noises she could hear came from outside the walls crashes and bangs out to sea and what sounded like vicious fighting in the city beyond the palace gate without paying to too much attention to what was happening close around her asima set her sights on the building ahead and made for the entrance as she approached the door opened and three servants rushed off toward the public palace carrying bundles of something for a moment asima wondered whether she had been premature perhaps the godking was in one of the palaces rather than his residence tending to affairs perhaps given his strength and abilities he was armoured already and helping defend the palace no the guards would not allow him to put himself in danger he would be in the safest place in akkad striding purposefully asima pulled open the door to the residence of the godking the entrance hall was filled from side to side with heavily armed and armoured soldiers of the royal guard archers positioned on the balconies above the guard were clearly taking no chances of the enemy reaching their master as she walked toward the line of steel and bronze she glanced into the side chambers and noted with satisfaction archers and soldiers positioned at all the windows the building was well defended behind her she heard movement and glancing back over her shoulder she noted with approval the four guards lifting the heavy beams that would fall into grooves and bar the door in a moment hardly premature just in time in fact the captain in command of the guard gave a military halfbow as he recognised the royal concubine approaching and with a curt command the soldiers parted to allow her through she glared at the captain and he was taken aback blinking for a moment before recovering himself and straightening maam you just let me through without a single question the captain cleared his throat aware that somehow he was now treading a fine line maam you are concubine and favoured of the godking asima growled we are being attacked by pelasians captain no one should be trusted the captain was crestfallen as asima swept past awash with annoyance and made for the stairs behind her the guards closed ranks once more asima chided herself as she climbed it had been petty but it made her feel better when events beyond ones control threatened it was always satisfying to make someone feel less than oneself in a strange way it passed a small amount of control back at the top of the stairs she noted with satisfaction the second line of soldiers guarding the entrance to the main apartment complex the men parted once more to allow her in and she wondered briefly whether to repeat her admonishment but decided against it opening the door she stepped inside and bashi the godkings chief manservant greeted her in the corridor lady asima i am surprised to see you here asima bowed her head bashi had a great deal of power and influence and should tonight turn out well she would need to remain on his good side master bashi as soon as i discovered what was happening i rushed to my lord to be by his side and to offer him support and comfort should he require bashi nodded this is good the master is tense my lady please attend just a moment asima stood in the entrance chamber and examined her nails as she heard bashi enter the apartment and announce her she also heard the strain and slight sound of relief in the godkings voice when he asked the servant to admit her by the time bashi returned she was already walking toward the main room he smiled and passed her to go about his business the godking resplendent in his plain black with the circlet on his brow and his jewelled sword slung at his side smiled at her though there was a sadness and a hollowness to that smile asima i am grateful you came surprised but grateful he reached his hands out to her surprised my lord the godking laughed sadly you are ever the gameplayer my dear ashar warned me about that from the start but for all your wickedness life here would have been duller without you asima frowned majesty you speak as though the game were already lost the godking sighed and sat heavily on the couch for your own good you would do well to leave i have already sent ashar to collect the twins and ferry them to safety i have seen the red stars from the observatory my grandfather saw them the day before his death you know he sighed several of my satraps have risen against me with armies and fleets they have constructed in secret and i have not had enough warning to pull in allies my fleet is lost on the sea floor to a surprise attack and most of the walls of akkad are now under their control the noose tightens around my neck asima and if you are here when they come you may well hang alongside me asima shook her head you are a god my love they cannot kill you a true laugh i am well aware of my simple mortality asima and i do not think that you believe in any god regardless no i shall die tonight and i would have you away somewhere safe but i am glad that i saw you once more you would have won you know i just cannot resist you you would have been goddess and queen had i lived how sad asima found that she had a genuine tear in the corner of her eye i shall go nowhere my lord i shall be by your side when they come the godking amashir iv absolute ruler of pelasia and divine power smiled sadly then let us sit and drink wine while we wait in which the wheel turns again asima gripped the arm of the chair so tight that she felt her nails cutting their way through the delicate satin cover her knuckles turning white a few feet away the godking sat with a sad stoic calmness his legs crossed and his gaze firmly affixed on the door the sounds of vicious combat at the entrance to the palace had died away only moments before and the echoes of steel on steel still rang around the corridors of the residence there was a pregnant pause as pelasia held its breath the time is upon us my dear time to go asima shook her head and dug her nails ever deeper into the chair arm it is no use making such a noble gesture my love i appreciate the thought but there is no need now your death would be pointless find somewhere to hide again asima shook her head her face pale she was wracked by uncertainty this was exactly what shed planned when she entered the building to do in these very circumstances though she had also considered several alternatives it was a calculated risk that if the attackers succeeded she would appear noble and loyal enough to stand out above all the other women who hadnt come here it was all about raising her profile before anyone else had the chance but now there were feelings of regret and real loyalty creeping in and she hadnt felt these emotions since the days of her youth in mdahz she sighed as the godking turned to her consider it a last royal command if you must asima it was almost worth arguing her profile was something in asimas subconscious flashed her images of a potential future she could see how clearly impressive she would look once the usurper had felled her master and she strode calmly from behind the curtains looking regal stunning and entirely unfazed by the horrifying events around her if anything it would be all the more impressive with a sad smile she reached out and grasped his hand as she did so the fresh sounds of battle broke out on the stairway and landing outside the apartments the godking squeezed her hand lightly smiled once and then turned back to face the door asima stood and made her way across to one of the drapes that hung as a divider separating the more intimate lounging area from this formal reception room her choice was hardly random she had selected it as a possibility when shed first entered the room twenty minutes ago there was sufficient dark heavy material to hide a full person thoroughly with enough light wispy netted areas for her to be able to watch events unfold whilst unobserved moreover given the drapes position between the two rooms it was quite reasonable for one of the concubines to be in the intimate chamber rather than the reception room with a quick glance at the door she ducked behind the material and held her breath the wait was not long the fighting at the head of the stairs was over almost before it began asima swallowed and kept herself still as she heard footsteps approaching the door there was a rattle and then a creak from this position she could just see the doors edge as it opened and was so surprised at the sight that unfolded before her that she almost laughed the satrap of siszthad the satrap one of the more powerful and yet certainly one of the least popular at court had been absent from the seat of government for over two years following an unfortunate incident involving a serving boy he was to asimas mind one of the most thoroughly unpleasant and repulsive creatures the gods had ever let loose in the world the man who made his way into the room was more than a head shorter than the godking so rotund that no armour would go round his bulk he waddled more than walked and his complexion was oily and sick his eyes small dark and beady in essence he was everything the godking was not siszthad jerked his head to one side his neck making an unpleasant cracking noise and his topknot swishing like a horses tail over his bald shiny head his strange waddle was accentuated almost humorously by the clicking of the silver and ebony cane in his hand like a third leg preventing the spherical nobleman from rolling over asima shook her head in wonder siszthad was wealthy and powerful with a lot of land certainly but this this unpleasant piggy little poxhound had masterminded a coup that had felled a dynasty of four centuries standing it seemed ridiculous the satrap came to a halt sweating before the godking who stood slowly and regally to tower over his usurper siszthad this was never your doing you have neither the strength nor the intellect for something like this guards in black began to enter the room fanning out on either side of the two men asima growled under her breath as her view was partially obscured by the two in front of her the satrap laughed a highpitched feminine noise amashir to asimas surprise the godking reached forward and gave the small man a backhanded slap hard across the cheek you will refer to me by my title you worthless piece of camel hide i am godking as long as i live no matter what you do to me easily solved said an unseen person asima jerked at that voice as the guards had finished filing into position two other men had entered to stand at the rear one was a satrap she vaguely recognised handsome and dark a man of nomad blood from the deep desert regions the other had been mostly obscure by guards and the drapes she knew the satrap ruler of mdahzs voice well though maahd the usurper squeaked what do you mean oh for the sake of reason maahd stepped forward brushing the smaller man aside and pointed to the nearest guards this man was a king and a god so make it quick but do it now there was a brief hesitation and then two guards stepped forward one reached out for the godking who made no attempt to defend himself the guard grasped the godkings wrists and pulled his arms around behind his back the tall elegant ruler smiled at his three enemies you are committing treason murder and ostensibly deicide the stars have a way of coming back round and taking their revenge on such people remember that the stars will burn red for all of you in time so enjoy your reign for now without another word and without waiting to be forced the godking bent at the waist extending his neck the second guard drew a long curved sword with a horrible rasping sound and lifted it high above his head pausing for a second he looked to the satrap of siszthad for confirmation maahd sighed just do it asima watched with a mix of hatred awe and sadness as the living god that ruled pelasia fell in two his body crumpling and as the guard let go of the wrists slumping to the floor the head rolled several yards and came to rest in front of the darkerskinned nomad satrap siszthad turned and addressed maahd in his squeaky voice burn the horrid thing i want rid of anything that reminds anyone of that man maahd shook his head that is not enough siszthad his head must go above the moon gate as a warning the man who had plagued asima for most of her life gestured to the guards and pointed at the head and the body without waiting for further commands the men gathered the remains and began to carry them carefully from the room behind the drapes asimas head spun she had been prepared for a usurper but not for a triumvirate and certainly not for maahd she could make her future secure with almost anyone but this would complicate matters how would they rule together she shook her head and concentrated on the three men who were now fully within the chamber at a perfunctory gesture from maahd the corpulent little man took the seat so recently occupied by the godking the dark satrap bent and retrieving the simple gold circlet passed it to the seated man asima frowned as there was further activity at the door as she watched the high priest of the creator along with half a dozen of the most important ministers in akkad was ushered inside at swordpoint knees barked the darker satrap in a rasping dry desiccated voice that sent a shiver through asima the seven men dropped to the ground those who were too slow aided in their descent with a blow to the back of the knees delivered by an unseen guard maahd smiled a smile that told asima more than any words could king amashir is dead i shy away from the title godking for clearly he was no such thing there will be no more gods ruling pelasia just men you will now kiss the floor and accept the blessing of your new king paranes of siszthad paranes i there was a silent pause and asima could imagine what was going through the minds of the seven men the guards gave the witnesses a few random clouts with the hafts of their weapons not enough to damage but enough to goad them into action as the men gave their oaths of allegiance and collapsed grovelling to the floor asima shook her head she would survive and probably even prosper maahd and the other satrap were clearly intent on the power without the prestige becoming the de facto power behind the throne that meant they would be no immediate threat to asima as long as she extended the same courtesy to them siszthad would be the one to rule and he was no lover of women he was known to have a thing for boys and mostly for unwilling boys if he ever sent for a woman from the harem it would probably be to produce an heir but it was unlikely even that would make him do so he was a horrible creature and physically repulsive but he was also stupid greedy and gullible asima would be able to claw her way to the pinnacle of pelasian society just by playing the man she a noise distracted her and she swung her head to the private chamber behind her tastefully decorated and furnished and graced with three ornate windows and a balcony her heart in her throat she realised the shouts of warning were coming from outside what now weighing her options she sighed and moved as lightly as she could from behind the drapes across the other room and to the balcony stepping outside she glanced down into the grounds and took in the events below as shock made her grip the rail of the balcony blackclad guards were running across the lawns chasing a single figure on horseback the horse was a magnificent white mare she knew that because she knew the rider prince ashar raced for the stairs leading up to the walls near the gate and she found that she was urging him on to escape strange that ashar had never trusted her never been a friend to her and yet she felt that on some unspoken level he understood and appreciated her he was a conundrum that one other guards were closing the net she realised with a hint of sadness that ashar had been charged with saving the godkings twin boys and yet his hands were empty as he rode desperately looking for a hole in the tightening net ashar would now be the last direct member of the parishid dynasty four hundred years of rule in pelasia in the form of one man fleeing the palace in the night as she watched ashar wheeled his horse shouted something she didnt quite hear and raced toward the thinnest area of the cordon timing his move impeccably the prince urged his horse to a jump and cleared the closing guards with ease as confusion reigned and the black soldiers rushed around trying to change direction and follow their target ashar rode up the wide staircase to the top of the land walls behind and below him men ran across the lawns and began to climb the stairs but ashar had a strong lead on them as other guards appeared from towers and ran out onto the walls ashar climbed dextrously onto the saddle of his horse turned to face the palace gave a last elegant bow to the memory of his uncle and dropped backwards out of sight disappearing from the wall top into the street that separated the palace complex from the great circus the fall from there forty feet down to hard paving should be fatal or criticallyinjuring at least and yet this was ashar parishid in the years asima had known the prince in akkad he had never once done anything foolish or without having planned it through first the prince would be alive and well and leaving akkad for now she heaved a sigh of relief and turned to see the three lords standing in the room behind her guards filing around the perimeter lady asima i believe the satrap maahd smiled mirthlessly i am given to understand that you were one of amashirs favourites and that you were one of my girls from mdahz it seems i chose well asima smiled meekly no time to push things now my lord satrap maahd nodded deep in thought and then turned to a guard and gestured at her take her back to the harem and while youre there do a complete count of wives courtesans and other women i fear we may have to perform a cull amashir had a broad palate the look of complete unconcern on siszthads face brought a mix of dry humour and disgust from asima she could survive a cull she had survived far worse part three cargoes in which a new page of history begins ghassan shuffled his feet nervously and glanced sidelong at captain jaral in the past few years their life had become surprisingly mundane the pelasians seemed to have turned their attention west toward their own people the civil war there may have been quick and brutal but the resulting peace had been long and just as brutal for three years now pelasia had cut off most of its remaining ties with the empire or at least with the former territories of the empire black ships had rarely been seen anywhere near the border zone concentrating instead on keeping the new reign imposed on an unhappy and restless population consequently the only target for the militia was the pirates and with what was essentially the closure of pelasian waters and therefore a massive increase in calphorian military concentration on antipiracy activities the villains were generally staying well away from the coastal regions and picking on the occasional brave merchant who crossed the open sea it had been rumoured that the lord of calphoris was considering reducing the size of his navy and pushing any spare militia into the land forces the idealistic side of ghassan approved of the move and realised that a reassignment to dry land could be a step toward his goal of directing the strength of calphoris against mdahz the practical side of him also realised however that since satrap maahd was now one of the top men in pelasia any move against them would likely result in calphoris being squashed like an insect under the weight of the pelasian army also frankly hed grown to love life at sea and so it was with some trepidation that he stood now with his captain outside the doors of the lords council chamber in the palace of calphoris the next few minutes could change his life entirely he could even be pensioned out he swallowed nervously enter ghassan straightened his hastilywashed uniform and watched as the huge cedar doors swung slowly inwards to reveal the great court chamber of the provincial capital the lord of calphoris sat at the far end not as ghassan had expected on a high throne surrounded by vassals and servants and plotting campaigns on grand maps the lord of calphoris was in fact sitting at a plain wooden desk with two elderly men and scribbling furiously while discussing something in low voices ghassan looked around at the room large and high and fancy enough in which to hold great state occasions the hall was certainly the largest single room ghassan had even seen poles jutted from the wall high on both sides having once held banners of some kind the room was of white and yellow marble with an inlaid and patterned floor he looked at the captain who shrugged and gestured forwards the two men fell easily into step and strode with a clacking sound across the hard floor as they approached the far end the lord looked up and blinked sitting back as they came to a halt and saluted he frowned and then nodded captain jaral and officer ghassan of the wind of god yes sir they both replied in the affirmative the lord of calphoris eximperial provincial governor and the most powerful man south of the sea was a surprisingly small and mousy nondescript man in an ordinary plain tunic and breeches he scratched his chin and fixed the two of them with the most piercing gaze ghassan had ever seen those emerald eyes seemed to have weighed up ghassans worth in a glance this despite his ordinary appearance was an exceptionally intelligent man i have important news to impart to you gentlemen please stand at ease as the two sailors relaxed a little though not enough to appear insolent the lord leaned back and stretched you have been in port for three days i believe he fished around among his papers found one and ran his gaze down it of sixty two militia craft in varying sizes the wind of god is the only one currently in port and the shadus arrow which we are not expecting for several days will be the next he smiled as he leaned back it is good to see the navy so active though i might prefer a few vessels close enough to afford protection to the city he shrugged did either of you see an unusual vessel arrive this morning the captain nodded there was a fast northern courier bearing a flag i didnt recognise sir a raven a dog and a cat or some such looked a lot like the old imperial flag a new lord in contact sir the lord smiled it was actually a raven a wolf and a lion silver on black if you had looked carefully you would have seen the crown between them also again those piercing eyes weighed the two men up news as i said brought on a courier ship from the north important news that directly affects myself you and your crew and indirectly everyone in calphoris but for now i want the flow of this news restricted i need you to remain collected and deal with this professionally yes the two men frowned and nodded uncertain of what was happening around them the lord breathed in and out several times and then straightened there has been something of a development in the interminable power struggles of the central provinces gentlemen a week ago give or take a day or two lord avitus of velutio met the infamous general caerdin in battle somewhere near the capital it would appear that although the general himself did not survive the battle his liege lord has been crowned emperor the first in two decades to dare claim the title the surprise was evident on the sailors faces and the lord of calphoris smiled quietly according to my dispatches this darius as he is called has received overwhelming support from the northern and central provinces the imperial government is being reconstituted and commissioners sent to all imperial territories to aid the transition of power as soon as things are settled at velutio and on isera he sighed sadly there are a number of lords both here in the south and along the eastern coast that will be unwilling to accept the mastery of a new emperor and may well declare independence i on the other hand am more than satisfied to return to my original role as governor of calphoris if the commissioners will allow it and i believe they will by declaring for the new emperor it is entirely possible that i have made enemies for us of several of the more powerful lords in the southern provinces do you see why i bring this to your attention captain jaral tapped his lip with respect my lord governor or your excellency will do nicely i think excellency what does this mean for the militia are we to be disbanded maintained or integrated into new forces the governor shrugged i have only the bare bones of the matter at the moment captain i cannot imagine that men of talent and experience will be wasted i am sure there will at the very least be a place for you but let me come to the heart of the matter the reason i sent for you then sir the governor sank back into his chair once more glancing briefly at the two old men who continued to work at their ledgers without looking up until we have further instructions from the imperial council i must do what i feel is prudent for calphoris as you are aware i have allowed the naval branch of the militia to operate very loosely under the authority of each individual captain reporting only to the militia commander at calphoris commander pharus has always steadfastly maintained that such was the only way to operate an effective militia navy yessir for now however i need someone to coordinate naval activity to plan strategies and to dispatch the various militia vessels appropriately to new assignments as they return to port it may be weeks or even more than a month before we receive any further instructions from the capital and we have cities to the east who may declare against the emperor and a growing and turbulent situation to the west ghassan frowned excellency pelasia has been quiet for years the governor sighed his expression inscrutable that brings me to the rest of the news in the dispatches gentlemen it would appear that the scion of the last true royal house of pelasia prince ashar parishid took the field alongside the new emperor and general caerdin and defeated the de facto ruler the satrap of siszthad in that same engagement the young first officer blinked in surprise sir pelasians fighting in the central imperial provinces yes the governor shrugged it does seem odd doesnt it in the days of the old empire pelasian units were a standard auxiliary force in the military but never whole armies of them becoming tied up in imperial politics still it is not difficult to see how with the fractured empire and the usurped throne of pelasia there could be sympathies among aligned factions he stretched and tapped his chin thoughtfully the problem we have now is that siszthad was not alone in his coup in pelasia there are other noblemen who will be taking this news rather badly and depending upon how prince ashar and the new imperial government handle matters we could see increased activity at the edge of our waters or even assaults on our shipping or outposts ghassan shook his head in disbelief satrap maahd is basically in control of pelasia right now and i would say hes too careful to launch a war on us when theres trouble coming back at him from overseas the governor nodded in fairness young man regardless of siszthads title i think you will find its been maahd that has controlled pelasia for years and while he may be concentrating on the potential return of prince ashar mdahz is one of his power bases and his main shipyard these days so he may feel the need to make his presence felt on our border regardless he shrugged until we receive further word from velutio i want you jaral to coordinate the fleet as soon as you leave here go and see the commander pharus and he will make arrangements for staff banners and documents of authority to be delivered to you i need you to make sure we still have an effective presence against pirates and to put some ships to patrol in the east as you see fit but make sure you have enough of a force to deal with any pelasian threat the governor smiled and tapped the side of his nose conspiratorially and dont go spreading the word about the new emperor beyond those who need to know yet ive made no official announcement and dont intend to until ive slept upon it as far as most folk are concerned until further notice this is a mere reorganisation of the militia lets not start a panic or a riot with unconfirmed rumours eh also he added pinching the bridge of his nose lets give it a few days and make sure this darius is still in power with his head on his shoulders once the dust settles the captain saluted sir im not the most senior captain in the fleet you understand you are however two things the governor smiled the most renowned and popular captain and first officer in my navy with a fearsome reputation and the only one currently in port now get to work jaral of course excellency the captain turned on his heel and strode from the room ghassan hurrying to catch up still shaking his head in amazement captain what does this mean for mdahz do you think the prince ashar will be leading an army or a fleet back from the north to retake pelasia if he does what will happen to my town calm yourself ghassan i realise that youve always wanted to go back to mdahz and personally behead that sack of shit satrap but whatever may happen to the town maahd has been living at akkad for years now controlling the throne he may be beyond even your reach there ghassan nodded glumly and jaral gave him a fatherly smile as they left the halls foyer and the doors were closed behind them well have to head back to the ship as soon as were done here and inform them of the change in status and orders then ill have to look for somewhere appropriate in the port to set up a headquarters we can have staff and equipment sent to the ship in the meantime i presume sir that the crew will have a few days shore leave until the other vessels have all arrived and youve set their orders and are free to come back out jaral laughed hardly ghassan im going to be a little busy from now on and from what the governor said well need to get the ships out and patrolling as fast as possible ill need to be on top of the situation at all times with reports from every ship that comes in changing the groupings and position of the navy as required gods i may even need to put in a request to construct or buy more vessels but ghassan youre more than capable of captaining the ship and you know it just make sure you follow the orders i give you and dont go off on one of your personal crusades to hunt down maahd or your brother theres other things to be done right now ghassan shook his head im not sure how the crew will take it sir jaral smiled i think youll find theyve been expecting it for some time in which events take a surprising turn things had been unsettled for some time in the palace asima had made the most of the last three years but had been continually beset by difficulties the satrap of siszthad had taken no interest in the harem finding his entertainment in less reputable directions as a result things had become static among the women with no master or husband the women were not required to leave their harem were even forbidden to do so in this stilted lifeless situation asima had taken to playing games with her fellow inmates turning them against one another and watching the resulting mayhem with interest causing discomfort among her rivals was her only diversion though and even that had begun to pall after a few months after all she was at the pinnacle as it was and playing the game repeatedly when youd already won was no fun at all she had wondered whether given siszthads notorious preferences one of the other two important satraps would come to the harem to take a woman but they had not done so on one of the rare occasions half a year ago when a guard had come to the building on a chore and had shown a little humanity to the women asima had quizzed him about the three satraps she had been surprised initially to learn that siszthad had led an army across the sea to track down prince ashar and strike a deal with the lord of velutio it had seemed strange for the little piggy hedonist to embark solo on such an impressive military campaign but then it would have been the other two pushing him into it and asima was sure they considered their figurehead king to be thoroughly expendable the darkskinned nomadic satrap apparently already had a harem of wives he had brought with him from the desert as he despised the softer lighter women of the coastal regions and as for maahd according to the guard maahd simply had no time for them he was busy effectively ruling the country and planning expansion and that left few hours for frivolities life had become dull but still asima kept herself alert on the edge when things were quiet in her experience it was almost always a prelude to busier times and indeed it would appear that busier times were arriving this morning one of the younger girls who was so far below asima on the ladder that she felt almost friendly toward her had come with news that the palace was a hive of activity asima of course had been blissfully unaware of this her apartment looking out over the sea meant that the only activity she ever witnessed in the palace were the guards patrolling the walls far below the younger girls though desperate for excitement had taken to hanging around the window that asima and yasmin used to frequent and others that were more readily accessible these days she had listened halfheartedly for a moment reasoning that what the girl thought of as a hive of activity could be anything but it had appeared she was correct the stables had apparently been emptied the horses camels and carts of the palace loaded up asima had frowned and gone to her window sure enough the guard had been changed the common arrangement to which she was now very accustomed called for two guards to each stretch of wall passing one another as they patrolled with one more in each tower and more on duty below and out of sight now however there was one guard alone patrolling the two stretches of wall and three towers visible from her window that was why she now found herself standing like a sneaky child at the narrow window of the kitchens close to the harems main gate watching as the guard were paraded back and forth kitted out for a campaign whatever maahd and his crony were up to it would appear that it would take them out of akkad and that could be dangerous for him even in such seclusion as the women now suffered the mood of the populace was common knowledge the ruling triumvirate was not popular it seemed hardly a surprise particularly given the respect that had been accorded the godking amashir asima frowned as her eyes strayed from the marching soldiers to the heavilyladen carts being marshalled in the gravel area between the public palace and the mausoleum what in the name of sanity were they taking that weighed so many carts so far down her frown deepened as two servants left the public palace carrying something large under a sackcloth covering toward one of the carts as she watched in interest one of them got their feet tangled in the cloth and it slide from their burden the large filigree gilded shutters that protected the godkings reliquary flashed in the sunlight asima growled maahd wasnt going on campaign he was simply leaving and taking whatever he wished with him she scoured the grounds for more signs of the satraps greed and suddenly spotted the man himself with one of his officers striding toward the main door not ten feet from this very window holding her breath she ducked back out of sight the two were deep in conversation as they approached but their voices were low and quiet asima strained to hear as the two men stopped outside the closed door will they leave the building sire theyll have to siva see to it lets make this quick the storm approaches asima frowned for a moment storm it was a perfect day there she adjusted her thinking to the likelihood of a metaphorical storm something so huge was about to happen that maahd and his men were leaving akkad and raping it of anything valuable she allowed herself a small crooked smile ashar that had to mean prince ashar he was coming back for his throne her smile slid a little things might be bad right now with that unpleasant pig on the throne and the two most callous satraps in the kingdom running things but at least they had no opinion of her either way ashar on the other hand had never made any secret of the fact that he distrusted and disliked her it would appear that she was about to be delivered from an uncaring captor by one who actively disliked her what sort of choice was that moreover where were they being taken maahd and his ally held no interest in the women of the harem as the great doors of the harem rattled and creaked open asimas heart lurched and the colour drained from her face as she became sure of their fate maahd was raping the city but had no interest in the women so they would not take the girls with them but he would leave nothing for ashar in the brutal world in which these satraps lived a retreating soldier left nothing for the enemy the women would be killed probably along with the servants of the palace then very likely the whole complex would be put to the torch and maybe even the city so that when ashar arrived there was nothing but soot and wreckage awaiting him she realised she was growling gently her hand closed on something and she looked down in surprise she had grasped one of the cleavers hanging from the rack above the heavy wooden bench now why had she done that if shed believed in gods or fate or indeed anything but her own will she might have put that down to some hidden influence smiling coldly she walked quietly along the wall of the kitchens parallel with the entrance corridor of the harem a footthick wall all that separated her from the two men she approached the kitchen door with a little trepidation and paused listening this portal led back out into the central courtyard of the harem beside the entrance passage she heard maahd and his man stop nearby heard the satrap clear his throat and begin to address the harem in a clear voice women of the royal bedchamber we no longer have any need of you and the time has come for you to escape this prison you are to be set free behind the decorative door asima snarled she knew exactly what sort of escape and freedom the man was talking about well she was not going to curl up and accept her fate quietly outside she could hear girls rushing out of the doorways around the building and into the garden chattering with excitement could they really be so dense and short sighted that they believed the masters of akkad after leaving them to rot for three years actually intended to free them just how stupid were some of these women she heard a hoarse chuckle from the officer without a plan without forethought or even taking a breath in preparation asima ripped open the kitchen door and stepped out directly behind the captain of the satraps guard in that brief moment she took in the entire scene the women were filing out into the open square from which maahd addressed them the guard officer was armed but the weapon was sheathed maahd likewise with no grace or elegance asima swung the heavy cleaver to her left her eyes fixed on maahd and not even breaking her step as she tugged the gleaming blade back out of the mans neck hearing the unpleasant sounds as it snapped a tendon and left the spine almost severed behind her captain siva of the palace guard his eyes bulging in shock collapsed to his knees and then one hand going to the huge chasm in his neck toppled gently forward making gurgling noises the whole assault had been so brief that she had already taken her next swing before maahd his eyes wide with surprise had begun turning to see what had happened her blow took off maahds left arm just above the elbow the razorsharp heavy blade continuing on to dig into his ribs he stared at her his mouth opening and closing as he registered the gruesome damage she had just inflicted on him the whole world having slowed to a crawl for asima as she dived into her assault with no thought and delivered her initial blows suddenly sped up and left her in a minor panic what in hells teeth had driven her to do this before her satrap maahd was recovering his composure the wound was crippling but far from fatal he roared and reached around with his right hand to draw his long curved sword asima swallowed and sighed no going back now she had to finish it as the wounded tyrant began to draw his sword the blade rasping against the metal edge of the scabbard asima kicked him in the kneecap with as much force as she could muster there was a satisfying crunch and sword still half sheathed maahd cried out in pain and fell heavily on to his back now they were fighting on asimas terms and not his like all of her plans carefully constructed over many years of harem life this one had to be played out in the appropriate steps and carefully first the element of surprise well shed accomplished that easily second leave nothing for your victim to use against you taking a deep breath she drew back the cleaver and let it fall with all the power she had behind it the satrap agonised and in shock floundering on the floor with a missing arm and a shattered knee could do nothing but watch in horror as his other arm hacked off above the wrist scraped across the gravel and came to a halt beneath a decorative rose bush what he managed blood bubbling around his lips as he managed to speak in a wheezy whisper why asima smiled and the effect made the satrap recoil as far as his position allowed you invaded our town burned our homes killed our people turned on your own country and usurped your king among many other smaller failings there are countless reasons im sure why people want to see you dead maahd but not me you see i have changed since the days you sent me away from mdahz as she spoke she stooped and finished the job of drawing his curved sword from the sheath flinging the cleaver covered in viscera into the bushes away from them she became aware of the horrified silence that filled the garden and the increasing proximity of some of the other women who were slowly closing in from behind her they were hardly a worry quite simply maahd you took a happy young girl and turned her into me for that i suppose i should really thank you i am far stronger and more powerful than i could ever have hoped to be as asima the merchants daughter she paused in her speech for a moment to bring the long curved blade down in a precise blow that severed his other leg below the knee the satrap shrieked third step make sure you have them exactly where you want them and there is no escape she turned and the women approaching her stopped in their tracks id wait there ladies im rather enjoying myself and i dont know whether ill be able to stop at two she licked her lip hungrily without paying any further heed to them asima turned back to the maimed and bloody mess below her he was flailing but not a single limb remained intact to obey his brains desperate commands to flee this mad woman no asima stated flatly ive long ago got past hating you im sorry if it bruises your ego your lordship but there are girls in this building that i consider more of a threat than you no i couldnt have cared less about you she gave three light slashes with the blade delivering random cuts across the mans torso eliciting new cries of agony no this is quite simply self preservation i will not go to my death maahd some of these women may be stupid enough to think you might free them but the only thing im not sure of is whether you would have had us shot full of arrows or simply locked us in a shed and set fire to it and the last step make sure the game goes on long enough to enjoy it she delivered a few more painful cuts he was bleeding quite profusely now and his face had become gaunt and grey the hollows of his eyes taking on a purple tint more even than that you see prince ashar never liked me much i dont think ill thrive under his reign but i may be able to begin closing the gap between us when i present him with your neatly severed head on a bed of rose petals without taking her eyes from the groaning heap below her asima gestured over her shoulder with her free hand you girls get me a few hundred rose petals and a silver serving dish satrap maahds reign is over the last thing the mighty satrap maahd power behind the throne of pelasia and conqueror of mdahz ever saw was the happy grin on the face of a bloodspattered beauty as she went to work sawing through his neck with his own sword and whistling a lullaby as she did in which borders are redrawn asima stood glowering at the new king of pelasia ashar calm and collected leaned back in his seat and placed his feet upon the table in a relaxed fashion i understand you have a problem lady asima she eyed him coldly and nodded i am well aware of the fact that you do not like me majesty i never expected to fulfil the same place with you as i did your uncle but this is madness it flies in the face of tradition ashar laughed lightly tradition asima you would lecture me on pelasian tradition unless i am mistaken you are only partially of our blood born and bred in imperial lands who are you really to take the high ground with me asima grumbled i am the woman who dealt with maahd for you and prevented you returning to a ruined city at least give me that ashar paused for a moment a thoughtful look on his face i will give you that yes i do not believe for a moment that it was motivated by selfless honour rather than selfpreservation and personal gain it so happens that our goals coincided for a time he sighed and sat forward once more cradling his hands on the table asima the world has changed pelasia has changed for all their greed and wickedness the three usurpers have changed the role of the pelasian ruler forever i shall not be a godking merely a king i also have no need of a coven of women to fulfil my desires there is one woman i have ever wanted and she and i will see out my reign together i am disbanding the harem and that is all there is to it you should be glad glad asima said her voice rising with a dangerous edge majesty i was plucked from a comfortable and innocent life put through hell and managed through my own strength to claw my way to a good position and now you ostensibly the hero of this little play wish to take that away from me again what do you intend to do with all the noble and delicate women you cast aside and make homeless ashar smiled the ladies of the harem will be given estates and titles i have no wish to see my uncles wives go without nobody will suffer as part of this rearrangement asima settled to a quiet simmer well at least thats something we can continue to live appropriately for members of the royal court but there was something about the smile on king ashars face that she didnt like i think youd better take a seat asima ill stand very well the king continued straightening i have just concluded a treaty with the emperor darius he really is a very amenable young man as well as supplying a sizeable force to help me retake pelasia he has given me a number of trade and political concessions and has asked for almost nothing in return just the return of certain territories claimed by my predecessors asima frowned you are giving mdahz back to the empire yes it is the least i can do in fact it was never worth fighting over in the first place i suspect it was only ever to be a staging post for maahds rebellion yes asima i am returning mdahz to the empire i am also making unsought reparations for damage and trouble caused by the presence of pelasian control we will supply funds and workers for rebuilding can you afford that youve still got to rebuild parts of pelasia ashar raised an eyebrow and asima was suddenly acutely aware that she had fallen into a very informal mode of speech with a very powerful man ashar shrugged the money and workers are coming from the estates of those we have overthrown asima nodded if my father is alive would your majesty be kind enough to inform him of my situation and to ask him to come to akkad ashar folded his arms that wont be necessary asima ive no doubt youll see him soon enough he noted the confusion on asimas face and smiled when i said that the ladies of the harem will be given estates i was referring to the pelasian ladies asima you can call yourself whatever you wish but you are a girl from mdahz and as part of the reparations i intend to send back there anyone who was forcefully taken by maahd youre going home asima he watched her and gave a light chuckle as he saw her face drain of colour before filling once more with pink as anger replaced the shock you cant ashar grinned and tapped the circlet on his brow i believe youll find lady asima that this says i can you can go home to your family and friends but im not that person anymore king ashar im one of you now ive been here since i was young i may have been an imperial girl but im a pelasian woman what you are asima is a dangerous woman i am mindful of the fact that my uncle was very fond of you and that it is in all probability our fault that you have become this untrustworthy twisted and selfseeking creature that is why i intend to send you back in style with money and a guard i have no wish to see you suffer asima but i also have no wish to see you here any more what once again her voice raised a notch as she approached the table and slapped her hands down on the wooden surface opposite the king you are too troublesome and dangerous to keep around asima i do worry a little that setting you loose in imperial territory probably violates some part of the nonaggression treaty i have just signed but thats all there is to it dont fight me on this asima youre going home accept it the strength seemed to go out of asima and she deflated slightly where she stood do not make me beg majesty i am pelasian and all i want is to stay send me to another city if you must but do not send me back home there is nothing in mdahz for me im sure your father would be proud to hear you say that asima you must go for the peace of my realm and the security of my throne take some time to go through everything you may take whatever you wish and have time to say your goodbyes if there is anyone in the palace that you have not manipulated and alienated in your time here in three days you leave for the border and from that moment on you are forbidden from ever again setting foot on pelasian soil ashar eyed asimas hands on the desk where one had quietly and unnoticed begun toying with a letter opener in the shape of a knife even when you are unaware of your actions you are dangerous asima reaching across he took the small knife out from under her fingers and sheathed it now go and prepare yourself in calphoris everything was chaos ghassan captain of the wind of god strode through the governors palace gates acknowledging the guards as he passed he was becoming well known to them all now the imperial commissioner and his party had arrived yesterday and within an hour the raven flag of the empire had been raised above the palace the port and all the citys gates over the last week or so ghassan had seen almost nothing of his former captain jaral had been busy in his new headquarters building dishing out orders and charters to captains and mercenaries as though they were at war curious really since calphoris was currently more at peace than at any time in the last quarter of a century he smiled and brushed aside the curl of black hair that made his brow itch for some reason he never seemed to have time to get his hair cut these days and nothing he tried ever stopped the floppy curls from doing exactly as they pleased straightening in a military pose he strode across the compound saluted the guards at the palace door and climbed the white marble steps with practiced ease he trod the corridors of the great building until he arrived at the audience chamber of the governor he stopped at the entrance and waited one of the guards knocked at the door opened it when ordered from within and announced the young captain ghassan heard the governor shout him in and smiling at the guard ducked past and entered jaral stood at the wide desk with the governor and several people he didnt recognise as he strode toward them he sized up the four strangers one was a thin reedy man with a large nose dressed in grey robes clearly an administrator or bureaucrat from velutio another was a heavy set bearded man in uniform likely the captain of the ship that had brought them here the other two were a peculiar couple a young lady slightly built and heavily pregnant sat on the governors chair while her hand was held by a man with a missing arm and missing eye wearing a uniform with a tiger pelt over the shoulder that clearly denoted high rank in a very military fashion ghassan approached the table came to a halt and saluted first the governor then jaral and finally the two uniformed strangers your excellency sent for me the governor smiled at him indeed captain ghassan as im sure youve already guessed this is minister fulvis of the imperial government here to go through the details of reintegration with me gesturing appropriately he introduced the others captain harald of the steel claw marshal tythias of the southern provinces and his lovely lady wife sathina ghassan tried not to stare at the marshal it could be considered extremely rude given that this was one of the most powerful men in the empire there was something vaguely hypnotic about the network of old scars on the mans face and staring was practically a requirement he almost heaved a sigh of relief when the scarred commander smiled captain ghassan i hear good things about you im overseeing the reorganisation of the militia in the south as you may be aware the imperial army and navy have been fully reconstituted i am taking command of all the forces in the southern provinces and intend to set up my headquarters here in calphoris ghassan nodded professionally trying to hide the sheer pleasure of the discovery that the militia were to become part of the marshals forces beneath me i have pharus who is being promoted to general and placed in charge of the provinces ground forces and on the recommendation of the governor here i am accepting jaral as commodore and commander of the navy all current militia forces both land and sea will be reassigned to the appropriate service branches ghassan nodded once more i understand sir i hope we will live up to your requirements marshal tythias smiled his strangely warming broken smile i have no doubt young master ghassan however youve been sent for specifically for two reasons firstly i am reliably informed that you are both the best and the luckiest sailor in calphoris i approve of the former but the latter is just as important i myself am only alive through the judicious application of luck he took a deep breath and secondly because of your affiliations ghassan frowned in incomprehension and the marshal sighed captain we are trying to get things back to the way they were under the old imperial bureaucracy with our position here and new trade treaties with pelasia we hope for a significant increase in mercantile activity and that means the suppression of what has been called a plague of pirates in the waters north of here ghassan swallowed nervously trouble was marching his way the marshal smiled sadly i am informed that one of the more notorious of the pirate captains is in fact your brother under normal circumstances the very last thing i would do is attempt to pit you against him however commodore jaral assures me that not only will you not allow your filial situation to come between you and duty but that you are probably the only man capable of both outthinking and outsailing him i will not even as your commander order you to do this the marshal began ghassan saluted and straightened you dont have to marshal samir may be my brother but he needs to be removed i understand that tythias nodded good thank you captain i will leave the matter in your hands ghassan saluted again is there anything else sirs the governor shook his head and ghassan nodded turned on his heel and strode from the room it was an unhappy task but they were absolutely right samir had to be taken out of the picture for the good of the empire in which a homecoming is suffered the pelasian cataphracti eight in number in their gleaming fishscale armour came to a halt four to each side of the coach the driver waited his horses stamping and snorting while the escort commander approached the gate requesting permission to enter asima leaned out of the window of the coach glaring at their destination even from here where she could only make out the basic details of the soldiers all in imperial green she could feel the animosity being projected at the black and steel clad soldiers the pelasian military despite prince ashars excellent relations with the new emperor were not a popular sight in beleaguered and oppressed mdahz the people had enjoyed only two weeks of freedom since the pelasian withdrawal and here were a unit of that lands elite cavalry at the gate unpleasant memories would rise unbidden to the fore in every citizen who saw them there was a brief discussion at the gate and the great wooden portal swung ponderously open asima sighed in her youth the walls of the town had fallen into disuse due to the uninterrupted centuries of peace now even the gates remained shut irritably she ducked back inside and pulled across the curtain as the coach began to roll slowly on once again throughout the interminable journey across the barren landscape between central pelasia and the borderlands she had pondered and thought planned and schemed there was no way she would settle back in mdahz but the current situation in pelasia for her was untenable ashar had forbidden her from returning and so the plan had been born it was ambitious probably asimas most ambitious plan of all time it would take a few years and a lot of planning sprinkled with a judicious topping of luck but it could work king ashar only maintained his hold on power in pelasia through the respect and fear of the other nobles the coup of the three satraps had changed things there forever the ruler was no longer unreachable and immortal and ashar knew it so she would find a way to return to pelasia through a different noble house half a dozen powerful satraps had lands stretching east toward the imperial border and asima knew that if she had nothing else in the world her looks and her brains alone could carry her to the top she would find a way back across the border entice and entrance one of the powerful nobles and use him to ingratiate her way back into court in akkad ashar would never dare order one of his more powerful satraps to lose a wife the first thing to do would be to settle back in mdahz and wait for around half a year living quietly and unobtrusively she may even change her name it might be expedient and give her an edge when she broke the rules and returned to pelasia as she pondered she heard the change in tone when the wheels of the carriage passed from the dusty rocky sand of the desert road to the flagged streets of mdahz despite the fact that she no longer considered this flea pit her home and wanted nothing more than to be away from it and back to her beloved akkad she would have to spend some time here and had to admit that curiosity was getting the better of her she pulled back the curtain they had passed through the akkad gate and were trundling along the main street toward the centre of town and they became the focus of attention to all as they passed the evidence of mdahzs return to imperial control was everywhere imperial banners flew over the towers of the town the propaganda for the reign of maahd on the walls to the town was being removed carefully and painstakingly by the citizens colour was returning slowly but surely but every face turned as the coach with its escort passed by every worker stopped in the middle of their task every child or mother exiting a side street came to a halt and every face hardened every eye took on a look of intense hatred asima fumed she could understand why they felt what they did but it was so futile these werent the same men whod conquered this town the man responsible for their misery was dead by her hands no less these miserable wretches should be thanking her throwing petals before her she had avenged them all the more she looked out the more irritated she became she had been forced into exile back in this dismal place and the people here were going to hate and resent her her anger rose to a climax as they reached the end of the long and level street and turned right heading up the hill inland on the corner between the streets stood the pelasian temple with its tower the building had been a landmark in mdahz as long as asima could remember and had figured in their rooftop chases as children at some point in the past few days revenge for the pelasian occupation had been carried out on the temple the white plastered walls were charred where the flames had licked out of windows and doors the entire building had been gutted and heavy wooden beams propped up the tower which was leaning at a precarious angle she growled quietly to herself and settled back into her seat from the directions the coach was taking they must be heading for the palace complex of the towns governor remembering the day she was taken from here she found herself wondering who was in charge of mdahz now still grumbling unhappily asima sank back into the seat and walked herself through her plans once more as the carriage trundled on up the uneven street several minutes later she heard the cataphracti rein in their horses and the carriage rolled to a halt there was conversation nearby and curiosity getting the best of her she pulled back the curtains once more the small party had stopped in the plaza before the gate of the palace complex the escort captain was speaking to a small group of welldressed men by the entrance and from the sound of the rising voices there seemed to be a problem everything else and now another problem asima ground her teeth shed been thrown out of this place and sent to an unfamiliar country only to be then sent back once shed become so thoroughly native to pelasia that she would never fit in here again and now there was another problem before she had time to decide whether it was a good idea or not her anger had driven her to fling open the coach door and storm out into the bright sun directly toward the group the pelasian captain his helm clutched beneath one arm while his other hand was busy making argumentative gestures turned in surprise at the sound as did the others with him my lady please return to the coach i am dealing with matters asima snarled at him and turned the most vicious glare she could muster on the tall thin and elegant man in his silks and satins clearly the new governor and from his paler skin tone just as evidently an imperial import from across the sea be quiet captain i have had enough of this she barked without looking at the soldier ignoring the blustering noises from the startled captain she narrowed her eyes at the governor i can assure you excellency that i have no more wish to be here than you have for me to be however i need a comfortable place to bide my time until i can get out of your hair once again i will cause you no trouble and stay almost completely unnoticed as long as you can provide me with a few things firstly i need to see my father the governor far from being taken aback and meekly acquiescing as shed expected straightened and looked down his nose at her young lady i do not care how you were trained in pelasia but here we expect a modicum of manners he watched her intently for a moment and squared his shoulders i checked into matters very thoroughly prior to your arrival and im afraid your father passed on a number of years ago of an illness secondly as effectively a foreigner with no familial connections in mdahz and no property here i am not particularly disposed to putting myself out for you in the spirit of cooperation with king ashar i have agreed not to turn you back at the border but as im sure you would soon notice pelasians are not well regarded in mdahz at the moment and i cannot guarantee your personal safety while in the town asima frowned for some reason the news of her fathers passing had hardly touched her at all she found herself more concentrating on the other focus of the conversation then may i ask what you intend to do governor the man folded his arms and nodded you cannot stay here young lady and you are clearly not welcome in pelasia so i have made alternative arrangements for you asimas frown deepened and she pursed her lips other arrangements the governor nodded and gestured to the leader of the cataphract unit your task is complete captain i will take responsibility for your charge now the captain saluted and turned with to asimas shrewd eye just a little too much relief for her liking she glared at him as he strode to his horse and climbed slowly into the saddle under the weight of the heavy armour ignoring the escort as they wheeled their horses and trotted away she eyed warily the small unit of whiteclad governorial guards as they marched out purposefully toward the carriage explain she said flatly the governor shrugged unconcerned you are a courtier so i am sending you to court in a little less than an hour your ship leaves for velutio and the imperial capital you will be both safe and comfortable there and may find a number of other pelasians there at any given time asimas mouth fell open she was for the first time she could remember completely at a loss for words conflicting emotions and ideas raced through her mind she knew nothing about life in the imperial court certainly they wouldnt have such things as harems and concubines there and it was cold they said it was so cold sometimes in velutio that the rain came down in lumps asima hadnt experienced rain in her life until she settled in akkad and even there it was a gentle warm and refreshing thing of course velutio was if anything a more powerful place full of influential people even than akkad there could be possibilities but it would require a complete readjustment of her thinking and she would have to start from scratch she realised she was standing like an idiot her mouth flapping open and closed angry with herself she shut it and tried not to grind her teeth the look in the governors eye was resolute she would be on board that ship whether she accepted it or not and so as had always been her way she grasped the situation and made it her own very well your excellency i can see that you have covered every angle and have my safety at heart would you ask one of your guards to make sure that my luggage is transferred from carriage to ship carefully i have a number of breakable things with me the governor nodded i hope that velutio sits well with you young lady i have spent many happy years there and for a young noblewoman with money there are many entertaining diversions asima nodded and turned toward her carriage to see a new group of men alongside the governors guards busily checking over the carriage for the second time in as many minutes asimas jaw dropped asima ghassan blinked is that really you asima found that words just wouldnt form on her tongue she was silent as she stared at the tall muscular naval officer before her there could be no doubt that it was him the floppy black curls that fell over his brow took her straight back to those days of running over rooftops and sneaking into warehouses ghassan the young man nodded still staring at her she suddenly became aware that the governor had stepped forward next to her captain you know the lady asima ghassan shook his head in wonder i knew her many years ago excellency yes the governor nodded then if your ship is ready for the tide you will have plenty of time to become reacquainted asima continued to stare as the ghost of her past formed up his men in which a journey is undertaken asima frowned as her eyes ran up and down ghassan once more it was so clearly him and yet at the same time he had changed so much the serious tall curly haired boy had grown into his look and suited the uniform of a naval officer for certain and while she couldnt fathom what series of events had led him from the streets of occupied mdahz to captaincy in the imperial navy at calphoris he was obviously born for this life he seemed at ease and had acquired that natural rolling gait of the practiced sailor moreover he appeared to know every peg and rope on the ship personally and every man aboard even those three times his age looked up to him and treated him with respect and trust but then she would have changed as much to his eyes she dropped her gaze to the aperture in the wooden hull and the water rushing past outside and chided herself for even beginning to get sentimental over her childhood friend they had hardly had a chance to exchange a dozen words in these first few hours out of port with ghassan constantly occupied on duty now however hed come back to the room set aside for her in the covered housing at the rear of the wind of god poured two glasses of highquality wine and sank into the seat opposite silently waiting for her to initiate conversation the problem was that she just had no idea where to begin wasnt even sure she wanted to begin more than half of her life had passed since she had last set eyes on the brothers and she had changed beyond measure in other circumstances she might have considered reaffirming an old friendship but not now digging deep into the well of her being she was a little surprised to find that the sudden appearance of someone once beloved from her past had almost entirely failed to move her once the initial shock had faded rather than fascination or a desire to catch up what she found herself wondering was how she could use ghassan to her advantage the greater surprise had been that the realisation that she was truly that shallow and quite possibly now incapable of love empathy or sympathy had not in fact given her any cause for concern not only had her soul hardened to diamond cold and impervious but she was at ease with the fact life was a game and needed to be played to win finally uncomfortably ghassan broke the silence im so sorry about your father mmm asima looked back from the sea her wandering thoughts sharply reeled in and shut away where they could be contained and protected i asked around and hed lived well after you left ghassan continued he was looked after but an illness of the gut settled in and the doctors could do nothing asima frowned again and shook her head changing the subject and what of you ghassan why the navy the tall curly haired captain shrugged a series of unpredictable choices samir and i both vowed to free mdahz and kill the satrap but i think samir knew we wouldnt agree on how i went to join the army and then turn them on mdahz samir left me and ran away into the criminal underbelly of the town he sighed and now mdahz is free and i wasnt even involved all my plans to launch a rescue for the town and its fate was decided by politicians a thousand miles away i would feel deflated but its just not the allconsuming goal it once was the militarys given me purpose and now that its part of the empire again it feels like im helping to build something asima nodded sagely while actually only half listening and ive persuaded the governor of calphoris to request extradition of satrap maahd for his unwarranted invasions and executions given the alliance between us now and maahds involvement in the coup im sure the new king will agree and then ill go collect him myself and deal with him in public asima looked up and was impressed at the cold viciousness she could see in his eyes ghassan was about to be sorely disappointed you may have a little trouble there ghassan narrowed his eyes what im afraid maahd wont be sent here he is not imprisoned by ashar he never got the chance the young captain stared at her and she sighed putting on her most sympathetic mask if its any consolation to you i can tell you two things one is that he died horribly he suffered from beginning to end and was never buried but cast from the city walls in akkad his remains lay on the rocks by the sea until they were eaten by scavengers she noted a certain satisfaction settle over him this could easily play to her advantage and secondly it wasnt during the civil war he died at my hands in revenge for what he did to all of us one of us did it ghassan it wasnt you but it might as well have been she smiled at him as she watched a mixture of disappointment and righteous satisfaction war for control of his face it was a lie of course revenge had not even figured in her motivation shed have been quite glad never to set eyes on mdahz again but it would have been a plausible motive had she any use for morals and nostalgia he died badly then ghassans voice sounded almost pleading very in fact if you wait i have a gift for you the young captain frowned and watched as asima unfolded her legs and wandered across to her bags she began to mutter to herself quietly as she delved into one and produced after much rummaging a small purple pouch of velvet and gold returning to her seat she sat once more crossing her legs and clicked open the catch on the pouch upending the container she held her hand beneath to catch the two things that fell out wrapped in silk and tied with a delicate gold ribbon her face grave and serious asima passed over the two small parcels one crimson and one aquamarine ghassan frowned at the items in his hand open them asima urged pocketing the pouch ghassan chose the smaller of the two parcels gently untying the ribbon and unwrapping the blue silk he stared down at the object within the folds of shiny material a ruby the size of his thumbnail stared back up at him cut shaped and immaculate and representing more than a years pay for anyone on board what is this asima smiled and there was something about the expression that ghassan wasnt sure he liked its a pommel jewel i took it from the hilt of maahds sword when id finished removing his head with it call it a keepsake ghassan stared this is worth a fortune asima you might need this in velutio she laughed but the laugh had an edge ghassan you really dont know me at all do you that is a bauble a mere bead compared with some of the precious stones i liberated from their imprisonment in akkad i could buy this ship with one jewel and not even the largest one her smile vanished instantly though i trust you will honour my wishes and keep their existence a secret ghassan frowned at her and then nodded i think youll maybe like the other one more she added his frown still in evidence the captain began to unwrap the second parcel and almost dropped the contents as they fell into his hand causing him to lurch in surprise from within the red silk a gleaming white fleshless bone finger pointed accusingly at asima what he managed his voice hoarse another little souvenir its his maahds you kept his finger asima laughed and once more ghassan was unnerved by her expression better i kept the whole hand for a while she smiled wistfully but i had to trim things down and travel light when i left akkad so i just kept a couple of fingers for luck the captain stared at his passenger and then shook his head in a mixture of disbelief and revulsion he suddenly felt so alone hed been looking forward to a chance to talk with asima to catch up on the events of so many years and now he found that she was far from the person he remembered she had hardened become cold and vicious he found himself thinking of samir and his life of crime and murder and wondering how of the three children that had raced across those dusty rooftops so long ago he seemed to be the only one that had reached adulthood with a sense of morals and principles of which their parents would be proud he frowned again asima had not flinched at the news of her fathers death she had not brought up the subject of samir not even asked where he was or what he was doing ghassan realised with a start that any trust he had in her had evaporated in the past few minutes and he began to feel for the unsuspecting nobles of velutio who were about to have this calculating woman dropped upon them ghassan he looked up and realised that asima was watching him im sorry asima thank you for thinking of me but i dont need these gifts and im afraid i dont really want them he turned and gestured at her with a waved hand have you lost touch with who you were so much that your fathers death is meaningless youve not even asked after samir asima shrugged i would have got around to it one thing at a time ghassan to do anything well you must prioritise she stood and started to walk around the room waving her hand to accentuate her words i am asima ghassan maybe not asima the poor merchants daughter from mdahz but the lady asima wife of the former godking of pelasia first woman of the harem and until recently the most powerful woman in pelasia she pointed an accusing finger you expect me not to change in almost twenty years ghassan you have changed so why not me i had to survive and in the name of all that remains i did so and i did it damned well her voice had dropped to a hiss and samir of course i know about samir that ship of his is as infamous in pelasian waters as it is in yours and he always did think faster than you ghassan thats why hes still out there how many times have you tried to corner him how many times did you think you had him before he slipped out of your grasp like water from a leaky cup she snarled and slapped her hands down on the table i do what i must ghassan so does samir only you are so weak that you hide behind your flags and regulations as you flounder around unable even to catch your brother with half the worlds military power behind you she fell silent staring down at the table she appeared to focus on something for a moment and then her mood changed like a sudden squall she glanced sidelong at the stony face of the now bitterly angry captain the target of her tirade im sorry ghassan she gave him a weak smile ive had a tough time and life is not very easy for me at the moment i shouldnt take it out on you forgive my harsh words ghassan continued to glare at her as she returned her gaze to study the map on the table beneath her hands an interesting archipelago lay between her thumbs and this if she was reading this correctly was looming in her near future she turned to regard ghassan again and the captain straightened thank you for you time lady asima i shall not disturb you again until the evening meal is prepared rest well without a word he cast the bones and the jewel onto the bunk and turning strode from the room allowing the door to shut with a loud bang behind him asima sighed had she gone too far she needed him distant but not too distant new plans new plans within plans now where was that archipelago in which asima makes her presence felt asima peered from the viewport in the side of the room she had been alone most of the time since her conversation with ghassan when she came aboard the only interruption being the delivery of her meals by one or other of the crew apparently the captain fell disinclined to join her to eat but that was better for asima anyway it had taken around an hour and all of her considerable mental faculties to fathom the arcane naval charts on the table plot the distance to the archipelago estimate the ships speed and therefore how long it would be until they reached the string of small islands having embarked on the afternoon tide the wind of god should pass the archipelago in the middle of the second night the interminable hours alone in a small bare room were then mostly spent irritably tutting as she went through all her packages it had been galling enough when she left akkad stripping so many years of her lifes acquisitions down to three large cases now she realised it would have to be just one and preferably the bag which was easily transportable refining what she needed and what she could realistically do without was a task of several hours on its own finally there had been the time spent listening to the orders and the heavy footsteps above and outside peering out of the door and along the corridor to the deck when she felt she needed more information to work out routines and schedules by sound alone was a difficult task but asima had achieved more during her time in the harem the first night had been very informative with respect to the crews night time schedule the second morning she had braced herself and left the room ostensibly to stretch her legs ghassan had glared at her when she appeared on deck and had assigned one of the oarsmen to escort her she had made a great show of enjoying the sea air stretching and relaxing and had shown an interest in the workings of the ship as she would no doubt be expected to in fact she was very interested but only in certain aspects how sails were set or oars were stored was of little value to her other parts and then she had retired to her cabin once more to settle in for the day and finalise her plans the hours had passed tensely for her as the naval vessel bounced lightly across the waves on its journey to the great city that was the centre of the empire and the start of her life of imposed exile in obscurity now the moon was bright and shining down on the water making the waves glitter and dance which worked both for and against her plan but then she could hardly control the heavens squinting out to the horizon she confirmed what she thought she saw a minute ago marked on the charts eagle rock was one of the standard naval navigation markers and stood at the near end of the closest island in the archipelago she smiled to herself predictably eagle rock was identifiable from here rising aquiline above a low spit of sand that eagle marked the arrival of the archipelago and the departure of one prickly passenger hoisting the heavy bag onto her shoulder she glanced down at the other two open on the bed and messy and dishevelled with a sigh she tapped the hilt of the knife in her belt with her free hand and gave a last quick scan of the cabin to make sure shed forgotten nothing she hadnt of course asima was nothing if not thorough nodding with satisfaction she opened the door of her cabin as quietly as she could the faint creak going unnoticed among the many other creaks and groans of a ship under sail it was almost midnight and most of the crew would be asleep the oarsmen were bedded down in their temporary sleeping rolls in the flat space between the benches in the lower deck their oars up and locked out of the water the ship slipped quietly through the sea rising and falling gently carried by a light wind slowly but continually the only crew still active on deck would be two or three of the more senior men above her current position maintaining course and speed lookouts in the bow and atop the mast and two or three ordinary crewmen padding around on watch where the oar benches lay empty overnight the only light kept aflame was at the rear where the officers worked asima peered out into the corridor from her door at the end the rear of the ship supported what was in essence an extra partial deck most of the ship consisted of a hold in the bottom of the hull with a deck of oar seats and ports above and then the main deck with two more rows of oar seats the centre of the ship however boasted a raised timber castlelike structure housing the war machines while the rear held an enclosed section of cabins with the rudder and command section atop it there were only seven rooms in the covered area five occupied by the most senior officers one for medical use and one for dining asima had been given the captains cabin and everyone had shuffled down a room for the duration of the voyage she frowned at the corridor as she held her breath and listened no sound came from the two nearest rooms while the second door on the left hummed with the sound of gentle snoring the last cabin and the sick room were silent but the noise of laughter and activity issued from the dining hall the door there was slightly ajar yellow light illuminating the medical bay door opposite there appeared to be a dice game going on within along with a lot of drinking taking a deep breath asima crept as quietly and quickly as she could down the corridor silently she slipped past the beam of yellow light catching a momentary glimpse of men at the table within who were paying no attention to the corridor heaving a sigh of relief she continued on to the end of the corridor pausing she peered out through the doorway the door itself had been jammed open with a wooden peg allowing the warm and fresh night time air to circulate in the interior the sounds of several dozen sleeping sailors rose noisily from the deck below adding to the creaking and groaning of the ship if anything the vessel was actually noisier at night than during the day for a brief moment as she grasped the door frame and prepared to put her plan into action asima experienced doubt a thing that happened so rarely it gave her pause was she being foolish it was possible she could make a comfortable life in velutio certainly she would be a great deal more welcome there than in pelasia or mdahz could it be that she was choosing the difficult course when she could make a life in the north she shook her head angry at her own weakness she had no intention of living out her days in exile in a place where the wind chilled the bones and rain was a regular occurrence and the weather was only a small part of her reasons the imperial capital would already be full of people who knew the local game so much better than her she would stand precious little chance of getting close to the emperor or his companions and she would likely end her days as some strange foreign refugee existing on the periphery of court life ashars ban or not pelasia was the place for her it was in her blood and in what was left of her soul and the realisation of that in her first few hours aboard had prompted her new scheme if three satraps a vicious one a greedy one and a virtual nomad could pull off a coup that almost changed pelasia forever imagine what she could do given a malleable satrap with good connections and a sizeable estate and military she could put him on the throne within a year two at the most and on his own not as part of some triumvirate and ashar really did have to die hed set himself against her and despite her earlier deluded schemes to ingratiate herself with him it was clear when she thought about it objectively that he would have to go in order to pave the way to power whatever changes to her plans might be caused by unforeseeable events one thing was certain she had no desire of a future in the empire pelasia was for her nodding to herself over the rightness of her decision asima ducked out of the door and turned a sharp right around the outer lip of the deck around the cabin section toward the stern she held her breath once more the ledge was only a foot wide and a slip here would end in disaster slowly and carefully she edged along the ledge watching the turbulent waters below with care fortunately the cabins she had passed on this side of the ship had all been silent and apparently empty so she had no concerns over being seen through a window it was above her that was the problem there would be several men on the upper deck busy keeping the ship on course very slowly she shuffled along the ledge occasionally feeling her foot slip and grasping the thin rail that ran around the wooden cabin housing as though her life depended upon it which of course it very well could every tiny slip sent her thumping heart into her throat and made her want to cry out though she clenched her teeth and continued on in silence a murmur of conversation made her halt and pull herself tightly against the wooden wall above her two men approached the railing and stood for a moment discussing something technical that completely bypassed asimas attention she stood perfectly still for long moments willing the two men away until they appeared to reach some sort of conclusion and then wandered back to the centre of the deck asima allowed her breath to escape slowly and continued to edge round the ship reaching the stern rapidly now she took a peek around the corner and found that what she had seen through the window in her rear cabin was indeed the case the huge rudder that was easily handled by a single man on the top deck was one enormous beam flattened out at water level to give the strength to guide the vessel it was attached to the stern by a hinged wooden contraption and safety rope that allowed it to pivot and move freely while remaining firmly under control she had studied it for some hours through the window but had been unable to actually reach it from there hence this night time journey around the dangerous edge of the ship the wind of god had been on active service for quite some time since her last sojourn in dock for maintenance and nowhere was it showing the strain more than here i expect you have to carry a lot of spare parts she had asked her escort this afternoon probing lightly but he had informed her that they only carried bulk spares of rope timber and sail cloth certainly not anything as complex as the hinged mechanism she now found herself closely examining as she closed on the rudder course had been set as soon as the eagle rock had come into view and the rudder locked into position at the top that neednt matter and in fact would prove beneficial meaning that no sailor would be close enough to the rear rail to notice her work her assessment from her cabin had been correct the two wooden struts that held the rudder into the hinged mechanism were long past due for replacement one was white with age and had been seriously attacked by salt and weather the other had already snapped though the damage had gone unnoticed as the safety rope continued to hold it together however if the other wooden spar went reaching the mechanism asima grasped the shipward end and drew her knife inserting it into a natural stress crack in the wood she began to slowly and carefully work the solid heavy blade back and forth she smiled as she felt the wood beginning to give easily under her assault and small flakes and fragments of ruined timber twanged off and floated down into the water she sighed with relief as she realised that this was going to be considerably easier than she had initially estimated there was a quiet crack and a large piece of the strut disappeared down into the waves just a moment longer she almost lost the knife as the strut split with the last push grabbing madly to retrieve it the effect was more sudden and obvious than shed expected though still attached by the rope the lack of any solid support had allowed the rudder a great deal more leeway than before with a crack it slipped sideways as far as the restraints would allow the whole ship lurched and banked with the new direction of control and asima was almost thrown from the ledge the starboard side of the ship rising alarmingly she heard shouts of alarm from above and knew she had only moments flinging caution to the wind she ran along the narrow ledge trusting the new raised angle would push her further aboard rather than tipping her over she reached the corner and flung herself around it grasping the rail for safety just as the heads of the sailors above appeared at the upper edge desperately trying to see what had happened to the rudder she grinned as she realised she had done it the ship would suffer badly in its manoeuvrability and would not be able to continue its journey across the open sea with the rudder floundering around by her estimate it would take some serious work with ropes and all the strength of four men to keep the course steady enough to get anywhere to repair it ghassan would have no choice but to make for the nearest port which according to the chart in her cabin lay some three miles along the islands coast from the eagle rock the rest should be easy once the wind of god was in dock she would have the easy task of slipping away into the small town it would be pelasian territory and there would be fishermen with sailing boats that could take her from island to island until she found herself on the mainland and away from ghassan and his principles passage would be easy to buy with the riches she carried as would the silence of anyone involved she would shortly return to pelasia to plan her rise to prominence and ghassan would have to head back to calphoris and be disciplined for his failure unfortunate for him but he must be used to failure by now and besides he shouldnt have got in her way she asimas smile fell as she reached the end of the narrow ledge and turned the corner back toward her cabin and came face to face with a burly sailor momentarily she considered knifing him and tipping him overboard but decided against it not only did he carry a heavy belaying pin that he may be able to hit her with first but also if she attacked him and failed she would compound her guilt in ghassans eyes whatever happened they would still have to put in at the island and she would find a way to leave nothing had changed in which the reunion is completed the young captain growled angrily and asima merely shrugged i could lie to you if it would make you feel any better ghassan perhaps i heard a dangerous crack from my cabin not wishing to disturb the poor hardworking crew i risked life and limb to make my way out to the source of the noise and try to help i barely made it back with my skin intact when the thing gave way just as i approached she smiled with the most unpleasant falseness she could muster right down to the curl of a sneer on her lip does that make you feel better captain ghassan stood and stared out of her cabin window the sun had been up for a little more than an hour now he had refused to order his men to carry out any work in the conditions last night what with the darkness slippery wood and the ship lurching every now and then as soon as dawn had crested the horizon though he had sent three men down to the rudder to completely remove the damaged hinge mechanism and tie the pole tightly in place the wind of god bobbed on the calm sea drifting as the current took it what did you hope to achieve asima shrugged again i have no wish to visit velutio and i believe the word youre looking for ghassan is sabotage youll have to put in at the nearest island and i will find a way to leave you whatever you do to contain me ghassan snarled at her you stupid woman you risked your life and ours because you are so damned spoiled that you will have your own way whatever the cost just how selfish have you become asima she allowed her sneer to remain while the smile fell from her face your words mean nothing to me ghassan because you mean nothing to me i have been mere steps away from becoming one of the most powerful queens the world has ever seen and i will have that again despite the interference of mindless soldiers ghassan laughed without a hint of humour well im afraid youve failed this time i have no intention of putting to port it will take the best part of a day for my chief carpenter and his men to work up a replacement and a matter of hours to fit it by this time tomorrow we will be on our way once more he turned and pointed angrily at her in the meantime you are restricted to your cabin it will be locked from the outside and your window will be barred even though i doubt you would fit through it the only contact you will have with the crew is when palas brings you your meals and youve never met a more straightlaced and unfriendly man than palas he will have none of your charm were it not for the fact that you are supposedly a noble guest and i am dutybound to look after you i would have you locked in one of the equipment rooms down below in the dark he smiled his least humorous smile and if there is the slightest hint of trouble from you for the rest of the voyage i will be seriously tempted to tip you over the side in chains and tell the commodore that you leapt to your death do i make myself clear asima flashed him a haughty and disobedient look just leave me your stench will settle in the cabin for days otherwise ghassan let his glare linger on her for some time and then strode from the room stopping at the door removing the key and placing it in the outside as he shut the door and locked it he addressed the junior officer in the corridor beyond the lady asima is refused permission to leave her room she will be brought three meals each day and once a day a boy will be sent in to replace her shitbucket clear the young man saluted with a nod and ghassan strode angrily off down the corridor and out into the light eying the inactivity on the deck with frustration he considered bellowing orders out to the lounging oarsmen to scrub decks or recoil ropes no use taking it out on them though they worked hard when needed and it was hardly their fault that his childhood friend had turned into a saboteur what hed really like to do was to cuff asima round the ear and try to knock some sense of decency into her he turned grumbling and climbed the steps to the command deck half a dozen carpenters were at work near the rear rail putting together a replacement mechanism for the rudder hed known it was on its way out but it should have lasted the journey and velutio had some of the most famous docks and shipwrights in the world he would have easily replaced it within an hour at the capital now his men worked tirelessly to form a new one from bare chunks of wood with their saws chisels and planes but he knew his men and was quietly confident that the new item would be finished and in position before the end of the day let alone tomorrow calamon the first officer nodded at him from the other side of the deck captain ghassan strode over to join his second calamon was young for the position much like his captain but had previously served with distinction and had done an excellent job in the last few weeks on board the tall olivecomplexioned man was a native of germalla to the north and spoke with an accent that still occasionally caught ghassan out and needed repeats calamon the two men stood looking down into the calm water as shoals of fish came close enough to investigate the giant thing that had invaded their habitat the first officer appeared to be a quiet man possibly a result of the slight language difficulties but he tended to keep himself away from the crew often standing alone at the rail you have questioned the princess captain ghassan snorted if thats what you wish to call her she can call herself princess concubine queen or goddess if she wants what she is is a spoiled brat and possibly the most dangerous thing weve ever had on board calamons face dipped into a frown i thought when she came aboard that you were friends sir the captain shook his head we were when we were children in mdahz the two of us and my brother but while i chose an honourable path and am making a life and serving a greater good she appears to have spent the last two decades serving only herself and growing to resent everything else when i was a boy i was always fascinated by tales of the pelasian satraps and their armies with elephants and armoured cavalry and their perfumed palaces and so on he sighed but i see now that pelasia whatever it is truly like has ruined asima turned her into a spiteful witch with a laugh he gestured out to the northwest i can only pity the poor bastards in velutio that are going to get saddled with her for the next few decades shes been on board for just over a day and shes already ruined my ship calamon smiled hardly ruined captain think how much worse her sabotage could have been if she knew the first thing about ships i suppose once more the two men fell silent staring out at the sea did you lock her in ghassan turned to regard his first officer had to why very unpleasant with no fresh air sir trapped in a room with a slop bucket its not as though she could do much during the day with the crew up and about sir ghassan shook his head at the very least she could make another run for it i really wouldnt put it past her to jump overboard in her underwear and swim for the nearest island calamon opened his mouth to reply with a sly smile but was interrupted with a call from aloft and his words went unsaid sail ho the two senior officers snapped their heads back and peered up through the rigging the boy at the top of the main sail was gesturing desperately out to the east past where the workmen dealt with the damaged rudder and off beyond the stern ghassan and calamon ran across the deck to the rear rail hurdling the carpenters who sat cross legged working feverishly shading their eyes and squinting into the low morning sun they could just make out the shape of the ship ploughing toward them on a direct course tell me there are other naval vessels out this far calamon the first officer shook his head id seriously doubt it sir too close to pelasian waters for anyone unless theyre making for velutio like us and thats coming from the wrong direction for a pelasian ghassan grimaced besides i think the sail shapes wrong as they watched ghassan started in horror to see a sudden flare as a mass of burning material arced up from the other ship and shot toward them across the waves the orangeygreen flare joining the bright glare of the sun for a moment before it crashed down with a splash into the water several hundred yards from the hull how the hell did it get that close without the lookout seeing it earlier captain ghassan grumbled its facing this way and coming out of the sun were lucky he noticed it that soon whoever that is they knew we were here and they planned it carefully and theyre testing the range with their artillery so they have no intention of treating this as a light engagement theyre out for blood calamon nodded pirates permission to stand the crew and the artillery to and get us moving as best we can were barely manoeuvrable calamon better barely moving than a stationary target sir if we sit here and wait theyll find the range and burn us to cinders ghassan grumbled the man was right they had to at least try and manoeuvre their way into a better position alright turn us into them use the oars as rudders like they used to do in the old days once were on course give me ramming speed calamon blinked are we not going to try and outrun them captain wed not succeed calamon but at least if we close the gap we make it harder for them to bombard us and itll come down to a matter of marine versus cutthroat if were really lucky theyll turn as we get close and well manage to ram them i doubt theyll be that stupid but its possible the wind of god has got a bit of a reputation after all the first officer nodded saluted and ran off to shout orders around the deck the oarsmen woken rudely from their rest ran to their seats and began very professionally to ship their oars the engineers clambered into the artillery tower and started to arm turn and crank their grisly weapons marines poured from the doorway below deck and formed up in the centre under their commanders gaze settling their armour into place and readying their weapons oars to the water ghassan bellowed get us moving bank to starboard with the steering oars and bring us about ghassan took a deep breath as if he didnt have enough to deal with now it was pirates too he stared up to the lookout aloft can you get any detail not sure sir but i think its the empress ghassan rolled his eyes and slammed his fist on the rail of course it was the bloody empress what else could go wrong with this voyage that at least explained how theyd managed to get into such a position samir must have found out they were taking on asima at mdahz and shadowed them until they were in the middle of the open sea he slapped his forehead in amazement asima must be working with him shed effectively crippled the ship just in time for him to bear down on them with his artillery firing as he came there was an old superstition that having a woman on board was unlucky certainly this one was in which captains clash samir frowned at the man in the bow staring out into the blue and youre sure its her sure as shit sir the captain of the dark empress shook his head in puzzlement then what the hell are they doing ghassans a good sailor and has uncanny sight he must have seen us by now so why are they just wallowing like that the lookout shook his head cant see anything wrong with her maybe they havent seen us yet well i wouldnt want to be accused of being all sneaky mister col samir grinned lets wake em up turning away from the bow he rushed across to the central artillery castle and pointed at the fire thrower how close can you get to the enemy with that thing without actually hitting her the artillery man shrugged if we wait a few minutes i can part their hair with it captain well singe it anyway samir shook his head i want to give him enough warning to face us properly fire a few ranging shots as we close the burly engineer frowned what for sir surely the less prepared they are the better not in this case every chance ghassans had to take me on hes hit us by surprise and tried to trap us he likes to think hes better than us because hes working for the government but were going to extend him courtesies he wouldnt to us but why because samir grinned when i steal his cargo and sink his ship i want him to know he had every chance and we were simply better the artillerist shrugged its your ship captain turning away he issued the commands to his men and the fire thrower was loaded and aimed quickly and efficiently while they worked samir strode back to the bow how the hell could ghassan not see them alright the empress had the sun at her back but ghassan was better than this so there must be something else going on briefly samir wondered if his brother had laid some sort of elaborate trap but there was nowhere close enough to hide another vessel the archipelago was just too far away shading his eyes he peered at the naval ship drawing ever closer in minutes they would be on her and she just sat there like a dead fish floating on the surface do you think he was interrupted by a wave of the hand from the lookout who pointed urgently focusing on the enemy ship he saw signs of urgent activity the deck burst into life and as he watched three banks of oars slid out of the sides of the hull and dropped into the water in perfect time ah hes seen us now we can get this fight underway the yards raced by as the empress closed on her prey as they bounced from crest to crest at tremendous speed samir smiled and watched the cumbersome ship begin to turn shes coming for us now for a moment i thought they might run but ghassan wants me he blinked as he watched the motion before him theyre using the oars to steer the rudder must be broken thats why they were just sitting there he turned to the lookout how mean are you feeling col the young man grinned im always feeling mean as a sack of rats captain you know that his captain returned the grin and called over his shoulder to the artillerist baeso hes coming at us head on if youre as good as you reckon give me a shot along their port side with the heaviest load youve got at the rear for preference the man nodded without question and making a few quick mental calculations adjusted the range and angle of the weapon ready when you are sir by all means mr baeso do some damage the shot was even for baesos high standards expertly aimed and launched samir watched with no small amount of pride as the largest sack of boulders available in the turret was cast up and over the water with a massive thump and a roar as with all such shots the bag was designed to hold the ammunition together for only so long by the time the sack had covered half the distance to the oncoming ship it had split and the four heavy boulders were now streaking independently toward the wind of god the first boulder hit the rail at the edge of the main deck close to the bow sending shards of shattered timber and lethal footlong splinters scything along the deck at waist height and causing a number of horrifying casualties the second rock disappeared into the sea off the port side with a fountain of roaring foam the other two boulders however ran true the first hit the top bank of oars midway along the ship snapping and cracking the wooden shafts and bouncing along the horizontal line of poles smashing and shattering until it disappeared with a splash the last shot arced over beyond the other three and came down with a crash through the steering oars smashing them to pieces desperate commands were being shouted over on the other ship and the hull lurched and veered violently to port presenting a board target to the empress this is too easy col turning he gestured with familiar signals to the artillerist who nodded and with the help of his men loaded another huge sack onto the catapult while another crewman lit the next mass on the fire thrower without bothering to watch them samir signalled with his arm for them to fire when ready there was a straining noise and then a heavy thump as samir watched another expertlyaimed shot sent the bag flying in a high arc much higher than the last at its apex the sack split open and a cluster of iron weights sharp shards of metal and glass and rods with pointed ends showered the naval vessel tearing through the sails splitting ropes destroying the rigging and effectively crippling the enemys ability to make sail simultaneously the fire thrower launched the ball of flaming material directly at the centre of the enemy ship as samir watched the flaming mass bear down on its target he realised with a start that ghassans men had also launched their artillery not prepared yet for fire they had relied on the catapult and the bolt thrower while crewmen presumably fetched the fire ammunition from secure storage a two foot long iron bolt shot past samir as he blinked in surprise went straight through the chest of the junior officer behind him and continued on along the deck with such force that it decapitated another man and impaled a third lodging itself in his chest and pinning him to the wooden housing at the rear it had been a lucky shot the catapult attack was less so unable to get a clear aim with their listing and bucking vessel the bag of boulders flew past high above the deck one of the boulders clipped the main mast while another ripped a section of rigging to shreds but the damage was minimal pulling himself upright once more in the wake of the assault samir noted with satisfaction that the central artillery tower of the naval ship was wreathed in a fire that was beginning to spread up the ropes heave to bellowed samir and the crew began working like fury to arrest the ships forward momentum he nodded they had to slow now or they would ram the enemy ghassans ship was done for now and samir had no intention of allowing the empress to go down with her he winced as he realised what was about to happen and put up his hands to guard himself just in case as he took a deep breath the combustible shot that had been brought from storage to the naval ships artillery section succumbed to the heat of the flames dancing around it an explosion burst up like a sickly yellow mushroom at the centre of the enemy ship shards of wood flew in every direction and the billowing flames rushed up the edge of the sails as they caught there was no hope now for ghassans ship most of his marines had been close to the explosion at the centre of the main deck samir would estimate their numbers at perhaps thirty on a standard vessel a dozen at most made it to the rail trailing flames and black roiling smoke as they dived over the edge and into the blessed water samir sighed he hadnt quite meant for that much damage they would have perhaps five minutes before the vessel sank certainly not enough time to loot the thing not that ghassan would be likely to have much worth taking as he stood his gaze danced nervously around the enemy deck among the flames and the chaos trying to spot ghassan though hed not really intended to cause so much death and injury there was one man on that ship that he particularly did not want to see flaming and sizzling as he tried to reach the safety of the water the empress slowed as she neared the blazing ship and finally came to a halt perhaps thirty yards from the wallowing mess samir sagged and though he kept his countenance carefully hidden from his own men a smile of relief crossed his face as he spotted ghassan stride straightbacked and formal from the cabin doorway what he wasnt prepared for was the fact that his brother was dragging another person by the arm a woman no less samir frowned what in the seven faces of harish was a woman doing on board a navy ship he turned col get two of the lifeboats lowered have the men be armed and ready and get their survivors aboard as fast as you can col gave him a look of mixed pride and disapproval and then turned and ran off to pass on his captains orders some of the men would not look kindly on having taken down the most famous ship in the calphorian navy only to rescue its crew and for no prize there may be comeback for it later but samir was prepared part of the empress reputation relied on the code of conduct with which they dealt with their prey besides having removed their most relentless hunter from the game should be prize enough samir waved an arm and noticed ghassan turn at the gesture and drag the woman along the deck until they were at the rail only thirty yards away ghassan get your lifeboats down ill give you two of ours as well your crew can come aboard for now and they wont be harmed so long as they surrender their weapons for a long moment his brother glared at him in silence across the lapping gulf the roar of flaming sails creating a deafening background samir the pirate captain frowned as the woman in ghassans grip called his name who could he almost fell over as he realised asima samir save me ghassans taking me away samir blinked and shook his head get aboard a lifeboat the pair of you and fast youve only got minutes indeed as he watched the listing ship was already tipping further as water poured into the oar ports he bit his lip and watched in silence as ghassan bellowed the order to abandon ship and the remaining crew ran to the boats many of them taking a shortcut and diving into the water from the higher side of the dangerouslyleaning vessel samir watched with amazement and confusion as his two closest childhood friends pushed their boat out away from the sinking ship and some of their companions began to row toward the empress this was going to be interesting in which meetings and partings take place samir shook his head as he sat back in the chair in his private room on board the empress outside he could hear the survivors of the naval vessel being disarmed stripped of valuables and put under guard some of the men would be tempted to take out their frustrations on the men of the imperial military certainly most of the captains in lassos would have simply left the men to drown or even stripped them of anything worthwhile and then tipped them overboard samir however was well aware of the role that reputation played in survival as a pirate the name of the dark empress and her captain were spoken with irritation and anger among the military but with the record of mercy and honour they maintained many of the ordinary folk felt a measure of approval for samir he had heard his name spoken with reverence in the back streets of calphoris better to be loved by half the population than hated by them all ghassan i have no intention of killing your men they will be set adrift in lifeboats with ample room for them all and enough rations to see them all through until they can make landfall near eagle rock whatever you think of me you know i am not a monster the taller brother his wet curly locks plastered to his forehead and a look of angry misery on his features stayed silent his gaze moving occasionally between his two childhood friends and gracing them will equal distain and disapproval ghassan they will be fine you on the other hand will not you intend to do away with me then he almost spat out the words and glared at his smaller brother samir had to laugh at the ridiculous words dont be an idiot ghassan in fact im going to help you if you go back to calphoris with the rest youll be at best left ashore to rot in the barracks thanks to the loss of your ship its far more likely in fact that youll be disciplined and drummed out of the forces pensionless to go starve on the streets thats where we came from ghassan you dont want to go back there he thought for a moment and then frowned there is even the possibility that they will try you for your failure and deem you disposable ghassan grumbled but said nothing samir sighed we could use you ghassan youre a born sailor like me youd no small reputation yourself til today come with us and avoid any unpleasantness at calphoris the elder brother opened his mouth to speak his face bleak but asima interrupted launching herself from the chair and slapping the flat of her hand on samirs desk crumpling a chart dont you dare take him on samir this worthless husk that was your brother is a rigid golem following the rules of his foreign superiors without a thought for any of us he doesnt deserve your mercy asima samir seemed genuinely taken aback what are you talking about this pig was taking me against my will as a gift for some perverse nobleman in the capital i was to be nothing more than a whore to some fat prince in velutio i begged him to turn round to set me free ghassan was staring at her as though hed never seen her before he opened his mouth and made a croaking sound samir matched his expression as he boggled at asima all i want she went on angrily is to go home and this creature wont let me some superior in the military decided id make a nice gift for a friend and ghassan is hardly going to save a girl he once loved if it means disobeying the order of some fat general half the world away she fell silent and turned to look at ghassan with her face now hidden from samir she graced ghassan with a wicked and humourless smile before allowing her indignant masque to fall across her face once more and turning back to the smaller brother ghassan stared in horror as samirs expression hardened i still extend my offer ghassan you are my brother and regardless of anything either of us has done blood holds true ghassan blinked you dont believe her samir shrugged you are the most dutybound man ive ever met and you were on direct course for velutio with asima on board please do not try to deny anything ghassan i would hate to have to listen to you embarrass yourself but shes lying samir its all she does shes not a whore shes a witch asima reeled in shock fake shock ghassan was sure but samir seemed to be drinking it all in you asima spat glaring at ghassan are going to get in the little boats with your crew and drift out into the sea i would not wish harm on you for the sake of our old friendship but i have no wish to see you ever again she turned to samir if he stays on board with you then i will go adrift in the boats ghassan growled you stay here with my precious brother the pair of you deserve each other and i have no wish to stay on board with either of you i would rather take my chances with the review board in calphoris than share a single meal with you standing he straightened cast one unpleasant look at each of them and turning opened the door and left the room there was an uncomfortable silence after the latch clicked shut asima turned her face to samir slowly allowing him the full effect as tears welled up in her eyes and she began to shake samir frowned deep in thought dry your eyes asima i will not send you to velutio noting with interest a small flicker in her eyes the young pirate captain stood and reaching out squeezed her shoulder supportively wait here pour yourself a glass of wine ill get the prisoners underway and then be back without further pause samir strode to the door opened it and left the room closing it behind him asima took a deep breath ghassan was supposed to be the more easilymalleable one she poured herself a glass of wine and listened to all the orders being shouted to the prisoners out on deck her next move would have to be a good one but she was sure she could manage it samir would take her back outside the captain blinked in the bright light and spotted ghassan leaning over the rail staring down into the waves and waiting for the pirates to finish searching his men and be ready for him samir strode over and leaned on the rail next to him i am truly sorry that its all come to this ghassan the taller brother grunted in reply it was inevitable that one day we would meet and only one would leave you must have known that and you also knew that it was always going to be me but thats a good thing if youd won youd be obliged to send us all to calphoris to be hanged i on the other hand am in a position to be magnanimous i have no wish to harm your men apart from the two dozen you burned and crushed in the attack ghassan dont be childish thats regrettable but unfortunately inevitable in war and its a war weve been in dont pretend youd have done anything different the soldier grunted another answer it doesnt have to end like this ghassan you can still come with us i have thrown open an invitation to your men and im told that a few have accepted life at lassos is good brother better than a dishonourable dismissal from service and starving in a backstreet for sure besides i have an idea and it involves you ghassan turned to samir and the smaller brother was surprised to see that the look of indignation and anger had been replaced by one of gentle sadness i cant samir you have to understand i may not always agree with what im to do but i took an oath when i joined up the only way i can leave the service is honourably and im bound to go back and report whatever they do to me a part of me would like nothing more than to say screw it all and abandon myself to life as a free man he sighed but that wouldnt be me thats you samir in a way i envy you your freedom even if it is a freedom from conscience but thats not my way you understand samir furrowed his brows for a moment i wish there was a way i could persuade you perhaps some day ghassan replied sadly but not today today i have to complete my duty and take my men home samir nodded his understanding my offer will remain open should you ever wish to find me he noted the pirates edging closer waiting respectfully to take ghassan to his men with a sigh he turned away but as he did ghassan grasped his arm dont take your eye off asima brother do not believe a word that falls from her mouth she is not the girl we loved she has changed immeasurably and i think would sell both you and i for animal food if it got her something she wanted she came damn close to destroying my ship before you even turned up shell play you and do the same to the empress unless you keep her confined samir stopped and shook his head gently i wont lock her up ghassan not yet shes not done anything to me yet but i can see something in her that i dont like would you care to tell me the truth about what happened ghassan shrugged it makes no difference just dont trust her get rid of her as soon as you can for the sake of yourself your ship and your men samir watched sadly as his tall proud brother turned and offered his hands open and palms up to the pirate captors shaking his head samir turned and reentered his cabin closing the door on his brother the crew of the wind of god and any hope for now of reconciliation asima was huddled in her damp clothes by the table on a low bench a goblet of strong wine clutched tightly in her hands samir nodded to himself and walked past her to retake his seat is there anything you would like to tell me asima she blinked caught by surprise and samir was satisfied to notice her guard fall for just a fraction of a second asima may be good enough to hoodwink the straightlaced ghassan for a time but samir could see how her facade was built and how to cause it to crack so that he could see past it to the real woman beneath he was genuinely saddened to see what had become of his erstwhile friend oh it was horrible samir she sobbed i was a captive in pelasia where the prince hated me i think it must have been him when he became king that persuaded the governor and the military to send me to exile with some unknown master samirs expression remained straight and unreadable hmm well rest assured that i have no intention of taking this ship anywhere near velutio or even calphoris asima gave a little sniffle and threw him a weak mousey smile thank you dear samir will you leave me in mdahz alone or will you come back with me the captain of the empress gave a light laugh mdahz he stood a smile plastered across his face im not taking you to mdahz asima the next few weeks are going to be a little hot for us around the coast as soon as the crew of the wind of god reach any town youd be amazed at the speed the news of our victory will spread every naval ship afloat imperial or pelasian along with half of the mercenary warships out there will all be looking for me he laughed i just sank a legend asima there will be nowhere safe for me for weeks the woman by the table frowned then what do you intend well i shall have to take you back to lassos and show you the delights of the pirate island wont i asima she stared at him and he was heartened to see anger and astonishment battling for control of her expression you what she screeched yes i thought that might bring about an interesting reaction asima glared at him i have no more intention of spending my life wallowing in the septic pit of a pirate hole than i do of accepting exile in velutio you save me from one hell only to deliver me somewhere worse samirs smile was irritating her more than she could bear just drop me on an island somewhere with fishermen and i shall make my own way back then hardly asima you are coming with me you may be able to play ghassan with your little games but i am a match for you asima and you know it accept the situation and make the best of it i have my plans do not worry asima fell silent her glower almost burning into him samir laughed out loud now are you going to be good or shall i take ghassans advice and have you manacled to the hull now and save a lot of time slowly quietly asimas breathing slowed and the fire in her eyes receded lassos then for now but be sure samir that i am your passenger and not your prisoner the captain nodded we shall see asima we shall see in which asimas beliefs are shaken asima still glowering after days on board had settled into her solitary life keeping herself away from the sweaty coarse crew and equally from samir who seemed to have the uncanny ability to look straight into her mind she had experimented on the first day after ghassan and his crew had been set adrift with minor issues of rebellion and inconvenience the crew had seemed to be aware of her location and her activity at all times and the knife she had secreted in the dining hall had seen her escorted to samirs cabin where he had firmly but gently removed it from her and confiscated it sailors had stepped up to block her passage to parts of the ship they thought she had no business in she had tried tantrums tears and even seduction all to no avail in the end she had resigned herself to making do with her situation until her range of options expanded and now days later she had at least managed to drum up enough interest in this legendary island to sit in the bow and watch as the landmass approached lassos made the mind reel used to the mainland shores with their brown dust heat haze and low rocks the pirate island seemed alien and strange to asima at first sight it had seemed as though a cloud had settled on the water wearing a dark shiny skullcap closer to the island was only two miles across at most and consisted almost entirely of precipitous mountain in green and grey the whole place was enveloped in a thick fog that settled on the water and rose to cover the lower half of the island asima could quite understand that on a day with fog any heavier than this the entire island could well become invisible and that settled a nagging worry in asima her life had taught her many things but one of the foremost tenets around which she now lived was a total denial of gods magic fate and anything she could not see touch or manipulate even the idea that something was beyond her control unnerved her let alone something beyond her understanding yes obviously the legends of this mysterious hidden and vanishing island had been borne from the thick enveloping fog that obscured the land unless one was actively seeking it and yet something about the fog still unnerved her the ship slowed considerably as they neared the edge of the white blanket that shrouded their destination in damp silence and asima saw the rocks for the first time rising like jagged and broken fangs from the mist the glistening black rocks took on a wicked almost supernatural aspect the first glimpse was impressive but a truly breathtaking effect was afforded as the ship first entered the enveloping white the cloying silence fell over the vessel muting everything bar the occasional creak and groan of the ship and its rigging even the crew worked silently as the prow pushed into the eerie nothingness it became evident that the reefs that surrounded lassos were more than the occasional jagged spike they thickened rapidly creating a carpet of teeth rising from the dark water in an almost impassable pattern asima drew a sharp breath shed had virtually no experience of sailing despite having spent her entire life by the sea in one place or another but a single glance at those reefs revealed no safe route between the shards there was quite simply no hope of passing them surely she turned to examine the faces of the men on board each expression was one of intense concentration she noted with fascination that few of the crew looked out at the rocks keeping their attention locked on their work aboard why would asima blinked and touched her arm in disbelief surely this must be some kind of dream the closest rock standing proud of the water was now home to a figure in wet grey ragged robes as she watched stunned and vaguely frightened the sleeves of the robe fell back and two thin rubbery grey arms reached out imploringly toward the ship the head rose slightly and two glistening eyes reminding her of pools of water in the dark of the night peered out from beneath the dripping hem without intending to asima had taken two paces back away from the railing other figures swam into focus as she watched one moment they werent there and the rocks were bare the next ragged wet grey figures pleaded with her to do something about their horrifying condition her initial shock quickly faded however others with deeply superstitious minds may be paralysed with fright but asima was made of sterner stuff putting aside the natural fear of the unknown she concentrated on the important things it was curious she never saw a figure appear if she looked at a rock and then looked away and back there would be a figure on it but if she concentrated on a rock nothing happened while she watched they could of course be some sort of illusion but that would have to be something that affected everyone given the reactions of the other sailors and such a thing was unheard of the ship creaked on slowly and as she watched asima realised that there was a channel through the rocks hidden complex and almost too narrow to possibly fit a ship through the rocks with their eerie occupants came closer and ever closer no not an illusion it couldnt be in her mind since it was in everyone elses also given the fact that the figures cast shadows on the rocks and the lapping waves plastered their robes to their ankles they were solid they were real the reefs of the dead shed heard them called but the dead didnt stand up or plead the dead were lifeless husks returning slowly to the earth so these were clearly something different that had never been encountered anywhere else and could not yet be adequately explained satisfied with her more rational explanation and with several minutes to go before the island would be in sight she turned her attention to the ship itself the sailors were busy about their tasks bathed in the eerie silence the officers interestingly it appeared that the crew had abandoned the raised command deck to the rear leaving samir alone with his first officer asima smiled to herself samir would be too busy with these rocks to spare time to drive her away taking a deep breath she strode along the deck paying no heed to the desperate grey figures reaching out to her as they passed a couple of the men glanced at her in mild surprise as she passed though none made a move to stop her until she reached the ladder she placed her foot on the first rung and a shadow fell across her looking up she saw the shaved and tattooed head of the first officer as he leaned over the ladder from the upper deck top decks off limits ta passengers miss asima smiled coldly unless you intend to physically assault me step out of the way you painted donkey the man blinked clearly taken aback and asima continued to climb from somewhere above she heard samirs voice let her up ursa shes a special case the huge pirate clearly irritated at this infraction of the rules stepped aside and glared at her as she reached the top and stepped out on to the command deck its alright ursa ill be fine go deal with the men again the second in command grumbled in disapproval and threw an unpleasant look at her before taking the ladder down to the main deck come asima im sure youll be fascinated frowning she approached the rear samir was directing the ship with infinitesimally small nudges of the huge rudder and yet his eyes were affixed on the object in his hands paying no attention to the ship or its surroundings at all what is that she asked pointing at the object he held he smiled and as she approached angled it slightly so that she could see clearly this is one of the biggest secrets in the world asima in his hands rested a bronze disk around eight inches across a flattened container with delicate and smooth glass on the upper surface inside on a central pin free to spin this way and that was a human finger dead and grey but perfectly preserved within the case asima blinked a finger your big secret is a finger for this you keep your crew off the command deck samir shrugged its part of the rules laid down by the council of twelve only the captain and his first officer are supposed to know about the dead mans compass i trust my crew implicitly but rules are rules on some level ghassan was right without any rules there would be complete chaos even pirates need laws asima and this rotting digit helps you sail samir grinned this is an almost unique thing dont ask me how it works though ive asked the cleverest people and studied it for a long time and theres no reason i can see for it to work but it does work the dead mans compass shows me the route i just align the rudder with this fellows finger and off we go ive never seen it fail drivel samir laughed somehow i thought you might see it like that but there are unexplainable things asima have you given up trying to memorize the route through the rocks now then i presume that was your reason for sitting in the prow i did that the first few times asima glared at him the path is fairly clear if narrow lets face it samir as long as i note where the entrance to the passage is id be able to navigate my way out she eyed him slyly should i wish to leave of course that is but then youll be taking me home soon when the sea is safe so i have no reason to leave at the moment nice to know that i can though gives me a certain sense of security samir laughed is that right the woman beside him frowned youll not break your word and keep me captive again the captain laughed thats not what i mean asima i mean are you so convinced of your ability to navigate the reefs without the compass asima shrugged hardly troublesome particularly with a smaller vessel grinning like a naughty schoolboy samir pointed out over the rear rail past the stern asima raised her eyes and followed his gesture behind the vessel a jagged carpet of impassable rocks jutted from the waves in every direction pleading grey figures occupied many of them calling out silently to her asima frowned how is that possible its not again samir laughed lightly not everything has an explanation asima and since there are only two of these compasses in existence shared by the pirate captains of lassos the island remains about as safe as its possible for a haven to be we could be found but never captured you see and dont bother trying to track one of the rocks from the front of the ship to the back as we travel either ive tried and failed many times if you follow along the rail and try it gives you an intense headache his passengers frown deepened as she looked back and forth between the rocks behind and the compass in his hand and now you must keep me prisoner on lassos or kill me i hardly think so asima but you have told me and showed me your great secret you have broken your own law even if you feel like flaunting the rules i doubt your peers on the island will see things the same way samir shrugged nonchalantly only a few of us know that you know frankly taking you to lassos at all is going to cause havoc with the council but they need a little shake up every now and then you would be best to keep your mouth shut while on the island i will not kill you but many would just for knowing some of the things you do so be careful with your mouth as for when we leave here well lets say that im not telling you all of this on a whim i have my reasons asima pursed her lips as she took this in very well captain samir what do we do now he smiled were almost through the rocks then we dock in lassos i will have to report to the council and present you then i and my crew go about our business you on the other hand will stay on board the ship until i say otherwise if you do go ashore you will wait for me or ursa and go with us asima frowned explain there are a number of very unfriendly individuals on lassos most of my peers are not the gentlemen that i am for your own safety i would advise extreme caution but equally you are my passenger not my prisoner you are free to explore the island in the brief time we will have there but i recommend against it he cleared his throat lassos can be a very dangerous place ahead the fog parted as the vessel reached the inner edge of the reefs lassos rose like the crown of a stone giants head cresting the water clouds clinging to the higher rocks and birds of prey circling very dangerous in which we are introduced to lassos the dark empress bumped against the jetty for the final time as it came to a stop sailors throwing lines and tying them off samir strode across to the rail and turned gesturing at asima first things first i need to present you to the council asima frowned and shrugging followed the captain waited for the plank to be run out to the dock and then trotted lightly down it his companion eyed it suspiciously and took a tentative step the plank bowed alarmingly under her weight a fact which irritated her immeasurably gritting her teeth she hurried as fast as she dared down the board and onto the relative stability of the wet slippery jetty samir grinned i feel it is important that i explain a few things about lassos to you im sure my reasons will become apparent in time its just as shame that ghassan isnt here too but that cant be helped for now asima frowned you have become cryptic in your old age samir he laughed in my position i am bound to keep some secrets and merely sensible to keep others she grumbled as she carefully picked her way along the drier patches of the wooden jetty until they reached the end and entered the town for want of a better word the whole community nestled in on the low slope from the port to the point where the hill became more mountainous and rocky and even then other buildings clung to the edge of cliff like the eyries of eagles with tortuous paths leading to their doors there were perhaps a hundred buildings in all of many different styles most of the structures of the port area and the lower town were reminiscent of the architecture asima was used to from mdahz and the borderlands of the desert as the settlement ambled up the slope however the style changed notably the buildings became larger and grander and probably older these would be the earliest remnants of permanent settlement on lassos the higher buildings were reminiscent of the architecture she had seen in books on the empire and its great cities all bricks and marble and columns and carvings others higher still hanging over precipices and looking out over the lower town were similar but grander with more marble and less brick eastern she had a feeling like germalla and its surroundings there is nobody in lassos who is not a pirate samir said as he led her between various stacks of crates and equipment near the dock and toward what he probably considered a street asima had grown to adulthood in akkad with its clean boulevards this looked more like the sewers that ran beneath that city but open to the air then who lives in these buildings samir shrugged the council of twelve are permanent residents also there are only ever two or three ships out at sea at any time one of the compasses goes out with them to guide them out and home while the other stays on lassos in case of any trouble years ago there were three compasses but one went down with a ship in an imperial naval assault i suspect that there were once ten one for each finger of whoever donated his hands asima nodded so the crews of most of the ships live a relatively normal life here and occasionally the population changes when ships come and go how many ships are there altogether samir gave her a sidelong glance you sound suspiciously as though youre probing me for information asima not at all you suggested this not me very well samir agreed there are actually only a dozen ships at the moment the number goes up and down but rarely new ships and crews have to earn a great deal of respect and trust before they can get close to lassos and most of the captains settled here are good enough that the chances of them being caught by the authorities are minimal so yes the town is occupied and run by sailors during their shore time asima frowned then there are no women here i am going to be rather conspicuous she was too asima was becoming aware of the stares she was getting from people as they passed some suspicious others lusty samir grinned oh there are women but they all serve on the one ship most captains are very superstitious and dont like a woman on board captain rianna is different being a woman herself asima nodded in approval it was a disgusting life of depravity and danger living in squalor and filth but it was good on some level to know that such awfulness was not purely the province of men and you say these pirates are not reasonable like yourself samir laughed i wouldnt announce that too loudly some may take offense there are two captains in lassos that walk the path of mercy and reason younger captains too and friends i live in hope that one day the truly wicked men here will pass away and a new breed of pirate will be able to take control khmun who was my captain was the first of his peers to consider allowing an enemy crew to leave with their lives intact but the idea is beginning to take root yes two friends to whom i shall introduce you presently the rest you would do well to stay away from some of them may even consider rape and murder in public with a face and body like yours asima shrugged she had survived in places much more subtle and dangerous than this i have no intention of letting myself reach that position yet i would be grateful if you would allow me to carry a knife i had one for protection but ghassan took it from me samir nodded when we return to the ship in a few hours i will find you a knife but be careful what you do with it the murder of anyone on lassos brings about the death penalty and even a nonfatal attack will likely see you chained at the bottom of the harbour his companion nodded and fell silent taking in her surroundings as they climbed the street ever higher past bristly sweating men performing menial tasks who stopped and watched as they passed as she walked with samir reeling off names and facts her mind wandered shed learned what she needed from him for now and had to think quietly the problem was that she was at samirs mercy and that rankled but she couldnt let it become an issue her plans had been shattered repeatedly and pelasia was further away than ever but this was a temporary measure an alliance of convenience at least she was no longer bound for the north and samir would take her back to mdahz of that she was sure she had to bide her time in the interim stay low and cause no fuss and yet there was something about the way samir was acting and talking that made her pause he was up to something and he was far more subtle and inscrutable than his brother she would have laid ghassans mind open by now like the entrails of a sacrificial animal and be picking through his plans and motives not so with samir in time he would slip or she would pry the information from him she may have to sleep with him in time but it was a small price really for his help and her continued safety she turned to him and nodded focussing once more on his conversation and the captain of the sea witch took the last position on the council and became the twelfth permanent resident of the island he lives in that palatial place up there in the cliffs brooding isnt it it is she agreed nodding as though shed been listening to his drivel all the way up the slope to her surprise samir stopped they appeared to have arrived at their destination a large building in the classic imperial style with eight white marbles columns fronting a grand portico this must be the council that hed spoken of with no ceremony he strode across to the door and pushed it open stopping and gesturing for asima to join him she approached with a little trepidation and followed him through the open door conscientiously shutting it behind her she was currently at the mercy of these people and would do well to try and get on their good side the hall they entered was impressive but plain for some reason given the architectural style asima had expected something more grand and decorative the hall was constructed of white marble or at least she thought as she noted with some satisfaction a crumbled area of wall in one corner showing its core it was built of brick with a veneer of thin white marble to give a more noble impression there was no furniture or decoration in the hall barring a single small wooden chair and desk to one side and a rickety bench by the opposite wall she had little time to ponder on the strangely disparate nature of the building as samir continued on across the room gave a smart rap on the opposite door and opening it strode through leaving it agape behind him masters of lassos she heard him say as she hurried to catch up i return with good news and a request a cracked and ancient voice answered quickly your requests captain are always troublesome samir was nodding as asima reached the door and entered closing it quietly behind her there were three tables in a u shape here with twelve impressive highbacked chairs at them the floor space between the tables was occupied with a map of the sea of storms and its surrounding lands constructed painstakingly accurately from different coloured marble and stone strange markings had been made in places presumably noting the location of important vessels or the sites of some great event only three of the chairs were occupied the speaker a man of extremely advanced years was clearly a pelasian a fact that took her somewhat by surprise for some reason she had drawn a mental line that separated pelasians from these people the other two occupants were men in their late forties none of them looked remotely pleased to see samir or his companion this woman is an old acquaintance of mine and no friend of the imperial authorities who was being held captive by them and taken as a slave to the northern cities i intend to return her to her home in due course and beg leave of the council to allow her to stay on the island until then one of the younger leaders stood and slammed his hands on the table we do not bring outsiders here captain samir you know the rules you should have taken her elsewhere before returning now we should have to have her killed that was not possible im afraid master culin samir smiled she was being held captive on the wind of god and now that that vessel languishes on the sea bed it would be foolhardy of me to go to close to the mainland half the worlds navy will shortly be searching for me we cant afford to lose a certain item in my possession after all the three councillors fell silent and the speaker returned to his seat that is good news samir i wouldnt say good enough to offset endangering everyone by bringing her here but good news nonetheless the wind of god was beginning to cause great concern to the council do i then have permission to allow the lady asima to stay in lassos the councillors shared hidden looks and the elder rumbled for a moment before looking down his nose at them she may stay on board your ship until the full council meets tomorrow we will then decide her fate and consider yours you are foolhardy captain samir khmun paid the price for your adventures but rest assured that we will not fall in with your lunacy return to your ship and wait there until we send for you samir bowed and turning grasped asima by the arm guiding her from the room as the door shut behind them she regarded samir levelly not overfriendly i fear they will weigh down against me and you will pay the price for bringing me here we may both die tomorrow samir shrugged there are events set in motion asima of which you know nothing the council will almost certainly sentence you to death and exile me these things needed to be done now we must stop in and see a few friends before we return to the empress and i need you to be as charming as possibly and preferably drop a few hints that you are full of very useful information i am far from foolhardy there are reasons for everything i do asima narrowed her eyes she was sure of that oh yes in which the empress breaks out asima woke with a start she hadnt meant to fall asleep at all let alone as deep as that but the hours spent at captain faerus lodging had been warm and inviting and she had been encouraged to drink considerably more wine than was good for her it had taken every ounce of her selfcontrol to hold her tongue and keep her secrets while playing the part samir had asked of her the house had been prepared to celebrate the return of samir as soon as the empress had appeared at the dock faerus had begun to crack the barrels of drink and sent one of his men out to gather their compatriots together by the time samir had arrived with asima and a few chosen crewmates in tow the alcohol was already flowing and more than a dozen men were laughing and singing the reaction to her presence was curious with initial surprise giving way to suspicion then samir had explained who she was embellishing certain aspects of her history such as her repeated captivity and her dislike of imperial authorities in samirs words she appeared to be a troubled rebel repeatedly surviving the hardships brought down by one government or another asima was once again impressed at the subtle ways the young captains mind worked when she thought about it he had told no lies and left out few facts while bending the truth to appear as he needed it to the other occupants of the room she quickly became a figure of respect and would appear to have knowledge of the pelasian navy and access to people in higher positions in both there and the empire it had taken only moments for her to realise what he was doing in the morning the council would meet and asima would be condemned to a watery grave as a danger to the security of lassos samir may receive the same punishment or at the very least would be exiled from the island however by the time these decisions were announced those who were already sympathetic with samir and his politics would be aware that he had heroically removed the single greatest threat to the captains and their ships the wind of god he would be a hero to them which means the council would be condemning a hero to death moreover asima was now known to have helped take down the ship by crippling her rudder when combined with the impression that she was herself an outlaw with information that could be of great use to the folk of lassos the death sentence pronounced on her would likely create equal outrage samir had used her to turn some of them against their own leaders it was a masterly stroke along the lines of things asima had done herself the downside of course was that those who were outraged by all of this would still be vastly outnumbered by those who were loyal to the council and no great friend of samir he may have turned some pirates to his cause but not enough to prevent their death once the announcements were made and that was obviously why mister ursa the bald and tattooed first officer was gently shaking her awake now captain wants ya on the command deck miss asima blinked wearily this hardly seemed the same man who had glared and grumbled at her as they had first arrived yesterday afternoon but then ursa had been present last night had learned what the others had of her somewhat exaggerated past by the middle of the evening he had begun to smile when he looked at her and by the end hed been the worst of all culprits for forcefeeding her the strong wine she had tried to tell samir that all this alcohol was a bad idea but he had insisted that it would be abnormal and unseemly to reject faerus hospitality rubbing her bleary eyes and trying to ignore the insistent thumping in her skull asima stood and stretched with a grin ursa draped a blanket over her shoulders cold out there miss fogs in thick tonight with a nod asima grasped the blanket and pulling it tight around her exited the cabin and walked the short distance to the ladder that led to the command deck she frowned as she eyed the deck there was a more activity that she thought there should be at night the few visible crewmen moved silently in much the same way as they had through the rocks ropes were being coiled and crates lifted aboard the sight was made all the more eerie by the thickness of the fog that enveloped them all she could barely see the bow of the ship let alone the town the jetty marched away on legs of oak into the blanket of white turning she climbed the ladder samir sat on a low wooden bench near the rudder ah asima his voice was soft almost lost in the fog that settled creepily around the ship it would seem that the gods of weather are feeling kind she tried to keep the sneer from her face and was only partially successful you need fog samir smiled it wasnt a necessity but very useful nonetheless makes things considerably easier asima frowned turned and cast her eyes across the rail sure enough the jetty was slowly slipping away from them even in the moment she watched she saw the end jutting out welcomingly disappearing into the allconsuming white were underway i never heard a thing samir smiled just ten oars enough to get us moving but not enough to make a loud noise particularly in the fog with any luck well be almost out of the harbour before were noticed asima shook her head what are you doing samir the young captain smiled saving your neck among other things as i keep saying plans are in motion well ive now turned a corner and burned another bridge to mix my metaphors he noted the look of distrustful uncertainty on her face and his grin widened the few members of my crew of whom i have never been entirely sure are back in lassos hopefully still drunk and unaware the empress now has a totally loyal crew we will have a bounty placed on our head by the council as soon as they find out weve left particularly when they realise that ive had to take one of the two compasses with me but the leaders will lose a great deal of their support i have friends in lassos asima the time of the council of twelve is coming to an end soon there will be only one ruler of lassos asima nodded though he still had his secrets some of his motives and plans were beginning to unfold and she could easily put herself in his position samir was more like her than she had ever imagined just as she planned and aspired to become an empress in her own right samir had his sights set on total rule of lassos even now he was undermining the council and building a power base she smiled you may just be the absolute opposite of your brother samir for a moment she pulled back as something dark and dangerous passed across the young captains face i wouldnt say that asima ghassan may be a little more lawabiding and strict than i but we both have our ethics and codes of conduct i recognise that there is some small similarity in the way our minds work but i would advise against considering yourself my peer in any way you are useful and our paths currently coincide but make no mistake i trust you less than any occupant of lassos they may by murderers thieves and rapists but they make no attempt to hide what they are you can wrap yourself in as many layers of respectability as you wish but i know what you are he frowned and you apparently bring out the worst in me too i brought you up here for two reasons firstly you deserve to know whats happening in case we are caught and captured or sunk she nodded her own eyes now flashing darkly there was a tension on deck that could not be settled right now secondly he went on i am now down by almost two dozen crewmen i need lookouts take position over by the rear rail on the port side as we leave harbour any minute now well have to pass beneath the rocks and i need you to warn me if we get too close i can angle the bow correctly but the current here pulls ships into a drift and if youre not careful the stern is turned into the cliff asima continued to glare at samir through narrowed eyes for a moment longer and then turned and approached the rail taking up position and peering into the white the situation was as strange and unreal as any she could remember the blanket of fleecy fog was so thick she could hardly see the water below the rail unless she concentrated extremely hard the silence was oppressive with the only sound the occasional creak of timber or splash of oar and even that had to be listened for somewhere along the ship a sailor coughed as quietly as possible so quiet it should hardly be audible but in this strange otherworld it seemed deafening and then the rocks were lunging at her through the fog and asima had to summon all of her selfcontrol not to cry out a warning turning sharply she hissed through her teeth and pointed down toward the glistening black shard that marked the edge of the cliff and was drifting toward the hull at an alarming rate samirs head snapped toward her and reacted instinctively without seeing the rocks turning the rudder so that the empress changed course slightly but rapidly the rocks that had seemed so threatening a moment ago drifted past alongside the rear rail and asima heaved a deep but quiet sigh of relief the heavy silence was suddenly torn apart by the sound of a horn from astern asimas heart leapt into her throat oars samir bellowed removing any doubt in asimas mind as to what the blast meant the silence exploded into noisy activity as dozens more oars slid out of the hull and dipped into the water seeming momentarily disorganised until they managed to match the stroke asima stood rigid wondering whether to go below again when samir turned to her keep an eye on the rocks weve got to get closer closer asima said astonished it looked as though the oars would scrape the cliff any moment as they were we have to hug the cliffs turning to port until were out of sight so to speak of the port then we strike out for the reefs and we can get a few yards closer to them yet watch the oars and the cliff and when you see the spray from the oars touch the rocks were close enough asima blinked as samir yanked on the rudder and sent them banking left and back toward the cliff they had just rounded thats crazy samir shrugged thats the way it is any further out in the open water and wait for it as if on cue somewhere above them there was a dull thud followed by several more in sharp succession out to starboard away from the cliffs and hidden by the fog came the sound of a number of very heavy objects plunging into the deep water after the first couple of huge rocks hit asima found she was wincing with each splash somewhere at the top of that cliff must be a defensive artillery platform their view was totally obscured but given a wide enough spread of shot there was always the possibility of a lucky shot unless they stayed so close to the rock that the artillerists couldnt get a range she almost jumped as a flaming greenyyellow ball of flaming matter arced over the ship from high above and plunged into the water with a splash and a hiss suddenly asima realised that samir was watching her intently turning her eyes back to the cliff she realised that the water thrown up by the oars was already spraying across the slick black rock in a panic she turned and waved her arm in what she hoped was an appropriate gesture for a moment as the ship continued to near the cliff and she was sure the oars must strike home and snap she realised she was right now more nervous than at any point since those days of being young in mdahz and possibly more so than even then she was not by nature a nervous person and these days little frightened her but this was something different she was in an unfamiliar situation and with no power over events helpless and with no experience or knowledge of sailing she was completely at the mercy of others and nothing she could do would allow her to take control of the situation and samir was using her and seemed to hold her in as little regard as she truly held him blessed anger began to filter through her smothering the fear bringing control with it samir would suffer for putting her through this splash well once they were out away from the island and safe he would anyway tensely she watched as the cliffs slid slowly past now there were more horns from behind great activity in the harbour which likely meant other ships weighing anchor to chase them down the rocks of the reef would be moments away now and once they were in there she blinked as she realised that didnt exactly mean safety the captains in pursuit would have the other compass and could navigate the reefs too so it would come down to samirs ability as a captain in the end oh he would suffer but not yet she thought as she saw samir take out the disc and align the rudder with the disembodied finger within just let her get away from here first in which ghassan drifts the six boats bobbed along quietly there had been talking like this during those first few hours most of it then though had been violent threats against the captain and crew of the dark empress curses or oaths of vengeance others had been more consumed with the fear or drowning starving to death or even falling prey to the sharks that sometimes made their way toward the south coast and praying to whichever god they most favoured it had taken an hour of listening to the chatter before ghassan had snapped and barked at his crew to shut up do you have any idea what just happened he had bellowed at them the boats had fallen silent as the crew of the wind of god had turned as one to stare at their captain samir let you go all of you us let all of us go weve got boats enough food and water to last two days which we shouldnt need as were only a day from land none of us were harmed youve lost the ship and a few valuables but youre alive the message he was trying to put over began to filter through their anger and despair if we had caught them in the same state theyd be in chains below deck on their way to be tried and executed do you think they had to be merciful do you even think that many of them wanted to their captain saved your lives because despite anything else we can say about him he has mercy in his heart after that the conversation had become quieter and a little more thankful and positive but by the afternoon even the most vociferous of the crew had run out of things to say and a silence had settled over them their ship had drifted during the night and early morning and the action had taken place far enough from the archipelago that the islands were out of sight even the landmarks they all sought but they had not really moved far beyond them and the direction of land was clear enough to them all in the late afternoon they had spotted eagle rock and there had been a collective sigh of relief the current had begun to pull them toward the island and the crew had taken the opportunity to boat oars and let the sea do the work for them while the chatter resumed among the crew ghassan kept his peace and concentrated on the glinting water as it washed past the men would be fine when they finally got back to calphoris they would be shorebound for a while but would eventually be assigned to another vessel ghassan on the other hand would be disciplined very heavily for his actions in ordinary circumstances he would probably be retired from service there were after all extenuating circumstances the crew would be able to confirm that the ship had been sabotaged by asima prior to the dark empress arrival but that would not be enough now the imperial navy was new here it had been decades since the empire had had control over the ships of calphoris and now within a few weeks of the transfer of power ghassan had lost their most notable vessel more or less the flagship of the calphorian fleet moreover he had lost it to the very man he had been assigned to hunt down and remove and in the process he had lost a cargo that the lesser governor in mdahz had entrusted to him no things would not go well for ghassan he watched the low sandy coast of the island slide toward him pelasian territory this would be the first time in his life he had set foot on pelasian soil though he had brought destruction to their navy for many years how did the pelasians feel toward the imperial military now they had no reason to feel animosity but that hardly mattered they would have to argue persuade beg and possibly even barter transport on pelasian fishing boats to get to the mainland to attempt to row that far in the lifeboats was unthinkable madness failure would mean being trapped on an island in pelasia indefinitely at which point they might as well settle there and fish for a living for a moment the need to fulfil his duty wavered in the face of the attractive proposition of a quiet life of fishing on an island far from what he considered civilisation it had a lure he had to admit he took a deep breath even if they could make their way from settlement to settlement along the chain of islands they would arrive in pelasian territory and have to make their way along the coast back to imperial lands the journey would take weeks at best more likely months and of course it was entirely possible they would never make it back his mind latched on to mdahz for a moment every time he went to the town of his birth it was a disaster their youth had seen earthshaking events that had almost broken them all then after decades away he had returned with a naval commission only to take on a cargo that had ruined his career and almost cost him his life but now if he managed to get back to imperial territory he would have to stop there first to inform the local governor that asima had been taken by pirates even though the governor knew little of her and probably cared less the news would not likely be welcome sighing he turned to the sailors under his command alright men weve no ship and were refugees in foreign waters right now but remember that youre men of the imperial navy and the pelasians are now our allies when we land you will treat anyone you should meet with respect and we will maintain military order once we reach the shore beach the boats carry all the goods we have ashore and make an equipment store i want two foraging parties to search out fruit game and fresh water he straightened the familiar mode of speech of a captain in command returning to him everyone else needs to set up camp just back from the beach well need to gather wood and get a fire going and construct some sort of shelter we may be there a few days before we can move on he cast his eyes across the crew wishing samir had left them a few weapons as soon as weve landed i will take a small party with me along the coast until we find the nearest village and try to negotiate passage toward the mainland is that all clear there was a low murmur among the crew did i hear something ghassan barked are my orders clear silence reigned ghassan glowered at the men in his boat does anyone have something to say the was a pregnant pause and then a burly man squared his shoulders ghassan eyed him thoughtfully caro his name an oarsman who had been on that bank of oars that samirs artillery had targeted while there were no marks on him he had likely been sat in the centre of hell this morning as men burned and were smashed to pieces around him ghassan was surprised that he hadnt seen this coming but then hed had rather a lot on his mind there was a word for this in the navy mutiny mister caro is that it you cn call it that sir if you want but the way i look at it weve no ship and we aint in imperial waters i aint in the mood to take orders right now see sir and i dont think many of the lads are neither ghassan nodded so whats this to be a direct takeover will you be the new captain or is this to be a democracy if the former i hope you have your plans ready caro growled s not funny capn as of now we aint navy no more no onell hurt you long as you sit there quietly and dont get in the way ghassan gazed levelly at the man he was an oarsman not a marine burly and big but not trained to fight ghassan on the other hand had had more than his share of brawls it doesnt matter whether were floating on a tray in the underworld youre still a sailor in the imperial navy caro sit back grab the oar and get ready to row and ill forget i ever heard the word mutiny ghassan almost laughed as the other twenty or so occupants of the large boat shuffled backwards as much as possible to be out of the way of this potential clash there was precious little room to stretch in here and yet somehow they managed to open a clear passage between the two men duty brought responsibility and one responsibility was to keep the crew together and under the chain of command caro leaned forward and cracked his knuckles dont push it capn we dont wanna hurt you just sit quiet and relax ghassan straightened very well mister caro i hereby officially charge you with attempted mutiny and have no choice but to bring you before the authorities on our return if you survive that long the oarsman rumbled deep in his throat i ought to ghassan cut him off with a shout you ought to what mister caro he nodded inwardly as he watched the man reach down to one of the supply crates wallowing in the bottom of the boat predictably caro wrenched at the crates lid and tore a short length of wood from it gripping it tight enough that his knuckles whitened ghassan treated him to a smile this was a critical moment to lose now was to lose everything but to win in the wrong way would be to cause anger and resentment and to invite further challenges he sized the man up caro was big and strong and any blow by the man would hurt tremendously but would be wild and fuelled by frustration and anger ghassan had the luxury of already knowing what he needed to do and how to bring that about he smiled as he looked at the mans face those dark eyes glowering under a heavy brow the oarsmans hair was short as was his beard but one eyebrow ran along the ridge above his nose a nice straight nose he hated to lose people but better one than all whyre you smilin the man asked uncertainly because i know something that i believe you do not mister caro and because of that i give you one free shot make it count as if you can put me down with that shot the crew is yours as he finished speaking he shuffled forward into the space between the crew and held his arms out level from his shoulders caro stared at him changed your mind sailor ghassan asked lightly the man flared for a moment and launched his attack just as ghassan had hoped he had goaded the man into wasting his opportunity the blow was heavy as caro swung the plank angling the makeshift weapon so that it landed with the edge rather than the flat ghassan felt bones break probably two ribs but maybe even three this had better settle things as hed be in a bad state to deal with anyone else afterwards he collapsed to the bottom of the boat hurled to one side by the force the wind knocked from him caro had stood and as ghassan pulled himself back from the floor he realised how stupid the man must be to get to his feet in a rowing boat indeed hed just made ghassans job harder if he did this wrong now the sailor would end up in the water swimming around and waiting to come back for the next shot slowly he pulled himself upright grunting at the excruciating pain in his side caro was grinning at him cmon capn stay down so i dont have to really hurt you still grunting and with heaving breaths ghassan stood straight if caro stood he would have to as well my turn the captain said flexing his fingers caro gave a deep belly laugh come on then capn ill give you a freebie too but then is gonna have to put you down hard ghassan nodded as the sailor mimicked his earlier stance arms held out to the sides fair enough there were certain things hed learned from his uncle but they involved fighting like a soldier with weapons and there were others that hed picked up when he headed a boarding party then there were a few things hed learned when still a boy on board serving in whatever lowly position was required in those days hed been careful to pick up anything anyone would teach him and throughout his life he had come to the inescapable conclusion that strength and endurance were no match for planning and accuracy with a lightningquick blow like the attack of a coiled snake ghassan lunged out with his right arm palm open and fingers up as he straightened the limb into the blow the heel of his hand connected with caro at the upper lip and carried through driving the mutineers nose bone deep into his brain and exploding the mans face in a shower of blood ignoring the shocked silence that fell around him ghassan stared into the surprised and suddenly lifeless eyes of his opponent and then reached out and grasped him by the shoulder before he fell overboard gently in the stunned quiet he lowered the body to the seat once more and left him to loll there flopping to the left to end up draped across a horrified sailor hell need a proper burial when we beach so ill also need a burial party am i clear the chorus of affirmative voices brought a wave of relief to the captain and he sat heavily in the bow once more and tentatively prodded his side that was going to take a long time to heal fortunately time was not something he was currently lacking in which new plans are laid asima tapped her fingers irritably on the rail at the stern of the empress samir seemed to be largely unconcerned and whistled quietly as he made minute adjustments in course according to the compass in his hands as seemed to be always the case these days what irritated asima was the lack of control she felt helpless to direct her own destiny and samirs irritatingly smug calm in the face of danger merely heightened the aggravation she felt youre supposed to be a remarkable sailor samir so why are we going as slowly as those following us can you not find a tiny turn of extra speed and put us further ahead of them samir laughed asima these rocks are extremely dangerous and unpredictable i go at whatever speed safe passage affords no more and no less but as soon as we get past the reefs those other ships will be virtually on top of us can you really outrun them all when we hit open sea perhaps probably not we could outrun most ships but were short a number of oarsmen so well be lucky to stay ahead of them at all his passenger ground her teeth audibly so why are you looking so pleased with yourself because i rarely leave anything to chance these days asima you should appreciate that i have a feeling you live by similar rules if different ethics i hope youre right and not merely being smug and selfaggrandising ha she gritted her teeth as samir narrowed his eyes and peered past the masts toward the front of the ship what now she barked angrily not taking her eyes from the vague shapes behind them the fog had thinned a little as they left the clinging steamy vegetation of the island there was still a blanket of white but since they had been among the reefs she had begun to see their pursuers more clearly though it had taken an effort of will to keep her attention from wandering repeatedly to the desperate and gloomy figures occupying the rocks she had counted at least three vessels but had a feeling there were four or five back there in the mist following their own directions from the other dead mans compass on the lead ship almost out of the reefs i can see open water ahead and the mists almost clear thatll be a relief im starting to miss the sight of the stars and that wonderful white moonlight a relief asima fell angrily silent for a moment clearly samir was unconcerned and unwilling to explain himself to her so it was time to plan ahead on the assumption that he knew what he was doing and change the subject im still very much in the dark as to what you intend now samir hmm he prompted concentrating on his rudder well youre in the same position you were before you dragged me to lassos but now youve got pirates chasing us as well you said you couldnt go near the coast as theyd be looking for you samir smiled ive got a day or two at the least until news reaches anyone pelasia will learn about it first ghassan will have landed there and news travels fast there as youll know cant go to calphoris though as theyve got it in for me anyway so i shall make for mdahz but by a roundabout route asima rounded on him angrily what then you could have taken me there first asima calm down i was unable to do so before but things have now changed i shall take you to mdahz in due course first things first though got to get clear of pursuit i cant just breeze into mdahz on board one of the most notorious vessels afloat and drop you on the dock be sensible so we need to disappear altogether for a while youre being needlessly cryptic again samir laughed weve taken on some cargo during the night at lassos as soon as were out of sight of other vessels our colours change as do our clothes and even the name on the ship given about an hour we will no longer be the dark empress but the spirit of redemption a private imperial merchant out of serfium youre going to pretend to be another ship she blinked in surprise certainly samir smiled how else do you think weve ever got into calphoris or mdahz its dangerous so i dont like to do it unless its imperative but there are odd occasions when we have to go places that are really way too dangerous for us asima shook her head in disbelief so you change your flag and your shirt and then drop into mdahz thats ridiculous dont they check you or anything of course they do thats why were not going there straight away there are half a dozen convenient small towns along the archipelago and on the coast of both pelasia and the empire that we can trade our goods in and even make a little money enroute then when we get to mdahz and they check our manifest well have plenty of supporting evidence for our story he raised an eyebrow as he noted the speculative look on asimas face i cannot fathom what that dangerous mind of yours is cooking up now but i would recommend against it with an angry flash in her eyes asima turned once more to gaze into the rapidly thinning fog behind them four vessels moving painstakingly slowly through the reefs each captain relaying the orders from the leading ship what was samir up to the last of the rocks drifted past an old man with hopeless eyes in a drenched grey robe fixing her with an accusative stare as he slid by again in spite of herself asima found herself shuddering very well samir were in open water what now now he replied with a grin we set as good a pace as we can out into the open sea bearing south west i meant about our pursuers watch and enjoy asima aggravated as always by his slightly smug silence she turned and watched as their pursuers came on relentlessly a line of vessels in perfect coordination echoing one anothers movements like she blinked something was clearly wrong out there the lead ship had turned to port no wait to starboard her port she would never get the hang of sailing the vessels following closely however seemed to have received incorrect information there were sudden bellows of alarm the front ship quickly slewed to a halt almost side on stuck between rocks that prevented further passage behind them chaos ensued as ships desperately came to a stop receiving either no instructions or incorrect ones from the leading vessel asima narrowed her eyes that wasnt an accident and i dont see how you could have done it samir smiled every gambler worth his salt has a card up his sleeve but you havent been on board their ship you couldnt even have known whether theyd follow us at all let alone who it would be and you havent had the opportunity to lay a trap so what happened samir tapped the side of his nose and smiled at her before cupping his free hand round his mouth and shouting out the order for full speed both sail and oars behind him asima grumbled and glared at him why would he continually reveal everything he did to her despite his professed lack of trust and yet withhold what seemed to be a small detail she narrowed her eyes again there was something going on here samir had plans for sure hed said as much to her and they appeared to involve his designs on rule in lassos which she could heartily understand but he was using her somehow and it infuriated her that she could see that and could feel it happening but had no idea how it was happening well shed been thinking too and it was time for the lady asima former consort of the king of pelasia to begin working her way back to power for some time since being taken from ghassans ship she had pondered on her best course of action once she returned to the mainland when the wind of god had disappeared beneath the waves it had taken most of her belongings with it she had saved the most important and the most valuable items about her person yet with diminished funds it would be all the more difficult to set herself up as an eligible widow beautiful and young to trap a high lord of the pelasian court but now funds would be largely irrelevant samir had used her as part of some plan she could not fathom and a plan that was clearly still in progress but it would never come to fruition asima smiled inwardly as the true value of her situation dawned on her lords and officials both imperial and pelasian would practically deify her if she could deliver them samir into captivity moreover she had seen lassos knew its occupants its layout and military strength and even the secret method of navigation through the reefs when she reached mdahz with samir and that knowledge she would find herself in probably the strongest bargaining position of her life she realised that she was smiling openly as she noticed samir watching her with interest something funny asima she laughed lightly care to share with me how you chased those ships off she asked with a cheeky grin i think ill hold on to that for a while never know when i might need a little trick or two of my own then yes there is something funny but i alone shall laugh at it samir shrugged as you wish for now however i think you ought to go below and catch up on a bit more sleep the moons almost down and dawn wont be far off ill want you fully alert and ready to lend a hand when daylight strikes asima shook her head i haul ropes for no one samir ha i realise that in the morning the empress will be barely recognisable and well have imperial clothing colours and name you will be a wealthy passenger on her way to mdahz its basically true anyway but i need you to play the noblewoman some of the people we will be dealing with in the ports on the way are more inclined to give us favourable deals if they think it will curry favour with a courtier of note asima nodded thoughtfully then i shall need to be attired and addressed appropriately of course of course so get some rest for the next couple of weeks you are a rich passenger on board the spirit of redemption in which ghassan goes home it had been a strange journey ghassan sighed as he stepped down from the pelasian daram strange but quick from their initial beaching near eagle rock they had found the local pelasian fishermen to be extremely helpful and accommodating the first three days had seen the sailors escorted by one fisherman or another between islands the locals going out of their way to help and delivering the refugees to their destination before going about their ordinary daily business then on the fourth day they had all been surprised to see the next settlement in the chain that led them home arhab was somewhat different from the other fishing towns and villages they had seen this was a new settlement only a few years old and purposebuilt as a shipyard for the navy of the local satrap whom they learned was a man named khalad and who shared the dual distinctions of being the controller of the most land at the pelasian court ruling a sizeable portion of the coast as well as the entire archipelago while also holding the exalted position of commander of the royal fleet at akkad in the spirit of cooperation between the two governments the pelasian admiral in command of the arhab shipyard immediately had one of their newest daram put at the disposal of ghassan and his men to ferry them wherever they wished to go while the repeated aid of helpful fishermen had brought them a surprising distance in only three days the powerful military daram of the pelasian navy was capable of astounding speed ghassan had almost forgotten the awful situation into which they were heading as he spent the next two days strolling around the ship and investigating it comparing it to his own lost vessel if anything this new pelasian warship would be faster than his had been though less effective in direct battle he was suitably impressed by both ship and crew and had found that he was beginning to enjoy himself a little for a time then however real life had impressed itself on him once more this morning when he had been called up on deck by the captain to see the smudge that was mdahz on the horizon he had gathered his men on deck and given them his instructions while the crew settled in to wait in one of the military bunkhouses of the docks he would report to the local governor they had finally docked midmorning and with no small amount of trepidation ghassan had descended the gang plank mdahz hadnt seemed to change much it had done when he had been growing up though what hed remembered from his childhood as a happy noisy busy place had become quiet depressed and almost dead in the years of the rule of maahd hed been sure mdahz had changed fully never to recover yet in the short time the town had been once more controlled by the factors of the empire the failing settlement had experienced a rebirth clearly hope had never died and with the removal of the oppressive ruler mdahz had begun to flower once more people who had fled to calphoris and lived had returned as had traders from the desert and overseas the port bustled and was filled with voices in a dozen accents bright carpets and hangings were in evidence in the streets once more and many of the buildings had been given a fresh coat of white and yet all this positive attitude that seemed to flood out of the very stone of mdahz could do little to lighten ghassans mood taking a deep breath he turned and cast one long look at his crew some of whom had been veteran sailors on board the wind of god when he had come aboard as a boy he couldnt fight off the impression that he had failed them all with a sigh he strode through the organised chaos of the dock between coiled ropes lobster pots crates and junk toward the main street that climbed the hill to the top of the town even with his uniform dirty and torn and showing signs of the awful events it had witnessed the people of mdahz parted as he passed many nodding their respect to him an act that merely heightened his unhappiness he passed through the main square where they had burned pelasian flags so long ago crossing diagonally and continuing up the slope as it steepened the searing sun was hidden in these streets by the age old means of stringing blankets and rugs across between the upper storeys his heart sank like an anchor in the sea of his soul as he reached the end of the long street and strode out at a military march into the plaza before the governors compound despite their childhood vow to climb the roofs of these buildings ghassan had never stepped foot inside the compound yet the closest being when he had collected asima a week or more ago even then hed only spent an hour or two in the town the thought of his childhood friend love darkened his mood further if that were at all possible grinding his teeth he approached the gate two whiteuniformed guards stepped forward their spears and shields reflecting the brilliant sunlight and creating random spots of dazzling white that danced around the shadows as they moved captain ghassan of the wind of god to see the governor you have an appointment asked one of the soldiers his northern accent thick no but it is imperative that i see him urgently and i fear he will want to see me the guard nodded and then conferred with his companion in his own language for a moment before turning back wait here ghassan nodded and stood silently his gaze wandering over the buildings both inside the compound and out as he waited for what seemed an eternity the whiteclad guard effectively ignored him standing stiff and proud by the gate with relief perhaps five minutes later ghassan saw the guard emerge from a door on the far side of the compound and gesture calling out the guard in front of him gestured you go in now ghassan saluted and marched across the compound he had always hoped to see the inside of this place and now he found he couldnt wait to get out of it the closer he came to his meeting with the governor the more convinced he became of the bleakness of the fate that awaited him the new local governor in mdahz had seemed very straight and humourless at their last brief meeting ghassans future career livelihood and even life may well depend upon the decision or recommendation of this man ghassan realised he didnt know the political structure enough to know how much power this lesser governor had when compared with that of the provincial governor in calphoris or his military commanders his heart pounding ghassan reached the doorway and was ushered inside by the guard who escorted him in silence up one of the flights of stairs that framed the main hall the governors door was open and as they approached the whiteclad guard gestured to him to enter making a futile gesture to tame the tangle of black curls on his head and straighten his jacket ghassan cleared his throat and entered the room the occupant was a tall and well dressed man with a long nose and piercing eyes a foreigner sent from velutio to take control of mdahz he also had a dangerous look ghassan swallowed nervously sir he came to attention and saluted the governor turned and stood against his desk crossing his legs as he leaned back and folding his arms captain i presume the news you bring is not good ghassan shook his head and had to fight for the words momentarily wishing hed taken samir up on his offer duty must be done though i beg to report my lord the loss of the wind of god and a small portion of her crew most of the men returned with me and await further instructions at the docks the governor tapped his finger on his lips i felt certain you had not made it to velutio and back in this short time pray tell me what happened to the most renowned vessel in the calphorian fleet and where your charge the lady asima is at this time ghassan swallowed again there was an edge to the mans voice that spoke volumes regardless of his almost casual words regretfully sir we fell prey to pirates he winced this was a moment of defining character he realised did he take on the full responsibility himself the situation had been unfortunate and largely beyond his control the truth was less noble and considerably less believable but then asima deserved anything that life threw at her now or that ghassan threw the lady asima in an effort to prevent us achieving our mission sabotaged the ship and left us unable to manoeuvre when the pirates appeared we were not in a position to take them on sir and may i ask if you identified your attackers ghassan sighed yes sir it was captain samir of the dark empress the governor nodded knowingly im sure you realise just how irregular all of this appears captain ghassan i would normally have to decide between disciplinary courses of action to take against you for the loss of a ship and an important passenger however given that both said passenger and the captain of your attackers are old acquaintances of yours other questions are raised and i fear that we have now surpassed my jurisdiction ghassan nodded professionally i can see how this must appear my lord be silent the governor hissed you will be very lucky to escape this debacle with your head on your shoulders captain at any rate i will pass along my recommendation to my superiors in calphoris that you be dishonourably discharged from the force without pay or benefits and possibly banished from the province ghassan shook slightly trying to hold himself straight sir that is all captain ghassan and be grateful that i am a merciful man the lord who trained me in velutio would have recommended execution for such a failure and given the dubious circumstances surrounding it ghassan straightened and saluted yessir the governor glared at him you have family in mdahz i believe a home here im sure ive seen it in the records ghassan blinked for a moment unsure of the answer there is a house that belonged to my mother if it still stands sir none of my family survived the occupation very well well have the address on file no doubt go there and stay until you are ordered otherwise i will send a courier to calphoris with the news and ask for the marshals recommendation when it is given i will send for you sir and do not think about leaving the city your name and description will be given to the army and the port authorities i am releasing you on your honour on the understanding that you are still currently a serving officer and that no decision has yet been made stay out of trouble until you are sent for ghassan nodded and saluted now go with a final salute ghassan turned on his heel and strode from the room without pausing or looking back he marched down the stairs and across the hall out through the doors and across the compound into the plaza those occupants of mdahz he passed shied out of the way of his fierce gaze and gritted teeth depression and despair had given way to something else as ghassan left the compound angry determination and a cold certainty there was only one way to make this right with his superiors he would have to give them samir on a platter and return asima unscathed to answer for her own crimes the baking sun hung suspended above mdahz and shone down on a town in flux the end of a regime had lifted the spirits of the people and had brought back trade and life things were changing in mdahz and many of its lost children had returned home and now three of those children repeatedly torn away from one another and thrown back together changed beyond measure from the boys and girl who raced across the hot rooftops a lifetime ago converged on their childhood playground the pirate the soldier and the princess were coming home bringing schemes and plans with them part four my enemys enemy in which samir goes home mdahz looked just as it always had from the sea a sprawl of tangled narrow streets and alleyways winding their way among white blocks as they snaked up the slope to the crest where the walls and towers of the governors palace complex stood proud of the lower roofs though in truth all they could smell on board the spirit of redemption was the fresh if salty air of the sea the mind filtered in the mixed aroma of spice and dung that they remembered from their youth samir sighed they had been at sea for more than two weeks including the occasional stopovers in one port or another much as he hated to admit it samir found he rather liked the life of a legitimate merchant while it was less exciting on a physical basis the challenges inherent in business gave his mind something to work on even in quiet restful periods moreover asima played the imperial noblewoman so well that she had charmed and impressed many otherwise shrewd traders into extremely favourable deals no real surprise to samir was it that his lady passenger was capable of taking on a role and playing it with no slip or hiccup but on these occasions her devious mind and slippery morals had played to the advantage of all concerned and yet with every hop between ports bringing them closer to their destination samir found that a cloud hung over his mood and darkened with every league they passed not only was a trip to mdahz not the most pleasant on his list of things to do but this was where everything would change and each detail had to go well he hoped in the name of whatever gods were still interested in watching his hometown that he had not underestimated asima he doubted he had but there was still a nagging doubt he could nudge her in the right direction but she was almost as subtle as he and she might just notice that he turned and looked along the rail upon which they leaned casting a noncommittal glance at his passenger in her expensive northernstyle dress he had to admit that not only did she look the part but she was extraordinarily alluring im never entirely happy coming back here he said sadly it is a stinking hole asima nodded absently thats not what i meant samir snapped at her i feel happy sad disappointed and angry all at once when i even look at the place it tears me in too many directions at the same time and of course with the path that i follow these days i can never truly let my guard down when im here so im also tense and jumpy how long til we dock she asked five minutes the woman nodded what will you do now samir enquired i will sell on my few expensive items and find myself safe passage back to pelasia i shall have to avoid any contact with the governor or the military though as theyre the ones who sent me into exile across the sea i expect i can find the right sort of people given a few hours i have a little money put aside for you you made us rather a good profit on the voyage my lady of velutio so i thought a small token of our thanks might help you find your way safely to where youre going as fast as possible asima smiled thank you samir i will have to stay at least one night in the town though my father passed away a few years back and ive never had a chance to visit his grave so i think i ought to take the opportunity while im here indeed i considered visiting our old neighbourhood but there are too many people in mdahz that might know or recognise me safer that i spend the night on board and venture no further than the docks if youre spending time in the town perhaps you would look in at my mothers house and pass on my regards to her ghost asima nodded of course the pair fell silent and watched the sprawl of mdahz drifting toward them minutes passed as the two deep in thought leaned on the rail their eyes locked on their destination prepare for docking a voice from the command deck called samir looked back up at his first officer who was also concentrating on the town ahead the crew moved around them preparing the mooring ropes taking seats with the oars and furling sails samir barely paid them any attention still carefully concentrating on figuring asimas likely activities straightening he adjusted the tight and itchy imperial green jacket and flattened his hair for neatness reaching down beside him he undid the bag hed brought out from his cabin removed a leather wallet and then slung the bag over his shoulder dont let your act slip now asima she nodded and allowed her face to fall into the grave and serious mask she had worn so often over recent weeks a few moments later the ship came slowly alongside the jetty the oars retreating within the hull and being set down as other sailors threw out the lines samir glanced along the wooden walkway to the small group awaiting them two of the town guard stood at the shoulders of a small weasellike man with a tablet and stylus who was frowning at the new arrival carefully and diplomatically samir waited until the ship had come to a complete stop and the lines were being tied and then took asimas arm in a respectful fashion as the sailors ran out the gangplank and lowered it to the jetty samir and his passenger stepped across to it in the ageold manner of a captain with an honoured guest he bowed to her and then slowly backed down the plank holding his arm out before him for the lady to grasp the board was slippery and asima made a point of skittering once in her expensive slippers just for the look of the thing samir almost smiled at that attention to detail that was what made her good it was also what made her dangerous they alighted on the walkway and he escorted her forward her hand on his arm until they came to a halt before the group of men samir nodded his head professionally while asima graced them with a superior smile good morning captain lady samir smiled good morning officer may i present the lady lyria once of calphoris and lately of velutio the port official bowed seriously and then gestured at the ship with his stylus your name cargo and destination as well as port of origin captain professionally samir nodded and passed the leather folder over the official opened it glanced briefly at the documents and turned the page to check the one below nodding he passed it back and gestured with his stylus to go on captain halvus of the spirit of redemption out of velutio these past four weeks samir announced varied cargo mostly of fabrics and grain nothing restricted were simply on one leg of our journey from here we head for calphoris in a day or two then the ports of the east coast and up to germalla before returning to velutio as he spoke the official nodded and made marks on his tablet long journey captain roundabout trip keeping to coastlines for safety too many stories of pirates in your waters im afraid officer the official shot him a miserable look and then returned to his marking sadly youre not the first to say that at least you came though many keep away altogether will you be wanting to do a search of the hold no trouble if so but the lady will be staying on in mdahz for a few days to visit an acquaintance and i would like to have her escorted to meet her friends before we begin so as not to inconvenience her too much the official looked samir up and down and then smiled superciliously at asima everything appears to be in order captain so i think we can forgo such formalities welcome to mdahz my lady i hope you enjoy your time here the town is in a state of extreme busyness at the moment we are preparing for the first fullweek festival since the city was freed and it will be rather a large celebration i hope you can stay for it asima smiled a dazzling smile at the man i shall make every effort to attend sir he smiled at her once more and then lowered his face respectfully as he stepped aside the two guardsmen bowed slightly and parted to clear the jetty please captain after you samir nodded and arm still held out for asima to grip strode from the jetty onto dry land once they were safely out of earshot asima took a deep breath dangerous offering your hold to search openness and honesty is often rewarded even if its faked much more dangerous to appear cagey and unwilling well she said squaring her shoulders i think you can safely leave me here samir you dont want to go too far into the city samir shrugged ill escort you to the edge of the docks and to the town itself such would be expected of your escort the pair strode on for another minute he leading her through the port as though she were unfamiliar with it rather than knowing each stone and plank from youthful games presently they reached the edge of the docks where a delimiting stockade marked the beginning of the town proper the gate stood open jammed with crates and was apparently rarely closed now even at night the pair of guards standing to either side of the gateway appeared bored to the point of stupefaction samir smiled he had no intention of spending his time in mdahz lounging around on the ship but what he was going to do depended at least partially on asimas next course of action as they approached the gate samir fished in his jacket and withdrew a small pouch here take this itll hardly buy you a palace but itll make your journey considerably easier asima smiled and stopped reaching out and grasping and pocketing the pouch thank you captain i hope all goes well for you here and that when you return to your home port you achieve everything you dream of im sure i shall lady perhaps our paths will cross once again someday perhaps she gave him a warm and very forced smile showing just a little hint of her desperation to depart until then yes maam samir touched his forehead respectfully and had to hide his smile at the vaguely lustful glances the two bored guards cast at the retreating beauty as she turned and wandered up the road trust me lads you couldnt afford that one one of the guards laughed and then returned to his languid pose tapping his foot impatiently samir watched asima trot up the street too soon wait just a little longer he blinked as she disappeared down a side street damn it could she possibly be doing something else where was she going hed assumed she would go straight up to the governors complex to announce the presence and location of the dark empress and its captain could she actually have been telling the truth was she just going to disappear no samir chuckled raising interest from one of the guards ignoring the man he set off up the street at a fast walk no she would betray him it was in her nature she was just going somewhere else on the way to the governors could she be heading to her fathers old house maybe he slapped his forehead as he picked up his pace to reach the side street of course hed asked her to check on his mothers house he hadnt expected her to actually do it but perhaps he had piqued her interest enough that she could spare the time to go and check after all as far as she was aware she was in no rush she may even go and visit her fathers grave too after all with a frown he strode along the busy street the port official had been right there was so much activity one could hardly imagine this was the same town that had suffered and almost died beneath the rule of a harsh foreign invader colour and noise abounded and the narrow road was so crowded that samir was forced at times to pause and wait for a gap to open up or to push through a resistant and inattentive bunch of ditherers he had lost sight of asima as soon as she had turned into the side street but now convinced of her destination he knew exactly where to go gritting his teeth as he pushed his way between half a dozen burly men with a ladder and roll of banners he shook his head would their mothers house still be standing moreover did he really want to go there and dredge up all those old memories and feelings there wasnt much choice though he needed to be sure of asimas betrayal to adjust his own plans accordingly so even if she walked into the jaws of hell at this point hed follow her taking a deep breath samir headed home in which samir goes home the house looked the same somehow samir had expected either years of abandonment and neglect to have taken their toll and left a ruinous shell of a building or for someone to have taken up residence and changed the place and yet he suddenly felt eight years old returning from buying juicy watermelon at the market to wait for the noon meal clearly someone had taken up residence though he could see a blanket and some clothes hanging out of an upper window mens clothes too asima had either not noticed this or did not care though for as samir finally came within sight of the front door the crowd parting as he reached the outskirts and streets that were less busy he spotted asima hed almost caught up with her and she stood looking at the door of the building with her head on one side before shrugging and reaching for the handle samir hurried along the street keeping to the side and obscured from sight by a couple playing noisily with a dog he ducked and keeping his head low waited until she had pushed open the door and entered before rushing along the buildings and pushing himself up against the wall of the house it felt exceedingly odd to be sneaking up on the only permanent home he had ever known the place that held the memories of his mother brother father and uncle he heard a call of alarm in a womans voice muffled by the thick cooling walls of the building he couldnt be certain but was reasonably convinced the voice would be asimas judging the location of the occupants from the level of muffling of the voice and his flawless memories of the buildings layout samir ducked into a side alley that led up the slope between the houses to a higher road beyond and hurried up the steps to one of the small rear windows of the building the aperture partially obscured by a damaged blind that had been in that state as long as samir could remember led into the kitchen where he and ghassan used to help their mother prepare meals now there were two voices becoming clearer as he approached the window one male and one female stooping slightly he put his eye to one of the small gaps in the blind and blinked in surprise ghassan stood at a ruined table in the kitchen propped up on a broken chair he looked tired scruffy and badlyshaven samir nodded to himself his brother must have been discharged from the navy they wouldnt countenance an officer in that state as he watched ghassan flung his arms wide in an angry gesture as he fixed his gaze on asima standing in the doorway to samirs surprise there was a bottle in his brothers hand one of the powerful spirits distilled by the northern tribes and quite hard to buy for a reasonable price this far south i dont care what youre doing here asima get the hell out of this house youre cheapening mothers memory with your stink again samir blinked ghassan was taking it hard but then the taller brother had always been the more sensitive and the pungent brew would not be helping asimas betrayals and deceit were easy enough for samir to brush off but ghassan would feel wounded every time he saw her for a moment samirs heart went out to his broken brother things will be better samir the words ghassan had spoken to him on that day when so many innocent people had been cast to their death from the town wall and right now things were better for samir not so for ghassan but then the taller brother was unaware of samirs plans for the future the small handsome brother smiled at the window things will be better ghassan he said under his breath asima had entered the room now and levelled a finger at ghassan across the table dont be blind and petty ghassan if you dont listen to what i have to say youll sit here and wallow in your own filth and drink yourself to death and nothing good will come of this for either of us go away samir was surprised once again as asima rounded the table and grasped ghassan by the forearms the bottle fell to the surface where it tipped onto its side and began to spill its expensive and corrosive contents onto the wood he hadnt realised how bad things had become his brother was either truly drunk or a broken man ghassan you have a chance here to make everything right and i ask for very little in return whatever it is asima the price is too high whose life or liberty are you selling now asima smiled and samir couldnt believe how horribly feral that face had become i can give you your honour and your career again how much is that worth to you less than itll cost asima pushed ghassan and the slightly inebriated soldier fell back into the chair behind him wake up you idiot samirs in mdahz hes brought me back and hes in port as i speak ghassan sat up straight and samir suddenly wished he could see his brothers expression samirs days of piracy are numbered she went on jabbing an angry finger at the seated man i was on my way to turn him in to the governor but i made a side trip out of curiosity despite everything samir had to smile to himself there was a certain point of untrustworthiness and deviousness where a person became as predictable as a straight and law abiding citizen he peered down at them ghassan was shaking his head what have you got against samir i thought your quarrel was with me asima samir raised his eyes to the heavens it wasnt that ghassan was slow or stupid but he had trouble seeing the dubious side of anything even of asima the alcohol had likely blinkered him a little too ghassan i need to return to pelasia and i prefer to do it legitimately with power and finance a good step to doing that would be to have the governor on my side and possibly even a reward then why come to me asima laughed happy accident ghassan i came here on a whim at samirs suggestion just to see if the building still stood but there are advantages to coming to you rather than the governor the seated man greeted this with an empty silence so asima shrugged the governor may not agree to see me im not precisely in his favour as he only wanted to send me away even if i do get to see him he may not believe me and that just leaves too many uncertainties for me then theres the practicalities too if the governor sends troops to the port to take him in samir may well get away with his ship before they can board if not itll likely end in a fight and again the outcomes too uncertain for my liking no we need to capture him alone and i cant really do that on my own ghassan nodded and cleared his throat it so happens that the notion of the capture of samir and his ship has been knocking around in my head for a while now ive not had my judgement decided by the provincial governor yet but if i can deliver samir it would go a long way to solving my problems he stood once more with only a slight wobble i am not happy at all with working alongside you asima but if you can deliver samir to me i give you my word that i shall speak to the governor and ask him to grant you permission to stay and at least a portion of the reward asima smiled just what i had in mind and then i never want to set eyes on you again for as long as either of us lives is that clear asima nodded with a nonchalant shrug once i am on the road back to the pelasian throne i care not a jot for what you do ghassan samir listened for a moment to them finalising their deal and then stole away from the wall he would have to see where she went from here the governors compound or the port the pirate captain was sure of three things asima would not leave ghassan to glean most of the glory and profit from this she was spiteful and greedy and would want everything for herself she needed every ounce of support if she was to try and return to her place in pelasia similarly ghassan had no intention of letting asima take her portion of the glory she had dishonoured him committed crimes against the navy and the empire at which the tall captain would take great offence and had personally betrayed and insulted him samir was convinced his brother would turn her over after they succeeded and yet he was also sure that neither of these things would come to pass asima must be stopped for the good of the world at large and the brothers specifically under no circumstances should a woman with that kind of mind be any closer to power than she was now moreover ghassan had to be made to realise that he was wallowing and drifting when he should be working with samir and asima would have to betray them for him to have any hope of convincing ghassan samir suddenly ducked back into the shadow of a wall as asima strode from the front door of his former home he held his breath as she looked up and down the street and then walked off down the slope from whence shed come nodding to himself samir disappeared into the crowd and rushed ahead until he reached the point where this street joined the main thoroughfare up the hill through the town there he waited in a doorway watching a minute later he caught sight of asimas face among the crowd as she reached the main street again he held his breath as she looked up and down the hill governor or port squaring her shoulders she turned a determined look about her and strode back down the hill nodding samir moved off ahead of her among the crowd making directly for the port gates as fast as he could shed not been to see the governor then what on earth was she up to he needed her to do something wicked to help him with ghassan sighing he made his way down the hill through the docks and up the plank to the ship that wallowed in the water by the jetty two of his men nodded respectfully at him as he came aboard quickly he looked himself up and down a little dusty but fine really he brushed himself down and strode across to his cabin entered poured a drink and waited for his visitor relaxing in the chair the wait was not long two minutes he had counted when there was a knock at the door and it opened a little the ladys back sir and asking permission to come aboard samir nodded by all means show her in he smiled as he took a sip of the good wine he kept in his cabinet and then looked up feigning mild surprise as asima entered and the sailor shut the door behind her asima back so soon i thought youd be on your way to akkad by now she shook her head there was a look of despair or possibly sadness on her face both expressions seemed so alien in that environment that samir had trouble identifying it what was she up to samir i dont know how to tell you this he frowned what are you talking about asima she fell silent a tear rolled down her cheek and a slight wobble began to affect her lip samir didnt know whether to laugh or be impressed the show was well and truly underway samir its your brother got to play it right he thought as he threw the most perplexed and cautious expression he could manage across his features ghassan hes here after a fashion asima more tears now it really was quite impressive how she did that hes dead samir there was a momentary hoarse catch in her throat and then she threw her hands up to her face and began to sob samir blinked in shock and stood suddenly clambering wildly round the desk to grab her by the shoulders gritting his teeth he shook her a little so that her head jolted back what are you talking about she burbled and wiped her eyes i went to your mothers house to see if it still stood it was empty and quiet so i went in to have a look and there he was oh samir its horrible samir frowned she was good how could he resist this what happened asima he barked his voice on the edge of feigned panic he oh samir hes been attacked beaten knifed samir smiled inwardly it was perfect but now he had to play his part in the drama with equal skill settling his features into a grim determination samir addressed her through clenched teeth take me there in which plans are laid and undone samir followed asima through the crowded dock he wondered for a moment whether he should have suggested taking a few sailors with him it would be inconvenient though a natural thing to do but in the end he decided to forgo that and head out with her alone trusting she would put any lack of caution down to shock or the necessity of speed they passed through the dock at a fast walk a run would attract far too much attention for either of them and at the far side samir almost walked into asimas back as she slowed near the port gate what was she up to surreptitiously while keeping his head lowered samir scanned the area and almost smiled as he noticed the gate guards the military were not noted for their subtlety and these two were no exception one kept his eyes averted from the pair of them while the other gave a barely perceptible nod to asima samirs eyes strayed a little and noted that the mans grip on his spear tightened the knuckles whitening that was it then shed not needed to go to the governor because shed already sold them out to the town guard it was a dangerous play given the likelihood that the guard might just be eager enough to capture him that theyd go ahead and ruin whatever plans she had he frowned as they passed the guards and entered the street leading up the hill repeating their earlier journey precisely the soldiers werent trying to take him at the gate so she must have told them to come to the house it would have been easier to capture him here so they must be intending to take ghassan at the same time but why separately would have been so much easier for them quickly they hurried up the street toward the turning that led toward the west gate and their house samir worked through every conceivable angle and motive as he rushed along behind her they were trying to get both brothers together and that meant that some extra evidence was afforded by them being in the same place he almost slapped his head as he realised ghassan could very easily be accused of complicity in the whole affair from a legal standpoint it was not unrealistic to assume that the naval officer had delivered both asima and his ship to his brother for a cut of the profit through some familial obligation or myriad other possibilities to find ghassan in apparent collusion with samir would likely damn them both and leave asima with a cloak of innocence once more samir considered just how dangerous asima could be if she managed to get her hands on real power she was more trouble than a thousand pelasian invaders casually he turned his head and cast his gaze behind them down the street sure enough pairs of guards were filtering through the crowd converging slowly and subtly likewise up the hill ahead of them he could see the uniforms of other soldiers scattered among the people moving down the hill there would likely be more guards moving in from the other end of the street upon which the house stood no time to worry about that now though both he and ghassan had spent their life getting out of trouble in one situation or another and the pirate captain was sure they would be able to do so again escape was not the highest priority right now top of the list was to meet ghassan to make it clear to him what a lying deceitful woman asima was and to get him on the same side they turned the corner into the narrower street and hurried along samir glanced back to see that the pursuing guards had slowed as they converged at the end of the road they were having trouble now in larger groups remaining inconspicuous and had wisely chosen to hang back he bit his lip as they approached the old neighbourhood he couldnt act to try and recruit ghassan until asima had revealed her treachery he could only hope that she wasnt going to similarly wait on them but then she couldnt do really as soon as samir officially discovered that ghassan was alive and well she would have to act with a smile he realised that without even concentrating on it his ever frantic mind had already planned out his escape good thing really since they were approaching the door and there would be very little time to pull this off with a last glance up and down the street he could see the guards at both ends now tightening the net in a minute they could be on him here goes as asima approached the door she stopped covered her face with a hand and turned to him i i just cant not again samir he had to stifle an inward laugh well played asima thats alright asima he said his face straight and grim you wait here turning his back on her he pulled on the handle and entered the house allowing the door to swing almost closed behind him the common room was very much how he remembered it though dirty and dusty the furniture was mostly gone or broken but the small low table in the centre remained a reminder of family meals long ago though he knew the layout of the building intimately his mind had already checked out and catalogued the exits regardless doorway to kitchen with climbable window to steps out back doorway to corridor that led to latrine no exit that way stairs to rooms above mothers room with window onto street or their old room with the only clear exit samir smiled ghassan stepped out from the kitchen into the doorway samir the pirate captain smiled at his tall brother ghassan id like to say you look well better than asima tells me anyway the taller brother laughed darkly i had a feeling youd be less gullible than she believed im rather sorry that i have to do this samir even though it pains me to aid asima over you i just have to try and rebuild my life i am sorry not as sorry as i am and not as sorry as you will be in a few minutes ghassan frowned and tilted his head explain samir sighed i really wanted to provide you with the evidence before i explained all this but here goes he took a deep breath asima is outside with several dozen of the town guard she doesnt need you at all ghassan she knows that turning over a notorious pirate captain would likely garner her the governors support but not as much as she would get if she also provided at least circumstantial evidence that you were in league with me and had sold out your own navy imagine what the governor would do for her then ghassan blinked i know she cant be trusted samir but are you sure about all of this you can either believe me and we can get the hell out of here and somewhere safe or you can wait a couple of minutes for hard evidence to turn up and take you into custody i told you a few weeks ago that my offer would remain open youve done your duty ghassan all there is left now is punishment and ignominy come with me and we can work it all out im not cut out for piracy samir ghassan replied shaking his head you know that his brother rolled his eyes are you cut out for jail beatings and executions come on for a moment ghassan dithered staring at his brother and then taking a deep breath he strode across to the door still standing ajar ducking to one side he peered through the gap a number of uniformed figures lurked by the doorways opposite she sinks to a new low every time i see her what are they waiting for samir either theyre not all here yet or theyre waiting on a signal from asima or more likely theyre waiting for their men to block all the alleys and streets leading away from here theyve got to seal us in ghassan nodded im assuming you have a plan i used to put together all the most complicated roof races didnt i samir smiled you almost got us killed so many times yes but were bigger and stronger now ghassan and no guard in mdahz knows the roofs like we do hows your memory ghassan shrugged as he bent and stuffed the various items he had on the nearby cupboard into a bag depends where youre thinking of heading my ships going to be in trouble either its already under the control of the guard and the men are in custody or the crew have taken her out to sea to be safe either way though were going to have to get to the port and find out ghassan shrugged then we need to take four temples cross by the dye factory turn once were over broken promises down into coppersmiths and across the five warehouses thatll bring us to the port on the west away from the gate samir laughed you see i would have foregone coppersmiths and taken the long jump over seven gables quicker ghassan reached out and squeezed his brothers shoulder you keep coming back for me samir i do nothing but try to take you in and yet you come to my aid every time how can i be worth all the effort im no better in some ways than asima the smaller brother shook his head youve always done what you thought was right even when it hurt you youre in no way the same as asima and you know it now come on ghassan grabbed his bag and nodded as the two men turned and made for the small staircase in the corner of the room at the foot samir stopped and stepped aside gesturing for ghassan to go first the taller brother frowned but took a step upwards and suddenly cried out samir blinked and reached out to grab his brother as the taller man fell back from the stairs a knife protruding from his thigh the two men staggered back against the wall ghassans leg unable to take the weight with the painful wound leaving so soon boys they looked back to the door to see asima standing in the open archway her hand still raised from throwing the weapon no rooftop races today gentlemen youre my ticket back to pelasia so im afraid i cant let you leave ghassan clenched his teeth as he reached down and pulled the knife from his leg with a grunt a spurt of blood gushed out and down his leg asima you going to keep two of my fingers to give the governor as a gift samir frowned forget her come on the sound of metal outside testified to the closing presence of the guards they had seconds only go samir the pirate stared at his brother who was wincing from the pain in his leg im not leaving you again ghassan yes you are im yours samir you already knew that somehow and now so do i but not at the moment come back for me when youre safe for a long moment samir stared at his brother but finally nodded no no no came a voice from across the room asima was already rushing past the low table and as she moved she drew another knife from her belt samir shook his head but ghassan turned and pushed him into the stairwell and urging him to go before turning back to meet the assault of their childhood friend asima lunged like a wild animal snarling as she swiped the sharp blade back and forth at ghassans face she was untrained she may be angry and dangerous but ghassan had dealt with killers his whole adult life gritting his teeth against the pain in his leg he twisted and threw up his arm inside her last swing blocking her attack reaching up he grasped her wrist so hard that he feared he may break it asimas fingers loosened and the knife fell from her hand but there was no easing of her vicious attack as she leaned forward and sank her teeth into his hand the incisors meeting between his thumb and forefinger he howled and reaching back delivered her a stinging backhanded slap with his free arm asima fell away to the floor stunned and ghassan looked up blood running down his hand and arm and dripping into the growing pool below him on the floor half a dozen guards stood in the entrance to the room he smiled weakly i dont suppose any of you gentlemen thought to bring a bandage sighing he sank to his knees as the guards fanned out around him weapons at the ready in which old games are revived samir clambered through the open window and dropped to the dusty rooftop below behind he could still hear the activity in the main room and was suddenly faced with a problem he needed to know where ghassan and asima were bound but within moments there would be guards pouring up the stairs in pursuit of this infamous pirate captain while their fellows already occupied the nearby streets and would see him jump between roofs if they were paying attention problems and very little time to decide on a course of action he bit his lip asima could only reasonably be going one place from here the governors complex and she would be in no hurry possibly the most senior of the guards would escort her there as hed want to glean a share of the glory for the catch or perhaps he wouldnt since theyd failed to catch samir he briefly wondered whether asima would give chase no shed tell the guards where to look and then shed go see the governor the larger question was over ghassan would they take him to the governor too or perhaps to the guard house in the main square that stood behind the civic hall then there was also the prison that occupied the northwesternmost tower of the city walls hanging above the sea and separated from the town itself by a hundred yards of screed slope and finally there was the possibility that they would just strap him into a wagon or onto a horse and take him to calphoris to his superiors shaking his head samir realised he could hear the thunder of footsteps in the house below the guards were coming and there was no time to plan now he knew where asima was going as soon as she had the chance and ghassan would likely remain in the city in one place or another dropping to a crouched position samir smiled in a curious way this was refreshing a hint of his longgone youth if it werent for the circumstances he could really enjoy a good chase closing his eyes he took a deep breath below a voice called out the window grinning samir set off with the crunch of gravelly dust on the rooftop and a cloud of choking white by the time the first guards face appeared at the window he lithe pirate had already reached the far end of the roof and with practiced ease leapt across the gap without even glancing down as the first guard dropped down from the window to the roof blinking in the dust and adjusting his armour the second appeared behind him staring across the roof shit hes fast the front guardsman nodded unhappily ill never make it across there not in armour anyway as the second man dropped down a third appeared behind them wearing the crest and insignia of an officer stop pissing about and get after him sir we cant jump over streets well die the officer clenched his teeth if you dont get after him ill gut you myself the second guard a tall and muscular man with the colouring of a desert nomad heaved off his mail shirt his helmet falling to the roof unnoticed ill get him sir as the armour fell to the floor with a heavy chink he dropped to a crouch and then set off like one of the dusky hounds the desert folk raced at the oases the officer nodded appreciatively while the first shorter guard stooped to collect the discarded armour it was a hot day even for a mdahz summer and the armour was already hot to the touch hes good the officer mused used to run in the five gods games at calphoris sir youve never seen anything like it hed better be good i need that piece of shit brought to justice they stared off into the distance as the dust clouds settled there was no sign of the pirate but jun of the mdahz guard had already cleared the first street and was heading for a corner his quarrys path revealed by the trail of settling dust streets away and several minutes later samir puffed as he ran the guard that had decided to follow him was so damn fast he could have no experience of the rooftops while samir knew every nook and cranny and yet still the man gained on him it was astounding and more importantly it was putting samir under pressure he could illafford with guards rushing through the streets below and trying to keep level with their quarry shouting instructions across the intervening buildings and this houndlike man hot on his heels he had so far had precious little time to plan his route relying instead on instinct and his memories of old races this was no good without a plan he would just keep racing until he was caught or cornered hed assumed that once he was out on the rooftops hed be able to lose himself easily he needed to give his pursuers the slip and vanish but that meant dealing with the guard chasing him the problem was that he had nothing against the man indeed this dogged pursuer was the sort of man that in his youth samir had yearned to be that reminded him in many ways of uncle faraj he shook his head his life hung in the balance here as did ghassans liberty and the only opportunity he might ever get to curb asimas lust for power and that outweighed one guard no matter how innocent he might be with a fierce resolve flooding through him samir glanced left and right the roofgarden of the templehospital of belapraxis was only two jumps away and the most dangerous route hed ever planned passed by there time for a change of plan he couldnt outrun this man and he wouldnt have time to hide so he had to outthink and outmanoeuvre him veering off to his right samir made for the jutting outline of the temples upper level feeling a little bad for the poor man following him risking a quick glance over his shoulder he could see his pursuer in enough detail now that he could make out the determination on the mans face of course the mans career might well ride on this moment if not his life but that couldnt be samirs concern right now with another deep breath he made the last small jump to the temples main roof his nemesis close on his heels samir ducked out of sight around the wall surrounding the roof garden and made for the waterbearing pipe that crossed the street relief washed across him as he laid his eyes on the blessed escaperoute he hadnt had the time and leisure to contemplate the possibility that in the decades since hed run these roofs the pipe had been moved or replaced or had simply corroded and fallen away but it was there precarious as ever a single beam dusty and narrow crossed one of the widest streets he had ever used in his routes in the old days blanket ceilings in the street had created a possible safety net around fifteen feet below the beam but such was no longer the case as samir came to a halt at the roofs edge and bit his lip he could see three storeys down to the sloping cobbled street a few people milled about below unaware of the drama unfolding on the rooftops above them but as yet no guards had reached this point it wouldnt be long though given the shouted orders he could hear nearby at almost forty feet long the beam was a nightmare in unfinished ash worn smooth by the elements over the years and far from even the only grip provided anywhere along the distance was the iron clamps that held the searinghot metal guttering pipe that carried the water across the street and those could only be trodden quickly and lightly in passing for fear of burning the feet even through shoes asima used to call him mad for planning runs like this funny how everything samir had done in his life had seemed to contribute to his present liberty and health with a smile of gratitude he gave a brief nod of acknowledgement in the direction of the temple and holding his breath began to walk across the beam keeping his eyes carefully locked on the wooden surface stretching out before him he was concentrating hard and his first distraction came when he was almost a third of the way across as he heard the guard reach the end of the beam behind him and draw a deep breath without taking his eyes off the route ahead samir called out to his pursuer you should stop there i imagine that would suit you replied the man and samir was surprised and pleased to note a hint of wry humour to the voice you really are very good where did you learn to run so fast and jump so well he smiled his tongue stuck out of the corner of his mouth in concentration i used to run in the games pirate call me samir and you are getting tired of chasing you i will make it across and i will catch you if you stop at the other side ill make sure the captain goes easy on you though samir laughed twothirds of the way across now hed had a couple of moments where hed had to readjust his footing and his heart had skipped a beat but he was sure of his abilities knew himself and this beam very well im afraid i cant do that officer you see i have obligations to help people and i cant do it while your captain uses me to blunt his knuckles he laughed again gods i wish you were on my crew i could use a man like you im sure the same could be said the other way around but sadly things are what they are captain now whoa samir bit his cheek and stopped for a moment taking the dangerous opportunity to glance over his shoulder the guard had almost slipped and was wobbling back and forth regaining his balance that was close my friend i have no wish to see you shattered on the cobbles so do be careful thanks came the dry reply and the two men began to step forward again samir sighed he hated this with a passion but there was no choice he couldnt allow the guard to follow him beyond the beam there would be nowhere better than this to halt the pursuit he clenched his teeth as he stepped from the end of the beam onto the edge of the flat rooftop where the water channel continued to run in a narrow gutter and turned to face his pursuer the guard really was good and had made it almost three quarters of the way across this is my last offer turn round and go back officer i cant have you following me the guard shook his head you know i cant do that captain samir then i apologise for what i have to do now reaching down samir cupped his hands and collected a scoop of gritty dirty water swinging his arms forward and flinging the liquid across the beam with a splash the water covered the wood becoming slick and reflecting the tiny scudding fleecy clouds in the otherwise clear sapphire sky as the guard frowned and slowed reaching the edge of the slippery section samir bent and repeated the process twice more soaking the beam thoroughly turn round for gods sake you cant safely cross i wouldnt say i can turn round safely either get running i wont let a little water stop me for fucks sake turn round he grimaced as the guard took a step into the water shaking slightly and wobbling back and forth another step the man was managing to maintain his balance but there was a long way to go yet hed never make it samir shook his head sadly listen im not a bad man and i dont really want your death on my hands another step and suddenly a slight slip to one side left the man teetering samir watched with dismay as the man rocked back and forth picking up momentum he was about to go jump for the roof but before the man could get enough purchase he slipped samir watched for only a fraction of a second before leaping into action quite literally as the man slipped he did his best to push himself forward his flailing arm launching him out from the beam at an angle as he did so samir crouched grasped the iron clamp at the very end of the beam the searing heat here only slightly tempered by the water that flowed by and over it and the soaking he had just given it as he vaulted out over the open space feeling his shoulder jerk he clenched the hot iron tightly his other hand caught the falling man by the arm and the pair of them seemed to hang suspended in the air for an eternity before the pull to ground began to assert itself with agonising force the pair swung down against the wall samirs arm almost breaking where it held the clamp and carried the weight of two men below him the guard slipped from samirs wet grip and eyes wide grabbed desperately onto the pirates leg gripping tightly samir grunted the pain intense im going to try and pull myself up if you can find any purchase on the wall to take some weight it would be a great help the guard nodded vigorously and began to scour the plaster wall quickly there were pits here and there nothing that could be considered a handhold but with some effort he got his toes into one and pushed up samir felt a slight relief in the extraordinary weight of the big man below him gritting his teeth he swung his free arm up and grasped the really rather hot iron clamp with both hands groaning with the strain and tearing muscles painfully he slowly hauled the pair of them up to roof level after a minute that seemed like hours he managed to get his elbows over the edge and used his powerful shoulder muscles to haul himself the last stretch once his torso was flat on the roof his legs still hanging he shouted down to the unseen guard can you grab the edge of the roof now theres a very slight lip its not much but it should be enough if youre strong the man made an affirmative grunt and clinging to samirs leg with one arm began to search out a hold with the fingertips of his other samir watched with relief as the fingers gripped the edge and he felt a sudden release on his leg two hands now gripped the roof swinging his legs up and around samir climbed wearily to his feet and walked across to the dangling man are you alright ive been better but i could be a hell of a lot worse samir laughed im afraid i have to leave you now i hope you manage to climb but youll understand that i cant afford to hang around the guard looked up at him be assured that when i climb up ill be after you again but i think i may have twisted my leg in the fall so i might be a little slower now samir grinned down at him get drunk tonight officer i think you deserve it jun what thats my name jun ill remember that next time i get to the races samir laughed with a node he turned and ran off across the rooftops toward the palace complex in which asima seals a deal samir took another deep breath as he made the penultimate jump many times and many years ago hed sat on this slight incline and stared across the gap at the walled complex opposite hed always meant to walk those roofs but had never expected it to be under such circumstances from here the building that faced him was the residence of the local governor himself or at least it had been when they were children he had seen governor talus standing at the ornate windows several times in the past it was quite possible that the new governor had taken other quarters but the chances were against it these would be the best appointed of all the rooms in the complex so long ago he had spent time studying the complex and while hed never had the opportunity to put his observations to use now would seem to be the time there was only one possible route to the roofs of the complex it had made him too nervous as a child to even contemplate trying it but he was a great deal faster and stronger these days of course it was still lifethreatening and a ridiculous proposition even for a grown man but it was the only option if he wanted to get a step ahead once more he watched for several minutes there were figures moving around in the room but they staying deep in the room and never came close to the window one was tall and well dressed and samir was prepared to put money on that being the governor there were two or three other shapes that he could make out but they were too distant and shadowy to identify he couldnt even tell what gender they were still he had to try and that was the only window that seemed likely gritting his teeth he offered up a quick prayer to whichever of harishs faces was currently keeping an eye on him and crossed the roof to the small low pile of rubble in the corner it had been over twenty years of course rope didnt rot and iron didnt rust in the mdahz climate but it could easily have been found and moved fumbling in the dusty rubble he sighed with relief as his fingers closed on the curved iron moving a few of the heavier blocks aside he extricated the grapple that he had liberated from the docks more than two decades ago time had been kind to his little prize the grapple along with the thirty feet of thin cable coiled behind it had lain in secret all these years awaiting the day when samir plucked up the courage to actually execute his plan he frowned at the rope long ago hed selected this specific rope as being light enough when coiled to carry across the rooftops while long enough to cross the gap and strong enough to hold his weight now as an adult with a slightly more discerning eye he was beginning to doubt whether thirty feet would be quite enough and whether the thin rope would hold his adult weight turning he glanced over the low walled parapet there was less than thirty feet between him and the building but only just ah well carefully scanning the outer wall of the palace he took in every window within his target area none were occupied that he could see though people could easily be close by within the shadowed interiors the governor if that was who he was was occupied with his activity in the room of equal importance to him the street was empty below there would never be a better time there may indeed never be another opportunity at all crouching he located the heavy pitons that had been driven into the parapet long ago onto which a huge cover could be hooked to provide shade on the flat roof in the days when this building had been a more elegant residence nodding to himself he tied the end of the rope to the piton though not too tight standing he took a deep breath made sure the coiled rope was untangled took the iron grapple in hand and let the grapple slide slowly from his grasp until he gripped the rope around four feet from the metal starting small and slow he began to swing the grapple slowly picking up pace as the heavy object whirred past him ponderously gradually as the speed of the spinning item increased he let the rope slip out inch by inch years of boarding actions aboard the empress had trained him well finally when he judged the swing was right he clenched his teeth and let go uttering a small prayer under his breath as he watched the grapple arc out over the gap his heart skipped a beat as he watched it strike home against the wall opposite close to the governors window and then tumble toward the street grumbling samir hurriedly began to haul the rope back in after a nervous moment he had the grapple once more and squinted across the street no one had appeared at a window lucky coiling the rope once again he prepared for a second attempt at least his failure had ascertained that the rope was indeed long enough to reach again starting small he began to swing letting the speed build as he let the rope out slightly metal thrumming past his ear he reached the optimal moment and released watching with trepidation the aim was true this time though and the grapple disappeared into the opening of the window to the left of the governors tense samir ducked behind the low parapet and watched for almost a minute there was no sign of activity and slowly he released the breath he hadnt realised he was holding reaching down he untied the end of the rope from the piton and began to pull slowly the rope came in by almost three feet and then jammed tight just to be sure he hauled on it a few times it was solidly fastened and he nodded approvingly as he tied it once more much tighter this time here goes he said quietly to himself as he made a last check of the facade opposite the complexs outer wall presenting an aperturefree surface for fifteen feet with the palace windows above surmounted by a gabled roof in the old days it was that roof that had fascinated him not so now gripping the rope he slowly lowered himself over the parapet wincing the rope held so far offering up his third prayer of the hour an activity he had long foregone he began carefully and smoothly to cross the gap hand over hand along the thin rope his lower lip between his teeth as he went there was an alarming moment almost half way across when the rope gave just a little perhaps a foot possibly the grapple had attached itself to something badlysecured in the room samir shifted a little from his slow and careful technique picking up speed to cross as fast as he could the fall from here may not kill him but if not it would seriously injure him and almost certainly lead to a life of imprisonment or a death sentence the notion of swinging bulgeeyed before the public at the port as a warning to wouldbe pirates spurred in him an extra turn of speed and he crossed the remaining length of rope at an almost dangerously unsafe speed finally blessedly he reached the window and slowly pulled himself up to the lintel to look inside the room was empty and while reasonably decorative devoid of furniture some kind of antechamber it seemed glancing left he smiled the wall here was decorative and the rows of bondingtile jutted slightly making a handy ledge for both fingers and toes holding his breath he shuffled along edging ever closer to the window of the next room over the general background noise of mdahz he could hear voices in the next room concentrating as he shuffled slowly closer he tried to block out the ambient sound and pay attention to the activity in the room one of the voices was female and he would be willing to bet that it was asima particularly given the dark and unpleasant tone of the mans voice asima seemed to have that effect on people these days hurrying as much as he could samir closed on the window and finally as he reached it grasped the lintel with his fingers and drew himself close enough to peer over the edge there were four people in the room the governor was clear a tall man with a sour face dressed in neat and expensive clothes the other two men were clearly a senior officer in the town guard and some sort of advisor the last of course asima he was momentarily disheartened to see that he was too late the woman was leaving as he watched she nodded to the governor and turning walked from the room samir wondered momentarily whether he should give this up now and move onto the next step but shook his head slightly this was important he had to know what shed done as the door closed with a click the other two men approached the governors desk and he sat back heavily what do you think gentlemen shes telling the truth as far as we can confirm ghassan is in custody and is being taken to the tower now awaiting your decision samir is definitely somewhere in mdahz but the men lost track of him on the rooftops all the gates are being watched as is the port his ships been taken and is under guard and a part of his crew are being detained in the guard station at the docks whatever samir plans he cant escape and we have his ship the governor nodded and samir mentally urged them on in the silence that followed how far had she gone and what had they granted her do we stop her at the gate or are you really intending to let her go excellency the governor shrugged shes pelasias problem now her information is well worth the fee she asked and the issue prince ashar will raise with me the important thing now is to find captain samir and drag out of him the location of this compass thing then we can put an end to lassos and the pirate threat ashar will forgive a great deal for that the pirates prey on his ships too samir heaved a sigh of relief grateful that hed not overestimated her perhaps we could start hanging his men until he shows up the aide offered hopefully he was greeted with a cold stare from the governor coro we are civilised people the crew will get a trial and if they are to be hanged it will be with the knowledge that it is for the good of the people and not out of anger revenge or deceit samir cannot stay here forever sooner or later he will make a move and we will catch him likely it will involve his brother his men or his ship so have the guard pay a great deal of attention in the next few days i want samir nodding with satisfaction samir glanced around this trip had served a second purpose that hed also hoped for he now knew what the governor looked like and what sort of man he was and he appeared to be a reasonable man which would be very useful shortly when the time came to take the next step smiling he noted that a couple of ladies were standing chatting thirty feet below him he contemplated just dropping from here but a broken leg would seriously ruin his plans instead he lowered himself slowly and carefully down the wall below the window using the small hand and footholds he could find until he reached the bare surface of the defensive perimeter wall with a smile he let go and fell the last fifteen feet landing lightly with bent knees the two women turned in surprise and stared at the strange visitor that had appeared from nowhere ladies samir addressed them touching his forehead respectfully and with a smile before turning and running off into the city in which castles crumble the harbours military quartermaster glared at the guard as the first light of the sun crested the horizon and picked out the decoration on the tip of the buildings roof how the hell do you misplace stock like that the soldier winced hed been on guard all night from sundown til sunrise it had been excruciatingly dull and it was understood among the naval guards stationed in mdahzs port that nothing ever really happened and it was almost expected of one to drop off to sleep for a while so that you were fresh so to speak it just had to be the unluckiest day of his life for him to doze off without locking the door to the ammunition store and he could hardly own up to that last part else hed be swinging in the wind by the end of the day i just cant account for it sir when i did the predawn check this morning there were three items missing i cant vouch for the evening check coz it was before i came on duty so maybe the previous count was wrong the officer narrowed his eyes if i find out that you sold stock to supplement your dice habit i will skin you and wear you like a cloak do you understand sir i didnt do nothing then where the hell did three firepots half the size of a grown man the quartermasters voice tailed off as the air thrummed to the sound of an explosion so powerful that the very wall vibrated where he leaned on it samirs head rose from the rock behind which he had sheltered his eyes wide this of course was why all good warships had very careful and welltrained artillery masters novices playing around with liquid fire pots was clearly a bad idea hed stolen them from the armoury in the port in the middle of the night with considerably more ease than hed expected given the laxness of the guards an hours journey through the dark streets had been unobserved as the cart rattled up the slope toward the west with its heavy load of explosive pots the donkey and cart had managed the slope well bringing samir and his ammunition within ten yards of the wall manhandling the heavy earthenware pots however each more than two feet in diameter and packed with deadly combustible material from the cart to the tower was a whole different matter hed originally intended to perform his miracle breakout in middle of the night but had seriously underestimated the time it would take to get the three great pots up to the base of the tower on the other hand he was forced to admit as he watched chunks of stone rain down over the port and splash into the sea he may had overestimated the quantity of explosives he needed just a tad his head ringing like the inside of a bell and his ears making a horrible whining noise samir peered into the smoke and dust to assess the damage he had assumed that if he placed the pots far enough apart they would detonate in a chain as per his fuses what he hadnt counted on was that the force of the first blast was enough to detonate the other two instantly consequently the explosion that was supposed to be contained and sensible and to produce a hole in the towers lower wall large enough to climb through had in fact obliterated a portion of the foundations on the eastern side and blown much of the lower wall on that side out and over the bay and the port district the exact damage was hard to assess given the huge cloud of grey dust and the falling fragments his breath caught as he realised that there was more than a vague possibility that his reckless actions had actually killed ghassan and others along with him probably not though from what his sources had told him last night the lower levels were mostly given over to storage the prisoners being kept in cells at the centre of the tower where there were no windows it was possible that hed caught one or more guards in the blast but he was hopeful that wasnt the case the night shift of guards was a skeleton staff and they would mostly be on patrol at the top samir shook his head his ears still throbbing and whining it was no good panicking about it now taking a deep breath he tied a scarf around his lower face for protection against the dust and left his shelter as the last of the debris rolled down the slope from the ruined wall while he climbed the scree as fast as he could manage taking care to avoid the chunks of masonry that were still sliding down toward the town below he peered blinking through the grey cloud and picked out as much detail as he could relief flooded over him as he closed on the structure and the cloud began to dissipate the damage was not as bad as hed initially believed the tower was still structurally sound the hole that had produced so much falling rubble was perhaps fifteen feet in each direction it revealed the lowest floor and a little of the one above and had done considerable damage to the interior walls on this side but not enough to penetrate higher into the tower unless anyone happened to be in the ruined lower storeroom or the outer chambers of the next floor up they would be fine they may spend the rest of their life with whistling ears if samirs were anything to go by but that could hardly be helped reaching the bottom of the tower samir gingerly pulled at the edge of the aperture stone fell away under his grip but the core was sound taking another deep breath he clambered across the ruinous threshold and into the storeroom stopping for a moment to get his bearings he tried to superimpose the mental map he had constructed from the information hed gathered last night over the building around him nodding he calculated both the quickest and the safest route to the prison area on the third level and weighed them for a moment before shrugging and deciding on speed over safety it wouldnt even be the first stupid thing hed done this morning he grinned gritting his teeth he grasped the ruined wall and began to climb the mangled stonework toward the open floor above the climb was difficult and dangerous as illustrated amply by the amount of stonework that came away in his hands and skittered off down the slope still samir was lithe and determined and in a little more than a minute he stepped gingerly onto the flagged floor of the second level there was an ominous creak as he put his weight down and he quickly hurried away from the ruined edge and toward the middle of the tower the town walls and their towers were mostly of pelasian construction and relatively recent given that the original walls of mdahz were already ruinous when maahd invaded and had to be rebuilt for his new conquest the pelasians loved symmetry in everything they did and so the huge drum tower that marked the northwestern end of the town walls was five floors in height and organised like the spokes of a wheel a central spiral stairwell opened on each floor into a circular inner corridor with rooms off it at intervals however passageways led between the rooms to another outer corridor that circled at the edge and from which doors led inward to more rooms slowly and he hoped quietly samir drew his sword listening at the door was a waste of time in the circumstances and steadying himself he flung the door open and jumped inside the stair well had escaped the blast even at the lower levels and fresh clean air blew down from above there was no sign of movement and samir began to leap up the stairs two at a time the next levels door stood open and samir approached with caution ducking his head round the door he quickly drew himself back but not before having noted in the flash of an eye what lay beyond this was most definitely the prison level the doors leading off the inner corridor were heavy and iron banded each with a grille at face height and a locking bar across the outside all lit only by oil lamps burning on ledges at intervals in the corridor the guard hed seen just inside the door had worn an expression of utter confusion and shock his helmet lay on the floor alongside his sword while he stood with his head at an angle poking at his ear with a gloved finger samir smiled harish was working hard to help him today without delay the pirate captain strode into the circular corridor stepped up behind the guard raised his sword above the man and brought the pommel down hard on his skull there was a crack and a groan and the man sank to the floor his eyes rolling up into his head for a moment samir considered shouting out ghassans name in an effort to identify which cell he needed but the futility of that struck him immediately there was no hope of anyone hearing anything in here his own hearing had gone and hed been outside the tower in the open air let alone trapped inside with the explosion ringing echoes around the hall instead he ran to the nearest door and peered into the grille speed was now of the essence as soon as the town guard realised what had just happened this place would be flooded with uniforms and he had to get ghassan out of the tower before then the first cell appeared to be empty despite his urgency samir spent a moment casting his eyes left and right to be sure there was no figure lurking in the darkness his vision largely impeded by the low dancing light the shadow cast by his own body and the dim conditions within shaking his head he moved on to the next door careful peering around within revealed finally a thin old man hunched over by the far wall this was ridiculous he could search for half an hour and still not find his brother samir stopped and scratched his head as he pondered a moment passed as the whining in his ear continued to insist on his thoughts and then he slapped his forehead in irritation at his own shortsightedness the solution was simple returning to the first door with a determined expression samir drew back the locking bar and threw the door open lets give them a crowd of escaped criminals to keep them busy he said to himself as he rushed to the old mans cell grinning and slid the bar swinging open the portal on he rushed from cell to cell throwing back bars and opening doors taking only the briefest glimpse within as he did so behind him prisoners emerged blinking into the lamp light some clearly having spent years inside others more recent additions to the captive population he was so surprised when ghassan appeared at one of the doors and reached out to him that he was already moving on to the next door he stopped turning and grinned at his brother the taller sibling was dirty but had not been mistreated his leg wound now tended and bound along with the bite wound on his hand ghassan grasped him by the forearms and said something his lips moving rapidly excitement clear on his face samir shrugged and pointed to his ears ghassan laughed and mimicked the gesture before pointing at the stairwell the smaller brother nodded and leaving the half dozen confused prisoners milling about in the hallway samir led ghassan back round the curved wall to the door as the pair dashed out into the cool stairwell slowed only a little by the taller brothers limp ghassan initially turned upwards there having been no exit at the lower levels prior to the explosion samir grasped him by the wrist pointing at shadows cast on the wall though neither of them could hear a thing the shade puppets moving against the torchlight from above clearly announced the approach of the towers guards from the higher levels the two men moved down the stairs to the next level as fast as they could samir had considered leaving the stairs on the ground floor but the destruction of the stores contents would make it slow and difficult to pick their way out ghassan blinked in astonishment as they reached the lower level and stepped out into the light admitted by the enormous gaping hole in the outer wall the taller brother frowned pointed at the huge opening and then at samir a question in his expression samir grinned and nodded as he beckoned and ran over to the edge once again the floor creaked alarmingly as the pair approached the hole and he slowed as he reached the drop ghassans wounds seemed hardly to hamper his movement at all as the pair made light work of climbing out onto the ruined wall and down to ground level the taller brother slipping only once as his bad leg gave way as they alighted on the scree he mimed a question over their next move to samir the smaller brother beckoned once again and led his sibling over to a small knot of scrub bushes there was no hope of the two men escaping down the scree without being spotted and guards from the port area would even now be approaching the bottom of the slope there was nowhere they could safely go and nowhere to hide but samir had counted on this being the case as he and ghassan disappeared into the cover of the greenery he reached down to a small bag hidden under leaves and withdrew two neatly folded guard tunics and cloaks helmets chainmail and gloves sat ready next to the bag ghassan grinned and quickly began to don his uniform as his brother did the same no matter what the rest of the day might hold even amid a hundred enemies and with a horrible whistling in his ears it was good to be working with samir his smaller brother was a force of nature and it seemed there was just no stopping him ghassan couldnt help but smile in which brothers escape the brothers looked at one another took a deep breath and strode out from behind the ruined wall of the tower where they had been lurking as they watched the guards approaching up the scree bank ghassan kept his head slightly lowered shaking it as if to clear his hearing in fact his hearing was returning slowly he could make out noise from the men as they climbed samir strode boldly out next to him squaring his shoulders harish watch over me now ghassan smiled at his brother not entirely sure of what hed just said but aware of the feeling behind it from the tenseness in samirs expression you one of the unit of town guard climbing the slope and wearing a commanders uniform pointed at the pair of them as he reached the top and came to a halt before them what the hell happened here ghassan furrowed his brow and pointed to his ears samir caught the gesture out of the corner of his eye and took the lead someone blew up the tower he shouted in an exaggerated fashion lower your voice replied the commander grimacing at him what sir the commander turned to a lesser officer next to him these two need to see a medic about their hearing they must have been too close to the blast have someone help them back down the junior nodded and waved at the brothers pointing down the slope cavis help these two back to the barracks and get the company medic to check their ears a young guard saluted and ran forward to the two dusty men he opened his mouth to speak and then shut it and shook his head instead gesturing down the slope with his thumb samir nodded and began to move slowly and carefully down the gravelly slope trying not to slide and lose his footing as they followed the young soldier moments passed as they moved ever closer to the town and further away from the unit of guards somewhere around halfway down the slope samir risked a look about him to check the situation the guards had converged with three other units coming up the slope and along the wall any minute now the real problem would become apparent to them and then the fugitive pair would become very highly soughtafter the young guard cavis was several yards ahead of them frowning he leaned across to ghassan as they picked their way down slowing slightly in order to increase the distance between them and their escort quietly he cupped his hand around his mouth and leaned into his brothers ear is your hearing returning yet he said quietly ghassan nodded its a bit whiney and theres a constant whistle but i can hear you if i concentrate samir smiled mines better but then i wasnt trapped with the blast turning back he studied the young soldier theyd said nothing untoward yet but the guard wasnt listening anyway concentrating on his footing on the treacherous slope any minute now theyre going to discover that youve gone and questions will be raised as soon as they know that all the guards are still accounted for up there every uniform in mdahz will be searching for us so we need to get out of sight as quick as possible ghassan nodded well have to deal with cavis over there yes and now really ghassan nodded and shrugged nothing we can do til we reach the bottom though too open here to be busy beating up a guard you can be seen from every direction anyway were in a hurry leave him to me i have an idea samir nodded frowning and almost called out when ghassan grinning threw himself into a forward roll bouncing down the slope and plummeting past the guard the smaller brother smiled as his sibling tightly clutched his head protecting himself from serious damage and ended sliding down the last part of the slope and coming to rest on his back near a low wall at the rear of a house carefully located out of sight of almost everywhere cavis squawked in alarm and ran off precariously down the slope after his charge dropping to a crouch at the bottom and hovering over ghassan examining him closely the young man realised at such close quarters that this tall swarthy man had longish curly locks was badly shaven and smelled stale most unlike one of the town guard hey samir watched with interest as his brother burst into activity reaching up to the young guard above him one hand went over the mouth preventing any cry for help while the other reached round and clamped on the side of the guards neck as the young mans arms flailed ghassan rolled over pinning his victim beneath him while he maintained his hold as samir slithered down the last of the slope his brow furrowed ghassan was pressing into the young mans neck in a very precise manner and holding him tight now as he struggled cavis eyes widened a moment and slowly he went limp until he sagged beneath his assailant sighing ghassan rolled away from the boy patted him on the cheek in a friendly fashion and stood tenderly touching a few grazes from his controlled fall youve picked up some interesting tricks samir noted as the brothers gave cavis a last glance to make sure his chest was rising and falling safely before disappearing around the wall and into an alley just as they vanished from sight the warning blast rang out from the tower above and the top of the slope blossomed with sudden activity ghassan shrugged as they strode along the narrow alley one of my old marine sergeants used to fight in the pits in rilva he knew all sorts of fascinating things most of them are deadly but this one just renders someone unconscious for a while samir nodded impressed so what now ghassan asked i presume youve planned beyond this since were both wanted men trapped in mdahz with no way out ive the bare bones of a plan sadly i need you to put a bit of meat on them he stopped and turned to ghassan you see i need to go take care of something so im going to have to leave it in your capable hands ghassan frowned last time you did that i left to join the army and you abandoned me and became a criminal the smaller man laughed and grasped his siblings shoulder ah but now were both criminals my brother the problem is that i have a much grander plan than you could know but the timing is running very tight and i need to go now or ill miss my opportunity i will be back for you or rather i hope youll be back for me ghassan frowned alright whats your plan then theres a tavern in the docks called the laughing mermaid remember it yes only around a small portion of my crew will have been on board the empress when they impounded her the rest i told to go ashore realising that asima was going to turn us in the ones who stayed behind volunteered to maintain the fiction that the ship was occupied samir squared his shoulders im sorry to land you with the big job but theres no one else i could trust to do it you need to go find my crew and gather them together then get them to help you break the rest of the men out of the stockade in the port they may have volunteered but that doesnt mean we should leave them to rot ghassan whistled through his teeth good grief and then youll join us not exactly then comes the hard bit youll have to lead my crew down to the secure dock take on the town guard and cut out the empress and get safely away out to sea thats going to be the tough bit particularly since i presume youll try to do it with the minimum possible casualties thats a tall order samir im not convinced we could achieve that together let alone me on my own yes you can ghassan when you meet at the mermaid speak to my first officer a man called ursa and make sure he still has my bag theres something in there we cant afford to lose anything else ghassan asked in exasperation just this once youre out of port and safe head for pelasian waters right on the border about six miles away is a coastal village called khediv anchor offshore and wait for me there ill be with you as soon as i can ghassan narrowed his eyes dont you think it might be handy for me to have at least a clue as to your plan what are you up to samir the smaller brother laughed and scratched his head just saving the world ghassan can you do all this and meet me at khediv the taller man brushed his errant curl from his forehead and nodded ill manage somehow so long as your crew dont try to kill me on sight i cant imagine im their favourite person youd be surprised ghassan speak to ursa go safe and be lucky and ill see you hopefully tomorrow morning his brother furrowed his brow once again and then shrugged and sighed alright get going on your mysterious errand and well see you at the border he watched with a mixed sense of gratitude and worry as samir ran off through the tangled streets up the slope of mdahz removing his guard uniform and discarding it as he ran it would be awful to have finally reconciled his differences with samir only to lose him once again the little devil was too secretive and devious for his own good sometimes with a smile ghassan turned and made for the port at a quick walk removing the guard cloak and tunic as he went as he descended the widening street toward the port he was relieved to note that the gate remained wide open as usual although now rather than being guarded by two bored men half a dozen soldiers stood alert eyeing up everyone who entered or left the port presumably they were mostly on the lookout for samir they wouldnt know of ghassans escape yet and probably didnt have his description still it was better to be safe than sorry ducking into a shadowed alleyway that hadnt yet been graced with the dawn light ghassan looked up and down the street it was still early and there were few enough people around that he would be observed as he entered the port just enough that he might raise questions his attire condition and grazes might attract just too much attention with a smile he turned and jogged down the dark passage sure enough it met another tiny alley too narrow for animals or vehicles clean washing hung on lines at the rear of residences if he remembered this area correctly yes there it was the rear entrance of the stables that fronted onto khaz gharda street and just inside the gate stood a huge stone trough half full of water later it would be filled for the horses grinning ghassan pulled himself easily up and over the low wall grunting at the pain in his leg as he dropped to the stone within removing the chain mail and gloves along with his tunic breeches and boots he dropped them one after the other onto the floor beside the trough until he was standing naked he grinned that would give the stable master a shock if he came out now as quickly as he could he climbed into the trough immersing himself in the cold water that had chilled overnight and was yet to see warming sunlight there was barely enough water to cover him but ignoring the goosebumps that rose on his skin he quickly washed himself down as best he could to remove the odour of the jail cell and sweat and plastered his unruly hair back down to his scalp shivering he climbed back out into the early sunlight paused for a moment as he decided what to do with his armour and finally shrugging left it where it lay and climbed naked over the wall and back into the narrow alley minutes later he was in the back yard of a house selecting unremarkable garments of an average quality and dressing as speedily as he could by the time he returned to the main road there were noticeably more people about with a frown he perused the population the best way yes there was his ticket into the port unmolested down the street came a teamster with a cartload of bags and sacks partially covered with a thick blanket the donkey pulling the cart rolled its eyes in a bad tempered fashion and snorted ghassan chuckled i know how you feel waiting for just the right moment he walked out of the alleyway just as the cart rolled past and ambled quietly along on the opposite side of the street keeping pace with the carter slowly they rolled on toward the port and after a few tense minutes ghassan let the carter pull slightly ahead as the donkey reached the gate guards stepped across to block passage the man reined his beast in and the wheels rolled slowly to a halt while the soldiers on duty began to go through the carts load prodding with the buts of their spears keeping his expression carefully neutral ghassan walked calmly on past the activity and through the open archway into the port district with only the most cursory of glances from one of the free guards he smiled being totally unremarkable was always the best way to remain unnoticed now to find the laughing mermaid in which ghassan instils order the tavern was noisy smelly and absolutely full of life exactly as ghassan remembered it from the many times he had passed by during his youth as well as the more recent occasions when the wind of god was docked here however despite his familiarity with the building he had never before set foot inside it the interior was murky reeking of the root cultivated by the desert nomads that was burned and smoked in clay pipes mixed with the smell of sweat and that curious salty odour that only a lifetime sailor could cultivate squinting ghassan cast his gaze left and right the tavern population seemed to polarise with certain types gathering in small groups there were several likelylooking groups that could represent the crew of the empress and for a moment the fugitive officer chided himself for not asking more detail of his brother through the crowds as he clicked his tongue irritably he spotted a heavyset man with a design of whorls and spines tattooed across his scalp smiling he realised that was probably why samir had directed him to the first officer ghassan remembered that scalp from his brief time on board ursa was rather hard to miss taking a deep breath the tall man straightened and strode across the room coming to a halt before the group who were spread across four tables at one end of the room he almost laughed when the whole bunch fell silent to a man as he approached them it was like something from an old comedy tale ursa yes im sure i remember you the big man turned an angry face on him and his eyes flashed dangerously only if youd like me to shout out your name captain ghassan nodded agreed indiscreet of me my apologies im here at the request of my brother ursa nodded he warned me youre to help us cut out the empress and meet him later yes but more than that ghassan said gesturing at a chair and raising his eyebrow the big first officer nodded and as they sat ghassan noted with a mix of humour and discomfort the unpleasant looks many of the pirates were directing at him he couldnt entirely blame them of course he had been their most ardent adversary for many years and were the roles reversed he might well have tried to kill them by now my brother is unwilling to leave even a part of his crew and i tend to agree were to free your shipmates and then take the ship but before we make any sort of move i need to be sure that youre with me and i have a feeling some of you are struggling with that ursa shrugged youre no ones favourite here cant say as id have time for you myself if it werent for the law having been laid down by the boss he threatened to gut anyone who laid a finger on you most of the lads would never dream of disobeying the capn but there might be the odd man who thinks it would be worth it just to watch you bleed out ghassan nodded and turned to smile at the other men who were still glowering at him anyone here have an issue with taking orders from me in your captains absence there was a tight silence though the level of apprehension around the table increased noticeably let me put it another way i release every man here from their oath to my brother i cant do anything with a crew that are only with me because theyve been told to be so given that youre all free to knife me with ursa as a witness to my promise who wants a go smiling he pushed his seat back from the table remaining firmly in it there was an uncomfortable pause as two men opposite him looked at one another and shuffled in their seat the threat of displeasing samir apparently still held them back he smiled no one at all ursa next to him leaned close for a moment dont do this sir the capn will kill me if i let the men hurt you ghassan smiled and nodded ill take my chances ursa you take yours noting the man opposite who was almost out of his seat his knuckles whitening on the seat arms with strain ghassan sized him up these men were brutal and dangerous but they would be honourable at some level or samir wouldnt have them it would be a shame to hurt them but an example was worth a thousand speeches well he took a preparatory breath as the man launched himself from the seat pushing the table out of the way as he rose ghassan continued to sit and smile stepping closer the man clenched his fists and leapt in ghassan having apparently goaded the biggest of the opposition and therefore most likely the slowest waited until the first swing came lunging forward out of his chair he rose immediately in front of his target so close he was already inside the mans swinging arm ducking his head as he rose he jabbed out with both hands his left formed into a shape resembling a dogs paw jabbed hard into the inner elbow of the swinging limb his aim accurate simultaneously his other hand homed in on the mans free arm which was reaching toward the sheathed dagger at his waist ghassans thumb and forefinger shaped into a pincer he grasped the mans wrist on the inside just up from the heel of the hand and squeezed hard as the man stumbled forward blinking his right arm dead from the elbow down and his left hand frozen in a claw of pain ghassan sighed and stepped back ive always accorded myself a man of principle and honour and as such i need everyone here to be completely open with me and ill extend you the same courtesy he smiled as he gently pushed his assailant back upright this man was going for his knife with the plain intent to kill at least hes let me know where he stands with this or rather where he falls still smiling warmly he took a single step forward to stand inches from the nose of the stunned attacker who was staring at his own lifeless hands in astonishment tilting his head to one side ghassan reached out and tapped the man in the temple with his forefinger with a sigh the large pirate folded his eyes rolling upwards as he collapsed to the floor see ghassan said stepping back away from the shuddering heap i dont really want to hurt any of you but im going to need every man tonight and i cant have anyone with me who isnt totally committed to the goal anyone else have any issue he held his smile as he looked around the assembled stunned faces ursa blinked at him how the hell did you do that ghassan turned to him im a man of hidden talents ursa now shall we get on with this with a nod the heavyset tattooed man sank into his seat and pulled it up to the table ghassan nodded to himself and returned to his own seat pulling it forward next to the unconscious form of his victim and leaning with his elbows on the table conspiratorially ive no idea what your captains grand plan is but i am with him now entirely my duty is done and i am committed to helping get your crew and your ship out i dont want to have to perform any more demonstrations so if anyone is still unsure leave the tavern now he waited for a moment there was silence and a great number of meaningful looks were exchanged but nobody stood good this is going to be hard enough if were all reading from the same scroll if you get my drift now are we safe enough to talk here so long as we keep our voices down ursa nodded lot of friends of the empress here sir so no problem as long as youre quiet good the way i see it weve two distinct goals here and they each have their problems firstly weve got to get your shipmates out of the stockade and secondly weve got to get on board the empress and get her underway before anyone raises the alarm the man across the table next to the recently vacated seat who had clearly been verging on attacking ghassan himself leaned back his brow furrowed ive been in that stockade drunk and detained theres no easy way in or out theres a compound with three huts for the port guard guard house armament store and bunk house the compounds walled and patrolled with only one gate the stockade is inside that and has its own permanent guard im not even going to go into how hard itll be to get the empress out ursa nodded i helped the capn get the big liquid fire pots from the store but that was easy the ammunition store backs onto the perimeter wall the stockades inside though much more difficult ghassan frowned there are only eight guards in the compound at night on a normal night given the current situation with them looking for myself and my brother i would expect them to double the guard and theyll be more alert than usual so were looking at perhaps sixteen guards he raised an eyebrow you say you got into the armament store yes ursa replied shrugging it backs onto the outer wall the capn and i went over the wall onto the roof of the place and just took some of the tiles away and climbed in that was easy coz the man on the door was asleep tonightll be different though they wont be asleep therell be more of them and youll need to get past that and across the compound ghassan grinned i think i have an idea how we can do this in fact if ive got this worked out right itll help with getting the empress away too the crew collectively frowned but they were used to such tightlipped confidence from their own captain so this was nothing new i give you my word ghassan said his face straight and my word is not given lightly that i am in allegiance with my brother and i intend to do everything i can to get the empress and her crew out of mdahz do i have your word that you wont make stupid attempts to knife me in the back as soon as i turn it there was a general murmur of assent though ghassan would have liked a little more vehemence about it ursa leaned on the table and gestured at him with a finger were all honest men capn or at least as honest as ever trod on lassos the boss carefully chose every man here over years shipping out crewmen he didnt trust or that didnt have the right sort of character for him ifn you know what i mean youll have no trouble from us but every man here me included wants to know why youre doing this you being a naval man and all ghassan raised his brow and nodded slowly thats a fair question firstly i am not turning against my former comrades that would be unthinkable consequently i will not attack a naval ship or crewman without just cause he sat back heavily but i know my brother he is not a bloodthirsty maniac and despite appearances he is as noble and honourable as i he has some grand plan that hes not shared with any of us yet but ive seen for decades how his mind works and hes cleverer than any of us the frowning man beside the empty chair narrowed his eyes thats half an answer youve spent years hunting your brother down and now you want to join him theres got to be more to it than that ghassan nodded truly i wouldnt be here by pure choice unfortunately when the woman responsible for all of this sold your captain out to the governor she also blackened my name and made me a traitor in the eyes of my superiors had i stayed in the tower i would be dead within the week my brother offered me the chance to free myself and clear my name the other pirate laughed strange directions the fates take you captain when you have to join pirates to clear your name ghassan laughed strange indeed but nothing that involves my brother is ever what it seems at first to be come on lets wake your friend here and get to serious planning in which ghassans scheme goes into action ghassan raised an eyebrow questioningly in the shadow of the wall salright capn i can manage nodding at ursa ghassan turned away from the first officer and his three companions and crept along the edge of the building until he rounded the corner to join the rest of the crew once more disappearing from sight ursa heaved a sigh though he wasnt sure that it was one of relief it was entirely possible that this brother was crazier than their own captain however the big man had to admit there was enough innovation and general brilliance about the mans thinking that it was not hard to see how the wind of god had been such a hazard to them over the years ghassan and samir were certainly of a kind stretching he gestured to the men with him to pay attention to their surroundings was he equally insane to agree to such a dangerous mission with so few men he almost laughed out loud returning to his tense waiting he cast his eyes round at his companions once more hidden within the shadow cast by the lshaped exterior of one of the ports many warehouses the four pirates crouched hidden and watching the complex opposite intently the only positive thing that ursa could really say about the plan was that they would be unlikely to bump into folk here this area was a long way from the taverns and populated areas here the guards compound stood out starkly among jumbled clusters of warehouses and few people would tread at night the legitimate folk of mdahz having no reason to be here and the less savoury staying a good distance from the centre of the town guards control funny really how the presence of the law was the thing that kept the streets empty enough for the criminals and fugitives to move around safely and unobserved ursa grinned two decades ago as a young man hed been part of the mdahz militia based in this very port and in those days the buildings across the road and their perimeter wall had been his home then had come the empires collapse and ursa like so many others had been driven to piracy to sustain himself having served as an oarsman and then commander of a boarding party on the gorgons revenge hed come to the dark empress under captain khmun as a solid officer with a good reputation there after years of sliding into the depravity that went with the life of a resident of lassos he had begun to reclaim both his selfrespect and his sense of right under the man that he had considered the best captain the sea had to offer until samir what khmun had begun by instilling a sense of honour and mercy into his crew samir had completed by systematically weeding out those who he considered unfit for his crew it was almost laughable to ursa that he would take the word and honour of any man on board the empress before that of the legitimate navy and yet it was this that kept him loyally with samir since imperial power had been reinstated in the sea of storms the activities of most of the captains of lassos had become more and more brutal in the constant struggle to stay ahead of the increasingly powerful navy and yet the empress had in this time somehow maintained her reputation while actually reducing their activity likely most of the pirates even of his own crew had been oblivious to this but ursa was an old hand and he noticed how his captain was going out of his way to improve their reputation among the ordinary folk and to draw ever further from the twisted authorities in lassos something was afoot samirs plan was continually picking up pace ursa could feel it happening without being able to identify any specific move in the game the young captain was so damn subtle it was hard just working out what hed already done let alone what he was going to do the first bell of the midnight watch rang out clang steady lads clang and now their former nemesis was with them professing loyalty and deeply involved in samirs plan without knowing himself what he was working toward clang yet there was no accident to this ursa was sure if ghassan was with them now it had been in samirs mind for a long time and was yet another thread woven into the plot clang and it had to be said that this man for all his history of mindless subservience to the navy seemed to have a similar mind to his brother amazing really should these brothers truly work together there would be little they couldnt achieve clang ursa frowned how many was that damn it he must stop getting sidetracked nodding he put thoughts of his two commanders and their relationship aside and concentrated clang that must be the sixth yes the sixth clang ready lads he whispered know where youre all going clang there was a low murmur of affirmative noises clang good ursa tensed clang ready clang go as the last bell tolled the four men hurtled out of the shadows like cockroaches in sudden light the perimeter wall of the compound was thick and solid and around eight feet high but not wide enough for a walkway broken sherds of pot had been cemented into the top to prevent easy access and the guards patrolled around the inside edge every few minutes ursa and his companion made straight across from the shadows and to the wall opposite behind which he could just make out the apex of the tile roof the other two men veered off to the right heading toward their second phase as the big man reached the wall counting slowly under his breath in order to keep the perfect timing this would need he crouched and cradled his hands the second man reached him put his foot in that huge grip and launched himself up and onto the wall the heavy leather bracers he wore on his forearms were a last minute idea but proved invaluable as he landed on the sharp pottery tips and struggled quietly across onto the roof turning he threw the heavy blanket from his shoulder over the sherds and reached down quickly hauling the heavy first officer up after him ursa tipped over onto the roof as quietly as he could from here they could see the entire compound and therefore could be seen from it however the guard changed at midnight and the two men now on patrol were at the far side hidden from this angle by both the bunk house and the stockade they would have little more than a minute before the two guards emerged from either end of the buildings heading round the periphery to converge on this spot before crossing paths and continuing on their way there would be a man at the door to the shed but he would be looking out the other way across the compound and should remain unaware of their presence given the crackling of the brazier next to which he stood so long as they were quiet enough the first officer familiar with the layout of the ammunition shed from the previous night gestured to the man with him and the two began to hurriedly lift the tiles from the roof placing them quietly nearby as the covering gradually disappeared and a hole formed the room below obscured only partially by the supporting beams ursa pointed down and grinned directly below them wooden shelves contained small pots of liquid fire for use as grenades in ship to ship combat the two men smiled and nodded at one another reaching into their jackets with a deep breath they withdrew two ceramic flasks each marked with the strange language of the northern barbarians it broke ursas heart to discard such rare and expensive liquor this way but when needs must with a deep breath the two men uncorked the flasks and liberally emptied their contents through the hole onto the pots below and the straw and wood shelving beneath them as the last few drops fell and they carefully placed the flasks on the roof ursa clenched his teeth and removed the bundle of sticks and wadding from his jacket retrieving flint and steel he began to strike as quietly as he could praying devoutly until the showing sparks finally caught on the bundle timing was getting too tight for comfort with a deeper breath he dropped the flaming mass into the hole and the two men slid down the tiles and off the edge they dropped the eight feet from the roof onto the soft gravel with a crunch that was altogether too loud for ursas liking here the two men stood hunched into the corner formed by the meeting of the perimeter wall with the ammunition shed the main light within this area of the compound the brazier in front of this very building cast a deep shadow here and the two men held their breath across the compound the patrolling guards emerged from behind the other buildings this would only work if the timing was right suddenly the wall behind the big man seemed to actually bulge and buckle for a moment trying to contain the pressure from within there was a series of deep thumps from within as several of the pots exploded the interior of the ammunition store would now be wreathed in fire but the building had been constructed with this possibility in mind the heavy walls contained it and the huge pots would survive intact so long as the fire was put out quick enough a cry of alarm issued from round the corner at the front of the building as the guard by the door realised what had happened sure enough just as ursa had expected the two soldiers on patrol came hurtling directly across the compound toward the building as the guard struggled with his keys to open the door there were several more bangs from within and flames were now issuing from the roof in an impressive column as the approaching guards reached the front of the shed occupied with the fire and the noise distracted by the dancing flames within ursa and his companion took the opportunity to run along the wall heading toward the compound gates they were only halfway there when the ox cart that marked phase two burst through the wooden portal shattering the beam that held the gate fast and coming on unstoppably briefly ursa had to feel for the oxen they were huge and strong creatures but to be driven directly into the gate must have been excruciating for them the heavy cart thundered into the compound the two drivers turning slightly and heading for the next gate the one in the stockade behind the cart ursa and his companion ran to keep up all hell was now breaking loose in the compound most of the soldiers were holed up either asleep in the bunkhouse or drinking and sheltering in the guard room men emerged from the doors expressions of shock and surprise plastered across their faces many of them unarmed and unarmoured caught in an offduty state confusion reigned and the newlyarrived guards panicked most of them rushing off toward the burning ammunition store they would have to get the flames under control before the larger pots caught or they could lose a lot of the warehouse district to fire in the night a few men who could see beyond this immediate danger turned and ran for the cart the first stupidly tried to grab the reins of the oxen as they thundered past there was no hope of stopping the huge bovines with this amount of momentum and the unfortunate man was dragged beneath and trampled to a bloody pulp as others tried to keep pace with the heavy unstoppable cart ursa caught up with it panting and running along behind with his companion moments before the vehicle hit and burst through the stockade gate screams and shouts of alarm issued from within as the captive pirates and other criminals threw themselves out of the way of the rolling nightmare as they passed the threshold the two pirate drivers threw themselves from the cart and rolled to their feet everprepared the men of the dark empress began to emerge from the stockade at a run ursa heaved a deep breath and bellowed to the empress the pursuing guards pulled up sharply as previouslycaged criminals of numerous varieties poured out of the stockade with a taste for freedom and many a grudge against their wardens as the two dozen men of the empress ran toward the gate ursa shook his head sympathetically at the plight of the guardsmen around him as they struggled amid the wreckage of shattered stockades and gates to control the ever increasing fire at the ammunition store that threatened the whole district while several dozen vicious criminals took the opportunity to either flee or exact their vengeance on any figure of authority they spotted ghassan had been explicit that he wanted the bodycount kept as low as prudence allowed preferably nil to ursas knowledge the only direct casualty had been the man beneath the oxen but he thought sadly as he ran toward the jetties with his shipmates the number of deaths caused by fire and escaping prisoners could yet be appalling nothing he could do about that now though his duty was to the dark empress her crew and her captain wherever he might be in which there is a night time visit the rope had been removed of course samir wondered how long it had taken before the more observant of the palace guards had spotted it arcing out across the street likely the entire compound had been searched down to the last cupboard for some kind of interloper theyd been sadly disappointed briefly the fugitive pirate captain considered walking up to the main gate bold as brass and demanding entrance the shock value of such a move appealed tremendously however in all likelihood he would end up chained in the remaining half of the prison tower without ever setting foot in the compound that way he glanced up and down the street the sun had gone down hours ago and while he had no idea how ghassan was going to break out the rest of the men and free the ship he knew two things for certain that his brother would succeed and that something spectacular would be involved and so hed stood on one of the highest roofs in this the upper part of the town where he had a magnificent panoramic view of the docks way below at the other end of mdahz hed not known exactly what he was waiting for but he felt sure he would recognise a sign of action and he didnt really want to make his next move until he was sure ghassan was getting underway the wait had been long and dull and samir had sat on the roof cutting slices of peach with his pocket knife and snacking as he watched the dark district far below and then just after the midnight bells rang out in the towns temples hed spotted what hed been waiting for there had been a flash and a column of flame had burst through a roof hed have put that down to ghassan regardless of where it happened but there was no doubt that the flames were rising from the ammunition store in the guard compound the colour of the flames and the roiling smoke rising to the stars above was testament to that good and so hed turned and made his way down to the street where he now stood frowning at the palace compound wall this time he was here on his own schedule and while he couldnt afford to waste hours it was dark and the streets were empty giving him plenty of space to work looking up the fifteen feet of sheerfaced boundary wall revealed no possible hand or foot holds but the construction while cored with solid stone offered a mudbrick and plaster outer as was common in architecture from the poorer days of mdahz gritting his teeth and frowning in concentration samir drew two weapons from his belt utilitarian knives rather than fighting blades these were thick and strong his tongue protruding slightly as he worked it took only half a minute to dig out a chunk of the walls surface at waist height smiling he made another hole at head height with equal ease slowly he began to climb using his freshlyexcavated hand holds and carving out new ones as he rose in less than ten minutes he reached up and for the first time his fingers touched the tile bondinglayers in the wall of the main building itself with a smile samir hauled himself up to the layer and put his knives away carefully clinging on to the narrow holds and trying not to look down slowly he pulled himself up to the next available grip and made his way diagonally toward the window of the governors office there had been no light or sign of life in the room when hed checked from the building opposite so it was a good place to start with a grunt and a last heave he grasped the lintel and pulled himself up and inside dropping lightly to the floor in a crouch and glancing around sharply there was no sound or movement the office was dark and quiet standing samir examined the exits the main door at the far end would lead to the main hallway probably with a stairwell that would be the way people entered the governors reception room which this clearly was likely though the governor would have a second entrance so that he could move between his private apartments and this room without passing a more open public space there were two doors leading off in addition to the main exit one on each side closing his eyes samir summoned up a mental picture of the outer facade of the palace from the roof across the street the two rooms to the left as one faced the wall had been busy during the daytime when hed sneaked here to eavesdrop on asima that meant they were almost certainly administrative or business areas he couldnt remember seeing any movement in the rooms to the right however they had been empty and silent during the middle of the day nodding with satisfaction he stepped lightly across the office toward the door stopping suddenly as he passed the heavy wooden table of dark northern oak papers scattered around amid ledgers and maps appeared to be random and messy and samir leaned heavily on the edge of the table and squinted trying to make out as much as possible in the scant moonlight afforded by the window he smiled and rounded the table to the governors chair where he grasped a particular unfinished letter and sat back smiling in the seat holding up the missive to take maximum advantage of the low silvery light to his majestic highness ashar parishid high king of pelasia samirs smile intensified as he read on through the governors carefully worded explanation of his actions regarding asima not quite an apology for turning her back to him but close enough it would appear from the letter that asima was less popular even with the king of pelasia than with the folk of the empire he grinned and cast his eyes across the table reaching out he grasped a stylus and concentrated as he hunched over the letter hed learned to read and write but it required concentration if he wanted it to look good at the bottom of the halffinished letter he finished a note with a flourish do not send this the grin still on his face samir dropped the pen scanned the desk and finding nothing else that particularly attracted his attention he left and returned to his original goal the side door as he approached he leaned close and put his ear to the wood this was an interior door of no great substance and there was no sound from the other side clenching his teeth he slowly twisted the handle the door remained steadfastly shut locked hed assumed for some reason that the main door to the officereception room would be locked but the separating interior doors would not be plainly this governor placed a high value on security smiling he crouched never let it be said that something as simple as a lock had got in the way of his plans his tongue working around his teeth as he concentrated samir withdrew a leather wallet from his belt opened it selected a specific narrow metal prong with a curious tip and began to work it slowly gently and quietly in the lock after a few seconds there was a gentle click and he held his breath as he leaned back chances were that even someone awake in the room beyond hadnt noticed the tiny noise but this was no time to blunder silence reigned as he silently put the lockpick away and tucked away the wallet at his belt slowly he exhaled so much would fail if he messed up and guards were called he would be carted off to his doom without the opportunity to carry out his mission slowly wincing with each miniscule whinge of the mechanism he turned the door handle and pushed gently the door swung quietly open a few inches samir smiled somehow hed known that the door wouldnt squeak the sort of man that locked his interconnecting doors was the sort of man that would keep them oiled and in good order standing once again he leaned closer and put his eye to the crack the room beyond was some sort of sun room or lounge filled with low tables and seats very comfortable a more private meeting room where the governor would socialise with friends or wellknown dignitaries good that meant he was in the mans apartments now once more two other doors led off from here one at the far end of the room opposite the window must lead to a lobby given the length of this room compared with that next door that lobby in turn would have several doors and a main entrance from the stairwell the other exit opposite the one through which hed entered was likely the one he required smiling he strode across the room quietly but quickly and grasped the handle of the other door turning it lightly the portal gave easily of course no need to lock the door between private lounge and private bedchamber the interior was dark as the deepest cave the windows closed in with shutters and drapes to keep out the bright moon and star light samir quickly nipped around the door and pushed it closed behind him the dim light that hed cast into the room when he opened the door would shine out like a beacon to anyone awake in here holding his breath again he stood just inside the door in the darkness and waited slowly his eyes adjusted a little while he listened for a challenge that never came very gently he could hear the deep breaths of the governor asleep in what must be a large bed at the rooms far side samir concentrated for a moment trying to identify more than one breathing pattern after all the governor may well be married nothing though just the one smiling samir padded silently across to a shelf on the wall where an oil lamp stood with flint and steel for a moment he considered lighting that but it would take too long and be noisy and trying shrugging he walked on past the shelf until he reached the large windows slowly and quietly he drew back the drapes tiny dots and points of silver light picked their way through the cracks and joints in the shutters taking a deep breath samir threw open the shutters admitting bright moonlight and bathing the room in a silvery glow he turned to address the governor hoping the light had at least woken him samir was astonished though he kept his composure and hid his surprise well to see the governor sitting up calmly in his bed a small hand bow aimed at him it was one of the torsionbased personal weapons that pelasian assassins used deadly and accurate samir smiled excellency you are apparently a remarkable man as are you captain samir the pirate stretched silhouetted against the window and presenting a clear target for the governors weapon may i ask why you have not simply shot me or called for the guards excellency the governor shrugged i have the upper hand captain moreover had you the intention to do me harm you would hardly have sneaked around the room and opened the window first i could be wanting to intimidate and torture you first the governor a serious looking man shook his head his aim remaining steadfast hardly your reputation captain now what can i do for you samir smiled and strode across to sink into a seat opposite the bed lit by the white square from the window i have a proposition for you governor go on i am aware that you know a certain young lady by the name of asima of course asima is as you may or may not know by now one of the most clever deceitful and generally wicked people you may ever set eyes on i know her of old the governor nodded no sign of surprise or denial once again samir was impressed by this man well he went on her accusations regarding my brother are entirely fictional i am quite openly and even proudly responsible for the sinking of the wind of god i was aided in the most unexpected way by that same young lady when she sabotaged ghassans rudder and left him helpless he grinned i apologise for the mess i made of your town walls yesterday but my brother is innocent and moreover i need him for a while the governor frowned this is all very well i cant confirm or deny any of it of course although im sure youre right but this information is currently valueless asima is gone from here on her way back to pelasia with a purse of my money and an escort until shes safely at the first royal way station in their country and as far as possible from me ghassan on the other hand is now with you as were well aware so what in the name of the imperial raven is your proposition what could you possibly offer that would be worth more than me as you so succinctly put it simply shooting you or calling for the guards samir laughed lightly and reached into his tunic im afraid i have no intention of staying right now i have so many things to do and so little time you see if you listen very carefully your excellency youll hear the commotion down at the docks where my crew have been freed im fairly certain that by now the empress will be back at sea and making for open water youll have your hands full in the morning if you intend to take us again he withdrew a folded and tied paper from his tunic and tossed it across to the bed where it landed on the governors knee the older man glanced down at it with interest though his hand never wavered and his aim remained true he looked up at samir again with a raised eyebrow thats my offer my proposal i dont expect an answer right now youll have to think it over and you may even need to consult with your superiors i give you my word though excellency that until we meet again and i have your answer i will forego any opportunity to take on one of your ships i believe thats as plain and as fair as i can make it the governor smiled i have to admit that im intrigued im just not sure whether im intrigued enough to let you go rather than having you taken into custody and then perusing your proposal samir answered with a grin of his own then i will just have to take my chances excellency im on a tight schedule you see standing and noting how the governors weapon kept track of his movements even while the man gazed down at the paper in his lap samir turned his back strode across to the window and began to climb out i shall see you soon sir have a good night with a last smile samir clambered down from the window climbed as far as the end of the bonding tile layers and then dropped lightly to the street in the dark room the governor put down the weapon and standing wrapped his robe tightly around him taking the paper and untying the ribbon he placed it on the shelf while he lit the oil lamp and then retrieved and unfolded the note and began to read as he neared the bottom of the text his eyes sparkled the guard on duty outside the governors apartment started in surprise at the sound of deep laughter ringing out from his excellencys chamber in the middle of the night in which another journey begins asima stopped at the gate and listened to the midnight bells echo away move along miss the cavalry sergeant said quietly just a moment she turned and looked back up at the town gate with its heavy towers to either side and battlements above she was outside once more away from the narrow teeming streets in which she had grown up mdahz should feel like home really or at least it should have some vague connection for her instead as she looked at it the town of her birth home to her fathers grave elicited no emotion from her at all with a raised eyebrow she realised shed not gone to see his last resting place after all shed left her father there so long ago in the knowledge that by going to pelasia for the satrap her father would be safe curious how shed hardly even thought of him after that had she always been this way or had pelasia changed her the sergeant commander of the unit of a dozen imperial cavalry that were to escort her back to the neighbouring kingdom cleared his throat and smiled sympathetically sad to be leaving miss hardly with a sneer she spat once in the direction of the town and turned her back on it hopefully for the last time this time the guard stepped away taken aback a little by her display his face hardened and he gestured forcefully to the staging post a few hundred yards ahead where the coach along with the baggage cart and the horses waited tended by her cavalry escort get in the coach miss and well get you away from here asima nodded sourly as she strode over toward the small settlement staging posts now existed outside each of the citys gates growing gradually into villages in their own right the new governor had banned unlicensed work animals and vehicles from the town the administration claimed that it lowered the chance of accidents and trouble in the steep and narrow streets and made the city cleaner and safer this was certainly true though the more cynical also noted that the licenses were a good source of revenue also and so these small settlements were springing up corrals with animal traders and stabling facilities to take advantage of the new laws traders to take advantage of the high turnover of travellers desert nomads come close to the city to sell their own wares and purchase goods unavailable in the hot sands and finally the inevitable beggars homeless and hopeless the coach and its escort stood at the edge of the small settlement the guards keeping a watchful eye over the vagrants and nomads in their makeshift shelters nearby asima barely noticed them as she strode past her nose wrinkling at the smell toward her transport to pelasia a few yards from the coach one of the scarecrows in tattered black lounging crosslegged beside a dancing fire stood and her curved back giving her a slight stoop shuffled toward them on a course of interception the sergeant began to steer asima to the side away from the woman gaunt and dark and haggard but the desertdweller changed direction and homed in on them once again asimas sneer was still in full effect and the old woman cackled grinning as she approached want to hear your fortune lady asima shook her head irritably a toothless desert hag has less idea of my future than the stars let alone myself get back to your tent crowwoman the sergeant frowned at her he may not approve of beggars and vagrants but these people had broken no law and served a purpose no matter how small here he said dropping a few copper coins into her hand as he reached out to grasp asimas wrist and arrest her forward motion as she jerked to a halt her eyes flashing angrily the sergeant turned to her ill pay to hear your future just to be sure that in no way am i in it lady asima his charge glared at him as he turned and smiled at the old woman with the dishevelled hair tell her and ill double your money when we leave the old woman smiled a cracked smile and reached out gently for asimas hand the young lady recoiled in disgust but the sergeant his hand still on her wrist pushed her hand out so that the fortune teller could reach this she did and with narrow leathery fingers she caressed the top of asimas hand you are a woman with a destiny the old woman said quietly asima nodded i hardly need a stinking old crow to tell me that the sergeant treated her to an angry glare as the old woman went on rubbing small circles on the back of asimas hand before turning it over to examine the palm your life has been transition constantly each time you feel you are nearing your goal it is snatched away from you yes asima stopped struggling to pull away her brow furrowing her astonishment at the fact that the woman had so accurately summed up her life since the day the satrap maahd came was compounded by the surprise at the old womans soft tone and educated use of language despite everything in her that told her to push this woman away asima couldnt fight it she was interested the world has repeatedly promised you great things but never quite delivered them you lash out when this happens and the result is often that you fall further away from your goal you are beginning to believe that you are owed a great deal and are determined to squeeze the world until it pays that was a bolt from the blue for asima it was horribly cuttingly accurate and yet news to her she had never realised this was the case stop the old woman smiled everything happens for a reason lady you will achieve your destiny but you must not fight it each time you fight it your destiny pulls away from you you need to follow the path you are now on and stop trying to change it asima frowned i do not believe in gods or fate or fortunes old woman a clever mind sees past the trickery you are merely insightful and a good judge of character but not a great one if you were youd have steered well clear of me the old woman laughed merrily you do not believe you who have murdered lords and ladies you who have bought and sold souls and lives to climb the ladder of success you who have sat with kings and worn jewels that were worth more than mdahz has to offer you who cannot stop yourself stop there was something in asimas voice that made the sergeant frown a great deal of irritation and anger of course but also a note verging on panic never lady you have taken a wrong turning at some point on the path of your life you would have been poor but loved as a nobody sometimes you realise that and it makes you sad but not sad enough to turn you away from the path you have chosen stop asima barked instead you seek power at the expense of love you care not what people think of you except when it is necessary to achieve something you will not stop until you can look down on the gods you deny and it matters not that the world will hate you for it asima made a lunge for the woman but the sergeant still had a tight grip on her wrist and held her back turning to the fortune teller i think youd best take the rest of the money and leave woman momentarily the old crone said quietly lady i said i would tell you your fortune i have only told you your past and the contents of your heart i would be remiss having been paid not to perform my duty asima glared at her coldly an angry rumble somewhere deep in her throat i said that you are a woman of destiny you may believe in what you wish lady but i have the sight and the knowledge and i know beyond doubt and past certainty you are destined for better or for worse to reach the dizzy heights that you seek before the next year cycles around you will be acclaimed an empress you will rule with absolute power uncontested yet unloved no one will sing your praise or welcome your accession though i fear you care little about that she smiled a humourless smile you will be an empress lady and as dark an empress as ever walked beneath the heavens i shudder to look further so i must take my leave may the sand devils grant you safe passage on your journey with a smile she wrapped her fingers tightly around the copper coins in her hand and shuffled off back toward her fire and tent the sergeant relaxed his grip im not sure whether im glad i heard that or not he examined the young lady by his side asima had an unreadable expression come on get into the coach so we can get underway if your highness is going to be an empress id as soon it wasnt in my country shaking her head asima picked up her feet and walked off toward the coach frowning as she went behind her the crooked old scarecrow woman in the tattered black pocketed her treasure and shuffled out of the open back to her tent as the cavalry and their vehicles prepared to get underway the old woman passed between two tents into the shelter of a couple of palm trees and scrub plants taking a quick glance between the shelters to make sure she was out of sight of the lady and her escort she straightened rubbing her back while sucking in air between her teeth grinning she stretched and laughed quietly samir was right this girl was a real piece of work and clever too she was almost clever enough to have seen through it all but samirs insight had apparently been uncanny enough to throw her off kilter she laughed once more as she set off back toward the town walls and the secret way in that even few of the criminal underclass of mdahz knew existed in which tain leads the way ghassan peered over the top of the crates a final time and then turned back to the men crouched behind him each armed with a cudgel and a fierce and determined expression remember the rules take them down as necessary but i want to avoid killing wherever possible and samir would back me up on this any man i see killing someone when there is an alternative i will leave for the authorities to deal with is that clear there was a chorus of subdued agreement ghassan nodded with satisfaction it did appear that despite their chosen path in life these men of samirs suffered the effects of a conscience and that made them the sort of people that ghassan could use must have taken some work identifying men like this and manoeuvring them over the years until they formed the crew of the empress taking a deep breath he beckoned to the man hed selected earlier it had been a simple choice most of the crew were longtime pirates with tattoos long unruly hair jewellery and piercings there were few among them who matched the presentable manner expected of a military recruit young tain was perhaps the only man among those around him that could do this fortunate they were that tain was also fearless wellspoken clever and as devious as a boy could be the young man only a member of the crew for two years left the crowd of his shipmates and approached ghassan picking and scratching irritably at the stolen guard uniform he wore ready the young man laughed quietly ready as ill ever be id as soon go now n get it over with sos i can get this itchy crap off me any moment now ghassan smiled he glanced back across the port from where they lurked in the shadow of a dockside warehouse hidden from the jetty by piles of crates and barrels hed listened tensely and heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the midnight bell ring out since then hed rarely taken his eyes off the dark roofs of the warehouse district and the guard compound that lay hidden among them the young sailor turned and cast his own gaze back there a few heartbeats passed and ghassan grinned did you see that see what the commander pointed into the dark distance and his young companion squinted cant see a thing sir theres flames just small and just starting but ursas in its begun yous got bloody good eyesight i cant his voice fell away as what had been a miniscule flicker of yellow barely visible from this distance suddenly exploded into a column of flame that reached up above the roofs do i go now ghassan shook his head count to a hundred slowly and steadily and then go you need to leave enough time to have legitimately got here they wont believe you flew the boy shrugged never counted ta hunderd is it long ghassan blinked at him and had to readjust his thinking just because the boy was clever didnt mean he was educated probably couldnt read either do you know the song sharri the mermaid the young boy grinned and nodded rude version tho hum four verses to yourself then go ghassan replied with a grin itll be about right he laughed quietly as he watched the lad concentrating on the song and noted a few of the more socially unacceptable of the lyrics in the rhyme as they formed silently on his lips get ready a minute more and the young sailor grinned at him and nodded standing and straightening his uniform with a deep breath he turned and ran back among the warehouses ghassan returned his gaze to the jetty beyond the crates the governor was taking no chances with this prize the dark empress wallowed in the dock tied fore and aft to the end jetty the boarding plank pulled up on board he would be willing to lay money on the oars having been taken away and impounded just in case which is why theyd raided a storehouse earlier in the evening and brought a number of replacement oars with them to this spot there were three of the port guard on duty at a brazier at the near end of the jetty denying access to any possible visitors four men stood in position along the jetty itself with many more on deck ghassan had counted at least ten and estimated three times as many were aboard the sound of pounding feet from off to the left made him smile here came tain ghassan made several hand gestures to the men with him and watched as they split into three distinct groups fire came the warning tain suddenly burst into the open in front of the jetty having run like the wind around the back of three warehouses and arrived panting from the correct direction for a runner from the compound the three men at the brazier readied their weapons these soldiers were truly alert and prepared halt the leader barked tain came to a stop dropping his hands to his knees and breathing in deep gasps after playing up the weariness a little he straightened sir sarge at barracks said he needs ya bin attacked at ammo store and places on fire all prisners got out n all shit the officer at the brazier turned to one of his companions take a dozen men and go help tain straightened and saluted before doubling over with a very impressive hacking cough and youd better stay here til you can breathe lad the young man nodded and shuffled over to a cleat to sit down as he continued to breathe in deep lungfuls of air he watched the second in command as he shouted to his men on board a dozen guards came to the rail dropped their spears over onto the jetty and then leapt the six feet down and across onto the wooden floor some of them barely making it tain smiled to himself as he noted the random rope snaking away from the cleat upon which he sat and across the jetty with a deep breath he leaned back and began surreptitiously to move the rope an inch at a time with his foot moments later the guard detachment was away and marching through the port toward the nowobvious column of flame that marked the location of the ammunition store ghassan made a single gesture with his hand and watched the groups with him burst into silent life the first ran quietly along behind the piles of crates and barrels until they reached the end wall of the port here the wall rose up behind warehouses to nowhere near the height of the town walls but high enough and with a walkway the guard that patrolled the top would be looking outward if he were paying attention at all likely he was now somewhere further inland gazing toward the rising flames inside the perimeter the first harbour was framed by the port wall and the jetty the high sides of the empress reaching up from the dark glassy surface within the first group silent and swift crossed the space between the crates and the shore and disappeared into the black water with hardly a splash ghassan bit his lip his heart pounding as he turned to the other two groups the men at the near end had taken position in the cover of the barrels close to the end of the jetty and just outside the circle of orange light cast by the brazier the third group only eight men but handpicked by their companions for their abilities remained with ghassan at the centre hed have liked given the opportunity to have gone with one of the main assault groups but no he was in command and it was the job of a captain to direct and guide and from here he could continue to monitor what was going on until they were certain enough of the success of the plan that he could rush in and join them he turned his gaze back to the group in the water and watched anxiously as they slid through the black until they reached the ship they disappeared from view at this angle as they moved along the far side of the hull and ghassan took a deep breath counting almost silently one two three four five six turning he gestured with his thumb at the group near the jetty go with a roar the main party of pirates rushed out from their cover toward the two men by the brazier who reacted more professionally than ghassan had expected bellowing warnings and commands to the men behind and on board perhaps the officer had been prepared for something like this if that was the case then ghassan had to hope hed outthought the man as the raiders bore down on the jetty and ghassan prepared for the next step he almost laughed as he saw tain seated on a cleat pull a rope by his feet until it tightened the coils hed been carefully manoeuvring with his foot straightened at the ankles of the two men by the brazier and with a squawk the officer and his companion were swept from their feet the former landing on his back on the jetty while the latter disappeared into the water with a splash with a wave to the small group beside him ghassan climbed to the top of the pile of crates from their slightly elevated position they had a better view of what was happening on deck the soaking pirates who had swum across and climbed the ships side using the welldesigned hand holds samir had had carved for situations just like this finally reached the rail at their side and began to clamber over just as most of the soldiers on board had rushed over to the jetty side to aid their comrades below now beside ghassan the men of his third party began to swing their slingshots and bolas and let the missiles fly at any target aboard that presented itself several men standing at the jettyside rail were caught unawares as the small stones pounded them one man unfortunate indeed was the recipient of a thrown bolas that caught him at the knees tying up his legs just as a small smooth stone caught him a glancing blow on the forehead unconscious even as he fell the guard toppled over the rail alongside several of his companions the men variously fell to the jetty with a thud or disappeared with a splash the distraction of the main charge was enough the men whod swum across and climbed the far side were now spreading out on the deck and disappearing into the doorways it would all be over in a few minutes then would begin the difficult part getting away from the dock intact with a nod of satisfaction he noted that the assault group on the jetty had reached the far end downing or pushing into the water anyone who resisted two men on board began to lower the boarding ramp as the others dealt with the remaining defenders turning to his missile troops ghassan grinned alright lads lets fetch the oars and get on board as they dropped down from the higher crates and rushed to collect the piles of long oars from the side of the building where theyd been stacked ghassan looked up when someone shouted his name with a smile he recognised ursa and a number of men rushing down the main thoroughfare of the port and making for the empress glad you could join us mister ursa well sir you know how hard it is to leave a comfy fireside and come out in the cold ghassan laughed as the escaped pirates began to swarm across the jetty and up to the ship preparing to get her underway ursa stopped amid the commotion and addressed his commander hope youve got something up your sleeve still there are four navy vessels in port and theyre all as fast as us were not away free yet ghassan smiled well see mister ursa in which paths diverge the carriage rattled slowly and uncomfortably along the track toward pelasia despite the fact that this was the closest she had managed to regaining what she had lost asima sat brooding and seething in the rickety vehicle the encounter with that uncanny bitch at the staging post a couple of hours ago had sent her into a deep sense of disgruntlement and every time she tried to calm her mind or sleep visions of that unholy ragged desert witch and her keen insights insisted themselves once more upon her thoughts to hell with her many years ago as an innocent girl she had travelled this very road in just such a coach with vapid pointless companions on the way to akkad strangely that time she had been a virtual slave with an uncertain future and yet she had been relatively at peace now while she was an adult with a sense of purpose her destiny in her own capable hands and travelling on her own something gnawed at the edges of her consciousness and made her unsettled with a sigh she sat back heavily ridiculously this carriage was so old and dreadful that it was entirely possible it was the same damn coach shed been sent in that first time everything would be better when she got to pelasia another deep sigh and she realised that she was staring angrily at the empty seat opposite her reaching to her side she pulled back the black curtain to see one of the cavalrymen riding alongside on escort duty the man armoured lightly for a desert ride wore his scarf wrapped around the lower part of his face preventing the cloying sand and dust kicked up by horse and carriage from choking him he paid no attention to the carriage and for some reason that annoyed asima more than anything how long until we reach the border soldier the man turned and raised his eyebrows should be just before dawn maam he replied his voice muffled a little by the scarf asima frowned and grumbled mind if i ask a personal question miss asima shrugged and said nothing well he went on we spent the last couple of decades pretty much at war with pelasia theyre weird and have strange gods and their noblemen are all well that way inclined if you know what i mean asima furrowed her brow and well i was wondering why an imperial lady such as you would want to go there specially since the sarge tells me that youre exiled from the place and you could get done over if you get found asima narrowed her eyes and wrinkled her lip outspoken arent you soldier the cavalryman shrugged just interested maam asima took a breath of tepid night air a combination of ambition and revenge she answered darkly the soldiers brow furrowed maam glowering at the outspoken guard asima retreated into the darkness of the carriage and let the curtain fall back into place prince ashar would hang from the city walls for rejecting and banishing her and putting her through all of this her first stop would be the coastal town of jeresh where the satrap was a man of at least sixty years and of delicate enough health that he rarely ever visited akkad and had remained absent throughout the troubles only two years ago the mans wife had died and it was said that he would take no other that would change what aging lord wouldnt want such a stunning young woman on his arm and once she was with him that satrap and his son would be the only two people that stood between her and a veritable kingdom of her own a sizeable army and navy were centred on jeresh and the satrap was extremely wealthy the timing would have to be careful though the son would have to die first perhaps some sort of hunting accident hunting accidents happened all the time or possibly he would be attacked by brigands on one of his visits throughout their demesne it would have to be something she could organise that would happen away from the city in order to keep herself high above suspicion also it couldnt happen for at least a year after she managed to wed the satrap arranging the incident and then disposing of those who could link back to her would be fun just like the old days of the harem she was good at that sort of planning and then of course the old man already shaken by the loss of his wife and failing to find succour in the arms of his new bride would be heartbroken at the death of his only son and heir he would pine away and die in his sleep probably in his sleep perhaps it would be better if it happened in public she realised in the dark carriage that she was smiling for the first time since leaving mdahz she was starting to get her life back in order half a year would be enough for her to insist herself upon the aging satrap married within the year and sole heir to his demesne its wealth title and military within two that was the way to do things then of course she would have to expand a failed coup just did not bear thinking about when she went for ashars head it would have to be with certainty that she would succeed the second step would require another powerful satrap perhaps a young and naive one next one with either money and influence or with military power didnt matter too much so long as she was assured of being the one in control then with the resources of two large and powerful demesnes she would be able to buy or frighten a number of others into her cause it would take a while could even take a decade but her own rather tight timeline was worked to a five year plan and she would try to stick to that she sat back the tiredness finally beginning to settle over her now that the thoughts of that old crow woman had been washed away by the plans of her future as she closed her eyes and began to drift she floated on through her future picturing the day her army escorted her into ashars chamber and he stood before her contrite and helpless would she bother with the immense satisfaction of executing the man herself or would that be beneath her yes shed have to have him dealt with by her men it would be unseemly to dirty her hands when she was about to grip the crown with them of course she would be the power behind the throne with her asyetunnamed naive consort as the true king of pelasia but only for a year long enough to change the laws and become lawfully an equal ruling partner then shed have to find a way to get rid of him but that would be easy nice and easy she said quietly smiling in her halfdoze and then then she would have to turn the power of pelasia to her own goals that horrible island of pirates would already have been dealt with by the governor at mdahz or his superior at calphoris but samir and ghassan would be free she was in no doubt that samir would already be out somewhere and probably with ghassan was there no regret even deep down that she would have to deal with them she raised an eyebrow no no regret they had become an itch that she would have to scratch sooner or later not only would they both be harbouring a grudge against her after the events in mdahz but also they knew enough about her that theyd inevitably find a way some day to try and take her on no when she had the unlimited power of the godqueen she would demand both their heads of the imperial governors for certain the authorities would not be happy with such a demand from a foreign power but then one was a pirate and the other a traitor and they would be hard put to find a reason to help them at risk of angering such a powerful neighbour as pelasia ghassan and samir swinging out over the parapet above the sea at akkad creaking as they dangled in the wind perhaps sleep swept over asima like a comforting blanket her smile one of sheer contentment as she ruled her dreamkingdom drafting dreamlaws and wreaking revenge on her dreamenemies the curtain lifted gently and two dark eyes sparkled as they gazed in on the sleeping occupant the drape fell once more masking the gentle snore that melded so perfectly with the rumble of carriage wheels on stony ground samir pulled the scarf down a little to wipe his itchy nose why in the name of harishs fourth face would people ever join the cavalry were these people numb from the waist down riding a horse was like spending hour after hour seated upon a bag of broken furniture still that was about to end it had been difficult and complicated waylaying and incapacitating one of the soldiers and taking his place in the escort more difficult even than replacing the hired teamsters from the staging post with trusted men from the underbelly of mdahz hed been hovering even after everything she had done on just leaving asima to the fates to deal with but he just had to know hed asked of her motives for returning to pelasia and though she had clearly spoken of ambition and revenge hed expected that anyway what had clinched it for him and asima probably hadnt even been aware of it was the slight sneer that crept into her expression when she said it and the deeply wicked and frankly evil look that welled up in her eyes as she spoke the words whatever schemes she had laid out and samir was sure shed planned ahead for this they would be at the expense of innocent people including king ashar the legitimate ruler of pelasia and the man who had stabilised the realm and brought peace and reparations with the empire no whatever she was planning she had to be stopped he smiled as he remembered the conversation hes overheard between asima and his friend the soothsayer it had been elaborate as a ruse possibly overlyso but as events unfolded in the coming days and samir put his plan into action it would be so much more helpful to have asima going along with things believing it to be in her own interest rather than struggling against him every inch of the way you will achieve your destiny but you must not fight it samir smiled as he remembered the look on tianas face as shed said that so much furrowed concentration it looked like she was about to implode what an actress she was so wasted in the gambling pits when she could be on the stage with a smile he let his horse drop back slightly allowing the carriage to roll on into the night slightly ahead watching the baggage cart rumble past with its additional cargo of eight sleeping men he grinned and nodded to the driver who touched his forelock in response three more to deal with then or possibly just two and the rearguard was the easiest allowing the cart to trundle on ahead he watched the horseman at the rear catching up with him as the two closed the moonlight illuminating them samir was amused at the look of quiet incomprehension on the other mans face whats up the soldier asked quietly lady in the coach asked if id give you this the man frowned as the two converged and samir reached into his tunic the soldier watched with interest as the hand came out and reached toward him samir smiled as he turned the slow movement into a powerful punch that hit the man square in the face the rider stunned by the force of the blow as well as the shock lurched back in his saddle only the hand gripping the reins preventing him from toppling over backwards samir smiled as he reached across and prised the fingers from the leather strap the man still stunned in the moment opened his eyes wide as he was suddenly completely detached from the horse and slid gracelessly backwards and disappeared with a thump and a squawk in the night that did not go as well as planned samir grumbled to himself as he grasped the reins of the riderless horse and trotted forward again the blow was supposed to knock the man out and samir had been damn lucky hed been stunned enough not to bellow out a warning to the others there was silence now so the fall had either winded him or rendered him unconscious now he could have used ghassan and those amazing little talents he seemed to have picked up taking a deep breath he trotted quietly up to the supply wagon and tied the reins of the riderless horse to the leash that connected all the spare horses to the cart nodding again at the teamster he made a v sign with his hand and rode on to the carriage on the far side opposite where hed been riding another of the soldiers sat ahorse his gaze locked on the moonlit horizon smiling samir rode alongside nodding professionally at his peer the horseman raised an eyebrow bored hardly samir smiled quietly terribly sorry as the man frowned samirs free hand came down behind him knife gripped tightly pommel downward the heavy carved ivory knob connected with the back of the soldiers head and he slid from the horse with a sigh his eyes rolling up into his head that was more how it was supposed to go narrowing his eyes he gazed out forward the rider out front playing vanguard was perhaps a quarter of a mile ahead paying attention to his surroundings in these sands that sometimes hid bandits he wouldnt be looking back often though his job was to keep the way ahead clear while the two men with the carriage played close guard samir turned and nodded to the man leading the supply cart with a grin the man reached around and unhooked the strap that kept the spare horses tethered to the cart stepping as quietly as possible onto the edge of the seat the driver leapt landing squarely on one of the unused steeds with a smile he began to usher the horses forward toward the carriage samir nodded again and then came alongside the carriage and nodded to that driver moments later the carriage and almost a dozen horses veered off to the right carving a new path toward the coast through the open rocky lands samir glanced back over his shoulder the scout leading the way was little more than a dot in the distant grey while the unmanned supply cart trundled on with its sleeping cargo beginning to change direction as the oxen plodded along on their own route samir grinned they would probably be early so long as ghassan was on time anyway in which old tricks are useful the dark empress slipped away from the jetty amid cries of distress and bellows of rage from the reserve port guard who were even now making their way down to the waterfront to find their compatriots largely unconscious or incapacitated from where ghassan stood on the command deck he could make out more and more figures appearing from between buildings and rushing around the port the town guard were now fully alerted and ever more reinforcements were being drafted into the harbour area ghassan smiled they werent the worry unless they were superhuman swimmers he glanced away to his right as the empress began to turn under the power of her determined oarsmen they were the worry the four imperial daram docked further along the waterfront even now he could see their crews scrambling around on deck like a colony of ants rushing to get the vessels underway and in pursuit of their escaping prize he knew two of those ships well knew their captains and some of the crew they were good men and very capable sailors any pirate worth his salt would be soiling his trousers at the sight of those four beginning to burst into life ghassan nodded with satisfaction of course he wasnt a pirate not as such but then he could hardly claim to be a naval officer these days what he was was an interested third party with a good objective viewpoint a smile slid into a grin and of course because he was neither soldier not pirate he was bound by no rules he staggered slightly as he tried to keep his gaze locked on those ships while the empress completed her swing around and the reverse rowing stopped like one of those windup pelasian toy birds everything fell mechanically in to place this crew were every bit as good as those of the wind of god had been the oars were repositioned once again and the ship drifted to a stop before beginning very slowly to pick up forward momentum staggering again he looked down the wound in his thigh though it had been expertly dealt with still weakened him and if he turned sharply or unexpectedly on that leg he momentarily lost the strength in it righting himself he turned toward the stern to keep his eyes on the port as the empress began finally to come straight and head out toward open sea the commotion on the dock was immense he watched tensely as artillery was cranked and loaded on the towers marking the seaward end of the port walls where they gave way to the lower and nondefensive harbour wall these catapults were a new defensive measure against invasion since imperial control had once more been asserted and it was they that were the first hurdle to overcome nothing for it but to pray and row there was nothing they could have done with the artillery given their time and resources but the pirates had two things on their side firstly surprise the empress would hopefully be out of range before they were ready to fire and secondly even if that wasnt the case the artillerists would have drilled for this moment but would never yet have had the opportunity to fire a live shot in a combat situation their crews were trained but green and inexperienced and ghassan knew just how hard it was to operate artillery effectively for the first time he nodded as he judged the distance one tower might he held his breath as there was a distant twang and a dull thud a rock the size of a wine cask hurtled through the air from the nearest tower followed almost instantaneously by a second from the other side of the port the near shot was clearly very badly aimed and not only fell some six hundred yards short of the target but also around three shipwidths off to starboard the other tower was far out of range and clearly no threat as the missile from there disappeared with a distant splash grimacing ghassan turned back to the imperial ships they were already getting underway and having been docked with their stern to land as was the traditional way of the navy they had no intricate manoeuvring to perform before they made for sea there were times that any good captain had to rely on the abilities of others and when he himself had no bearing on the outcome of events ghassan hated those times two of the four ships were already slipping from the jetty with the others already moving they would be very close on the empress tail or possibly even ahead of her even now though he couldnt see it he knew damn well that the artillery crews on all four ships would be loading and priming their own fire throwers and catapults though they wouldnt begin to use them until they were clear of the harbour there was the sound of pounding feet and ghassan turned to see one of the men someone he vaguely recognised running toward him yes sir ursa wants permission to unfurl the sails ghassan shook his head tell mister ursa the sails stay furled for now oar power only until i give the order sir just tell him the man shrugged and ran off ghassan turned back to the four daram sliding through the water straight out to sea on an intercept course he couldnt tell just yet he was still concentrating on the four ships and frowning into the night when he heard more boot steps without turning he cleared his throat no sails mister ursa weve got to catch the little wind there is to get out ahead look at that the enemy ships have unfurled their sails were going to lose the lead we have in minutes ghassan smiled enigmatically i may not be samir ursa but i have commanded a daram for years and i do know what im doing im rather hoping that they match our speed or even outpace us but i want to be ready to slow to a halt any minute turning he unleashed what ursa considered to be a mad grin heres your next job were angling toward the centre of the harbour to head out to sea before we turn keep a sharp eye out if everything is going according to plan and the gods are smiling on us tonight youll spot a rowing boat when you do we need to stop and take its crew aboard if its not there then were in trouble and we might have a hell of a fight on our hands ursa narrowed his eyes youre almost as irritating as your brother sir ghassan laughed why thank you now keep an eye out ursa nodded and peered off into the darkness the sea sparkling and reflecting flashes of moonlight here in the harbour where the waves were low and the water remarkably still the two men stood watching in a strange silence while all about them was chaos the roaring and grunting of the oarsmen as they heaved to bring the ship toward the centre of the harbour the distant shouts and cries on board the enemy vessels the commotion on the docks and the towers it was almost unreal standing calmly in the middle of this particularly for ursa apparently who appeared so taut he could snap at any moment moments slid past with the dark water as the five vessels converged on the entrance to the harbour ursa ground his teeth theyre going to get there first and be able to block us in faith ursa faith ghassan replied without faith even gods fail the big bald pirate glowered at him and mumbled something that sounded unflattering under his breath there ghassan called the first officer blinked damn it this mans eyesight was good it took a moment peering into the dark waters for the burly man to pick out the shape of the boat bobbing around in the darkness full stop he bellowed at the crew the oarsmen taken by surprise took a moment to sort themselves out but very quickly the empress slowed to a halt just beyond the small boat its four occupants rowed as fast as they could to catch up with the pirate vessel this had better be important the big man grumbled to his commander those four ships are way out ahead of us now ghassan smiled i think youll be pleasantly surprised shortly ursa the big man looked down at the four new arrivals who were beginning to climb the rope ladder at the side three men and a woman all dressed in lowclass utilitarian clothes and all dark grey and black who the hell are these people again ghassan turned his smile to his second in command my brother has the honour of knowing a great number of people in low places in the port of mdahz i persuaded a few of them to rise above the waterline for an hour or two in return for the promise of considerable recompense theyre port dogs some of them have morals that would make an executioner blush ghassan nodded but they have their uses ursa we will be giving them passage out of the port for now and putting them ashore once again when we meet up with my brother if we meet up with your brother that grin was starting to get on ursas nerves something about the tall officers face actually managed to make his enigmatic smile even more irritating than captain samirs as he grumbled under his breath the last of the four dishevelled villains from mdahz climbed aboard get underway as fast as we can mister ursa still just the oars though make for the harbour entrance ursa shook his head look sir the navy are already there they only have to manoeuvre into position and they can pull us to pieces yes ghassan grinned that could well have been the case however you will find in a moment that it actually isnt as soon as were at the harbour entrance i want hard aport swing round and follow the coast west as soon as were out of harbour and in open sea and making for pelasian waters you can unfurl as many sails as you like but until then i want the tight manoeuvrability of oars alone your port turn might have to be the sharpest youll ever make ursa narrowed his eyes it would help us poor mortals if you and your brother occasionally shared your plans with the rest of us and spoil the surprise watch and learn ursa the dark empress cut through the waves bearing down on the entrance to the harbour where the four imperial ships in tight formation had just arrived from his position following them ursa was surprised to hear sudden cries of alarm from the vessels ahead whats happening he asked of no one in particular frowning and squinting into the distance he watched the ships which having begun to bank for positioning to blockade the empress in suddenly started jerking wildly around two even colliding lightly as they continued on a roughly straight course heading directly out to sea there was a desperate commotion and the four ships were suddenly trying to sort themselves out and reverse their oars what did you do he asked turning to his temporary captain ghassan smiled our four friends here have spent the last hour or two emulating what asima did to my ship before you attacked us these captains had no reason to bank until they reached the open sea since they were facing the entrance while in dock as soon as they got there ahead of us they hauled on the rudders to turn and discovered that some villainous scoundrel has sawn most of the way through them if you listened you could hear the cracks as they gave way and left them with no way to maneuvre his smile widened theyll get back on track with steering oars just like we did but youll remember the disadvantage that put us at and of course because theyre facing directly away from us they cant fire their artillery without taking out their own masts ursa shook his head as he grinned youre a clever bastard sir a mad one but a clever one i hope your oarsmen are as good as they think youve only got a small space there to take us to port without colliding with those ships ursa squared his shoulders i dont think thatll be a problem sir ghassan nodded as the heavy man ran off to issue the orders brushing that stray lock of black curly hair out of his eyes he watched the havoc aboard the four daram as they desperately tried to manoeuvre the empress would be a dot on the horizon before they even made it back to the dock for an emergency refit alright samir ive done my bit now lets see what youve been up to in which a full reunion occurs samir nudged the teamster who woke with a start smnff theres a sail i think its the empress but i want to be sure before i give the signal what do you think the man squinted off across the dark waves from their small and cold camp by the waters edge they had arrived at the village of khediv around an hour ago and rode on along the beach until they were safely a quarter of a mile from civilisation even then samir had refused to allow them a fire for warmth or food in case they were spotted by the wrong people the carriage driver sat awake in his seat guarding the vehicle and its slumbering occupant its too big for a merchant ship and not flying military pennants so if its not your ship its another pirate samir nodded satisfied and finally retrieved his flint and steel striking sparks on the dry straw leaves and sticks until they caught and roared into life with an orange light that cast eerie shadows around the small camp samir watched the ship out to sea as it gradually closed with the coast and nodded to himself once more as the empress came to a stop just within safe depth and a lifeboat was lowered almost time to part ways my friend the teamster gave him a grin and raised an eyebrow samir looked down to see the mans hand out open yes i remember the arrangement youll have to hang on until the others get here though as they waited samir strode over to the carriage and peered in through a crack in the curtains hed been doing so every ten minutes or so since they arrived never entirely convinced that asima would still be there the next time he could have tied her but would rather not have to there she was still slumped in the seat fast asleep and believing herself on the way to pelasia once again samir smiled as he returned to the waterfront the lifeboat was almost here now and samir frowned as he realised there were six people in the vessel surely ghassan hadnt brought an honour guard from the ship or some such rubbish he heaved a sigh of relief as the six occupants came into clearer view ghassan and ursa were accompanied by four of the more resourceful but less reputable people he employed from time to time in port the boat arrived at the gravel beach with a crunch and ghassan stepped out samir smiled at him with a raised eyebrow youve been using my contacts i used your name in the mermaid yes brother i had a little job i needed doing before we could saunter off to meet you one of the four a short dark and badlyshaven man flashed a dangerous look at samir your friend here offered us forty corona apiece and id hate to find out ive been stiffed samir samir laughed lightly hardly grim he turned to ursa you brought my bag with a nod the big pirate retrieved a waterproof sack from the boat and handed it over samir dropped it to the floor with a crunch and delved within removing a bag of coins opening it he began to count out large gold discs and proffered them to the man im afraid im rather low on corona at the moment but i do have these sols minted in germalla i believe the general exchange rate is around eight corona to a sol so if i give you say six sol apiece the extra should make up for the inconvenience of having to change the currency yes the man glared at samir and the captain shrugged bearing in mind that im in mdahz semiregularly and youll have plenty of opportunities to tell me if you have problems seven apiece the man said flatly you drive a hard bargain grim still you have me currently at a disadvantage seven it is but i shall expect preferential rates the next time we do business as the others reached out to collect their payment samir doled out the coins with a smile i presume i can leave you all here to work out the details of the return journey to the town you have carriage cart and plenty of horses as they nodded and examined their coins biting the gold to test its authenticity samir grasped ghassan by the shoulder and walked him away from the crowd toward the carriage the driver nodded respectfully down at him and reached out to take the coins the pirate captain proffered as the exchange took place quietly samir leaned closer to his brother conspiratorially and whispered have a quick look inside ghassan frowned and leaning across to the wagon pulled aside the drape a little to peer into the darkness within he blinked and then checked again to be sure his eyes did not deceive him what are you doing samir there was a groan from within now youve gone and woken her ghassan still its time she was up ghassan grasped samir by the collar and pulled him close as the sounds of stirring came from within the coach she cannot be trusted she tried to kill me samir shes sold us out more than once she values nothing but her own comfort and power and we were about to be rid of her probably for good samir nodded thats all certainly true ghassan but youre the one whos always going on about duty and whats right do you think for a minute that wed be doing the right thing sending her back to pelasia so she can plot the downfall of king ashar ghassan frowned as his brother went on pelasias been nothing but trouble for the last two decades and now at last theres a good reasonable educated man on their throne a man who wants to tighten ties with the empire hes the man who exiled asima and i gather dislikes her intensely given that asima knifed one of her oldest friends just because you were in her way what do you think she has planned for the king of pelasia but she couldnt she could ghassan and she will if someone doesnt stop her i asked her why she was going back and she told me flat that it was ambition and revenge ghassan continued to shake his head shes a wild animal ghassan samir said shaking his head sadly and while i wont put her down she needs to be tamed im a what they both looked round to see asimas face at the carriage window samir beamed at her ah the wildcat is awake good morning asima the door burst open and their captive dropped heavily from of the vehicle striding across the ground angrily to the brothers what is the meaning of this samir the pirate captain treated her to a warm smile ive been selfish asima very selfish now its time to think of others for a change people other than you time to give the world a breather and remove you from the game for a while ghassan shook his head so thats the plan we take her on board and flee i presume theres more to your scheme than this samir nodded oh far more ghassan and asima bear in mind that despite everything you see what i am doing is as much for your own good as everyone elses possibly more so asima folded her arms defiantly is that so kidnapping me for my own good samir nodded at some time since we were children you came to a fork in the road and went down the wrong one and its turned you into this but the nice thing about roads is that you can walk down them both ways even back to that fork so that you can go the right way this time asima blinked twice in a day shed been told much the same thing by both her oldest friend and that witch in the rags why was everyone so damn perceptive these days casting the blackest look she could muster at the brothers she turned to the small wiry man in black on the assumption you are for hire little man i will pay you handsomely to protect me from these two and to escort me on the rest of my journey grim a longtime resident of mdahzs most dangerous streets and a regular employee of samir grinned a largely toothless grin at asima you see if it werent for our arrangement with samir here id be tempted to take you up on that offer but be grateful im not about to cross him woman like you youd never get there wed have taken your money and then sold you to the desert traders for a lot more or maybe wed just have stopped for a while and had some fun on our own and left you in the desert it can be a lonely life asima sneered at him and spat at his feet pig he laughed as i said woman be grateful samir stepped forward youre coming with us asima i would rather you came aboard quietly and willingly but i will settle for any other way if necessary he sighed as he saw the colour rise in asimas face her jaw clenching ready to launch into yet another tirade oh for gods sake stepping past samir ghassan swung a powerful punch fast and unexpected connecting with asimas jaw and cheek so hard that it spun her on her feet and threw her to the ground samir blinked you never cease to amaze me brother ghassan shrugged and then bent to collect the unconscious woman from the floor and throw her gracelessly over his shoulder staggering momentarily as his leg wobbled beneath him well she was starting to get on my nerves as samir laughed the pair of them nodded their goodbyes to the port dogs as they gathered their gear and prepared for the long journey back to mdahz ghassan passed the silent form of asima a welt already beginning to show on her cheek to ursa who took her grinning as the three turned toward the boat that would take them back to the empress two mad bastard captains now this is going to be an interesting voyage part five the kindness of strangers the cruelty of friends in which captains collude ghassan shook his head once again and tapped the table with his index finger nothing good can come of this samir i think thats blatantly untrue ghassan again the shaking of the head the taller brother sat in a heavy wooden chair opposite his sibling in the captains cabin of the dark empress swaying slightly with the motion of the ship through every dip and swell i dont mean your plan in general its a good plan i have nothing against your plan in fact its the sort of thing id have liked to have come up with myself and i cant argue that im pleased you finally decided to take me into your confidence so whats the problem samir grinned ghassan ran his fingers through his wild curly hair getting them caught in the salty locks irritably he raked his hand free and sighed actually i can see a few gaping holes in your logic though i can assume youve already spotted them and have some cleverarsed way around them no the big problem is asima i think that just being near her befuddles your mind brother samir answered with a shrug youre all over the place when it comes to asima ghassan gave his brother a hard look its true samir laughed you dont trust her but you still feel sorry for her you agree that we cant just leave her to go merrily cutting a swathe through the innocent population of pelasia but you also dont want to confine or inconvenience her you dont want her free but you dont want her anywhere near us you see what i mean ghassan shook his head again you make it sound worse than it is enlighten me then what asima has become is the product of what has been done to her we remember her as a girl and she was one of us back then samirs turn to shake his head i think you look back with rosy vision when i think back on her youth i can see her playing the pair of us time and again i think all thats happened has merely accentuated her selfish ambition i hope youre wrong even the most noble of people can be changed by events look at you youve sunk ships taken lives and robbed people and we both know you were never that sort of boy samir laughed rosy vision again i think brother im under no misconceptions that i was born anything other than a rogue ghassan was starting to get irritated now listen we cannot just arbitrarily condemn asima to anything without being sure that there is no other possibility i live in constant hope that she will change and while that doesnt appear to be happening weve done nothing to help either perhaps if we try to push her in the right direction we can get the asima of old back you make it sound like im planning to have her executed alright ghassan weve a little time yet what do you want i want to give her the chance i want to try to help her i agree with your plan with reservations but i want to be sure that its necessary first samir nodded slowly then for the sake of your conscience ill give her the chance to prove to us that she can change that she can be reasonable healing is the province of belapraxis and as you know everything with the desert lady comes in threes well give her three chances but only three agreed agreed so samir sat back heavily what are your other reservations lassos basically and ghassan sighed samir lassos is the most infamous den of pirate iniquity in the world most criminals would be afraid to go there as for us well im an exnaval captain thats probably still on the top of their list of enemies to disembowel the only thing that might have knocked me off the top position is you overtaking me for what they likely see as betrayal and endangerment of the island neither of us is likely able to set a foot on that dock there without it being nailed to the timber by angry pirates he grinned there is a certain level of risk there ill grant you im just trusting that my dice roll is high enough to make them fold without rolling themselves theres still only one of you and eleven of them if youre wrong the odds are going to be very heavily stacked against us the smaller brother leaned forward over the table i have other friends even if things go the worst they can the odds arent as bad as you suggest and what of the council these are vicious old hardbitten pirates theyve only made it onto the council by being some of the most evil and remorseless bastards the world has ever known theyre not likely to fold easily and even if they do theyll stay put at their table and leave it to us samirs grinintensified ive already got that worked out just trust me ghassan ghassan sighed and then smiled a helpless smile i love the idea samir i really do i just hope youre right and it all comes together the captain stretched and stood this has been years in the making ghassan things have been unfolding and ive been manoeuvring them for months now alright theres a way ahead of us yet but you have no idea how much work ive already put in and whats gone right so far everything now hinges on two things our success or failure at lassos and what the governor decides to do the latter is out of our control but at least we can take charge of the former and thatll be at least as much down to you as to me the taller brother also stood rolling his shoulders i hope youre right and i hope were up to it well what now samir shrugged were still a way from lassos and even then well have to loiter around for a while until were sure of the path ahead in the meantime perhaps its time we checked on our passenger ghassan nodded and the pair strode across to the cabin door opening it and blinking as the fresh salty air wafted across them two cabins down the doctors cabin door remained firmly closed and locked a specially selected man with no sense of humour standing beside it duro were here to see the lady the big man nodded and withdrew a heavy key on a large iron ring from his belt reaching to the lock with it he inserted the key and then paused to knock heavily on the door people to see you step back from the door to the opposite wall of the cabin and therell be no trouble there was no sound from within she never replies the big man shrugged but shes probably done it capn shes missed two meals from being difficult and disobedient but she let us deliver the last one so i think shes learning samir shook his head i wouldnt be too sure about that duro but we can handle her open up the pirate nodded and turned the key in the lock stepping to one side he turned the handle and pushed and the door swung inwards samir ducked and ghassan stepped lightly to one side as a fork still covered in stew hurtled through the doorway at eye height and bounced off the wall opposite scattering away down the corridor with a metallic clatter asima youre aim is improving samir turned to his brother as he spoke does that count as one belapraxis is listening ghassan gave samir a hard look causing the smaller man to grin impishly as he turned back to the room and approached the doorway the cabins occupant out of sight around the door if youre going to throw anything else dont forget to adjust for height im coming in first still sporting his cheeky grin samir stepped through the door his hands wide and open in a conciliatory gesture good afternoon my dear the stew not to your liking asima sat on the bunk fingering the handle of the knife on her plate thoughtfully have you come to gloat over your prisoner or perhaps to take advantage of me ill warn you samir men have tried that before some of them stopped being men that very day samirs grin widened were just here for a little chat asima the woman on the cot opposite sat back and gestured to her surroundings the doctors room had been converted into what was in effect a prison cell the many drugs and herbs and pieces of sharp or dangerous equipment had been removed along with all the furniture barring the bed a rickety chair and a small desk the room was somewhat oppressive with just so much bare and dark wood moreover the plank that had been nailed thoroughly across the exterior of the window preventing its being opened cut out around half of the light making the interior dim and depressing you can dispense with the pleasantries i think she grumbled samir and ghassan entered and stood opposite her as the door was closed and locked by duro outside were trying to decide how best to proceed with you asima a sneer greeted that comment youve made it abundantly clear how you will do that you kidnapped me and prevented me from going home now you have three choices kill me free me or imprison me for the rest of my life neither of you has the strength of character to kill me and neither of you has the guts to free me i just wonder how you will go about imprisoning me and where you think could possibly be secure enough top contain me neither of you is very popular on either side of the law ghassan shook his head and opened his mouth but samir spoke first nothing has been decided yet i have made certain potential arrangements but i have yet to decide what to do about them however what you said does deserve a response his smile turned cold and feral i like to consider myself a good man despite everything but dont mistake good for weak if i decide that the world would be a safer place with you at the bottom of the sea believe me that i will cut your throat and drop you overboard myself ghassan is a better person than i but i doubt that even he would stop me he raised an eyebrow at his brother but ghassan said nothing his expression unreadable also do not think for a minute that i do not have the nerve to free you no matter what you have done to us in the past ghassan and myself know who and what you are and i have no fear of you asima the reason i took you away from your pelasian dream is far from personal lets say its my little contribution to the peaceful relations of pelasia and the empire to allow you to return to your games would be akin to setting a wild cat free in the famous royal aviary asima sneered and sat back still fingering the knife so you have no real decision to make ghassan stepped a pace forward frowning you say samir prevented you from going home asima you may be half pelasian by blood but you were born and raised in mdahz you are one of us whatever youve come to believe do you truly feel no kinship to your hometown the sneer turned on ghassan but its owner said nothing your father was a good man the tall brother continued quietly a man of the empire and he lies at rest in mdahz ive visited his grave have you there was no change in asimas expression as she raised her head slightly are you finished boring me ghassan sighed i believe so perhaps samir was right about you belapraxis has closed one of her eyes a trace of uncertainty passed suddenly across asimas face but disappeared in an instant to be replaced by yet more disdain and disgust get out and leave me to eat this filth in peace samir and ghassan exchanged a look and then turned to the door duro open up as the key was jangled in the lock a low and determined voice from behind them said bear in mind both of you that i have been enslaved imprisoned exiled and sentenced to death and i have walked away free and unharmed every time there is no power in the world that can contain me it is my destiny to reign even the gods have acknowledged that and when i do i will shake the world until it spits the pair of you out at my feet samir turned as the door opened and sketched a mock bow then since i have no wish to anger the gods i shall do everything in my power to make sure that you achieve your goals your magnificence the gravyspattered knife hit the door and dug deep with a wooden thunk just as the lock clicked shut in which asima rails against fate harus had joined the crew of the dark empress six years ago caught stealing food hed fled the guard in calphoris found himself at the docks and hid aboard the first vessel he could find since when hed never looked back even those first months after hed been discovered stowing away when the crew had been extremely harsh on him and hed had the worst jobs they could throw his way hed been grateful beyond belief it may have seemed to the rest of them that they were putting him through hell but the plain truth was that the worst they could dream up was heaven compared to life as a homeless beggar in the city his muscles might ache but his belly was full six years of slowly clawing his way up from that inauspicious beginning of forging a career as a sailor learning the ropes in quite a literal manner and of gaining the respect of his crewmates six long years of struggle and it had to end like this staggering against a doorframe staring down at the blood gushing from his chest harus felt like crying at the unfairness of it all but the pain and the horror paralysed him was he dead was that it he stared down at the tin bowl its meaty juicy contents spattered across the wooden floor he was only delivering food could he do anything to prevent what seemed inevitable now at least he could scream that would bring help and perhaps warn the others the cry died in his throat as asimas dining knife came in for a second attack slicing neatly across his windpipe and artery with a wheeze and a sigh pumping blood like the grand fountains of calphoris harus slid down the doorframe and slumped to the floor asima tutted irritably and brushed at the droplets that spattered the hem of her dress reaching down she wiped the knife on the boys tunic cleaning the viscera from it so that it gleamed silver once again edging close to the door she peered left and right the corridor was empty and dark the faint moonlight tempered by scudding clouds and not penetrating this far into the cabin sections interior clearly samirs cabin would be the one at the end on the assumption this daram was organised the same as ghassans military one had been the room opposite would be a social room for the more senior crewmen while the four between here and the captains cabin would be those of the first officer and the three other most senior crewmen the nearest two to her would be less important which meant that ursa and ghassan would be behind the two doors that flanked the captains cabin briefly she paused wondering for the hundredth time since she had settled on this course of action whether it might have been better to steal a lifeboat and try to make for land but she was no sailor and had no idea how far they were from shore now so such an act would be reckless the old crone had told her not to fight against her fate but that was assuming that there was such a thing as fate asima still struggled with the concept but logically if something were fated then anything she did was already written and therefore she was following the path and not fighting it whatever she tried that logic when it had come to her this afternoon had eased her tensions and helped her justify whatever needed doing this was a gamble of course the crew had no reason to support her even though ursa had been on good terms with her during their last brief stay at lassos but this was the only real path left open now in the navy it would be dealt with harshly but among pirates it was said that strength ruled and strength was something that asima had in abundance realistically it should be samir first the way you killed a serpent was to cut off its head ursa could be last he was clearly the least important but the more she thought of ghassan and his selfrighteous attitude the more the thought of him pinned to the bulkhead with his eyes rolled up into his skull appealed to her samir could wait ghassan might just have to go first call it a practice run still pausing asima held her breath as she listened the sounds from outside were muted in the night as the ship relied on sails the oars shipped for the duration the creak of timber was faint and if she listened extremely hard she could hear the distant murmur of low conversation between duty crewmen there was no sound from the room opposite presumably any eating drinking and carousing they had planned theyd done earlier in the evening taking a quiet gulp of air she stepped out into the corridor and padded silently deeper into the darkness the wooden beams creaked gently under her feet but the sound was lost amid the normal squeaks and groans of the ships timbers she paused again as she reached the next set of doors there was heavy snoring from the room on her left but no sound from the right keeping a watchful eye on the silent door she crept further passing those rooms and approaching the end of the corridor where the ornate door of samirs cabin taunted her perhaps she should go after the snakes head first after all no shed made her decision secondguessing and indecision suggested failure in either the planning or the execution of any scheme now which door leaning to the left she listened at the wood the very faint sounds of someone sleeping within could be ghassan could be ursa who knew crossing the corridor she leaned toward that door again the faint sounds of deep relaxed breathing it was a guess then one door held ghassan and one ursa they would both have to die anyway if she were going to stand a chance of usurping command of the ship she was sure enough of her own talents and persuasiveness that she didnt doubt for a moment she would sway the crew to her side but not while any of these three lived to defy her shrugging she silently ran through a childhood rhyme to make her decision the gleaming point of her sharp knife wavering back and forth with each line pointing at one door and then the other the closing stanza of the rhyme escaped her lips and asima looked down at the knife then up to the door on her left and shrugged nonchalantly now for the first real test of her abilities leaning in close she carefully grasped the handle and began very slowly to turn there was the faintest squeak and she lowered the speed of turn more moving the handle through a fraction of a degree at a time all the while listening for any change in the sleep pattern within it came as something of a relief when the door finally gave just an inch shed half expected them to be locked and while she was more than capable of overcoming that kind of difficulty after so many years practice in the harem of akkad it represented an added degree of danger slowly the door cracked open once more there was a faint creak to it had she opened it at normal speed the noise would have been loud enough to startle most sleepers awake but asima was nothing if not careful the door finally wide enough to allow access she slipped inside briefly she considered closing it but then if she were caught out and there was a noise a closed door would hardly protect her better to leave the exit clear for her to move on speedily silently she padded into the dark room a drape hanging over the window and obscuring all but the faintest glow as her eyes adjusted to the stygian gloom she picked out various furnishings and finally the bed for a moment she was a little disappointed to realise from the bulk of the figure in the bed that this was ursas room and not ghassans still she told herself once more they all had to go and this could be considered just an extra training run slowly she inched across to the bed the great bald man lay there barely covered by a single sheet and naked barring a set of underbritches he slept on his back eyes tight and mouth purring gently in a manner so quiet and calm and even ladylike that it brought a smile to asimas face that great tattooed head uttering such a tiny peaceful noise very easy positioning of course he would be a lot more peaceful in a minute taking a deep breath she raised herself up over the slumbering figure silent that was the thing silence first with a smile she placed her hand ready over his mouth not touching but ready should he get the chance to struggle the knife went in easily and slid across the neck to the ear opposite she shook her head in disbelief at how easy it really was surely they should have had more foresight than to give her a sharp knife to eat with if shed been their captor theyd have been lucky to get a spoon ursa awoke in understandable distress his eyes wide as the life sprayed from his neck he tried to shout something but it merely came out from his throat as bloody bubbles as he thrashed damn it he was going to make too much noise with all this waving around sighing asima drew the knife back her hand going to his chest to try and hold him down as he panicked dying she carefully drove her knife into his temple delivering a paralysing killing blow the big body a pile of sweating blubber slick with sweat and crimson gore shuddered and shook for a moment and then fell still the mans glassy eyes staring lifelessly at the ceiling asima nodded to herself one down and two to go and shed learned a valuable lesson silence from the mouth was only part of the job she had to make sure the thrashing around was kept to a minimum ghassan would be a better job once more she carefully cleaned the blade on the drape over the window it wasnt a fussy thing for the sake of cleanliness so much as the need to make sure she kept a solid grip on the weapon with no slippery blood beneath her fingers straightening and squaring her shoulders she crossed the room once more and peered through the door still no sign of movement or noise outside quietly she pulled the door to behind her closing it with the faintest of clicks a step or two and she was across to the other door once again she repeated her procedure turning the handle so slowly that the inevitable creaks and squeaks were almost dulled to inaudible levels the door refused to budge shaking her head irritably asima retrieved a pin from her luscious dark hair and set it into the lock her tongue protruding as she worked she eased the pin left and right finding the teeth of the mechanism and manoeuvring them into position the harem had been a great teacher for sure there was a slight click and asima stood back holding her breath the sound of breathing within continued without a change in pitch good the handle began to twist under her grasp and slowly ever so slowly she turned it and pushed the wooden portal gave way quietly inching open and revealing the dark cabin beyond drapes covered this window too casting a deep darkness over most of the room as her vision adjusted she realised that the contents of this cabin almost exactly mirrored those of ursas opposite the faintest gleam of silvery starlight shone from the window where the drapes had caught on the frame and left a narrow triangle of clear glass the beam fell across the bed and its occupant and asima heaved a sigh of relief despite everything she had half expected ghassan to be standing behind the door prepared for her or samir sitting in the chair waiting but no that beam of light illuminated the tall figure beneath the sheet and those curly ebony locks were unmistakably ghassans silently she crept across the room approaching the bed different method needed here ghassan was asleep on his side his back to her given how dangerous he could be she would have to make sure he was out of commission as soon as possible a killing blow first and then as he woke his life already ebbing she would then have to make sure he stayed silent she couldnt get to his throat without turning him over anyway and that mass of curly hair made any blow to the temple uncertain she might miss and merely crack his skull then hed have the best of her taking a deep breath she looked up and down the sleeping figure of her childhood love before shrugging bending and thrusting the knife to the hilt in his back the blade rasped as it slid between ribs making her shudder as the reverberation ran up her arm as she dealt the blow her other hand went straight around to the mouth clamping over it to keep her victim quiet ghassans eyes opened wide the shock of the sudden incredibly forceful wound filling him asima yanked the knife back out blood spattering both her and the floor as she did so and raised her bloodsoaked finger to her lips in a silencing motion shhhh as her childhood friends eyes blinked and his face went white she turned him gently onto his back her hand still over his mouth and leaned forward placing the tip of the blade on his throat beneath his ear ready to finish the job and thats when it all went wrong he should have been too panicked and weak paralysed he certainly shouldnt have the strength or presence of mind for this she clenched her teeth and squeezed her eyes shut against the intense pain as ghassan bit down hard on the hand over his mouth his incisors meeting in the heel of her hand she reeled a chunk of flesh an inch across missing from her palm as ghassan spat it out his eyes filling with fury this wasnt possible he should be dying he was dying but refusing to lie down and take it he still hadnt cried out though and despite the agony in her hand neither had she so there was still a chance gritting her teeth and ignoring the throbbing hand by her side she reached in with the knife once again to go for the throat but ghassan was already struggling to rise and as she leaned forward his arm came up like lightning shaped into something resembling a claw and delivered a sharp precise blow to her neck just below the jaw asima was already unconscious when she hit the floor the knife skittering away from her grasp ghassan stared and tried to rise from the bed the agony in his chest and back was unbelievable and threatened to drain the consciousness from him he tried to pull himself upright again and instead slid sideways and fell to the floor of the cabin face down his body shuddering and his legs flopping around could this be it had asima actually done for him had she already got to samir his eyesight was already dimming samir he bellowed once before unconsciousness took him and he lay motionless next to the prone form of asima in which the aftermath occurs samir noted with dismay the slick crimson coating of the doctors hands and forearms as he entered the captains cabin one of the crewmen opening and closing the door for him the mans face was unreadable but that meant nothing samir had known him long enough now to know cale had seen enough horror that his face had long since given up expressing his emotions yes the doctor reached down for the damp cloth at his belt and began to wipe the excess gore from his hands without looking up he talked as he worked at his cleaning the important thing is hell almost certainly live i dont like the almost the doctor shrugged im not about to give you any guarantee captain the next twenty four hours will be very telling though we were very lucky that you found him when you did hed have bled out in minutes longer as it is theres barely enough blood left in him to keep him going but blood heals though yes the doctors mouth curled up at the corner it replenishes yes the big problem your brother had was not the loss of blood but where the knife went in had he not been so weak and short of blood i would have opened him up to check his organs his organs forgive me doctor my medical knowledge is scant at best the doctor sighed his heart and his lungs im fairly sure theyre unharmed his breathing is surprising strong given the state hes in and his heartbeat is slow and measured so i dont believe theyve been harmed by the wound this in itself is miraculous as the blow was as precise as any assassin could achieve the blade should have gone into his heart and he should by all rights be dead samir frowned so why im not sure the doctor interrupted but a pelasian surgeon called passides wrote a text on organs in which he noted discovering in his long career several people whose organs were not quite in the regular position without opening your brother up i cant confirm it but thats simply the only explanation i can think of the knife went in between the fifth and sixth rib and was angled just right your brother is either very very lucky or one of the gods has a vested interest in him samir nodded images of the cult statue of belapraxis flashing across his vision so he should be alright im pretty certain thats the case there is the faintest possibility that the edge of the knife caught the cable down his back that the pelasians call a spinal nerve if thats the case then he may lose the use of his legs but thats a small possibility so i wouldnt worry unduly about that until hes awake samir slumped back in his seat and let out an explosive breath and when will that be again the doctor shrugged i wouldnt expect him even to wake today tomorrow he might but only for brief periods hell be very weak and very tired and his blood is so low that hes almost white he may not be up and about for weeks i think ghassan might surprise you on that can i see him the doctor shook his head absolutely not he is staying alone and undisturbed at least until the first time he wakes i have my assistant sitting with him constantly hes fine but i dont want any disturbance for him samir nodded take good care of him doctor and thank you for all your efforts now i may catch up on missed sleep and i suggest that you do the same captain im beyond sleep now cale beside the suns made an appearance now and things will require my attention were nearing lassos and things are afoot the doctor shrugged and turned approaching the door and banging on it with a clean elbow a moment later it swung open and the man paused in the entrance for a moment ill let you know as soon as he wakes captain as samir nodded the man disappeared down the passageway outside the man by the door began to shut it but samir waved a hand at him patus where is the lady asima now shes being held in the firepot locker captain i trust you had the forethought to remove anything dangerous or useful from the room first its as empty as a germallans head sir the man grinned samir nodded ive not known many germallans but for the sake of argument i will assume that means yes do you want to see her captain no i dont think so patus if i meet her at the moment i might just have to kill her out of hand and i made a vow to belapraxis concerning her the goddess may have closed another eye but until the third shuts ive my hands tied in asimas case has ursa been taken care of the smile slid from the mans face the first officer had been a popular man and the crew were taking his death hard samir had the suspicion that asimas ribs had probably met with a few boots during her apprehending and incarceration his bodys been cleaned up and wrapped we thought wed let him go at the eighth bell if thats alright with you sir he never liked being up early anyway samir gave a sad little smile agreed anything else sir no thank you thatll be all the man saluted and closed the door to the cabin leaving the empress captain sitting silent and thoughtful in his chair after a long pause spent staring at the desk he turned and peered out of the window past the great beam of the rudder and out to sea in the wake of the ship belapraxis im not much one for praying as i expect youve noticed youve put me in an uncomfortable position i said in your name that id give her three chances to redeem herself right now im tempted beyond reason just to go and do away with her but would that anger you after all ghassans life is also in your hands would it really piss you off that much if i got rid of her he sighed a deals a deal i suppose when im sure i can spend long enough in a room with her without strangling her then ill give her another chance but look after ghassan he sat quietly once more pondering until a commotion on deck above caught his attention listening carefully he heard someone calling about a sail a sail on the horizon and the footsteps were all above him so they must be at the rear rail frowning he turned once more and peered out into the distance squinting into the dark waters the sun may be up but only just and it wasnt making much of a difference in the west yet was there a sail he wished fervently that ghassan was here with his sharp eyes dammit grumbling he pushed back his chair and strode across the room pulling open the door and marching down the corridor to the open air turning he climbed the stairs to the command deck and approached the knot of sailors standing at the rail nice to know that something important enough to drag you all from your positions is not important enough to send someone down to find me the comment was only halfjoking and the faces of the men fell sir we thought you had enough on your plate until we were sure what it was samir brushed the matter aside and frowned so talk to me the lookout reckons he saw a sail behind us but were not sure cant see anything now samir shrugged well were not on that tight a schedule slow us up a little and well see what we can see the men nodded and ran off furling one of the sails samir leaned on the rear rail and watched the horizon intently as he felt the momentum of the vessel lessen very slightly more and more the pace slowed and gradually the men drifted back to join him at the stern see anything yet sir not yet perhaps our lookouts been dreaming whats that someone said samir peered into the dim distance where the purple sky met the black sea in the strange dawn moment squinting he concentrated that my friend is a sail there was light laughter around him erm captain yes thats not a sail thats three sails samir peered into the distance and smiled more than that someone else added i can see at least two more bloody hell its a fleet samir grinned captain whyre you laughing theyre white sails and that means theyre navy ships yes he nodded and now that i can see them a little better i note there are a couple of black sails in there too on the assumption theyre not travelling with other pirates i think our navy fleet out there has a few pelasians in it too he noted the uncertain faces of those around him do you trust me of course captain but no buts mannius trust me everything is going according to plan the governor is coming to see us and hes brought a few friends i wonder what decision hes come to we cant face that many alone captain samir nodded and smiled youre absolutely right my friend all haste to lassos then get that sail back up and full of wind and lets get to port the deck around him burst into life as sailors went about their business leaving the captain alone at the rear rail where he peered off into the distance at the pursing fleet what have you decided governor what are you going to do in which the empress goes home back away from the door if youre within reach when i open it ill break whatever i can touch asima was standing at the far side of the small bare storeroom an expression of glowering hatred on her face when the pirate finished with the lock and pushed the door inwards with a groan what now captain wants you on deck does he indeed well wed best not keep him waiting then asima was gratified to note as she stepped forward how the man moved carefully back and out of her way if nothing else her little exercise in butchery had earned her a reputation to be feared and in many ways fear was more useful than respect or love you dont have to be quite so jumpy sailor im unarmed and im hardly going to gut you in broad daylight in front of your friends am i she looked down at the wrappings around her throbbing hand besides im hardly in a position to wield a weapon am i the big man gave her an unpleasant look and pointed at the stairs that led up on deck the square hatch above letting in bright sunlight that stung her eyes after hours in the dark ammunition store nodding asima strode past him her head held defiantly high and keeping her pace deliberately calm and controlled the deck was alive with activity though curiously quiet asima frowned for a moment until she caught sight between the working sailors of the approaching jagged black rocks the pirates always seemed to fall into an awed silence around the reefs of the dead still that explained samirs sudden desire to see her theyd arrived at lassos what he intended to do now was however still a mystery goaded on by the angrylooking pirate she strode along the deck combing out the irritating knot in her hair with her fingers this sea air really was no good for her the sooner she could get all of this behind her spike a few disobedient and irritating heads and set herself up in the palace of akkad the better ah asima samir nodded at her as they reached the command deck you have a curious look on your face contemplating murder again i was picturing your head on a spear tip samir she replied with a tight smile and wondering where it would look best certainly somewhere i could admire it regularly and somewhere near jasmine to hide the stench samirs grin was as unpleasant as her own and despite the superficial smiles on the command deck the undercurrent of malice was so thick and powerful that several of the sailors on deck moved further away from the pair sweet and charming as ever my dear be grateful for belapraxis asima frowned in incomprehension and samir squared his shoulders we are about to arrive at lassos it will take a while to get through the rocks as youll remember but then well dock and when we do i plan to move you to a secure temporary location to keep you safe from harm while i go to the council hall samir glared at his prisoner i would have liked ghassan or ursa to join me when i went to address the council but you appear to have gone through my crew like a plague i dislike it when my plans are changed for me but we will prevail asima shrugged carelessly so samir went on you will be coming ashore with me along with a number of the more fearsome and trustworthy of my crew we will be heading through the town and up the side of the hill when we reach the council hall i will leave you and my men will take you somewhere safe im warning you about all this now because i need to advise you against trying any of your madness you may hate me but remember that on lassos i may be the only person not planning to drown you on sight stick with my men for your own safety asima frowned what are you planning that is none of your concern asima just go with the men when they take you to the safe house and try not to kill anyone on the way well speak again when ive finished with the council asimas frown deepened but she held her tongue the two stood in silence for several minutes watching the rocks as the dark empress reached the outer edge of the reef the mist closed in on the bow of the ship and despite the bright afternoon sunshine within moments the empress was cold damp and gloomy as she peered ahead into the mist she could make out the figures of the socalled ghosts or wraiths that occupied the glistening rocks it was easy in this mist to lose track of the time and turning to the stern she wondered whether the mist had closed in behind yet suddenly she realised the empress was not alone samir mmm who are they samir turned to look over the rear rail at the array of small white sails interrupted by the occasional black triangle dotting the horizon behind them oh friends of yours i think probably not friends of mine asima rolled her eyes samir never gave a question a straight answer and the longer she knew him the more it annoyed her she really would have to put him out of her misery soon you do realise that theyre going to blockade the island now that they know where it is trap you all and me along with you samir smirked is the governors arrival not part of your plan asima you told him about me the empress and the dead mans compass so i can only assume you told him everything you know about lassos the reefs the council and the ships his smile was grating on her asima sighed so they must have been following us since we left mdahz then youve very little choice now you and your worthless friends are about to meet an unpleasant end as criminals and pirates want me to help i can make it fast and relatively painless just a short sharp blow and its over much nicer than swinging from a public gibbet samirs jaw hardened enough now asima in around fifteen minutes we will reach the inner perimeter of the reef and approach the island itself at that point things will become rather busy and i will be occupied remember that you need to behave or i cannot guarantee your safety his companion glared at him and then returned her gaze to the misty figures around the ships hull reaching pleadingly to the passing vessel one day she would see to it that samir and his crew joined them the image of him on his knees on a rock pleading for his life as she drifted past was a satisfying picture captain a sailors head popped up over the top of the steps from the main deck samir turned to look captain the doc sent me your brothers awake and you can see him if you want samir grinned my day just improved a great deal thank you and lead on as he stepped toward the ladder he addressed the large pirate that had brought asima from her cell make sure shes got at least four guards around her at all times and dont let her near anything important or dangerous ill be back before we dock reaching the stairs he clambered down them after the medical orderly and entered the corridor making for the open doorway of the doctors cabin the scene that greeted him within made him start for a moment his brother lay on the bed on his side and facing away from the door with the doctor probing around his back ghassans shirt was up around his neck and there was a nasty wound half way up his ribs laced with black thread and puckered with red yellow and white flesh the sight was momentarily horrifying until he realised that the shape and discolouration was largely due to the pressure the wound was under as ghassan moved his arms and torso indeed he appeared to be making windmilllike motions with his arms causing the wound to ooze and change samir gulped down air is everything alright the doctor looked up surprised at the interruption what oh yes im just running a few tests the wound may look unpleasant but it doesnt seem to have done any lasting damage and this man seems to have a remarkable constitution my orderly may he be cursed with wakefulness for a thousand years fell asleep on watch and when he awoke your brother was standing at the window looking out the body shook and samir jumped before he realised that ghassan was laughing ghassan you need to be a little more careful you nearly died last night the doctor stopped prodding things and stood back as ghassan rolled slightly and came up with a groan to sit on the edge of the bed he was deathly pale but the smile on his face was warm and full of life the captain sighed with relief samir your doctor here tells me that im a freak i never used that word gah patients samir grinned well you know what they say the docs a miserable old goat but his hearts in the right place well he is a little impatient samir and ghassan laughed as the doctor stood and scowled at them dont overexert yourself he barked at his patient i will be back in less than ten minutes and then you will be resting again if i have to knock you out myself to achieve it captain ten minutes yes samir nodded gratefully as the man left the room ghassan i am so glad to see this i was worried that shed have done some permanent damage to you this may sound a little heartless but its a damn good job she came after you before me you managed somehow to floor her before she could finish you off i rather think if id been first that shed have managed to dispatch me before i woke ghassan shrugged and then winced at the pain actually though this is painful its not actually stopping me from doing anything the doc says theres no reason i couldnt walk around and carry things apart from the fact that im still weak from loss of blood and even thatll heal in time ive been waiting until he goes away for a bit so that i can get dressed and come above stupid but very useful since i could really do with your help were almost at lassos the governors fleet is hot on our tail and i need to address the council with you beside me if you can manage it ghassan nodded of course now what have you done with asima shes been held in a temporary brig samir replied with a shrug but ive had her taken on deck under guard in preparation for our arrival ghassan nodded perhaps its a good thing that i didnt kill her last night given your plan but im still vaguely sorry that i didnt its going to take a supreme effort of will not to push her overboard onto the reef i made a promise to you and belapraxis remember three chances i figure shes had two for us to kill her out of anger or vengeance before the goddess has her judgment would be to defy the healing mother and defying a goddess is never a good thing especially when one is about to attempt such a thing as we are ghassan nodded again very well looks like the stage is set since were at lassos with asima you me and the governor all the players are here too now we have to get your little production underway he grinned weve still got a couple of minutes before the doctor gets back pass me my shirt and help me upstairs impulsively samir enfolded his brother in a hug eliciting a groan of discomfort i couldnt do this without you ghassan in which the council sits by the time the empress touched the jetty the hull bouncing away several times before settling and men jumping off to tie ropes a crowd had already gathered at the far end a twitch crept into asimas eyelid as she watched from the relative safety of the command deck down on the main deck samir stood with a sailor she didnt know supporting the sagging figure of ghassan her erstwhile victim had glanced at her only once in the few minutes since they had emerged from below decks and his expression might have been unsettling had she cared more the port was chaotic with people flocking to the jetty despite being involved in a thousand petty tasks of their own cargo was stacked everywhere and asima had noted eleven other jetties were occupied which meant that every ship based at lassos was currently berthed here it seemed unlikely that samir had managed to engineer a situation where everyone was in port so it could be pure luck but then samir like her made his own luck asima heard the man behind her clearing his throat meaningfully and as she glanced at him he gestured that she should descend the steps and join the captain her bulky escorts gathered around as she moved forward and kept close pace with her as she climbed down and strode head high to the place amidships where samir and ghassan were watching the boarding ramp being run out to dock from here she had a better view of the crowd on the jetty as shed fully expected their faces were not the smiling visages of those come to welcome their compatriots home the word mob better fitted the situation in the old tales she could have imagined this lot brandishing farm implements and shouting before she was roughly manhandled into position next to the brothers she did note the striking and attractive features of captain faerus samirs friend among those waiting faerus looked nervous the plank slid home onto the jetty and samir and the other man helped ghassan down as soon as they reached the slippery timbers of the dock though ghassan waved the man away and continued wobbling slightly on his own his fingers locked round samirs arm for support and tensing every time a badlyplaced step sent a shock up his back the large sailor behind asima nudged her toward the plank and she tottered carefully down it to join the brothers stay with us all the way up the hill this is not a good time for you to play games a wrong step or word now could get us all killed before i can do anything asima nodded at samir her time would come later when he was less on guard slowly allowing for ghassans careful gait the three of them walked toward the mass of angry looking people at the end of the jetty half a dozen burly sailors from the empress following up and surrounding asima cutting off any path of escape samir came to a halt a few yards from the crowd and raised his voice i need to call a meeting of the council immediately faerus shaking his handsome head his jet black long and straight hair whipping back and forth filled the uncomfortable silence that followed too late samir the council went into session the moment your sail appeared among the reefs i expect theyre busy right now deciding how many pieces to cut you into a humourless smile crept across samirs face good their timing is auspicious he raised his voice to address the whole group let us through i have to address the council faeurs but you had best get to it as well the time we spoke of is upon us i will meet you as planned in the safe house faerus frowned so soon he paused a moment and then thrust out his arms heaving people aside get out of the way and let captain samir through to address the council the force with which he pushed caused a few spectators to stumble and fall and the crowd quickly parted to allow them passage asima gave the tall pirate captain an appraising look she recognised him in a vague way from the night she had spent in his lodgings on her last visit here but the alcohol had dimmed her senses a little that night and she hadnt realised at the time just how enigmatic and attractive the man really was strikingly handsome clean shaven and with immaculate hair faerus wore grey silks from the eastern lands beyond the empire he was in excess of six feet tall and had a powerful smooth voice like liquid honey she had the feeling that if faerus ordered them to even the rocks would move out of the way shall i join you first the man asked of samir best not you and the others will have to be ready on the assumption that i return shortly just meet me later and make sure orins aware too faerus nodded and sketched a bow as the three passed him and began the interminable climb to the council chamber on the hill the walk up the sloping street was familiar to her and if anything even less pleasant than last time on her previous visit she had been unknown and had elicited mixed reactions of interest lust and suspicion now however every face hardened as it turned to them matters were made all the worse by the painfully slow pace of the journey hampered as they were by the wounded ghassan after minutes that seemed like hours they reached the point where the street made a hairpin bend and marched off back across the hillside through the upper tiers of the town here stood the council hall with its great marble columned portico speaking volumes of the faded glory of the island alright this is it i shall speak first then its your turn ghassan are you alright definitely up to this your testimony is solid support but i expect i can work them around myself if you cant manage ghassan shook his head leave it to me ill be fine with a deep breath samir turned to asima and her guards take her to surafanas house on the hill if faerun and orin have been efficient it should be empty but provisioned and there should be a good secure room for asima dont rely on the room though i want at least two of you in full sight of her at all times asima glowered at him as the large pirate next to her nodded and grasped her upper arm tightly well keep her nice and safe capn you be there soon samir nodded unless the council have other plans ghassan and i will follow you up very shortly asima continued to glare at samir as she was turned away and marched in a nononsense manner up the slope in the opposite direction doubling back behind the town samir turned to ghassan and smiled follow my lead then ghassan concentrating on the task at hand and keeping close attention on his brother whose shoulder he still grasped for support entered the fortress of his enemies for the first time as a willing visitor in other days he may have taken a more keen interest in this place that had been so sought after by his superiors for decades instead he merely glanced briefly at the interior as they passed through the grand entrance and the outer room making sure ghassans grip was secure on his shoulder samir threw open the door to the council chamber and stood in the doorway gazing at the u shaped table arrangement the seats were occupied by the motliest bunch that ghassan had ever laid eyes on mostly older retired pirates they were suntanned and weathered like the faces of a sandstone cliff displaying networks of scars punctuated with jewellery and tattoos clearly the hawklike dry and emaciated figure occupying the central chair like an animated and mummified corpse was the most venerable member equally clearly he had no love for samir glancing around it surprised ghassan that there was no one on guard either outside the doors or within the chamber but then who on an island of pirates would dare to interrupt a meeting of their elders apart from his brother naturally there had been a heated argument going on within as they entered samir striding out front while ghassan dropped behind closing the door after them the last threads of the argument tailed off as the council regarded their visitors the last voice fell silent as the twelve most powerful men on lassos stared in astonishment at the nerve of the wayward captain before them captain samir you have not been summoned yet samir nodded and smiled you have my apologies for the interruption gentlemen and i realise that i am currently not the lassos favourite son but i am afraid that this simply cannot wait an ebonyskinned man pierced and covered in gold jewellery narrowed his eyes captain samir you are insolent the council is deciding your fate and you should not be here until ordered samir shrugged this council can pronounce any judgement they wish enforcing it is another matter entirely but please allow me to speak i am not here to argue with you but to present you with the opportunity you need ghassan noted an almost instant polarisation among the faces of the councillors the elder two thirds frowned and glared at the insolent young captain before them while the remaining younger council members took on a thoughtful look almost as if they had been expecting something of the sort but then ghassan realised with a smile samirs reputation for innovative action and careful planning would already have made an impression on these younger councillors ghassan muttered under his breath just loud enough for his brother to hear samir concentrate on the younger ones theyre almost with you samir gave an almost imperceptible nod as the aquiline elder growled at him this council has no wish to hear from you or your whore son brother im not sure thats entirely true elder halcar samir smiled let him speak halcar barked one of the younger men dressed in crimson velvet and with a neat scar across the bridge of his nose samir is one of the best we have if he says he has something of use for us only the shortsighted would do away with him before asking more thank you master culin you are insightful as always im afraid this will not sound good at first but i must ask you to let us finish before you pronounce any judgements the hoarse older man at the centre with the parchmentthin skin and the aquiline face glared at samir you presume to order your elders around samir be very careful samir bowed slightly no insult intended master halcar but this is very urgent and very important go on the one called culin urged the time has come masters of lassos to conclude our business with the imperial navy of calphoris as we reached the reefs on our way here a fleet of imperial daram with pelasian support was close enough to breath down our necks even now they will be encircling lassos blockading us and effectively ending our time as a free port of nonaligned raiders if you will the effect of the news was fascinating the men of the council exhibited half a dozen different expressions on a theme of shock anger and panic all but culin who nodded sagely ghassan was interested to note no sign of surprise in the mans features there was a strange pause for a second or so in which the room filled with an oppressive silence and then suddenly the council exploded in argument please gentlemen samirs voice cut across the noise the arguments tailed off as the councillors turned back to the speaker i am going to leave you to decide on the course of action when i have finished i believe the only sensible choice is for the fleet of lassos to arm up crew up and sail out en masse to meet the forces of the empire however i realise that this sounds insane so let me lay a few things on the line first he spread his arms dramatically for the last few years imperial control of the sea has been tightening notably with pelasia as an ally now all the military have really had to occupy their time is making life difficult for the captains of lassos our activity and takings have fallen dramatically in this time and rarely do our captains manage an engagement without having to run for safety at the end things are becoming untenable unless we take back control of our sea we are facing the extinction of lassos lest we fight back and that is a painful conclusion to have arrived at but i have been trying to find a solution for years now a feeling passed among the audience the council may not like hearing this but there was no denying the truth of samirs words in addition i see no other course of action as feasible lassos is not an abundant island the vegetation here will support life but only just while people could live here indefinitely their diet would be extremely dull and the food quantity would support only a handful at most our survival here has always relied on our takings which are now too meagre to support the population our supplies may last a few months but in the end we will be forced to take action against any blockade we would be better dealing with it now before they are set in and comfortable rather than later when they are fully prepared and fortified against us and why are they here captain samir the elder growled why have you brought our enemies to us samir sighed quite simply we were betrayed and i allowed it to happen in order to bring us to this point there was another explosion of blustering and arguing samir stood back and crossed his arms waiting for the noise to die down as it did culin being the first to calm the young councillor waved his arms samir asked us not to judge until he was finished lets hear him out samir nodded and looked over his shoulder ghassan the taller brother stepped forward still leaning heavily on samir you are all no doubt aware who i am you may not however be aware of my current situation there was a tense silence and the ebony skinned pirate lord nodded quietly culin has informed us that you are no longer employed by the military of the empire culin laughed more than that saja hes actively a wanted man my people have been seeing wanted posters going up all over the coastal cities theres a bigger price on his head at the moment than samirs though theyre both sought after i gather the pair of them blew part of the city wall to pieces in mdahz samir nodded impressed your information is remarkably uptodate master culin that happened only just before we left to come here the council members nodded each involved in their own thoughts on the brothers before them ghassan cleared his throat a young woman named asima who was here recently with my brother later took the opportunity to visit with the governor in mdahz she sold out not only samir and myself but the location and details of lassos even the existence of the compasses you use it is asima who has brought the fleet here i was in mdahz at the time and spoke to asima myself and i can confirm the truth of this samirs only part in that is to allow her to do so that alone is enough to hang him captain ghassan nodded i imagine so but samir believes that you can fight the fleet and win i am i must say considerably more sceptical over the matter but when my brother is sure he is usually correct as im sure youre all aware i myself am here for two reasons firstly to give my evidence as i just have and secondly to seek sanctuary and safety with my brother since i have nowhere else to go culin stood as ghassan stepped back and frowned i have no doubt that samir and his brother are telling the truth gentlemen as you know i have men in every port and some even hidden in places of authority in mdahz and calphoris everything i have heard supports this story the fact remains however that whether his intentions were good or not samir has brought our enemies to us for that he should by all rights be put to death ghassan winced at the comment but culin was already going on however if he is right we have an opportunity here and in that case we really need any man we can get and certainly one as wily and lucky as samir he turned to the brothers i am tempted toward leniency samir convince us we can win very well master culin let me give you the full tale i have been looking for a way to break the growing naval control of the sea of storms ever since i first took command of the empress asima while believing she has been playing me has in her betrayal been the very linchpin of my plan he stepped forward once more under the suspicious gaze of the councillors i had to find a way samir continued to bring the governors fleet to battle with our own on favourable terms and this was far from easy given the number of ships available to them compared with our twelve i could never have persuaded you to launch an assault on calphoris so i had to bring them here to provide you with no alternative once we clear the sea of the governor and his fleet we can retake what is ours and perhaps even more the hoarse wickedlooking old chief councillor snorted and pointed at samir we still have twelve ships samir while they still have scores what you have done is exterminated us not saved us samir smiled not quite what the governor does not currently know is just how many people i have placed in prime positions on board his ships in the last few years some of my less savoury friends from mdahz have been serving on board the imperial darams for years awaiting this very opportunity as you know i always plan things well in advance in the silence that followed a light voice chuckled and then began to laugh out loud master culin leaned forward steepling his fingers captain samir i would really hate to play you at dice you have just answered for me one of the greatest mysteries of the past year the other councillors looked at him in surprise culin laughed on no less than four occasions in recent months documents have come into my possession that made no sense documents referring to the hiring and transfer among the imperial coastal forces of people that i wouldnt trust to open a door for me without stabbing me in the back and stealing my purse i could never figure out why the governor was putting such dubious and dangerous people in such important positions samir smiled i am a little disappointed in my associates leaving a paper trail but you are correct master culin if my moves have all paid off the odds will be considerably improved several of the enemy ships should be in a position to switch sides and join us and a number of others will find themselves the victim of sabotage i do not like leaving things to chance he noted the thoughtful looks on the faces of a number of the councillors we have a chance we have needed this chance for months and now it is before you it is up to the masters of lassos as to whether they take it we have a few hours possibly even days before we have to move against them so we will go to surafanas house which lies empty and settle in there until you reach a decision you know where to find us samir turned and sauntered casually through the door and out into the entrance hall ghassan following close on his heels and closing the door behind them just as a loud debate began to kick in around the table ghassan frowned as they stepped out into the fresh air and looked up the road toward their destination that culin seems to be supporting you but i think youll need to watch him hes clever samir nodded he is clever very clever and very well informed too but that ghassan is exactly what im counting on now come with me and i shall introduce you to the supporting cast in my little production in which belapraxis is honoured the house of the former head of the council the recently deceased surafana was more an eyrie than a mere home a grand residence constructed on a narrow ledge much of the building was held up by great supports formed from the boles of trees driven at an angle into the cliff the approach had taken asimas breath away partially from the sheer impressiveness of the structure and its positioning but also with the thought that this house that looked to be held up against impossible conditions was about to be her home at least for a few hours it was not that she feared heights or at least shed never realised that she did but this was something else like being dangled over an immense drop with nothing to cling on to samir had chosen well the only remotely safe exit from the building was the route by which they entered and there was no way she would be leaving without permission equally of course if things went badly at the meeting this was clearly the most easily defensible position on the island and so she had been bundled into the house with no ceremony waited while the pirates chose a room for her and was then escorted to a very secure chamber with only one door and a window that looked out onto a precipitous drop to the roofs of the town more than a hundred feet below the escort had left the door open and one of their number sat on a chair opposite his eyes locked on the makeshift prison cell for the first five minutes of her incarceration asima had sat in one of the three chairs at the single table in the room and stewed over the situation once again as so often in the last few years she felt largely helpless and that aggravated her not being in control set her teeth on edge of course her plans had now changed once more so things were still quite uncertain whether the old crone in the desert was right with her uncanny sight and her prediction of asimas rise to power or not asima was sure in herself of her future even if gods and fate had nothing to do with it she would make damn sure it happened and now samir was about to put her in a position to make it happen without realising it she wasnt sure exactly what she would need to do yet since that depended on how events unfolded however when they went back out to sea she was sure she could find a way to sell him out to the imperial fleet and deliver him to the governor and there were pelasians among the fleet too it was all coming together she couldnt quite see how yet but conditions were falling into place and when she finally achieved her goals and left prince ashars corpse to the jackals while she sat on the veranda of the palace in akkad she would make the world pay for what it had put her through in recent years she smiled oh yes streets would run with the blood of those who had got in her way five minutes of musing relaxed her a little and she began to become impatient for news samir and ghassan surely would be brief with the council and then theyd come here and shed see how the next small step in her plan fell into place irritably she stood glancing at the pirate guard wondering whether he would come and restrain her if she moved out of sight he merely watched with scant interest of course she could hardly escape from here stretching her legs she began to explore her cell this was some sort of storeroom from what she understood the master of this house had been one of the council who had passed on recently after his death it appeared that the house had remained empty a quick look at the dusty surfaces told her that no one had bothered tending to the interior though the lack of valuables decoration and useful items suggested that other island occupants had been through here like locusts taking anything of value arching her eyebrow in interest she began to open and close cupboards and drawers junk the room was full but full of junk trinkets knickknacks and miscellaneous rubbish every door she opened or drawer she pulled on revealed more of the pointless accumulations of a lifetime hoarding she sighed not even anything that could keep her entertained while she waited at least there could have been her thoughts fell into silence as she opened a deep drawer at waist height in a tall cabinet and the next piece of her scheme fell into place asima smiled as she carefully and delicately picked up the handheld torsion bow that lay abandoned amid the junk it was loaded with a narrow needlelike iron bolt just under four inches long which was exceedingly lucky given that there was no supply of ammunition with it she frowned at it and shrugged shed not a lot of experience with missile weapons but shed handled one of these before and it was nice and simple taking a quick glance around the doorframe she saw the pirate guard still watching the room with a bored gaze he couldnt see the cupboard around the corner and she smiled as she picked up the weapon being careful to keep it angled so that the ammunition stayed in place just to be sure she put her finger on the bolt and slid it back and forth a little it was free and unjammed a flick removed the catch that prevented misfires nodding to herself she held it carefully in position behind her back and then returned to her seat making sure she kept her front to the guard he paid hardly any attention to her merely looking up briefly as she reappeared from around the corner slowly ever so carefully she manoeuvred the bow from behind her back so that it rested on her knees under the table every movement was kept tightly controlled and masked by innocent actions such as a scratch a glance around or a yawn by the time she heard the activity at the front door the weapon was securely held in both hands beneath the table this next move required subtlety she dropped her head dejectedly apparently resigned to her fate and broken by captivity of course samir wouldnt fall for that for a second but it might distract him from what was really going on with someone as sharp as samir it was a matter of throwing enough signals and suspicious activity at him that he didnt know which way to turn samir was sharp enough but the iron bolt on her knee was sharper still and so was asimas aim faerus and orin will be here any time now with the most trusted senior members of their crews the next few days will be a time that both the council and the governor will remember for many years samirs voice was light and betrayed a little excitement as he entered the front room of the house helping ghassan as he went the taller brother was staggering wearily not a shock after what shed done to him but it still surprised and irked her that what was undoubtedly a killing blow seemed to have done such little to him next time the opportunity came her way she would make it slower and considerably more certain he may survive a single blow but see how long he lasted with no skin ill wait here samir her attempted victim said in a tired voice ill have a drink while we wait but i just dont have the patience or energy to deal with asima right now samir nodded ill only be a few minutes then we can get down to planning he turned to one of the other crewmen in the room jabir can you break out the drinks ill have one in a minute when i return asimas fingers tensed on the trigger as samir strode toward the doorway his face was a strangely unreadable expression there seemed to be mixed hope anger irritation desire and humour in roughly equal amounts despite some heavy competition it won out as his most irritating look of all time asima he began as he turned and closed the door leaving the two of them alone in the room she raised her eyes very slowly until her gaze met his her steely dark eyes held his as he squared his shoulders as ive said and im considered a man of my word i will not harm you despite everything you have done when our business here is concluded we will go our separate ways and gods willing our paths will never cross again i am bound by the promise i made when i took you back from pelasia to try and help you achieve your goal asima shrugged you are a liar samir you veer wildly between vowing to help me on my path back to power and stealing me away whenever i get close in order to save your precious innocents innocents are merely criminals that havent been caught yet samir a man in your position should know that everyone is disposable no exceptions samir shrugged there are innocents in relative grades ill admit but i know they exist you however asima are unable to recognise them since i now realise that you were never one yourself even when we were carefree children ghassan believes that you have become this person because the world turned its back on you i personally believe that you were always this person but it took certain events to trigger your release from the prison of youth enough talk samir i recognise that i have a struggle ahead of me but it will be considerably easier without you standing in the way purposefully and smoothly like the most professional pelasian assassin she stood the chair sliding back and toppling behind her as she brought the hand bow up in a graceful arc and pulled the trigger to release the bolt at neck level it was a speedy smooth bold and deadly accurate move the weapon aimed precisely for the centre of the throat unfortunately for asima the result was a metallic click a sad little twang and the bolt rolled off the groove and fell to the floor she stared in anger at the bow and then up at samirs grinning face no that was his most irritating look of all time i see you found the bow good i would have hated to have gone to such lengths with no appreciable result why she demanded angrily to appease belapraxis and to settle the matter in ghassans mind your tongue is more twisted than any serpents and no word that slips from it can be trusted but your choices your actions even tell us what your heart contains and yours asima my dear contains only black emptiness she cast the useless sabotaged weapon aside and crossed her arms defiantly as samir strode toward her and now that youve eased your conscience you can drop youre the charade of your vow to help me and have me killed instead at least have the balls to do it yourself and dont leave the job to one of your underlings samir smiled that vulture smile again as he came close face to face with her and a yard away hardly asima i keep my promises with a snort she turned her back on him good samir said with relief that makes it easier his blow to the back of asimas head was surprisingly gentle but accurate and strong enough to knock the consciousness from her samirs only concession to his feelings was to let her fall heavily and painfully to the floor without catching her sleep well all our worlds are about to change in which the order is given samir opened the door just as the runner tried to knock on it causing him to lose his balance and stagger a little the young sailor was out of breath and quite red faced and samir waited patiently for him to regain his feet and take a deep breath the lad looked up to see samir waiting with his arms crossed the tall pale and gaunt figure of his brother at his shoulder and a collection of powerful men gathered in the background captain samir the very same take your time im sure theres nothing pressing he smiled at the young man who flushed sorry sir the council wants to see you theyve called an emergency meeting for all captains now i presume yes sir just the captains and their first officers very well well be along presently yessir i think his voice trailed off as samir shut the door on him and turned to the other occupants of the room quite a crowd had built up over the afternoon and into the early evening with the eight men from the empress having been joined by faerus orin and their senior sailors are we all prepared we all know what to do faerus nodded scratching his chin still not all that sure i like it samir but youre absolutely right that it has to be done orin a stocky barrelchested northerner with a forked beard and a surprisingly quiet and gentle voice shook his head i still wonder whether we could have done more he sighed but yes we know what to do and were ready then for the sake of lassos and our continued survival lets go and do battle youd best head down to the council ill meet you there in a minute just a few quick things to attend to here the two captains nodded and made for the door both stopping in the entrance to grasp samir by the forearm in the age old gesture of comradeship as they left taking their men with them samir glanced around the room at the remaining occupants and then closed the door this is a dangerous course weve embarked on gentlemen and into unknown waters we all know we can trust faerus and orin implicitly i have other allies unrevealed as yet that will change the way today unfolds then theres the governor we have no idea yet what he has decided to do so he is a random element in the game and finally the council are almost entirely untrustworthy and have only their own safety and glory in mind i have no doubt that they would sell out or drown any resident of lassos without a moments thought if they deemed it necessary today is an important day he turned to ghassan are you up to this ghassan laughed quietly unless youre expecting me to leap from ship to ship and head boarding parties i can cope with standing on the command deck and watching what happens i had just a little more than that in mind see i have no first officer and it would be unthinkable to go to battle in that position it might be a bit strange for you being used to commanding a ship yourself but if you could cope with it i would really appreciate having you at my side ghassan answered with a grin samir im not sure i could ever keep up with you but id be honoured to take the post yes he sighed and shook his head still laughing it seems ridiculous in a way since its only weeks since i was a commissioned naval officer and now here i am taking on the role of first officer with the most notorious pirate vessel on the sea and fighting alongside faerus and orin both of whom ive engaged in battle in the past strange how things turn out isnt it samir smiled i told you long ago by the south gate stairs in mdahz the day ma died remember ghassan suddenly taken aback by the memory of that horrible day gave a sad little laugh you told me things would be better its been long decades and finally things seem to be getting better as you said i just hope thats not just for today i want things to stay better now do you think thats too much to hope for samir laughed youve survived an invasion repeated massacres and two decades of sea battles with pirates you made it out of prison in an exploding tower youve been knifed twice once supposedly fatally and here you are standing tall and about to lead a ship to war with me i think that despite everything weve been through weve both got a lot to be thankful for dont you ghassan continued to smile sadly and samir turned to the other sailors mannius can you sort out asima for me make sure shes carefully bound when you move her she shouldnt wake up for a while yet but you know how dangerous she is and i dont want any harm to come to her once youve got her ready take three of these lads and move her out of here ghassan and i need to go attend the meeting but well meet you at the ship shortly the thin wiry man nodded as he holstered the knife hed been idly playing with well be there and ready capn samir nodded and turned to the tall heavy set man next to the door with a scowl moulded permanently to his features duro you and rashad need to take care of the other thing youll find the tools and the paint in the room back there make sure that faerus and orin have taken theirs if not youll have to deliver theirs before you start work what are you up to now samir ghassan frowned oh just a little surprise nothing important shall we go ghassan continued to peer at him through narrowed eyes and finally sighed shrugged and opened the door after you my captain thank you as the room became a hive of activity behind them samir and ghassan stood straight and began to stride down the sloping road in the warm purple dusk light toward the council chamber at the first bend the noble scene was only slightly marred by the fact that ghassan winced and gasped with every other step and quickly began to lean on samir for support once again dont worry when we get on board all you have to do is lean on the command deck rail and shout commands ghassan nodded i shall be grateful to stay still for a while i think all this movement may have torn a stitch or two your doctors going to be furious with me the two walked on in silence each contemplating the coming day with a mixture of excitement and nervousness slowly they approached the council hall the great peeling colonnade towering above them as they closed on the doorway youre sure theyll go for it youve sent everyone off ready as though theyd already announced their intention to go to war samir shrugged i cant see as they really have any other choice besides whether they say yes or no well still have to get underway so best to be prepared are you ready for this we might not be over popular tonight ghassan answered with a nod in we go the entrance hall was empty as usual though the door to the main chamber was already open and the commotion within could be heard as far out as the colonnade dozens of raised voices argued a dozen different points each trying to be heard over the others samir smiled as he and ghassan entered and took up position leaning against the door and closing it with a loud click the room fell silent at the noise and a number of faces turned to them good evening gentlemen samir said with a tight smile there were a number of growls and lowvoiced threats from the assembled group but the banging of a knife pommel on the central table brought the silence to bear once more captain samir present yourself and your brother before the council the crowd parted allowing the pair room to face the hawklike figure of master halcar who frowned at them the council has concluded its deliberations captain samir and come to a decision as to the best course of action for lassos and its occupants samir nodded but remained silent someone nearby said in low tones is gonna slit yer throat real slow samir ghassans head whipped around but in the press of people the source of the voice remained unknown the comment was ignored by the mass and the council whatever your motive captain samir halcar went on you have betrayed the people of lassos and we do not tolerate betrayal in any circumstances you have put us in an awkward position even though some of our number believe that this time was inevitable the judgement of this council is that war must be prosecuted the twelve ships of lassos will sally forth at dawn when the mist is thickest and will engage the fleet of the governor your unique position with traitors on board the enemy ships makes you irreplaceable therefore you will lead the way out of the reefs and into position he smiled humourlessly the possibility that this is some sort of trap has occurred to us and if this is the case you will have the option of falling into it yourself or revealing its existence samir nodded that is fair of course master halcar be quiet we are not finished in addition the council will sail out aboard the ships it is important both that we add our long experience and expertise to the command and that we take part in what is after all a battle for our survival masters culin saja and myself will come out aboard the dark empress with you in order to avoid any unfortunate decisions being made and we will be bringing a guard with us of course he squared his shoulders more than half the council and many more among the captains have called for your death for what you have done samir and some demand that you be tortured to death it is only the irreplaceable position you currently hold that is keeping you alive therefore once battle is concluded if we have taken the day you will be deemed a traitor to lassos you will then hand over your compass to us and you will be taken back to lassos there you will be skinned salted and then boiled for your crimes ghassan straightened no samir shook his head but halcar nodded you will prosecute the war to the best of your ability and then submit willingly to your fate because we will allow your brother to live banished from lassos back to the mainland if you refuse to submit or attempt to trick us we will do the same to both of you and to every man who serves on your ship you may believe that mercy is a prime trait in a pirate captain but you are alone in that belief is that all clear samir frowned his head down very clear master halcar go then and prepare the empress for battle samir bowed making sure to keep steady for ghassans support and the pair turned and opened the door passing through before closing it quietly in the hall outside as the room behind them burst into noisy life once more ghassan shook his head this had better work samir im not going to see you skinned samir smiled i have no intention of ending my days bobbing pink and white in a barrel ghassan weve laid our cards on the table and so has the council now we just need to know what hand the governor holds ghassan nodded well find out first thing tomorrow i suspect in which the fleet sails ghassan leaned on the rail wincing his back had begun to ooze a little this morning and samir had worried enough to consult the doctor whod merely become irritated and incensed that the taller brother was being too active and not resting enough to allow the wound to heal properly samir gave him an admonishing glare as he squeezed his eyes tight and fought down the sharp pain its alright samir he says im in no immediate danger and given the situation i think thats a better than average estimate he gestured at the command deck in front the dark empress had set off at first light leading the other eleven vessels from the docks of lassos and heading into the nightmare reefs in thick fog the most dangerous time to attempt a passage of the sharp teeth that protected the island the three members of the council had come aboard just in time to sail with an escort of more than a dozen handpicked men chosen from the crew of the other more dependable ships halcar was taking no chances with samirs potential treachery and had organised the ship and the fleet so that those vessels who were likely to be more sympathetic to him under captains faerus and orin had been manipulated into safe positions far back in the line from the empress and between more traditional captains who owed their success to the council ghassan could see no way that samir could pull anything out of this mess what will we do about that he asked very quietly gesturing subtly in the direction of the three masters of lassos who stood side by side leaning over the rail at the front of the command deck keeping a close watch on the activity on deck while their guard kept a close watch on their safety samir shrugged theyre not a problem if they dont deal with it themselves well handle them when the time is right samir we are rather seriously running out of time on the contrary my dear brother we have all the time in the world quite possibly he added grinning we have the whole rest of our lives ghassan glared at him i just wish youd tell me everything ive got the main plan straight in my head its a good plan or at least it would be if the council werent hogtying us but there are so many things you havent explained how are we going to rally your friends what are you going to do about the three councillors and their thugs how are you going to stop the others from fleeing back to the island im just too nervous about the uncertainty of everything samir nodded i understand but there really is nothing to worry about in fact i think something is about to fall into place that id only tentatively hoped for the only thing that still makes me tense is the governor what will he do ghassan shrugged hell do as you asked its to his advantage samir nodded with a distinct lack of enthusiasm that may be so but there are other ways he could look at it hed be taking a fairly serious risk and putting his own career in jeopardy and thats even if he trusts or believes me which is a fairly tall order on its own ghassan nodded i dont worry about the governor its the problems that are a little closer that worry me regardless ghassan right now we need to prepare and steel ourselves all hell is about to break loose and we need to be ready can you see how far back the other ships are ghassan narrowed his eyes as he turned and peered over the rear rail not really the fogs too thick i can see two behind us and theyre keeping very close paying attention to the signals he raised an eyebrow i suppose youve given thought to the possibility of having your man give a false signal you could scupper the whole fleet within the rocks not a ship would make it out samir shook his head there are good people back there that i wouldnt leave behind besides ive only got one of the compasses i dont know yet which captain was given the other but itll be somewhere near the back and someone that halcar trusts even with the chaos id cause its more than possible that a ship or two would escape back to lassos and with the compass to boot ghassan nodded youre right of course i just dont like uncertainty cheer up samir smiled were about to leave the reefs a great relief im sure ghassan replied sourly the last few glistening rocks with their sad and pleading occupants slid toward the bow of the ship and washed past in the oppressive velvety silence the figures pawing at the timbers as though they could help ghassan shuddered no matter how many times he ever passed these reefs that sight would still make him shudder tensely he watched the slick rocks drift past and into their wake where his attention was drawn as the mist thinned and finally evaporated to the harts heart behind them captained by a particularly notorious man named gharic and currently also host to two more of the councils elders harish shine a good face on us today samirs mouth turned up at the corner cheekily are you intimating that our favourite goddess has ugly faces ghassan flashed a glare at samir who merely laughed suddenly with the veil of mist lifted the sea of winter storms reflected the dancing sunlight back to them in all its glory revealing a wide swathe of open horizon and drawing the viewers attention squarely to the array of sails positioned in a rough arc around the sea into which they sailed in other circumstances it might look pretty it was certainly impressive perhaps forty or fifty daram of varying sizes and construction face the empress as she emerged from the fleecy blanket three quarters of the sails were white bearing aloft the colours of the imperial navy punctuated by the less common black sail of the fleet of the king of pelasia and in the centre of the arc a particularly outsized daram bearing the blue insignia of the governor of mdahz ghassan frowned it worries me that the governors flying that pennant if hed agreed i would expect to see a different insignia there he ground his teeth but then theyre all here they havent blockaded the entire circuit isnt that a good sign samir shrugged either very good or very bad hush for a moment one of my more interesting coin tosses is about to come down lets see whether we win or lose this one ghassan frowned again as he looked past samir master culin of the lassos council was strolling toward them hands clasped behind his back while the other two councillors remained at the rail watching the events ahead unfold as he approached culin stopped by the group of menacing looking guards that the councillors had brought aboard and selected half a dozen of them gesturing for them to join him ghassan winced inwardly and realised that his breathing had become shallow and fast he forced himself to calm down culin was the sort of man who could read emotions and appeared to have an intuitive mind almost a match for samir captain the man addressed samir and then nodded at ghassan master culin what could i possibly do for you culin smiled quietly samir please you are not the only one here able to see beyond the end of his nose im not entirely sure how youre going to do it but i have a pretty shrewd idea of whats about to happen somehow despite being outnumbered more than three to one by an enemy fleet and having most of your own fleet out for your blood i have this disturbing feeling that next to you may be the safest place to stand today samir sketched a light bow master culin you flatter me i am a mere gambler with an eye for good odds culins answering grin was equally selfassured as am i samir i have been watching you and my peers with interest and trying to decide what to do about my suspicions as a matter of duty and sense i fear that what we should most do right now is to dispatch you both and tip you overboard before you can do any more damage he sighed my somewhat acute sense of selfpreservation however presses me to other courses of action when your little game plays out here samir i would appreciate it if you remember the choice i made samir nodded his smile fading to a grave expression you are as you have been for a while foremost in my thoughts master culin the councillor nodded and then turned to the men with him stay with the captain and first officer you know what to do the burly pirate he addressed nodded respectfully as the master turned and strode back to the rail to join his peers once he was out of easy earshot ghassan leaned close to samir and spoke under his breath i dont know what youre up to with him but that sounded good samir grinned as he nodded master culin has revealed his hand and i think that the balance in our own fleet has just tipped in our favour he smiled curiously how prophetic i was ghassan frowned and samir laughed later my brother he squared his shoulders can you see the ships behind us now your eyes are so much better than mine ghassan squinted off behind them most of them theyre coming out of the fog and theyre all as close as the ones just behind us shall i give the signal samir waved his hand noncommittally best ask the council for permission first as ghassan stood tensely samir stepped forward and cleared his throat addressing the pirate leaders in a loud and clear voice masters may i ask your indulgence and allow my brother to give the order to call the fleet to battle lines halcar turned his sour hawk like face back to them you do not have to send any messages to your people yet samir grinned thats taken care of master halcar we should see a reply any time permission halcar looked at culin and saja standing to his left at the rail saja shrugged his bare ebony shoulders and culin raised his brow why not halcar turned back to samir you have the councils permission to prepare for the attack samir nodded and turned to his brother alright ghassan lets get this fleet into position while we wait for my other coin to fall in which other coins come down with the practiced ease of veteran sailors the eleven assorted vessels accompanying the dark empress from the reefs fanned out into a battle line given their hushed conversations the previous night during which samir had given his brother a complete rundown of the ships their captains and any crew or tactics that he knew of ghassan rubbed his chin and glanced to the left and right trying to size up the fleet careful attention as the ships spread gracefully out into the line had given him the time and leisure to put together a mental map of the battlefield as it were the empress held the centre of the fleet stretching away to starboard lay six ships the first the harts heart clearly held little love for the empress and her captain the artillery master on the vessel had two of his weapons charged and angled to fire on the enemy fleet below the rigging and past the mast but the third weapon stood on a pivot and continually straying back and forth along the hull of samirs vessel ghassan sighed the harts heart would be the most dangerous foe here beyond her lay three more ships captained by the more barbarous of lassos occupants each of whom would have no compunction about sinking the brothers without a moments pause beyond them and almost out of useful reach of the empress lay one of their few allies orins vessel the southern fang itself being shepherded carefully by another councilloyal vessel at the far flank ghassan gritted his teeth there was nothing they could do to help orin that far out and equally nothing that orin could do to help them but that was not their problem their own great problem would be captain gharic of the harts heart a northern barbarian come south decades ago in search of warmer blood in which to wade samir had painted a frightening picture last night not only of the captains exploits but also of his personal pastimes gharic would not leave the day without murdering the pair of them and so he was clearly the most dangerous except he turned to look across the port rail to their immediate left sat wallowing the great dark bulk of the sea witch now under the command of a strange easterner called shohan but until recently the vessel of the very councillor saja who now leaned across their own command rail scratching his ebony scalp and playing idly with one of his earrings as he scrutinised the imperial fleet opposite yes the sea witch could well be as much trouble as the harts heart whatever good master culin thought could come of this and however sure samir was of their situation the hawklike halcar had trapped the empress between the two ships that held the firmest connection to the council ghassan would be unable to manoeuvre without presenting a soft side to one or the other therefore it hardly mattered what ghassan thought of the two other enemy ships beyond the sea witch or captain faerus golden dawn that lay trapped between other more vicious pirates on that flank in short they could rely on only three of the twelve vessels and each of those was thoroughly constrained by the other pirate ships he shook his head once again captain ghassan blinked and reined in his wandering and somewhat gloomy thoughts at the parchmentthin voice that had called from the rail samir smiled at ghassan and raised his brow flicking his eyes toward the three council members in the most commanding position on the bridge ghassan pulled himself away from the rail with a groan of discomfort and joined his brother as they strode across to join the masters of lassos the tall first officer wiped the eternally bothersome curls from his forehead where they kept becoming plastered down with a mix of salty mist and sweat this strange calm while the two fleets sat facing one another was almost too much to bear every ounce of command experience in him told him they had to make a move soon master halcar samir asked lightly the elderly pirate turned a sour face on the brothers your lookout says there is a signal showing from below the bowsprit on the enemy flagship i would be interested to know how you got your men on the governors own ship samir ignored the question and squinted through the rigging we should get a clear view from over there he said pointing at the side rail without waiting for a reply samir strode to the port side and leaned over the edge where he could just see the winking lantern against the dark timbers of the massive darams hull across the open water that separated the fleets he grinned thats our signal at last master halcar the older councillor along with the ebony skinned and somewhat grumpy looking saja leaned across the rail next to samir and peered off into the distance there was a long silent moment as halcar and saja translated the flashing signal halcar turned to samir his face an uncomfortable mix of suspicion and confusion what does that mean yes samir smiled it means that all my coins have come down rightside up master halcar my apologies halcars brow furrowed for only a moment before shock and terror swept across his mean and twisted features when the glistening dark bulk of councillor saja heaved him over the rail with an easy push the eldest and most senior pirate lord of lassos disappeared beneath the waves that splashed against the timbers of the empress but not before his head had struck the hull with a heavy clonk ghassan stared as the ebony pirate master turned and flashed a brilliant white grin at samir squaring his shoulders he was really beginning to get on my nerves samir i couldnt have waited much longer ghassans mouth flapped open and closed a few times as the two pirates before him clasped hands behind them master culin strode across the deck the dozen burly men at his back now i daresay you could use another dozen good men right now samir the captain of the empress laughed you have no idea culin i think my brother will find places for them finally ghassan managed a hoarse exclamation of astonishment samir turned his irritating grin on his brother i dont like leaving things to chance ghassan you know that ghassan laughed then the sea witch councillor saja beamed at him is awaiting my signal master ghassan samir turned again a noise attracted their attention from the starboard rail someone aboard the harts heart had apparently noticed that something was wrong perhaps they had seen master halcar taking his final dive into the brine whatever the cause there was no time left to ponder samir straightened ghassan pass the word to the boarding parties and the artillerists and have the lookout give the signal ghassan nodded as he turned wincing once more at the pain in his back whatever the future held it would all be decided within the hour now after a youth spent bouncing from one horror to another that had hardened them for their adulthood and then decades spent in bloody opposition as they both lost sight of their original goal the sons of nadia the sweetest flower of mdahz stood side by side doing what they both knew to be right and with an opportunity at last to change the world despite himself he found himself grinning like the little boy who had won the fiercest rooftop race that samir had ever devised and sat in the cool shade of the temple tower as he basked in his own achievement he laughed a carefree laugh drawing curious looks from the men around him artillery section make your target the harts heart the artillerist saluted as he ran off among the small detachment that manned the cruel machines at the central fortified section ghassan turned his gaze upward and cupped his hands to his mouth to bellow aloft but removed them again with a smile as he saw that the lookout was already doing the job samirs crew were almost instinctively fast ghassan beamed up at the imperial naval pennant that unfurled blue and green and bursting with pride fluttering in the wind and changing the entire nature of the vessel the act must not have gone unnoticed as the commotion that broke out on board the other vessels clearly indicated ghassan laughed as he watched an identical pennant unfurl aboard the sea witch from captain in the imperial navy to vagabond then second in command of a pirate vessel and now full circle back to a naval first officer strange the turns that life can take a person down he jogged back to the command deck just as he heard the first crashes of artillery beginning the action proper samir everythings set ive got firepower concentrating on the hart the last comment may have been unnecessary as he was forced to duck to avoid the horrifying flying splinters that exploded from both ships as their artillerists sought to do as much damage as possible despite the close range hampering their ability to aim scuttling shots as the shower of deadly shards dissipated claiming three men on the deck to their horrifying points ghassan gestured at the enemy vessel next to them im still not sure whether four against eight is a good number samir samir laughed arent you forgetting about the governors fleet dont be ridiculous samir by the time they get underway and reach us itll all be over master culin leaned across between them grasped ghassans arm and turned him deliberately to port where he pointed at the imperial fleet sitting silent across the calm sea ghassan frowned for a moment and then his eyes widened as he saw a great ball of fiery hell catapult from one of the governors ships his eyes followed the flaming arc as his mouth dropped open with an almost unbelievable accuracy the great mass came down on the deck of the pirate three ships to port the effect was instant and frenzied the pirates panicked at the sudden realisation that not only were they within artillery range of the imperial fleet but they had been sitting in place long enough to give the artillerists plenty of time to get their aim just right ghassan turned to stare at his companions on board the command deck as behind him four more flaming missiles came hurtling across the open water to strike into the heart if lassos most vicious predators culin was laughing so hard his eyes were streaming samir turned that everinfuriating grin on his brother care to tell me how you arranged this samir cast a semiapologetic look at the pirate councillors beside him a few wellplaced coins among some of culins contacts you see we all know that culin has a man in just about every office of the southern provinces feeding information around is ridiculously easy when you know the right people ghassan shook his head but how do they know which ships to attack they cant see the pennants from that distance that grin was beginning to irritate him beyond reason master saja here was the one who persuaded the council to put the ships in this order he fed me the plan long before he told the council ghassan laughed helplessly is there anything you dont think of ahead samir shrugged there are a few things left to work out yet the edge is with us now but the imperial fleet wont fire on the centre for fear of hitting us theyre concentrating on groups of enemy ships not individuals he paused his conversation as a massive crash indicated that the empress had been hit with a pot of heavy canister shot whole sections of deck were ripped violently away so were going to have to deal with the harts heart ourselves and quickly the sea witch can try and help faerus out ghassan frowned the hart is beginning to move theyve reversed oars can they get back to the island samir frowned and flashed a questioning glance at saja and culin the pirate leaders shrugged halcar entrusted the other compass to captain gharic if he reaches the reef he can get to safety samir shook his head cant have that my deal with the governor was to empty lassos and deliver everyone there to him as either ally or prisoner well have to turn and take him out before he gets to the reef he smiled as something occurred to him ghassan in all the commotion i forgot to show you the new paint job while we get underway can you find duro or rashad and tell them to do their duty ghassan strode off his brow furrowed and ignoring the strain he felt in the wound on his back to find the dour giant or his peculiar assistant he shook his head as he walked try as he might and he considered himself a bright and intuitive man he just could never keep up with samir that man had probably already planned out his afterlife the crew of the ship ran madly about their business and as the oars shot out and began to dip in desperate time to try and catch the harts heart already speeding back toward the reef two men dropped into the water a rough blanket that had been pegged in place over the ships nameplate the rough timeworn planks with their black and green insignia in southern script had been replaced with new clean and carefullycut planks the imperial ship of the line redemption cut away the last of its ties to piracy as it chased down the one vessel that could still mar the day in which the fleet engages captain faerus held his breath his black locks whipping behind him in the gentle breeze as his gaze passed for the hundredth time from the ship to his left her watchful captain and crew keeping their eye more on faerus than the enemy to the imperial fleet across the open water silent and brooding and then to the other pirate ship to starboard hemming in the golden dawn samir has assured him that the odds were good but that some risks had to be taken and the golden dawn would be at great risk for the first few minutes he realised that hed bitten his lip hard enough to draw blood this was ridiculous faerus had served with the imperial navy in great engagements along the eastern shores of the sea of storms until the collapse of the military even after that when he tried to form a militia for some time hed remained active keeping his home city safe from their local lords that tried to take advantage of the failing of imperial power only with his capture and escape had he turned to the last remaining avenue open to him piracy and since then while hed tried to retain an honourable attitude hed fought hard and dirty against every form of vessel military pirate trader and mercenary hed only lost three engagements in ten years of commanding the dawn and had had the sense and control to get out in time in each of those and now here he was part of a ridiculously fragile conspiracy of pirates against other pirates relying on the planning and brains of a man over a decade younger than himself and outnumbered waiting for some unknown sign to move of course samir was a man after his own heart and certainly the best man for this job and if he managed to pull this off he would be responsible not only for ending the threat of piracy in the sea of storms but also for returning those who deserved it to position in the military it was a master stroke faerus just hoped he lived long enough to enjoy it the plan had sounded so good but now trapped between hostile captains and barely able to even see his ally through the rigging he was beginning to doubt the strategy sir faerus blinked as he turned to locate the shouting sailor one of the juniors was pointing to starboard shaking his head irritably faerus tried to see through the rigging of the pirate vessel that sat alongside them and to the ships beyond through the mass of ropes sails masts and men he could see the next pirate ship and then just make out the colours of shohans sea witch beyond that the dark empress was entirely lost behind them all what the hell had the lad seen a sudden and tremendous boom answered his question as artillery went off in the centre of the fleet he shook his head again samir said hed know the signal when he heard it but that was just ridiculous turning to the first officer he took a deep breath alright alif these two ships wont know whats going on but it wont take them long to realise and as soon as they do theyll be down on us like a sand devil on a wounded camel everything we planned and all at once alright the desertdweller who had served faithfully as faerus right hand man for the best part of a decade grinned everything at once sir aye lets hope we can make enough room eh sir faerus ground his teeth and spoke under his breath into the breeze this is it samir i hope you know what youre doing he smiled as there was a muted and distant thud way out across the waves and as he watched a ball of flaming mass arced up and over the water trailing a line of oily black smoke behind it as it flew with relentless speed and surprising precision straight into the bow of the ship to starboard of faerus he turned to watch his orders being carried out as several more horrifying missiles began their journey from the imperial fleet the ships to either side of the golden dawn were in chaos just as faerus had expected the sudden launching of hostilities within their own fleet followed by the beginning of a surprise bombardment from the governors ships had left them panicking and trying to pull themselves into enough order to either engage or flee though neither captain would have had the leisure to make even that decision yet faerus crew had been with him and worked together for so many years that the orders were carried out with the minimum of wasteful activity and fuss and events unfolded before him in perfect order and precision aloft the pirate pennant was cut loose as the great imperial replacement fluttered free in the breeze hed questioned samir as to whether it would have been more sensible to wait to reveal their intentions until after theyd attacked giving them more surprise but samir had been adamant as soon as this action began hed said it began with them serving the empire and to do that they had to be honourable and open in a way faerus agreed but with a nod to the need for surprise hed waited until the very last minute pushing all his actions into one frantic moment as the green and blue flag whipped in the breeze a cloth was discarded into the sea and the golden dawn was no more the pirate ship that had been faerus home for decades had gone to be replaced instantaneously by the imperial ship of the line retribution which was already bursting into life with impressive speed and efficiency even as the oarsmen began to heave on the oars and the ship started to turn sharply to port the artillerists had their weapons loaded and trained to the rear shouts of alarm went up from the ship they were turning toward as the crew saw the sudden movement of faerus vessel turning sharply sideways while remaining in the line and they noted with horror the great iron ram and spike listing ponderously toward their hull their captain leapt to action trying to get his vessel mobile as fast as possible and move out of the way of this sudden menace behind and to starboard as they turned the captain and crew of the other vessel were already in a panic trying to deal with the massive damage caused by the imperial fire catapults the forward section of the main deck was ablaze and flames were leaping up the foresail and racing along the rigging as men tried desperately to cut the ropes and contain the fire it would be out soon faerus noted as men were already hurling water and sand across the flames but the damage had crippled them long enough to give faerus the edge as the retribution turned the artillerists finished lining up and levelling their weapons and released in unison with a deafening crash the already beleaguered and flaming vessel found itself the sudden target of a second ball of oily fire that burst at the base of the stairs to the command deck filling the corridor inside with flames and cutting off the officers from their men while two canister shots ripped through timber sails rigging and crew in among the carnage an officer trying to rally the crew in desperation was picked up bodily by one of the long iron bolts and pinned to the burning timbers where he burst into flame before the life could pass from his eyes faerus turned his face from the doomed ship horrible and dangerous as that was that had never been the gamble this was the gamble there simply was not enough room for faerus ship to fit lengthwise between the two enemy vessels and they had to keep moving away from the burning ship before the flames engulfed the whole vessel and she became a hazard to the retribution that all meant that the only way faerus could get safely to a position where he could manoeuvre and involve himself further in the action was to go through the outermost vessel as he watched the prow of the retribution closed on the side of the enemy ships hull their captain had been quick to get his oars out and into the water and even now the enemy ship was starting to move ponderously forward hed never get out of the way in time of course but that wasnt what was worrying faerus ramming someone at slow speed and at a three quarter angle was not a recipe for success artillery phase two shouted the second in command and faerus nodded tensely without speed and a direct frontal blow the ram and spike would probably just jam and lodge there locking the two ships in a deadly embrace while the fire behind them drifted ever closer the only hope was to break up enough of the ships structure before the ram hit so that half its job was already done behind him the artillerists their weapons already reloaded were swivelling their machines of war on the small castle amidships and taking aim at their next target the hull of the ship directly ahead of the retributions prow faerus held his breath as the two ships closed with an unstoppable force the retribution continued to pick up speed as the oarsmen strained and heaved like they had never done before the first two shots of heavy iron ammunition punched into the enemy ship in tightlyaimed locations one just below the waterline ahead of their ram the other smashing into the rail and shearing the main deck as it smashed through the timbers ripping up boards squinting at the need to be perfectly accurate the artillerists released the third and fourth shot only a moment later both of these hit in the areas previously devastated by the initial shots entering the main structure of the ship and ripping apart beams and bulkheads new cries of dismay went up among the crew of the enemy ship and the captain rushed to the rail of his command deck to survey the damage waving his arms and shouting to his juniors but there was no hope his orders went unheard as the fasterthinking members of his crew ran to either stern or prow whichever was closer and threw themselves into the water far from the site of the impending breech faerus shut his eyes as the shadow cast by his ram slowly made its way up the side of the enemy ship marking every inch as they closed this was it they were either going through or down at the far end of the fleet another tale was unfolding though this was far from a happy one the barrelchested and forkbearded orin captain of the newly named revenge surveyed the damage and sighed scratching his chin he would have liked at least once to have stood on the deck as it entered port a legitimate naval vessel he was no longer a young man and had long ago begun to tire of the attitudes of his peers when faerus and samir had tentatively approached him with the plan it had been a dream come true but then all dreams faded as soon as the first shot was fired the ships on either side of orin had leapt into action the imperial fleet had taken its toll on a number of vessels between here and the centre of the line but the ones flanking orin had been sharp enough to launch an immediate assault on him even before hed had a chance to strike the new colours by the time his artillerists had launched their first shot the prow had already been hit by a ball of oily fire and leapt into a flickering blaze hed had the oars run out to try and begin pulling back from the line but the solid and canister shot from both sides had been aimed at the banks of oars and hed lost half the rowing capability only moments after the oars touched water as hed watched in horror trying to decide how best to deal with the growing nightmare the second and third fireballs had hit one amidships at the mast effectively ending the use of his artillery while the other burst through the side of the ship below the command deck ravaging the cabins within orin ground his teeth in anger as he felt the boards beneath his feet beginning to warm with the fierce heat of the flaming cabins below hed had plans for certain but theyd relied on him having at least a second to breathe before the fight began but the shrewd bastards to either side of him had clearly been planning on taking him out regardless of the days actions their artillery must have all been loaded and trained on him from the start for things to have happened so damn quick he sighed again there was no other option leave that the crew amidships looked up in surprise at their captain where they worked tirelessly with buckets of water trying to douse the ever expanding flower of billowing flames the revenge is done for but well not go down alone eh lads there was a somewhat halfhearted cheer he couldnt really blame them of course many of them would now be wondering why they ever decided to turn against their colleagues still revenge was both the name of the ship and the order of the day hed see those bastards to either side whipped through three hells for what theyd done to him this morning grapple lines every available hand on both rails the men stood for a moment in confusion but then realisation dawned on them and they ran to get the ropes and grapples the revenge would burn for a while yet before she began to sink the other ships were so busy concentrating on taking him down that they hadnt given thought to pulling out of the range of danger themselves with enough strength on the grapples the revenge would pull its assailants relentlessly in until they all three became one great flaming mass but he would have to make sure that did for them too scouring the deck he spotted the dejected face of the second in command of artillery and beckoned to him well make use of your stuff yet khaim drop that grapple and get three men with you down to the armoury remove the protective coverings on all your firepots and get them charged and up on deck as soon as were within reach of these bastards were going to turn this ship into the biggest explosive youve ever seen in which the line breaks as the redemption formerly the dark empress backed out of the chaotic line of vessels making for somewhere with enough room to turn ghassan and samir stood at the rail with saja and culin trying to make sense of what was happening almost every ship in the line was now moving though with an unplanned chaotic and desperate edge to the action the left flank of the line was one of the main areas of trouble though samir had felt sure that faerus could handle whatever the morning threw at him the ships to either side of him were in trouble one thoroughly ablaze and already starting to lean badly the other samir laughed as he watched his friends ship in the distance hit the enemy vessel amidships tearing through the hull as though it were parchment and passing through cutting the pirate ship in half in the process how hed managed that without more damage to his own ship samir couldnt fathom but hed certainly be asking him if they got out of this well so at least one of their allies was safe he thought as he watched faerus tear through the last of the ship and out to open sea where he could turn and manoeuvre and in the process he seemed to have crippled or destroyed two of the remaining eight enemy vessels the two remaining ships on that side of the rail were now heavily locked in close combat captain shohan of the sea witch having not surprisingly declared for his old commander who now stood side by side with samir on the command deck those two vessels were an even match and far too close for effective use of anything other than small shot artillery it would come down to mantoman fighting on deck which would be nasty for both sides but whatever the outcome that meant the entire line to the left of samir was involved or dealt with the imperial fleet had finished its bombardment but that was expected the agreement had called for only one volley since by the time a reload had been effected the pirate fleet would be moving and likely mixing among one another making targeting almost impossible for a crew at such distance still from the roiling smoke that filled the bright morning air and the steady roar of flaming timber their single volley had been devastating enough to turn the fight immediately samirs way to the other side samir rocked back on his heels as he turned and the far end of the fleet suddenly exploded in a fireball the like of which samir had never even imagined the expanding mushroom of red and orange boiling flame engulfed several vessels at the far end and samir blinked in shock second and third subsidiary explosions marked the detonation of spare ammunition among the vessels involved in the conflagration it took a moment for samirs reeling mind to pull itself together in the wake of the mindnumbing blast with a deep sadness of the soul he realised from the direction of the blast that orins ship was somewhere in that fireball precious little hope of anyone surviving that if there were any survivors at that flank it would be those who had the foresight to jump from the rails and were underwater when the blast occurred samir shook his head and turned to his friends to realise that they were all standing staring as shocked as he orin knew the risks we need to concentrate on whats still to do as if shaken from sleep the three other commanders on the deck blinked and nodded as ghassan ran to the rail to yell orders at the men and culin put a rare and expensive spyglass to his eye saja fumed at the harts heart already completing its turn and heading for the reef ahead well have go some to catch them he barked samir turned away to examine the line once more the fireball had contracted once more and left three ships in a state of almost complete destruction hardly anything standing above deck fragments of wood and other more unthinkable things rained down from the sky trailing little flames like falling stars while chunks of timber and bodies floated in the water around them oh it was too far away for samir to actually see what it was that darkened the waves around the ships but hed been in enough brutal engagements these past two decades to know what caused that stain trying not to think how many of those tiny dots that speckled the water had shared a drink with him in the bar on lassos samir forced his gaze away from them and to the remaining two enemy vessels on that side along with the harts heart they were the only remaining enemy ships that were not engaged the question was what would they do faerus ship the retribution was at the very other end of the line and too far away to engage orins vessel was a burning shell and the seawitch their surprise ally was already engaged with another ship in vicious handtohand samir shifted round the rail to keep watch on them as the redemption turned as fast as ghassan could manage trying to catch the harts heart in open water there was clearly chaos on board both enemy vessels though that was hardly a surprise given the sudden turns of events in the past few minutes as he watched sliding his hands along the rail while the deck turned he frowned the nearest of the two vessels was beginning to wheel around given that they now had plenty of room to manoeuvre and no close enemies and could simply pull forward out of the line turning meant only one thing they were planning to head the same way as samir and his prey though whether in order to engage the redemption or merely to try and hook up with the harts heart and try to return to lassos remained to be seen either way in a few minutes samir and his crew would be trapped between the ship they were pursuing and this new one following them in the situation could turn unpleasant then his lip curled into a slight smile as he realised that the remaining unengaged ship had struck out at full speed for open sea past the three burning wrecks more fool him the governor could spare up to half a dozen ships to chase him down and apprehend him but the likelihood was that now they had all had a chance to reload their artillery the running fool would be used as target practice he wouldnt get a half mile away from here before he touched the sea bed still that was one ship that he didnt have to worry about he turned back to the two pirate councillors standing at the rail how far are they from the reefs saja his bright eyes flashing anxiously in that dark face turned to samir not far enough theyll be among the rocks before we can touch them theyve got away culin next to him nodded unenthusiastically hes right samir with the best will in the world i know your crew are good but unless you happen to have a god in your pocket theres no way we can catch them lassos is theirs and itll be hell trying to lever them out then samir shook his head that would be no use anyway my deal with the governor stipulated all the folk of lassos and their ships we let gharic get back to the island and weve broken our side of the deal while i cant guarantee that the governor would renege on his side im not about to take that chance he smiled wickedly i have a plan we dont have to catch them as saja and culin narrowed their eyes suspiciously samir turned to his brother ghassan give us every bit of speed you have but count to fifty and then bring us to starboard at a narrow angle as though were trying to come alongside from behind ghassan frowned for a moment and then shrugged turning to the crew and muttering something unheard under his breath before bellowing out the orders once more samir smiled and brushed his fingers along the edge of the object in his pocket so gharic wanted to run back to the island did he captain faerus heaved a sigh of relief as the retribution pulled free of the mass of the stricken pirate ship it had been he had to admit a dangerously lunatic idea the whole idea of the ram was to puncture the enemy and then pull out and flee while they sank nobody to his knowledge had ever attempted this and despite the awesome weight and strength of the retributions ram it was still idiotic but then the fiery mass that was the other ship behind them was listing in this direction and any attempt to reverse after impact would be to present themselves to a whole new burning danger after the initial collision his main worry had been that they would stick fast or even that the rudder would jam on the wreckage before they could get clear it had been a fascinating and heartstopping minute and a half as his ship had sliced somewhat messily through the midsection of the enemy vessel the initial heavy shots had been wellplaced enough that they had shattered the main beams and bulkheads in the hull and faerus ship had long been renowned and feared for its outsized ram just under a ton of iron fifteen feet long and reinforced all the way from the keel up along the breakwater and to the bowsprit as they had struck the ram had punch through with ease the iron breakwater shattering the remaining boards as they met the main problem had been that the retribution had not had enough room to build up ramming speed and the initial impact had slowed their ship further in danger of grinding to a halt jammed across their enemy faerus artillerists had begin to fire shot both solid and canister into the structure of the ship ahead beside and below them even then they had almost become wedged the oarsmen given their objective hauled their oars in at the last minute a couple of them in the front half of the ship waiting too long and watching helplessly as the long wooden implements shattered on the enemy hull while they came up most however had managed to get the oars up in time and spent the next minute using them to push the disintegrating hull of the enemy ship away from them heaving as hard as they could as though they were punting a barge every ounce of strength adding to the ease of passage had the crew of the pirate vessel had their wits about them they could have taken the opportunity to pick off many of faerus crew as they sawed their way through but the imminent demise of their own ship had them panicked and those that hadnt already run fore or aft and dived into the water before impact were desperately running up the tilting deck away from the scene of the destruction by the time the retribution was far enough through the enemy hull for the foremost oars to be dipped into the water once again the pirate ship had separated into two neat halves and was beginning to disappear below the waves are we clear alif the weathered second in command standing on the main deck above the hatch shivered and rubbed his head i cant believe you even tried that capn let alone that it worked but are we clear alif nodded were able to manoeuvre a little but weve taken a hell of a lot of damage sir the prows a mess and people are shouting up from below that were taking on water in a dozen places critically alif shrugged water coming in is never good captain in a perfect world the water stays on the outside of a ship faerus smiled that his grouchy subordinate felt the subject worthy of humour spoke volumes then lets get those holes plugged as best we can and set the crew to emergency repairs only weve not got time to affect a full repair i want to get us back into the fight as soon as possible with respect captain youre barking mad has anyone ever told you that you alif and on more than one occasion the swarthy man grinned at least five minutes for a desperate patch up before ill feel safe even trying to make a turn alright sir whatever you say alif he sighed as he stood back and leaned on the railing his ship may have taken a pounding form this but they came off better from the attack than the other two vessels he watched with a slight undercurrent of sadness as the last timbers of the shattered ship around them disappeared beneath the waves a glance behind revealed the burning mass of the other vessel now leaning at a dangerous angle as it began its descent to the underworld unfortunate for the crew caught between the choice of a fiery death or a watery one in the most perfect of worlds they would help the stricken sailors bobbing in the water and shouting for help hauling them aboard to save them but that was for military engagements with men of honour such as faerus had faced in the old days he knew those men in the water from the last decade or more though most of them would gut him the moment his back was turned and realistically what chance did they stand if faerus relented and rescued them he would have to deliver them to the governor who would hang them in calphoris of mdahz watching as they jerked and soiled themselves in front of a jeering crowd better that they disappeared here forgotten better for him and better for them he smiled sadly at the ship of the line retribution five minutes and no more then he would go and help samir and orin in which threads come to a close samir shook his head not yet but were in range a heavy firepot might stop them samir turned from the rail to look at ghassan not yet but samir listen gharic is far from stupid hes seen whats happened up and down the line hell he knew he was beaten that first moment while the other captains started fighting back gharic knew they were done for and fled not brave but clever hes seen what shots have been fired and he knows what well do hell be expecting the fire shot by now every man whos not on the oars will be standing by with poles and water to sort it out at best well create a minor distraction and singe the deck no i need that catapult ready ghassan ground his teeth then tell us what youre planning damn it samir i know you have this whole personal superiority complex where you need to know things that other people dont and be ahead of the game but now is not the time i am who i am ghassan samir grinned ahead saja leaning on the rail amidships turned and shouted back to them hes reached the rocks and slowed any minute now well lose him in the mist ghassan growled at his brother alright samir this is it whatever youre going to do do it now samir shook his head one more minute we need one more minute let him get safely in the rocks the exasperated ghassan turned to look out to stern the remaining active pirate ship was bearing down on them matching speed they would catch up the moment samir turned on the assumption he was going to turn and hadnt planned merely to fly over the reefs moments passed in tense silence and finally the deep voice of saja called out thats it shes gone into the mist two minutes and well hit rocks and fog ourselves hope youve got the compass ready samir the captain of the redemption grinned you have no idea saja reaching into his tunic he withdrew the disc with its mummified finger with a laugh he beckoned to culin and ghassan and made for the steps down to the main deck frowning the two officers followed him down the stairs and out onto the deck where the crew worked tirelessly the oarsmen on their benches hauling and grunting trying to bring the ship within reach of the nowinvisible target as the three samir striding out ahead approached the midsection saja hurried over from the rail to join them alright samir whats going on the diminutive captain smiled his most irritating smile and passed the compass to the ebonyskinned councillor what have you given me this for watch and learn laughed samir still grinning he reached into his pocket and withdrew a key flourishing it like a showman he held it aloft behold the end of captain gharic he became aware of the tense irritation around him and stepped forward to the set of five steps leading up to the fortified artillery castle by the main mast there he crouched down and inserted the key into an almost invisible hole in the timbers at the base of the tower you see the compasses have been lassos closest guarded secret for centuries but my old captain khmun had a closerguarded secret than that to this day the only person he ever told was me and he had this little compartment fitted to hide away that secret he never used it to my knowledge and i only used it once myself when i last fled lassos with a pirate fleet hot on my heels with a click he swung open the wooden plank perfectly hinged and expertly hidden and slid out a dark metal container i think youll like this reaching into his pocket he produced a second key which he inserted into a lock in the container the box is made of lead dont ask me why is has to be lead i dont even know how khmun knew that but there it is only lead works now he grinned up at them keep an eye on the compass with a flourish he opened the box and as the other three stared down at the bronze disk in sajas hand the finger within suddenly jerked as though alive and then swung wildly round to point at samir where it hung for just a moment before beginning to spin at a dizzying speed in circles the three commanders stared at the precious item in their hands rendered entirely useless by by what samir grinned as he stood and unwrapped the bag hed retrieved from the lead casket a lump of metal rusty and red that looked like the rawest iron fell out into his hand laughing he thrust the lump close to the compass and the pointing finger within picked up speed spinning so fast it almost fractured and fell apart how the hell are you doing that ghassan blinked its the metal dont ask me why a gift from the gods maybe all i know is that it totally messes up the compass ability to give a reading at a distance it makes the needle waver a little closer and itll point toward the metal but anywhere within a couple of ship lengths and it makes the finger do this culin laughed we spent a week arguing about how you did that the last time you left here you almost sank half the ships of lassos on those rocks samirs smile faltered slightly i never intended that there were friends in that fleet i just revealed the red metal from a distance and gave them enough to worry about that they had to work hard and forget about me he smiled grimly now however its not only time to stop gharic and his crew but to seal off lassos forever turning he climbed the five steps to the platform whos the best shot in your crew he asked of the artillery master the bearded man scratched his chin id like to say it was me but that would be young kayri here samir turned to the young marksman theres enough gold corona in it to buy your own ship if you can fire this thing and land it close to the harts heart think you can do it the young lad frowned casting a professional eye over the red lump in samirs hand may i captain samir nodded and passed the lump to the young man rubbing his hands together and wiping away the red dust not very heavy itll be a tricky shot sir ive never fired anything this light cant guarantee it so we have to make it heavier the lad nodded as he regarded the lump that would be good sir samir grinned retrieved the item and reached across to one of the foothigh barrels of canister shot with a flourish he produced his belt knife levered off the lid and scooped out a couple of the rocks within concentrating he dropped the iron lump in replaced the lid and hammered the pins back down with the hilt of his knife lifting the barrel he stood and turned to the lad more the right sort of weight the artillerist nodded and reached out taking the canister thatll be easy sir but bear in mind that if it doesnt hit a rock itll just sink with your metal lump inside it samir shrugged noncommittally nothing short of a lead casket would make a difference anyway a few yards of water and a wooden box wont matter he nodded to the lad and stepped back down to the main deck as the artillerists began to adjust the catapults aim ghassan flashed a nervous smile lets hope hes up to it samir laughed he was good enough to cripple your ship brother i think hell be alright to be honest anywhere remotely near them will do the trick anyway saja sighed as he gazed out toward the rocks of course that means we can never go home samir you realise that samir shrugged my home is mdahz always has been lassos was only ever a temporary haven the four officers fell silent as they heard the creak of the winch staring out ahead they couldnt help but flinch as the catapult fired not six feet from where they stood with a loud crack and a bang that shook the deck nearby the canister that samir had produced disappeared arcing out silently into the mist shouldnt we hear it land culin shook his head too small itll only be a little splash muted by the fog the four watched tensely as the reefs grew ever closer now if samir concentrated he could see the shapes of the desperate wraiths as they called out helplessly from their slippery platforms everything was eerily silent and the mist closed on the bow best take us to starboard sharp and bring us about ive no intention of foundering on those rocks samir said ghassan nodded and turned to call to the man at the rudder but as he opened his mouth there was a muted crash as they all fell silent and listened from deep within the mist there were desperate cries and the sound of splintering timbers crashes and splashes the smile dropped from every face gharic may have been a cold hearted and vicious bastard but to crash among those rocks well everyone knew what that meant ghassan heaved in a deep breath and bellowed to the helmsman come about to starboard sharp as you can manage saja sighed no more lassos itll be strange being legitimate its been so long since i could hold my head up in an imperial city that i cant even remember what its like samir gave a light laugh i daresay youll adjust my friend youll culin grasped his wrist sharply and samir looked down and then across at the councillor in surprise his words immediately forgotten what our pursuers theyre almost on us its not over yet in which the brothers are beleaguered samir rushed to the port rail cursing himself hed been concentrating so hard on catching and dealing with the harts heart that hed paid scant attention to the vessel that had broken the line to pursue them it had been unclear initially whether the captain of this last operational pirate vessel had been planning to launch an attack on them or try to flee past them to lassos the latter course of action was no longer open to them anyway given the fact that of the two compasses that existed and could navigate the reefs one was now at the bottom of the sea among the rocks and the other was on board samirs ship regardless the objective of the pirates appeared to have been samir and his men from the start rather than making course for the narrow channel that led into the reef or pulling about after the hart had disappeared the pursuers were bearing down on samir at a surprising speed both billowing sails and splashing oars bringing them to a ramming speed samir eyed the iron spike on the ships prow not the work of destructive art that adorned faerus ship but enough to punch a hole in the side of the redemption and cripple her samirs mind raced they had a minute at most given their own ponderous speed since theyd come to a stop to fire the strange package among the rocks presenting their portside to the enemy in the process there simply was not enough time to get the ship out of the way their only hope then was to stop the enemy before they managed to ram he shook his head angrily how the hell could they do that turning he saw saja and culin deep in panicked discussion while ghassan desperately shouted orders to the crew trying to get the redemption moving and out of the way of the ship bearing down on her weve got to stop her ideas come on saja and culin glanced around at him as they argued but neither looked hopeful ghassan samir looked across the command deck at where his brother had been only a moment earlier shouting out commands now however there was no sign of him squinting samir cast his eyes around the ship and finally spotted ghassan racing up the steps to the artillery platform amidships running after him samir shook his head there would only be time to get one shot off and there wasnt time to prime a fire shot they might do a little damage but not enough to stop them as he reached the foot of the steps climbing up to the artillery castle the lead casket still lying open nearby he clambered up to see ghassan in deep conversation with the young artillerist waving his arms to illustrate some point he was making samir stopped panting at the top of the steps and ghassan turned to him a look of quiet determination on his face behind him two artillerists loaded heavy solid shot into the catapult ghassan what are you up to theres no time for this ghassan nodded absently there is theres time for one shot just pray that its enough and that your men are that good samir frowned at his brother and as the artillerists began to line up the catapult tightening the ropes a last few turns and checking their trajectory he and ghassan leaned over the wooden battlements and watched the scene unfold their breath held the enemy ship was perhaps half a minute from them and still on a ramming course having to adjust only a few degrees occasionally as the redemption slowly slid forward gods i hope youre right ghassan they stared bleakly at the ever closing bow of the enemy ship with that horrific iron spike the oarsmen heaving like theyd never rowed before to achieve a crippling ramming speed samir closed his eyes tight and held his breath crack behind them the artillerists let loose the only shot they would have time for samir opened one eye as the great heavy shot sailed over their heads on a remarkably low trajectory for an artillerist to manage such a low and straight shot from a catapult was a remarkable enough feat let alone with the perfect precision targeting that the shot displayed through his squinted eye samir saw the shot hit the banks of oars on the port side of the enemy vessel smashing and shattering them and bouncing along the shafts cracking and breaking more as it disappeared with dreadful momentum down the side of the ship and disappeared into the water with a loud splash samir blinked just as hed once done to ghassans ship one carefully aimed shot had removed almost half the rowing power on the enemys port side the remaining oars on that side now disjointed and out of time in chaos the effect was immediate and astounding with little forward motion on the port oars while the starboard banks ploughed on as fast as they could and the sails billowed with the wind no amount of rudder control at the rear could stop the ship turning the men of the imperial ship redemption watched with fascination as the enemy vessel slewed wildly to port momentum still carrying it forward at a strange quarter angle samir barely had time to take it all in before he realised what was coming next the ramming spike had skewed left and out of line with its target but nothing was going to stop the two ships colliding under the circumstances brace he bellowed and grabbing tight hold of the artillery fortification ducked to floor level the enemy vessel hit them at that quarter angle the timbers of both ships crashing and breaking amidships for redemption and to starboard of the forward deck on the pirate vessel the damage was far from fatal for either but the crews of both ships were shaken those who were not fully braced being swept from their feet a number of screams and splashes from various directions announced men overboard among both crews the redemption listed frighteningly following the impact slowly righting itself as men were hurled from the rail similar events appeared to be occurring among the pirates ghassan grasped samir and the two hauled themselves back up to the crenellated top of the fortification were not out of the shit yet samir ghassan breathed heavily youve got a skeleton crew at best now while theyre fully manned samir nodded biting back an undeserved retort ghassan was right the men on his ship were brave and among the best hed ever seen but the odds would be three or four to one and no amount of heart was going to even that out im not letting them have the empress ghassan the redemption samir the smaller brother shot an irritated look at his sibling if things get too bleak make sure you throw that compass over the side that has to be the end of it ghassan nodded soberly and samir turned and cupped his hands around his mouth to arms prepare to board ghassan stared at his brother board are you mad we should be trying to repel them you dont try and board a ship that outnumbers you by four men to one indeed replied samir which is why itll throw them completely off track behind them the men of the redemption drew their weapons as they picked themselves up from the deck and clambered across the wreckage toward the rail samir theyll die better to go out trying than cowering ghassan im leaving you in charge of the redemption and the compass you know what to do when things get too bad oh no you don yes i do good luck brother as ghassan launched off on a tirade at the smaller man samir grimacing leapt down to the main deck and ran to join the men who were even now clambering at the rail ghassan watched from the command deck helplessly samir however irritating was right someone needed to stay back in charge of the compass it must not fall into enemy hands and he since his back was still weeping when he moved wrong was the obvious choice he thumped his hand on the rail as he surveyed the scene it was a mess many of the oars on both ships had been smashed when the collision occurred and the pirate vessel had slid to a stop side by side with her prey both ships rocking and shaking the gap between the two hulls was almost narrow enough to leap but if a man missed given the fact that the two hulls kept washing against one another drowning would be a blessed option ghassan had seen men crushed between two ships hulls before and it was never pretty the sailors of both sides were clamouring at the rails awaiting the chance to cross and cause havoc but neither was ready yet the collision had left both ships in a state of chaos no one was willing to take the leap between ships and neither side had expected a boarding action so the boarding ramps were being brought up hurriedly on both sides the crews who looked largely identical roared their anger and defiance at one another and the sight was almost comical given the impotent inability to actually reach the opposition until the ramps were in place ghassan however a veteran of so many years of combat could see a subtle difference in the two crews not the numbers there was nothing subtle about the fact that the enemy ships rail was crowded by a throng of bloodthirsty cutthroats at least four men deep while there were few enough men on board the redemption that small gaps remained at the rail no the difference was in the tone of the shouts the enemy ship had that roar of true violence they knew they had the upper hand and that they would be safe if they overran the redemption stole the compass and retreated into the reefs they had every reason to believe that the fight would go their way samirs crew however knew they were doomed though their cries were as angry as those of the enemy the undercurrent was that of quiet resignation the crew of the redemption knew that they were likely to lose here and that the enemy would leave no survivors the roaring intensified as the boarding planks were run out on both sides falling to the opposing deck and jamming there as the iron teeth fitted to the end dug into the boards yet another potentially humorous moment unfolding as both sides tried to charge one another before the other could prepare the result was of course chaos men from both ships ran out onto the same boarding planks meeting at the centre between the two vessels the forces clased in a sea of bellowing colour men screaming and hollering as sword blows landed and helpless desperate men fell from the planks into the churning waters only to stare terrified and boggleeyed at the hulls of the two ships as they trod water the waves brought the hulls inexorably closer and closer together once more until they met with a crunch ghassan winced at the sound of a dozen desperate cries being cut off instantly with that wooden bang the initial attack was beginning to slow the numbers were thinning out and more people now fell foul of the drop between the hulls than made it either forward or back to either deck the gore and viscera of the vicious fighting had within the first minute coated every ramp making the crimson timber slippery and treacherous anger was quickly giving way to frustration and desperation as men from both sides fought as carefully as they could then as ghassan watched in horror the figures of samir and saja appeared out of the rear of the redemptions massed crew nodded at one another turned and ran using the banks of rowing seats as a launch pad from his vantage point on the command deck ghassan watched his heart in his throat as the two men leapt across the gap with its bloody boards crushing depths and battling men and came down in a heap on the enemy deck amid a pushing crowd of surprised pirates knocking a number of men to the deck as they hit the pair vanished from sight in a pile of men and the area suddenly became a focus of intense fighting ghassan closed his eyes samir you bloody idiot a call escaped his attention for a moment as it was almost lost in the noise of the battle raging around him and it took precious seconds for ghassan to realise that the voice was addressing him from somewhere above raising his eyes and sheltering them from the brightness of the blue sky above he spotted a young sailor at the top of the smaller rear sail hanging onto the cross bar what is it the young man shouted something garbled that ghassan couldnt quite make out and pointed toward the enemy ships rigging ghassan frowned as he looked across at the sails ropes and masts of the pirate vessel with the shouting men dotted here and there among them there was nothing unusual there he frowned again and was just about to turn and try to frame a mouthed question at the lad when he saw itnot among the enemy ships rigging but behind them two vessels not just one but two sajas former ship the sea witch shed not been officially part of the rebellion so she had no new name and no imperial pennant to fly but shed dropped her own colours and was sporting a plain green flag the captain had found somewhere and she was bearing down on their aggressor at a frightening pace with faerus retribution at her side like a charge of heroes from the tales of old ghassan took a deep breath stay safe samir helps on the way in which a last assault begins there was a moment when the madness of the act flashed across samirs mind and almost shocked him to a standstill he was a man who never did anything without a plan and at least one card up his sleeve he had rarely in his adult life entered into any situation that he was not already absolutely sure of there always had to be a way out not this time for years he had bent every effort and guided every possible thread he could find to one end to this very end but once the governor had accepted the deal the pirate fleet had been coerced or dealt with and the passage through the reefs had been sealed for all time there had been no more plans and now he had found himself fighting a sea action for which he was unprepared and which seemed to be heavily weighted in favour of the enemy and the upshot of everything was that he had to do what he could without that alltooimportant card up his sleeve in the press of men pushing up against the rail of the redemption trying to get to the rabid pirates on board the enemy vessel samirs mind had finally gone blank leaving him floundering with no plan directionless he and his men had to gain the advantage over the much larger enemy but he just kept coming up blank there was no clear way around him the men of his crew pushed and shouted itching to prove their worth over the one remaining enemy vessel and samir could do nothing but watch helplessly he had jumped and almost lashed out when a hand clamped down on his shoulder swinging round he found himself staring helplessly into the eyes of saja ex councillor of lassos renowned pirate lord and tactician and equally famed warrior sajas face wore a deep frown of concern causing some of his tattoos to meet around the corner of his eye and his various gold adornments to move hypnotically around his face samir his mind reeling with the unfamiliar feeling of uncertainty found himself lost in the movements of the various rings and studs he suddenly realised that saja was saying something to him just as the man stopped and raised his brow waiting for an answer cant show my growing panic samir thought not amid the crew taking a deep breath he held his hand to his ear miming that he couldnt hear saja over the rabble the large ebonyskinned captain nodded and grasping samirs shoulder harder turned and propelled him back through the press and toward the open deck behind them as they left the heavy crowd the councillor leaned close to samir we have to do something to break them yes samir nodded emphatically but what its up to us men fight twice as hard when they are led by men they believe in you know that samir its up to us to turn the tables on the enemy samir nodded again uncertainty still freezing his mind but how saja shrugged as they neared the open space we have to lead the attack give them something to aim for samir nodded the uncertainty still filling his mind with emptiness he had to do something he was never this useless always had the next five steps worked out so they had to get ahead of the press and onto the enemy ship they had to give them something to aim for as saja said there was plainly only one thing they could do well have to dive in feet first and come up fighting we need to be the incentive saja nodded swing down from the rigging too slow things could go badly by the time weve climbed up there and swung across we need to get our men over there now before they break us and we all end up fighting on the redemption then we need the clearest area and a good run up samir nodded and scanned the deck as the pair finally came out of the rear of the massed sailors there past the main mast the place with the least men thatll be where they break through first saja followed samirs gaze and then turned to him and nodded the two men jogged back across the deck angling themselves so that when they turned back to the press they were facing one of the remaining gaps where the mass of shouting sailors was thinnest see you on the other side samir laughed the sudden attainment of direction giving him purpose and clearing his mind of the fluff that seemed to have settled there harish smile on us with a good face the pair grinned and then ran there was surprisingly little run up across the deck and the charge was hampered a little by the many obstacles on the wooden boards but the two men reached the raised benches of the oarsmen just behind the press of men and took an agile step jump and then leap from the highest point drawing their weapons at they rose ghassan would not approve samir thought briefly as he watched the surprised upturned faces of the men of his ship while he passed over the top of them and then the equally astonished raised faces of the enemy just before reality reasserted itself and the two men crashed back to the floor in a tangle of body parts fortunate they were that the enemy had been so taken by surprise that theyd not had time to react just one man having the forethought to raise a sword to the descending men could have put an end to the foolhardy attack all too soon as samir and saja felt the squashed bodies of fallen men and the hard surface of the deck boards beneath them a roar went up from behind their attack had enthused the redemptions crew and hopefully spurred them into a stronger push the two men had precious little time to think though and could pay no further heed to what was happening behind them already the effects of their shock arrival were wearing off and men nearby were picking themselves up and collecting weapons samir struggled to his hands and knees his fist wrapped around the hilt of his short sword and supporting his weight as he tried to take stock of the immediate situation as he turned he found himself face to face with one of the pirates picking himself up in the same fashion as their eyes met the man tried to free the blade in his hand enough to manage a stab at this mad captain samir instinct taking over as always had already considered and then abandoned the sword as an option still leaning on that hand he lashed out with his free fist punching the crouched pirate full in the face shattering his nose and knocking the man flat as the stunned man toppled to the side his hand came up and samir reached out and calmly plucked the longer curved blade from it standing slowly hefting his shorter imperial sword in his right hand and the long curved desert blade in the other samir remembered a day so long ago when he had stood on a ruined tower at the edge of mdahz with their uncle faraj teaching them the difference between the two and why they had to learn the use of different weapons he smiled grimly as he twisted his wrist and spun the straight blade in his hand the nearest pirate took a look at his face the mans gaze passing down first to one hand and then the other and he backed away carefully as much as he could into the press of men behind him saja had acted with much less flourish style and honour but with considerably more effect as the big man had come to his senses on the floor on top of two fallen pirates but surrounded by many more still standing he had brandished his weapon elbowed a little room and then taken as strong a swing as he could despite the lack of space saja was a powerful man huge muscles rippling under his dark and decorated skin and the golden bangles jangled as he scythed out with his own curved blade cutting easily through calves shins knees and hamstrings the effect was horrifying blood pumped from a dozen wounds and begun to flood the area as men collapsed in a screaming mass at this sudden and debilitating attack and as the pirates above him fell like a field of wheat before the scythe saja rose from the mass slowly covered in fresh blood and brandishing his evil blade while grinning like some monster from legend samir stood slowly a sword in each hand and nodded to his companion the attack had certainly started something back among the press he could see occasional faces he recognised from the crew of the redemption snarling and shouting among the enemy samirs crew had begun to push once more the pirates were being pressed by a considerably smaller force against all odds and samir and saja grinned as they faced a motley collection of nervouslooking men waiting for the tense standoff following their initial onslaught to break the first strike came suddenly after three heartbeats which had felt like months passed the man closest to samir lunged with the speed of a viper and samir had to step back to parry the blow with his short imperial blade stumbling slightly into saja who consequently almost fell foul of a simultaneous attack from the other side in the brief moment that followed before all hell broke loose samir took the opportunity to swap hands with the two blades the heavy curved sword in his right striking hand the smaller straight imperial blade in the left for parrying he barely had time to get a full grip before the force hit them the men around samir and saja came in like a tide the ripples of a cast stone in reverse swinging curved blades and lunging with short swords and long knives the attack only faltering a little through lack of organisation and of room to manoeuvre samir found he had no time to make an attack of his own being forced instead to raise and shift both swords in a constant whirr of steel in order to block the various blades that thrust swiped and cut at him even so in the massive press of men he felt three blows land in the initial flurry one glancing blow cutting a thin sliver of flesh from his upper arm just below the shoulder another taking a small piece from his earlobe and the third cutting deep into his outer thigh another set of blows like that and hed be down he was damned lucky none of those three had been debilitating as they easily could have behind him saja yelped as a blow bit home somewhere on his powerful physique and then there was chaos after the initial surprise and the standoff then the tentative lunges the fullblown assault by the enemy that surrounded them had given the men all the incentive they needed and samir and saja found themselves beleaguered and fighting desperately for their lives parrying blow after blow and managing only rarely to get in a thrust or swing of their own as opportunity allowed again and again samir felt the shock of swords hitting his desperatelyraised blade and sliding with a jarring grating feel down the blade more blows connected drawing blood and leaving fine lines or small wounds on his flesh samir was a good swordsman maybe as good as saja even but no man could hope to hold his own for long in a pressing circle of dozens of bloodthirsty screaming enemies this was it no regrets of course what they did leaping in among the enemy had been the spur the men of the redemption had needed and had changed the whole direction of the battle ghassan and culin had better take advantage of the change and use it or their sacrifice would have been in vain another blow well placed while samirs own swords were raised to block other attacks swung in beneath his guard and cut deeply just above his left knee some muscle or cord had been severed samir realised as he desperately swung with his curved blade the strength left his leg instantly and he collapsed like a sack of grain the blade spinning out of his hand and bouncing along the boards between the legs of the attackers he watched with dismay as the curved weapon came to a halt perhaps a foot out of reach among the stamping feet he stared at it as he crumpled his head hitting the deck hard a foot perhaps but it might as well be a league out of reach he tried pushing himself up but his head exploded in shards of white light and he realised through the heavy pulsing of his blood as it pounded round his brain that the deck beneath his head was slick with dark blood that was pouring from his own skull he flailed and tried to raise the short sword in his left hand but there was so little strength there and no coordination in his head the blade wobbled for a moment before it toppled from his grasp and fell to the floor he realised hed fallen back again only as the board hit the cracked area at the back of his skull and his vision blurred hed always wondered how it happened when harish turned her masked face to you and your soul went with her did you see the goddess he squinted through the shattered fragments of white light and the growing fug deep in his brain trying to see whether harish had come for him personally perhaps not he sighed as his vision briefly swam into focus long enough to identify a heavyset man with a blue whorled pattern tattooed on his face as the pirate raised a straight and wide sword in both hands point down to drive it through samirs chest and finish him at last given the rather insistent pain it might be a blessing samir let his limbs loosen and fall to the deck as he watched the glinting point of the sword descend somehow superimposed over the falling blade he finally saw the masked face of harish she wasnt as beautiful even in her deathmasked image as hed expected in fact she might very well be said to be quite ugly samir sighed as the blackness descended at least she could have been pretty saja grasped samir by the shoulders a sudden panic descending on him as the crew of the redemption swept around him and began to push the desperate pirate crew back the sea witch and the retribution were moments away their own boarding ramps already raised and ready to help in mere moments the whole attack had overturned the two commanders attack had begun something that simply could not be stopped even by sheer weight of numbers and the news that their sister ship and sajas old vessel were bearing down to help them had lent renewed vigour to the attack the news had however had a somewhat different effect on the pirates their earlier resolution lost panic had set in there would be no hope for them if they surrendered only a gibbet and a very public death awaited but if they stayed here they would only be carved to pieces by the three victorious crews and so they had broken some diving overboard others trying to find somewhere to hide from the now overwhelming enemy force saja frowned at samirs still form only a moment ago as hed swept aside the last pirate whod been intent on finishing the job hed seen samir eyes open and smiling and then suddenly hed gone limp and slumped with breath held heart thumping in his throat he leaned down to samirs chest and put his ear to the mans tunic a voice from above spoke in a leaden hollow tone well saja looked up and his ebony face burst into a wide toothy grin hell be alright captain ghassan so long as that heads bound quickly hes a survivor your brother the tall first officer brushed the ever present curl of black hair from his eyes and sighed with relief close saja too close for you two mad bastards in which retribution is the watchword the governors flagship was a magnificent vessel ghassan could hardly take his eyes from the thing as he was greeted at the top of the rope ladder and gestured toward the main deck by a deferential sailor waving aside the man he turned and helped saja bring his wounded and bandaged brother up the last section master culin below adding support as he pushed samir toward the top the governor stood on the command platform with a number of important looking personages and samir shook his head gently as he reached the deck and planted his wobbly legs as firmly as he could on the timber accepting ghassans offered arm for support saja and culin took up positions in surreptitiously supportive places around the young captain who had against all odds and despite the innumerable immense obstacles brought a fleet of vicious pirates to battle against one another until the only ones that remained afloat flew the flag of the empire the four men waited a moment until the windswept head of captain faerus appeared over the edge of the deck i see no one feels the need to help me aboard just because i didnt have the idiot bad sense to try and personally tackle an entire crew of howling lunatics he grinned as culin reached down and grasped his hand hauling him aboard the five men the leaders of the pirate rebellion stood for a moment recovering before following the beckoning form of the second officer aboard the pride of calphoris the climb up the stairs to the command deck was easier though still a little delicate given the condition of three of the five men ghassan still winced occasionally as movements pulled the stitches in his back saja was crisscrossed with minor cuts and abrasions and samir the doctor on board the redemption had been typically sarcastic but had begun work on stitching and binding the various wounds before the captain had even been given a sedative a testament to how bad he considered samirs condition that had been almost five hours ago and the doctor had been quite vocal in his refusal to let samir out of his sight even at the governors request until ghassan had given him a direct order to his quarters while the doctor had worked the crews of the three ships had swept the site of the battle noting the locations of the various sunken wrecks mostly from the flotsam and jetsam and the bobbing bloated bodies that had not yet been pulled down as they lay draped over random spars of wood or shattered pieces of broken deck the saddest had been the site of orins ship the revenge no sign had been found of any survivors in the area but the pieces of charred timber and the various unpleasant things the searchers did locate had told a horrible story still orin had fought like all of them for what he believed to be right and it was partially through his sacrifice that the five remaining leaders reached the top of the stairs and crossed the command deck of the massive outsized daram to the waiting officers opposite marshal tythias and commodore jaral standing to one side of the governor bore unreadable expressions and ghassan realised he was having a little difficulty meeting the gaze of his old captain even in jarals new exalted role as commander of the navy the presence of a clearly very important pelasian satrap dressed in his elegant black robes and sporting numerous marks of rank and decorations was more of a surprise ghassan recognised some of the markings that identified the officer as the commander of the pelasian royal fleet all five of you the governor asked in surprise i thought i saw one of your ships disappear in a fireball i was expecting only four samir nodded wearily wincing at the pain in his head i beg a slight change in the contract governor the man frowned suspiciously one does not usually change the conditions of a deal after it is done captain samir im aware of that excellency but there are circumstances he glanced along the line captain orin as you astutely noted is no longer with us having given his life for the cause however we were very fortunate to have as a lastminute ally master culin of the lassos council culin the governor snapped the man is wanted on a hundred different charges piracy is merely somewhere on the list this is hardly what i agreed to the target of his bile stepped out from the line and bowed slightly to the governor with respect your excellency you will find upon investigation that more than half of those charges are erroneous or at least inflated as the governor glared at him he cast a mischievous smile back indeed if you give me a couple of days i think youll find that my charge sheet is almost clear what culin grinned come now governor you must be aware of just how many people i have among your people if id wished i could have cleared my name years ago but i would rather it were done in a legitimate manner the governor glared at him and then turned the look on samir you could do far worse governor master culin truly is a master of many things i think you would find him a serious asset in the admiralty certainly id rather have him working for me than against me the governors glare refused to shift and samir sighed and withdrew a folded and worn sheet of parchment from his tunic and this particular item was not part of our agreement but i will proffer it as an extra incentive to accept the change in terms the governor reached out and accepted the parchment his scowl remaining deep as he unfolded it and read the neat script on the inner surface what is this a list of names who are these people samirs grin became darkly mischievous those are all the people i slipped aboard your ships over the last few years you may want to honourably discharge them all since theyve done you no harm and served as well as any other sailor next to him ghassan blinked you really did have men on board their ships i assumed that was a lie to goad the council into action he asked his voice hovering somewhere between astonishment and anger not sure id have gone along with this if id known that samir laughed quietly i like to have a cushion to fall back on ghassan you know that there was always the possibility that the governor would not accept my offer and i had to be prepared ghassan stared at his brother helplessly as samir turned back to the governor straight deal time governor you accept the five of us with amnesty into your service and i give you a guaranteed end to the pirate island the governor turned and whispered something into the ear of marshal tythias the two men along with commodore jaral retreated a few paces and then fell into a brief whispered discussion while the pelasian admiral watched them an unreadable expression on his face after a long minute the three officers turned and strode back across to them very well the deal is this samir ghassan saja and faerus will be pardoned entirely and accepted into the imperial navy at the rank of captain with their own commands as per your original request our offer with respect to master culin is on different terms however we offer an amnesty for all his crimes to date but without imperial naval enlistment and on the understanding that he disappears as far as we are concerned samir shook his head thats he was cut off midsentence as the pelasian admiral gestured at culin in that case i would like to offer a position to this man the pelasian navy is more than aware of culins accomplishments i think we can use you culin shrugged hows the weather in pelasia hot the man replied with a tight smile always hot samir looked back and forth between the two until culin gave a small nod looks like you have a deal governor though i think youve let a major asset slip your fingers there be very wary of the pelasian navy now the governor nodded then only one thing remains his eyes rose to the mist on the horizon and the black rock of lassos peak rising from the centre samir nodded and turned to his brother ghassan fishing in his tunic the taller brother retrieved the bronze disk with its grizzly needle and displayed it openly to the men before them and i have your word this is what you said it was samir nodded the dead mans compass since the harts heart took the other one to the bottom of the sea a few hours ago this is the last moreover i have taken extra steps to cutting off any future hope of navigating the reefs you need have no more fear of the pirate island governor this is an end of it he turned and nodded at ghassan and the tall captain strode across to the rail nearby with a curious smile he changed his grip on the bronze compass and nestling it in an underarm position cast it with all his might out into the sea where it hit the surface skimmed three times and then disappeared with a plop sinking to a watery grave the governor nodded as ghassan returned to the group then our business is complete captain samir welcome to the imperial navy i believe commodore jaral has had rather a large cask of some corrosive liquid stored below deck in order to celebrate i have it on authority that there are rites of passage to endure that defy official terms i presume you are in no rush to return to your ships samir glanced back and forth between his friends and noted their grins i think we can spare some time to carouse with our fellow officers excellency epilogue the sun was beginning to sink below the horizon as ghassan and samir rested on the side rail of the imperial flagship and stared out across the glittering sea ghassan had been careful with the drink below aware at all times of the gaze of commodore jaral and not entirely sure of where he now stood with his former captain still he was back in a position of command and even if jaral still held misgivings ghassan would soon put them to one side and make his name a noble one again life was suddenly a sea of possibilities he smiled at the smaller captain by his side samir also had partaken only of a couple of drinks the thumping of the blood in his wounded skull making him lightheaded and fuzzy after only a few mouthfuls you did it samir you redeemed both of us samir nodded wincing more than that ghassan i think but it wasnt just me i may have been the central peg that held things together but this was the work of several of us including the governor and culin and saja but most of all i agree it was the sons of nadia smiling he raised his cup to the darkening sky mother and uncle faraj wherever you may be your boys have made you proud at last ghassan raised his own cup and took a quick sip it seems like a thousand years since mother died and i lost all hope and it was you it was always you with your things will be better that kept me going through everything everything we lost and so many times we met as enemies but you never lost sight of that did you everything being better was always your goal samir smiled after what we went through i think we deserve a little of everything being better dont you ghassan laughed quietly its to be hoped we never go to war against pelasia again id hate to come up against a navy with culin behind it samir laughed a genuine laugh and the two fell silent watching the light fade in the west taking with it the old world and bringing the possibility of the new the desert nomads have a saying when something is broken it should never be discarded so long as the pieces remain the whole can be remade karo was and hed be the first to admit it not a nice man hed never been one and piracy had been a natural course for him after years of fighting in the pits in calphoris to harden himself hed turned to mugging folk as a way to make ends meet hed discovered how much he liked to kill that very way when a mugging went wrong and hed been forced to dispatch the target it had been messy and gratuitous and hed enjoyed it so much that hed repeated it the next time and the next only when the heat from the authorities had become just too much had he had to flee the streets and make for the port where he began the long journey that would lead to him more than a decade later being the commander of a boarding party aboard the pirate vessel diamond devil hed had an illustrious career serving under captain corun and everything had been rosy until the last couple of days then that damned samir and his treacherous friends had come back and brought disaster with them corun had dithered when the fleet suddenly started attacking itself and it had taken the first officers presence of mind to persuade him to turn and chase down the harts heart and the dark princess in the hope of killing samir and getting back to lassos and then everything had gone wrong somehow despite being in the favourable position things had gone so damn badly wrong that hed had to stop in the middle of scalping some bastard from the empress and jump into the sea to avoid capture and death following the sudden and surprise arrival of the sea witch and faerus damn ship hed seen a few dozen others hit the water around him some had been crushed between the hulls others had probably drowned but he paid them no mind now they were no longer on the ship it was every man for himself a question of survival and so hed struck out for the rocks of course people said things about the reefs and hed seen the ghosts himself but they were there to stop ships getting through not individuals it would take a long time for a man to get from rock to rock all the way to the island but he knew he could do it the first rock felt cold and slimy he slid his hands up the clammy surface until he could peer over the top there they were in the mist figures in grey robed and threatening but just as hed thought none directly around him they were a deterrent they always appeared nearby not on the rock where you actually were a deterrent pure and simple they must be some sort of magic as they couldnt really exist he grasped the top with his fingers and hauled himself up the next rock was clear too hed make it there and then decide where to head next hauling against the wet cold stone he pulled himself over the crest to a dip beyond and found himself staring up at a grey figure his eyes widened as the phantom smiled and the effect as that wet and rubbery grey face stretched and contorted to show a hundred needle teeth was truly terrifying gharic his heart stopped in shock but not before the cold dead grey hands of the former captain of the pirate ship harts heart closed on his cheeks and the wraith fed asima awoke to silence she was clearly in some sort of hold the bulkhead timbers and barrels reminded her of the room that samir had last kept her held in well this time there would be no sweetness and complicity samir would just have to die shed like to do it slowly to peel the flesh from his limbs while lightly salting him but she might just have to go for a knife in the back that hadnt done for ghassan though maybe the neck a blade straight through the side and then ripped out of the front that would do it everything vital in one go messy but quick and sure ghassan may be deformed but nobody could claim their throat was in a different place she moved and groaned how long had she been unconscious here she could hear the lapping of waves but no voices she moved again and realised that some of her discomfort came from the piece of wreckage under her head she squinted her eyes gradually becoming accustomed to the dimness in here a boarded up window letting in only minimal light there was a shattered lump of wood shed been using as a pillow several broken boards torn from the wall of a building or some such her head tilted to one side as she examined the boards and sudden anger flashed deep in her eyes as she realised where they had come from their origin betrayed by the elegantly painted slogan dark empress she raged silently for a moment in the privacy of her head he was going to have to suffer after all no quick kill trouble or no trouble samir deserved slow and painstaking she pulled herself up to her knees and realised that a note had been pinned to the bottom of the section of hull that had been torn from the side of samirs ship angrily she ripped the parchment square from the shattered timbers and straightened stretching who the hell did that little monster think he was when asima got hold of him shed stretch his death to take days or even weeks she looked around the small cabin and noted the faint glimmer of light around the cracks of a door a proper cabin on a daram then and not down below in the hold somewhere unfolding the parchment and concentrating in the low light she read the short note as she approached the door her expression moving slowly as she read down the page from puzzlement to anger and finally to plain horror she read the last line and allowed the paper to fall from her shaking hands as she threw open the door to see not the corridor and deck of a daram but a jetty marching back through the water to the harbour of lassos the black mountain hovering high above her cry was heard by no living soul nor would any other she ever made my dearest asima i feel that the situation is painfully obvious but i do believe that your arrogance blinds you to certain truths and so i feel the need to explain this to you my ship the dark empress is no more like the phoenix of legend she has risen from the flames of battle and been reborn as the retribution and if you think just a little i believe youll understand why the ship has a long history and dark empress is not the first name by which it was known back in the early days of the emperor quintus the ship was commissioned under an imperial order and with its sister ships of that order was named for members of the imperial family this ship took the name of sabinia the emperors mother she was as you may be aware from your histories one of the family line that fell foul of the hereditary insanity of the dynasty and it is when she began to manifest her vicious madness in acts of random and senseless violence and megalomania and was finally disappeared for the good of the empire that the imperial ship of the line sabinia became the dark empress for that is what quintus mother will ever be remembered as but the ship like her captain and crew has been redeemed we are reborn into imperial service and the title of dark empress passed from sabinia to my ship needs to be passed on to divorce us from this wickedness but and i imagine you can see where i am going with this there is an obvious successor like sabinia a promising beautiful and clever young woman who descended into vicious madness and megalomania this new dark empress has reached the point where she needs to be disappeared for the good of the world as a whole and lassos will be no more no living foot other than yours will step on the cursed island ever again you can no longer visit your evil upon the innocent people of the world but like a soothsayer friend of mine once told you you were destined to rule as an empress i hope your empire trembles at the sound of your commands i wish you luck in your rule may it be long and peaceful your friend samir
