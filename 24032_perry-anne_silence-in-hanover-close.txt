anne perry silence in hanover close police station sir the cabbie said loudly even before the horses feet were still his voice was thick with distaste he did not like these places the fact that this one was located in the aristocratic elegance of mayfair was no compensation pitt climbed out paid him and went up the stone steps and in through the doors yes sir the sergeant at the desk said without interest i am inspector pitt from bow street pitt said crisply id like to see the senior officer in charge the sergeant took a deep breath eyeing pitt critically he did not meet the sergeants conception of a senior officer not by a long way he was quite casual in fact he was downright scruffy clothes all a mismatch pockets full of rubbish the man let the force down looked as if hed never met with a barbers scissorsmore like a pair of garden shears still the sergeant had heard pitts name and spoke with some respect yes sir that would be inspector mowbray ill let im know youre ere can i tell im what for sir pitt smiled dryly no im sorry its a confidential matter is that so sir the sergeant turned stolidly and went out leaving pitt standing until he returned several minutes later still without haste if you go through that door second on the left sir inspector mowbray will see you mowbray was a very dark balding man with an intelligent face he looked decidedly curious when pitt came in and closed the door pitt he introduced himself and held out his hand heard of you mowbray took pitts hand firmly what can i do i need to see the records of your investigation of a burglary in hanover close about three years agooctober seventeenth to be precise mowbrays face showed rueful surprise bad business that dont often get murder in a household burglary not in this area ugly very ugly never found a thing his eyebrows rose hopefully have you got something one of the stolen pieces turned up at last no nothing at all sorry pitt apologized he felt both guilty for taking the mans case from him and angry because this further poking around was evasive not his real purpose and probably futile anyway pitt hated the way he had been brought into the case mowbray should have been the one doing this but because the case involved the delicate question of a womans reputation a distinguished victim from a powerful family and above all the almost inaudible whisper of the possibility of treason the foreign office had used its influence to place the investigation through ballarat where they felt they could keep some control over it superintendent ballarat was a man with excellent judgment of what his superiors required and a rich ambition to rise high enough in his profession to become socially acceptable perhaps even a selfmade gentleman he did not realize that those he most wished to impress were always able to distinguish a mans origins simply by the way he carried himself by the turn of a vowel in his mouth pitt was a gamekeepers son who had grown up on a large country estate he had been educated as a companion to the son of the house and had a manner acceptable to the gentry he had also married considerably above himself gaining an understanding of a social class closed to most ordinary policemen ballarat disliked pitt and resented his manner which he considered insolent but ballarat was obliged to admit that pitt was unquestionably the best man for this investigation he had done so with an ill grace mowbray was staring at pitt with only slight disappointment and it quickly disappeared apparently he had expected nothing oh well youd better speak to constable lowther first he found the body and of course you can read the reports that were written at the time there isnt much he shook his head we tried hard but there were no witnesses and none of the stolen pieces ever turned up we thought of the possibility of an inside jobwe questioned the entire staff and came up with nothing i daresay ill do the same pitt said in an oblique apology have a cup of tea while i send for lowther mowbray offered its a vile day i wouldnt be surprised if it snows before christmas thank you pitt accepted ten minutes later pitt was sitting in another small chilly room with a gas lamp hissing on the wall above a scratched wooden table a thin file of papers rested on it and opposite pitt a stiff selfconscious constable stood at attention buttons gleaming pitt told him to sit down and be easy yes sir lowther said nervously i can remember that murder in anover close pretty clear sir what is it as yer wants ter know everything pitt took the teapot and filled a white enamel mug without asking he passed it to lowther who took it with roundeyed surprise thank you sir he swallowed gratefully composed himself and began in a low voice it was five past three on the mornin of october seventeenth just over three year ago i were on night duty then an i passed along anover close how often pitt interrupted every twenty minutes sir reglar pitt smiled very slightly i know thats what its meant to be are you sure nothing held you up anywhere that night he deliberately gave lowther the chance to escape blame if necessary without telling less than the truth no trouble anywhere no sir lowther faced him with totally guileless blue eyes sometimes i do get eld up but not that night i were round exact give or take no moren a minute that was why i noticed the broken winder at number two particlar because i knew it werent broke twenty minutes afore an it were a front winder too which is kind o funny burglars usually goes ter the back wiv a little nipper skinny enough to get through the bars and whip round an let em in pitt nodded so i went to the door o number two an knocked lowther went on i ad ter raise an ell of a row he flushed beg yer pardon sir a lot o noise before anyone came down arter about five minutes a footman opened up alf asleep e were ad a coat over is nightshirt i told im abaht the winder as was broke an e was startled like an took me straight to the room at the front which was the libry the constable took a deep breath but his eyes held pitts without wavering i saw immediate that there was trouble two ardback chairs was turned over lyin on their sides there was alf a dozen books knocked on the floor upset like and a decanter spilled on a table near the winder as was broke and the glass lyin on the floor shinin in the light light pitt asked footman turned up the gas lamps lowther explained e were fair shook id swear to that then what pitt prompted i went further into the room lowthers face puckered as the memory of the hard stab of human mortality came back to him i saw the body of a man on the floor sir alf on is face sort o legs bent a bit like ed bin took by surprise from beind is ead were matted wi bloodhe touched his own right temple at the hairlinean there were a big bronze orse on a stand bout ten inches igh lyin on the carpet bout eighteen inches away from im e were wearing a dressin robe over a silk nightshirt an ad slippers on is feet i went over to im ter see if there were anythink i could do for im though i thought e were dead even then the look of an adult compassion for a child crossed his face the footman cant a bin moren twenty if e were that an e got took queer an sat down rather sudden e said oh gawdits mister robert poor mrs york and the man was dead pitt said yes sir quite dead but e were still warm an o course i knew the winder adnt bin broke when i passed twenty minutes afore what did you do then well it were plain e were murdered an it looked like someoned broke in the glass were all inside and the catch were undone his face clouded but a shockin amacher job it were no starglazin nor nuthinan such a mess pitt did not need to ask what starglazing was many expert thieves used the trick of pasting paper over glass to hold all the shards while cutting a neat silent circle which could be lifted out so a hand could be inserted to open the latch a master cracksman could do the job in fifteen seconds i asked the footman if they ad one o them telephone instruments lowther continued e said as they ad so i went out o the libry an told im to stay at the door i found the instrument and called the station an reported the crime then the butler came downe must ave eard the noise and when the footman didnt go back upstairs e come ter see what was goin on e formally identified the dead man as mr robert york the son o the honorable piers york the master o the ouse but e was away from ome on business so there was nothin for it but to tell the elder mrs york the victims mother the butler sent for er ladys maid in case she were overcome at the news but when she came down and we ad ter tell er she were very calm very dignified he sighed in admiration makes yer realize what real quality is she were white as a ghost an looked like she were dead erself poor soul but she never wept in front of us just asked er maid to steady er a bit pitt knew of many great women who were bred to bear physical pain loneliness or bereavement by always showing the world a serene face shedding all their tears in private they were the sort of women who had sent their husbands and sons to battle on the fields of waterloo and balaklava or to explore the hindu kush or find the source of the blue nile and then to settle and administer the empire many had gone themselves into unknown lands enduring appalling privation and the loss of every familiar sight and sound in his mind mrs york was such a woman lowther went on quietly recalling the somber house and its grief i asked them if anything were missing as they knew it were ard to ave ter ask a lady at such a time but we ad ter know she were quite calm and jus walked round the room careful like and she told us that as far as she could say there was two silver framed minicher portraits dated a crystal paperweight engraved with a design o scrolls and flowers a small silver jug used fer flahersand that werent ard ter come at because the flahers theirselves was on the floor and the water spilled on the carpet dont know ow we missed seein it beforean a first edition of a book by jonathan swift she said as she couldnt see anythin else where was the book kept on the shelves with the other books mr pittwhich means as e knew it were there i asked and she said as it didnt look nothin special from the back of it youd see ordinary ah pitt let out his breath slowly he changed the subject was the dead man married he asked oh yes but i didnt disturb is wife poor creature she adnt woke an i couldnt see no point in avin ter tell er in the middle o the night better to let er own family do that pitt could hardly blame him having to tell the sad news to the loved ones of the victim was one of the hardest duties in a murder case the only thing even more difficult was seeing the faces of those who loved the guilty when at last they understood material evidence he said aloud lowther shook his head nothin sir least nothin as means much there werent nothin in the ouse as didnt belong nothin to show the intruder went anywhere cept the libry no footmarks no airs nor bits o cloth nothin ter see followin day we asked all the servants in the ouse but they eard nothin no one eard the winder break but then servants sleeps at the top o the ouse up in the attics like so maybe they wouldnt anything outside pitt pressed lowther shook his head again nothin sir no footmarks outside the winder but it were ard frost wicked that night an the ground were like iron didnt leave no marks meself an i weighs near fourteen stone dry enough so you left no footmarks on the carpet either pitt questioned not a one sir i thought o that any witnesses no mr pitt i saw no one meself and never did find anyone else as ad ysee anover close is a real close no through road so no one as didnt live thered ave any reason to pass that way specially in the middle of a winter night an its not exacly an arlots patch that was more or less what pitt had expected to hear but there was always the chance he tried the last obvious avenue what about the stolen articles lowther made a face nothin an we tried ard because of it bein murder is there anything else no mr pitt mr mowbray took over talkin to the family e could tell you more maybe ill ask him thank you lowther looked puzzled and only slightly relieved thank you sir pitt found mowbray back in his office get what you wanted mowbray asked his dark face puckering into an expression of curiosity and resignation lowthers a good man if thered been anything hed ave found it pitt sat down as near the fire as he could mowbray moved fractionally to make room for him and lifted the teapot offering more tea by raising his eyebrows pitt nodded it was dark brown stewed but it was hot you went the following day pitt pursued the subject mowbray frowned early as seemed decent hate having to do that go and talk to people the moment theyre bereaved before theyve even got over the first shock still has to be done pity york himself wasnt there only the mother and the widow tell me about them pitt interrupted not just the facts how did they impress you mowbray took a deep breath and sighed slowly the elder mrs york was a remarkable woman been something of a beauty in er day i should think still finelooking very pitt did not prompt him he wanted mowbrays own words very womanly mowbray was not satisfied with this description he frowned and blinked several times soft likelike one of them flowers in the botanical gardens his face eased with the flash of memory camellias pale colors and perfect shape all ordered not higgledypiggledy like a wildflower or one o them late roses that falls open pitt liked late roses they were magnificent exuberant but it was a matter of taste perhaps mowbray found them a little vulgar what about the widow pitt kept his voice level trying not to betray any extra interest but mowbray was too perceptive a very slight smile curved his mouth and he kept his eyes on pitts face she were it so ard wi shock she were as white as a corpse erself id swear to that ive seen a lot o women in times o grief its one o the rottenest parts o the job them as are puttin it on tend to weep an faint and talk a lot about ow they feel mrs york ardly spoke a word an seemed sort o numb she didnt look at us like liars do in fact i dont think she cared what we thought pitt smiled in spite of himself not a camellia a bleak humor flickered at the back of mowbrays eyes quite different sort o woman altogether much more again pitt waited more delicate more easy to urt i suppose partly because she were younger o course but i got the feelin she didnt ave the same strength inside er but even shocked as she were she were one o the bestlookin women i ever seen tall and very slight like a spring flower ceptin dark fragile you might say one of those faces you dont forget different from most igh cheeks fine bones he shook his head a little face all full o feelin pitt sat quietly for a moment trying to picture the woman what did the foreign office really fearmurder treason or merely scandal what was the real reason they had asked ballarat to open this case again now was it just to make sure there was nothing sordid that could come out later and ruin an ambassador even in this short interview pitt had formed a respect for mowbray he was a good professional policeman if mowbray believed veronica york was stunned by the shock then pitt probably would have thought so too what did the family say he asked the two ladies had been out to dinner with friends theyd come home about eleven and gone straight up to bed mowbray replied servants confirmed that robert york had been out on some business he worked at the foreign office and he quite often had business in the evenings he came home after the ladies they dont know when neither did the servants theyd been told not to wait up by york himself it looks as if he was still awake when the burglar broke in he must have come downstairs interrupted the intruder in the library and then got killed mowbray pulled a face dont know why i mean why didnt the burglar simply hide or better still get out that window again the latch was open unnecessary very unprofessional what did you conclude finally mowbrays eyebrows rose case unsolved he said then hesitated for several seconds as though weighing whether to commit himself further pitt finished his tea and set the empty mug on the hearth odd case he said casually man knows exactly when to break in without pc lowther seeing him coming or going even though lowther passes every twenty minutes yet instead of going round the back away from the street and using a snakesman to wriggle through the pantry bars or a ratchet and pinion to loosen them he breaks a front windowand doesnt even starglaze it to stop the noise and hide the hole yet he knows enough to find a firstedition swift which is not an obvious thing at alllowther said it was on the shelf with other booksbut on the other hand hes so clumsy he makes enough noise to disturb robert york who comes down and catches him and when york does come instead of hiding or running away the intruder attacks him so fiercely he kills him and doesnt sell any of his haul mowbray finished i know rum very rum wondered if it were someone mr york knew personal like some gentleman ard up turned to robbin is friends started lookin in that line very discreet like even looked very casual at young mrs yorks acquaintancesand got told very gracious and very cool by the powers that be as i should keep to me place and not add to the distress o them as is already sufferin orrible bereavement nobody actually said as i was to mark it unsolved nothin so blunt just an expression o sympathy for the family and a cold eye on me but i dont need to ave it spelled out for me it was what pitt had expected he had experienced the same unspoken but unmistakable sort of thing himself it did not necessarily indicate any suspicion of guilt just a deference for breeding money and the vast indefinable power that went with it i suppose i had better pursue the next line pitt stood up reluctantly it was raining outside he could see the long wet streaks beating against the window blurring the shadows of the roofs and gables outside thank you for your help and the tea dont envy you mowbray said wryly pitt smiled back he liked mowbray and resented having to retrace the mans steps as though he were in some way incompetent damn ballarat and the foreign office outside pitt turned up his coat collar tightened his muffler and put his head down against the rain he walked for a little while feet sloshing up spurts of water hair dripping down his forehead thinking over what he had just learned what was the foreign office after a decent resolution of a case which involved one of their own so it would cause no future embarrassment as ballarat had said the widow of robert york was informally betrothed to one julian danver if danver were headed for an ambassadorship or higher no shadow must touch the reputation of any of his family especially his wife or had some new discovery pertaining to the murder of robert york pointed to treason and were they using pitt to unravel it for them he would take the blame for the tragedy and the scandal which would inevitably follow the careers and reputations ruined it was an ugly job and everything mowbray had told him only made it uglier who had been the other person in the library and why pitt turned from piccadilly down st jamess then across the mall and down the horse guards parade past thebare trees and windwhipped grass of the park up downing street to whitehall and the foreign office it took him a quarter of an hour to persuade the right officials and finally to reach the department where robert york had worked until the time of his death he was met by a distinguished man in his late thirties with black hair and eyes which at first appeared to be equally dark but as he turned to the light proved to be a startling luminous gray he introduced himself as felix asherson and offered to be of any help within his power pitt took that for the limited offer it was thank you sir we have had occasion to look again into the tragic death three years ago of mr robert york ashersons face showed immediate concern but then it would in the foreign office where impeccable manners were part of his trade have you caught someone pitt approached the subject obliquely no i am afraid not but there were several articles stolen at the time it seems very possible the burglar was not a casual housebreaker but a person of education perhaps after something in particular asherson waited patiently indeed and you didnt know that at the time we did sir but i have been asked by certain persons in authorityhe hoped ashersons whitehall training in discretion was sufficient to keep him from asking who to pursue the matter again oh ashersons face tightened almost imperceptibly just a faint movement of muscles around the jaw a thickening of the neck so the stiff wing collar hugged the skin how can we help you interesting how he used the plural making himself a representative of the office not personally involved pitt selected his words carefully since the burglar chose the library and not one of the more obvious rooms like the dining room where the silver was we have to consider that he may have been looking for documents perhaps something mr york was working on at the time asherson was noncommittal indeed pitt waited asherson took a deep breath i suppose thats possible i mean he may have hoped to find something does it help now after all it was three years ago we never abandon a murder case pitt replied blandly yet they had buried this one after six fruitless months why had they opened it again now nono of course asherson conceded what can the foreign office do to assist you pitt decided to be blunt he smiled very slightly holding ashersons eye has any information been missed from this office since mr york first came to work here i appreciate that you may not be able to tell when it was taken only when the discovery was made asherson hesitated you make us sound remarkably inefficient inspector we do not mislay information it is far too important so if information has reached unauthorized places then it was deliberately given pitt asked innocently asherson breathed out slowly grasping for time to think confusion was momentarily naked in his face he did not know what pitt was leading up to nor why there has been information pitt said gently testing making it something between a question and a statement asherson affected immediate ignorance has there then perhaps that was why poor robert was murdered if he took papers home with him and somehow people got to know of it a thief may have he left the rest unsaid then he could have taken such papers home on several occasions pitt pursued or are you suggesting it might have been only once and by some extraordinary chance the thief chose the precise night it was preposterous and they both knew it no of course not asherson smiled faintly he was caught but if he was resentful he hid it superbly i really dont know what happened but if he was indiscreet or had friends who were unworthy of his trust it hardly matters now the poor man is dead and the information cannot have reached our enemies or we should have suffered for it by now and we havent that i can tell you with certainty if there really were such an attempt it was abortive cant you leave his memory in peacenot to mention his family pitt stood up thank you mr asherson you have been most frank good day sir and he left the uncertainlooking asherson standing on the bright blue and vermillion turkish carpet in the middle of the floor back at bow street in the icy dusk pitt climbed the stairs to ballarats office and knocked on the door at the command he went in ballarat was standing in front of the fire blocking it his room was quite different from the functional quarters of the lesser police on the beat downstairs the broad desk was inlaid with green leather the chair behind it was padded and moved comfortably on a swivel there was the stub of a cigar in the stone ashtray ballarat was of average height portly a trifle short in the leg but his rich side whiskers were immaculately barbered and he smelled of cologne his clothes were perfectly pressed from his bright oxblood boots to the matching brown tie round his stiff white collar he was the antithesis of the disheveled pitt whose every garment was at odds with another pockets weighted down by nameless objects even now a piece of string trailed from one and a handknitted muffler half obscured his soft collar well ballarat demanded irritably close the door man i dont want half the station listening the matter is confidential i told you that before well what have you got very little pitt replied they were pretty thorough at the time i know that damn it ive read the papers on the case ballarat pushed his short fingers further into his pockets fists clenched he rocked back and forth very slightly on the balls of his feet was it a chance breakin some amateur who got caught in the act and panicked killing young york instead of escaping like a professional im sure any connection with the foreign office was coincidental i have been told by the highest authority and he repeated the words rolling them on his tongue the highest authority that our enemies have no knowledge of the work york was engaged in more probably some friend of yorks who ran up a debt and turned his hand to burglary to try to get out of it pitt answered frankly and saw the look of displeasure on ballarats face he knew where the firstedition swift was inside help ballarat said immediately bribed a servant possibly assuming there was a servant who knew a firstedition swift when she saw it not the sort of thing the honorable piers york would discuss with the tweeny ballarat opened his mouth to tell pitt not to be sarcastic with him then thought better of it and changed course well if it was one of their social acquaintances youd better be damn careful in your questions pitt this is a very delicate investigation weve been entrusted with a careless word and you could ruin reputationsnot to mention your own career he looked increasingly uncomfortable his face flushed to a dull purplish hue all the foreign office wants us to establish is that there was nothinguntoward nothing unseemly in mrs yorks conduct it is no part of your business to blacken the name of a dead man an honorable man who gave distinguished service to his queen and to his country well there has been information disappearing from the foreign office pitt said his voice rising in frustration and the burglary at the york house needs a great deal more explanation than its had so far then get on with it man ballarat snapped either find out which friend it was or better still prove it wasnt a friend at all clear mrs veronica york of the slightest possible mark against her character and well all be thanked pitt opened his mouth to retort but saw the pointlessness of it reflected in ballarats black eyes he swallowed his temper yes sir he went out with his mind seething then the cold air hit his face stinging with rain and he was jostled by passersby on the dark pavements he heard carriages clattering by saw shops with windows lit and gas lamps burning in the streets smelled chestnuts roasting on a brazier pitt heard someone singing a carol and he was overtaken by other things he imagined his childrens faces on christmas morning they were old enough now to be excited already daniel asked every night if it was christmas tomorrow yet and jemima with a sixyearolds eldersister superiority told him he must wait pitt smiled he had made a wooden train for daniel with an engine and six carriages he had bought a doll for jemima and charlotte was sewing dresses petticoats and a fine bonnet for her lately he had noticed that when he came in unexpectedly she pushed her sewing in a bundle under a cushion and looked up far too innocently at him his smile broadened he knew she was making something for him he was particularly pleased with what he had found for her a pink alabaster vase about nine inches high simple and perfect it had taken him seven weeks to save up enough the only problem was emily charlottes widowed sister she had married for love but her husband george had had both title and wealth after the shock of her bereavement last summer it was only natural that she and her fiveyearold son edward should come on christmas eve to spend the holiday with her sister but what could pitt possibly afford to give emily that would please her he had still not solved the problem when he arrived at his front door pitt took off his wet coat and hung it on the hook undid his sodden boots and started towards the kitchen in his stocking feet jemima met him halfway along the passage cheeks flushed eyes shining papa isnt it christmas yet isnt it even christmas eve not yet he swung her up into his arms and hugged her are you sure yes my sweetheart im sure he carried her into the kitchen and put her down gracie the maid was upstairs with daniel charlotte was alone surveying the final touches to her christmas cake a wisp of hair curling over her brow she smiled at him any interesting cases no an old case that will go nowhere he kissed her once then kissed her again with growing warmth nothing she persisted nothing its only a formality at first charlotte accepted pitts brief dismissal of his new case because she was preoccupied with christmas and all the arrangements there was so much that had to be done in the kitchen the hiding of carefully wrapped threepenny pieces in the plum pudding the making of sweets jam for tarts and chopped fruits for mince pies and there were presents to finish and wrap in colored paper on top of that everything must be kept secret to be a surprise on the day at any other time she would have been more inquisitive and considerably more persistent in the past charlotte had involved herself in some of thomass most complex and personally tragic cases drawn in by deliberate curiosity or outrage at some event it was only last summer that her sister emilys husband had been murdered and that case had seemed endless emily herself had been the main suspect george had had a shortlived but intense affair with sybilla march and emily was the only one who knew it had ended the night before he died who could be expected to believe her when all the evidence was to the contrary and emily in her efforts to win back georges attention had been so indiscreet with jack radley that she had deliberately given everyone the impression that she herself was romantically involved charlotte had never been so afraid as during that period nor felt true tragedy as close when their elder sister sarah had died it had been a loss sudden and stark but imposed from outside a chance event that might have stricken anyone georges death was different it had seemed a failure from within all their assumptions about safety and love had been shattered in a simple reverberating act touching everything and marring it all with doubt what lack in emily what emptiness in the trust she had thought so deep had turned george to another woman with such passion their reconciliation after had been so brief so delicate and so private it had not had time to blossom and no one else had known of it and the next morning george was dead there had been no pity no attention of concerned friends as when sarah died rather there had been suspicion even hate all sorts of old enmities and mistakes raked up and added to in the fear that blame would run over and scald everyone leaving other peoples secrets and weaknesses exposedas indeed they had been it was six months ago now and emily had recovered from the shock the social acceptance had returned indeed people fell over themselves to make up for their guilt at having been suspicious and their social cowardice at the time but for all that society still required that widows be seen to mourn especially those of men from old and titled families such as the ashworths the fact that emily was not yet thirty would not in any way excuse her from remaining at home receiving only relatives and wearing unrelieved black she must not attend any social functions that might appear frivolous or enjoyable and she must maintain an attitude of gravity at all times she was finding it almost unendurable to begin with as soon as georges murderer was found and the matter closed she had gone into the country with edward to be alone and spend her time helping him to understand the death of his father and his own new position with the autumn she had returned to the city but all the usual parties operas balls and soirees were closed to her the friends who did call on her were sober to the point of stultification and no one gossiped or discussed fashion or the latest play or who was flirting with whom considering those topics too trivial to disturb her grief the time emily spent sitting at home writing letters playing the piano or stitching endless needlework felt like a constant scraping of the skin the source of a raging discontent naturally charlotte had invited emily to come for christmas with edward who would find the company of other children the best present of all but what about after christmas emily would have to return to the ashworth town house alone and bored to tears and to tell the truth as deeply as she loved her home and her children six months of uninterrupted domesticity was beginning to hang a little heavily on charlotte also she had asked pitt about his new case with more than wifely concernthere was as well a desire for adventure in the question the following evening charlotte prepared her ground a little more carefully she waited until after dinner when they were sitting in front of the parlor fire the children were long in bed and she was carefully stitching butterfly ornaments to put on the christmas tree thomas she began casually if the case is really nothing of importancejust a formality as you saiddo you think you will be able to leave it over christmas she did not look up keeping her eyes on her thread and the delicate gossamer she was sewing i he hesitated i think there may be more to it than i supposed charlotte kept her curiosity subdued with great difficulty oh dear how is that a burglary that is hard to understand oh this time she did not need to pretend indifference burglaries were impersonal the loss of possessions held no interest for her what was stolen two miniatures a vase a paperweight and a firstedition book he replied what is difficult to understand about that then she looked up and found him smiling thomas instantly she knew there was more an element of mystery or concealed emotion the son of the house disturbed the burglar and was killed his eyes were steady on hers speculative he was amused by her curiosity and her attempts to disguise it yet he respected her perceptiveness and none of the stolen articles ever turned up he finished yes without realizing it she had let her sewing fall thomas he slid down into his chair crossing his legs comfortably and told her what he knew adding ballarats warning about discretion and the reputations that could be ruined and the information that the foreign office had mislaid mislaid she repeated the word skeptically do you mean stolen i dont know i dont suppose i ever will if information was taken it would have been copied not removed if robert york had papers in his house that might have been what the burglar was after and he merely took the other things to cover up the fact more likely it had nothing to do with it she took up her sewing again setting it on the side table so she should not lose the needle but what in goodness name does the foreign office expect of you she pressed if there is a spy isnt it desperately important he should be caught quite apart from his having murdered poor robert york i daresay he has been he said ruefully and the foreign office wishes to keep quiet about it what they really want is for us to test their skill make sure the mislaid information is hidden beyond recall it will do our reputation in the world little good to make such things public or perhaps there never was anything missing do you believe that she challenged no but it may have been carelessness more than deceit what are you going to do about robert yorks murder someone killed him follow the burglary as far as i can he said with a slight shrug what is the widow like charlotte was not willing to let it go yet there must be something interesting that she could relay to emily i dont know i have had no excuse yet to call on her without making her suspicious and that is the last thing the foreign office wishes it would immediately raise all sorts of ugly questions you havent mentioned jack radley lately is emily still keeping his acquaintance that was a matter much closer to charlottes heart and she was prepared to abandon the unpromising mystery for it jack radley had begun as a diversion someone emily had flirted with to prove to george that she could be every bit as charming as poised as witty as her rival as the events of the case progressed he had become a prime suspect but jack had turned out to be a generous friend far less superficial and selfseeking than his reputation had led emily to believe he had no money and fewer prospects the obvious thought unkind as it might be was that he pursued emily for the wealth she had inherited on georges death his success with women was well known his vanity might have led him to murder george then court emily and marry her he had proved to be quite innocent of any crime but he was still far from the suitor society would have wished for emily when the time was right certainly their mother would be appalled none of that bothered charlotte greatly whatever people thought it could not possibly be worse than what they had thought of charlotte herself for marrying a policeman jack radley was impecunious but he was very definitely a gentleman policemen barely ranked above bailiffs and ratcatchers but was jack radley capable of love to imagine that everyone was if only given the right companion was a romantic mistake that was very easily made but it was still a mistake many people desire no more than a convention the sharing of a home a social position children and the wider family they do not wish to share their thoughts or their leisure above all they do not wish to reveal their inner selves where dreams are held where they may be known and thus wounded they will not take risks in the end there is no generosity of soul only safety there is no giving where there may be cost regardless of his charm or his wit his warm and friendly manner if jack radley was one of these in the end he would bring emily only pain and charlotte would do everything in her power to prevent that charlotte pitt interrupted her thoughts a little sharply the answer mattered to him also he was very fond of emily too and he understood how it would hurt her if charlottes unspoken fear were justified i think so she said quickly we havent spoken of him much lately we have been so busy discussing christmas she is bringing a goose and mince puddings he sank a little lower in the chair and stretched his feet towards the fire i think if you want to play detectivehe looked up at her through his lashesyou would do more good exercising your judgment on jack radley than speculating about mrs york she gave him no argument what he said was undoubtedly true and although he phrased it gently it was something in the nature of a command beneath his comfortable sprawl and his light manner pitt was worried however charlotte had every intention of combining the two she could think of no more effective way of seeing enough of emily to be able to exercise her judgment as thomas had said than to encourage her to play detective in another case at christmas any discussion or judgment would be next to impossible but later if charlotte were to visit emily at her home where she might meet jack radley herself she might be in a position to form a more valid opinion of him without being obvious about it she was ready her plan prepared when emily called the following morning a little after eleven she came straight into the kitchen in a whirl of black barathea trimmed with black fox fur up to her chin her fair hair coiled under a sweeping black hat for a moment charlotte was envious the expensive coat looked so indescribably elegant then she remembered the reason her sister wore black and was instantly ashamed emily looked pale apart from the spots of color stung into her cheeks by the ice on the wind and there were gray smudges under her eyes where the skin looked bruised and papery charlotte did not need to be told her sister was restless and sleeping too little boredom is not by any means the worst of afflictions but it carries its own kind of debilitation christmas would be all too brief and what would emily do after that have a cup of tea charlotte offered turning to the big kitchen range without waiting for an answer have you ever been to hanover close emily took off her coat and sat at the kitchen table resting her elbows on its scrubbed wood her dress beneath the coat was equally elegant although there were places where she did not fill it out as she used to no but i know where it is why the answering inquiry was merely polite charlotte plunged in at the deepest point there has been a murder there in hanover close this time she had emilys full attention good heavens thats terribly exclusive the best possible tasteand money who is dead robert york he used to work at the foreign office until he died i mean how was he killed i didnt read of it normally a lady of emilys position would not have read a newspaper at all apart from perhaps the society pages and the court circular but unlike their papa george had been very lenient where such things were concernedas long as she did not offend people by discussing them and of course since his death she did as she pleased charlotte poured the water from the kettle into the teapot then placed it on the table with a cream jug and two of her best cups it happened three years ago she said as carelessly as she could thomas has just been asked to reopen the case because the widow is to marry again to someone else in the foreign office emily perked up is she betrothed yet i havent seen news of that either and i always read the society pages that is about the only way i get to hear anything no one tells me anything anymore its as if the whole subject of relationships between men and women were something i should not be reminded of unconsciously her fist clenched charlotte noticed it that is the point she said quickly thomas has been asked to investigate to see if she is a suitable person to marry someone as important as mr danver will become when he is promoted might she not be emily asked please do pour the tea im as dry as the sahara and its had plenty of time to brew has she a reputation i wish i could hear more im so cut off its as if i were a leper half the people i used to know are embarrassed to see me and the other half spend their time sitting around solemnly and talking in whispers as if i were dying myself she sniffed fiercely searching in her reticule for a handkerchief it was not selfpity so much as the sudden warmth of the kitchen after the cold air in the carriage which provoked the necessity charlotte shook her head no thats as much as i have learned but the crime itself is very unexplained she poured the tea and pushed emilys cup across towards her along with a piece of fresh ginger cake which was taken readily it is rather odd and she told emily all that pitt had told her very odd emily agreed at last i wonder if she had a lover and there was a quarrel i suppose that is really what the foreign office wants thomas to discover but they are afraid to say so in case it should get back to mr danver who would be furious and of course it would prejudice him terribly he would never have any peace of mind at such a slur neither would she charlotte said hotly if it is untrue it could be the most appalling injustice but i dont know how thomas will be able to make any inquiries it is hardly the thing a policeman can ask of her social acquaintances emily smiled my dear charlotte you dont need to labor the point so hard you are being singularly unsubtle even for you of course we will find out we have done nothing but bake cakes and stitch seams for six months and i am ready to scream with it we shall prove veronica yorks impeccable reputation or ruin it entirely where shall we begin charlotte had already anticipated the difficulties emily could no longer move in society as she had when george was alive and charlotte as the wife of a policeman had not the money to dress appropriately nor the friends upon whom to call there was only georges greataunt vespasia who would understand and assist but she was over eighty and since georges death had taken a less active part in affairs than before she was devoted to a number of causes and believed that the battle against poverty and injustice could be tackled through reform of the law she was currently engaged in a struggle to improve the working conditions in factories which employed children especially those under the age of ten charlotte poured more tea into her cup and sipped it are you still in acquaintance with jack radley she asked trying to sound casual as if the question were entirely to do with the problem of veronica york emily reached for the ginger cake again he calls upon me from time to time do you think he might involve himself she cut a large slice of the cake and bit into it hungrily perhaps he might help us toto arrange a meeting charlotte suggested not us emily made a face you she poured herself more tea spilling it at this she swore using a word she had heard george use in the stables charlotte knew her reaction had nothing to do with the mess in the saucer she was frustrated by the imprisonment of mourning and above all the loneliness i know i shall have to do it this time charlotte agreed and you will have to instruct me i shall gather what information i can and together we will unravel what it means it was not like being there herself catching the nuances of tone the expression fleeting across the face the glance from one to another but emily knew that charlottes idea was the best she could hope for and she was grateful for it it would have been ladylike to wait until jack radley called upon her she did not imagine it would be long before he did he had made his admiration plain enough six months ago and in the intervening time had visited her on many occasions it was not the depth of his regard she doubted but the quality did he court her for herself or because she was georges widow with georges position and georges money she enjoyed his company as much as she had ever enjoyed anyonesand that was a rather startling admission considering her suspicions put how close is liking to loving when she had married george he had been the catch of the season emily had been perfectly aware of his faults she had considered them part of the bargain and accepted them graciously he in turn had proved to be all that she had hoped and had never criticized any of her imperfections what had begun as a perfect understanding had grown into something much warmer her first perception of him had been as the handsome reckless lord george ashworth the ideal husband her feelings for george had matured into a gentle and loyal love as she had begun to see the reality of a man who was worldly in sport and finance charming in society without the least duplicity in his nature nor the least subtlety she had always had enough wisdom to hide the fact that she was probably both more intelligent than he and more courageous she had also been less tolerant and less generous in her judgments he had had a quick temper but it passed like a squall he had overlooked the foibles of his own class and ignored the weaknesses of others she did neither injustice infuriated her more now than when she was younger as time passed she was becoming more like charlotte who had always been opinionated quick to anger and a fighter against all she perceived to be wrong even though that perception was sometimes hasty and far too outspoken emily had been more sensibleat least until now today she sat down and wrote a letter to jack radley inviting him to call upon her at his earliest convenience and dispatched the footman with it as soon as it was sealed his reply was satisfactorily rapid he arrived in the early evening the hour when in happier times she would have been dressing for an evening at dinner or perhaps a ball or the theater now she sat by the fire reading robert louis stevensons the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde published the previous year she was glad to be interrupted the story was darker and far more frightening than she had supposed and she could see the elements of tragedy already she had it in a brown paper cover in case the servants should be scandalized jack radley entered the moment after the parlormaid announced him he was casually dressed but his tailor was clearly his chief creditor the cut of his trousers was immaculate the jacket fit perfectly it was his smile she looked to however and those remarkable eyes which were full of concern emily are you all right he asked searching her face your message sounded urgent has something happened she felt a trifle foolish im sorry it is not an emergency and i am perfectly well thank you but i am bored to distraction and charlotte has discovered a mystery there was no point in lying to him he was too like her to be deceived his face relaxed into a smile and he sat down on the chair opposite her a mystery she tried to sound nonchalant suddenly realizing that he might imagine she had dredged up an excuse to call him an old murder she continued quickly that may have a scandal behind it or may not in which case an innocent woman might be ruined and unable to marry the man she loves he looked puzzled but what can you do and how can i help there is a great deal the police can discover of course about facts she explained but they cant make the sort of judgments we might because it all has to be terribly discreet she saw with a flicker of excitement that she had caught his interest and naturally no one would speak in front of the police as they might with us nor would the police understand the shades of meaning if they did but how can we find ourselves in a position to observe these people he said seriously you havent told me who they arebut regardless of that emily you cannot introduce yourself into society again for some time his face tightened and for an unpleasant moment she feared she saw pity in his eyes she might have accepted pity from someone else but coming from jack it grated surprisingly like an abrasion of the skin i know i cant she said and instantly regretted the tartness in her voice and yet was unable to stop it but charlotte can and then we can discuss it together at least she can if you will be prepared to help her he smiled a little ruefully i am very good at scraping an acquaintance who are they she looked up at his face trying to read his expression his eyelashes still shadowed his cheek the way she remembered how many other women had thought precisely the same thing really this was the utmost foolishness charlotte was right she needed some occupation for her mind before it became completely addled the man who was murdered was robert york she said briskly the widow is mrs veronica york of hanover close she stopped he was smiling broadly not difficult at all he said confidently i used to know her in fact he hesitated apparently uncertain how indiscreet to be emily felt a stab of jealousy that was quite uncharacteristic she knew it was extremely silly she was thoroughly aware of his reputation and anyway she was a woman who had never cherished delusions she knew perfectly well that men held themselves accountable to quite a different set of standards from those they expected of women it was only necessary never to be so flagrant that others could not affect ignorance what they suspected was irrelevant all realistic people knew as much judicious blindness was the only way to preserve peace of mind but it was a standard emily was becoming increasingly impatient with even though she knew her feelings were foolish and highly impractical did you part in a manner which would allow you to take up the acquaintance again she said crisply his face fell certainly she looked down not wanting him to guess at any emotion in her certainly nothing as unattractive as the truth then will you with charlotte as you say it would be impossible for me of course he said slowly and she knew he was looking at her but will pitt approve and i can hardly introduce her as a policemans wife well have to think of something better thomas wont have to know she can come here first borrow one of my dresses and go as she searched her imagination as a cousin of yours up from the country a close cousin so it will not be in the least improper for you to accompany her without a chaperone will she agree to that there was already interest in his voice and not the incredulity he might have felt towards someone else perhaps he was remembering cardington crescent oh yes emily said with intense determination certainly she will two days later handsomely dressed in one of emilys winter gowns adapted from last seasonshe had bought nothing but black this wintercharlotte found herself in a smart carriage bowling along park lane towards hanover close with jack radley beside her he had called at the york house immediately upon parting from emily he left his card and asked if he might introduce to them his cousin miss elisabeth barnaby who was newly come up from the country after nursing her aunt through a long and distressing illness from which she was at last mercifully recovered now miss barnaby was in need of a little diversion and for this reason jack had presumed on an old acquaintance in the hope he might introduce her the reply had been brief but perfectly civil quite enough upon which to call charlotte pulled the rug tighter round her knees the carriage was bitterly cold and it was raining hard outside daggers of water stabbing the gutters hissing under the wheels and spraying high the leather upholstery inside felt damp to the toucheven the wood of the window frames was clammy emilys dress was excellent since her maid had let it out across the bosom and lengthened the cuffs an inch all very suitable for a young woman recently come up from the country while not obviously secondhand neither was it of the latest fashion such as might be worn by someone in no need of introduction but charlotte was still cold the carriage stopped she glanced quickly at jack radley beside her and swallowed feeling a tight flicker of apprehension this was a very rash thing she was doing pitt would be furious if he knew and the chance of being caught was very real it would be easy enough to make a crucial mistake or slip of the tongue she might have the misfortune to meet someone who had known her before her marriage when she still moved in such circles the door was opened and jack waited to hand her down she stepped out wincing against the cold needles of rain she felt no better about the impending visit but she could hardly remain in the carriage and say she had changed her mind she weighed her sense of caution and the anticipation of thomass anger against the excitement she had felt when she and emily discussed the plan she was still of two minds when the parlormaid opened the front door and jack handed her his card which was engraved with his name and miss elisabeth barnaby had been added by hand now it was too late the die was cast charlotte put on her most charming smile and stepped inside the parlormaid had a creamy complexion and dark hair she was very pert with wide eyes and a handspan waist but then parlormaids were usually chosen for their looks a handsome parlormaid was a mark of ones status and taste charlotte barely had time to glance round the hall except to notice that it was spacious the stair was wide and remarkably fine with beautifully carved bannisters and the chandelier blazed with light on this dark winter afternoon they were shown into the withdrawing room there was no time to look at the furnishings or the paintings all charlottes attention was taken up by the two women who sat opposite each other on the overstuffed and buttoned red settees the younger who must be veronica york was tall and perhaps a good deal too slender for the current fashion but there was an intense femininity in the delicate lines of her shoulders and throat her soft black hair was swept up and off her face showing a lovely brow and fine features slightly hollow cheeks and a startlingly sensuous mouth the older woman had thick curly light brown hair her curls were so rich no rags or irons could have created them only nature she looked to be considerably shorter than the other woman although she was of heavier build she was still extremely comely in an embroidered gown of the latest fashion her features were regular and she had obviously been something of a beauty well into her prime she was only just beyond it now and the telltale lines on her pink and white skin were few and round the mouth rather than the eyes it was a face of arresting strength this must be loretta york the dead mans mother whom thomas had said behaved with such dignity on the night of the tragedy as mistress of the house she welcomed them inclining her head to jack and offering her hand good afternoon mr radley how agreeable of you to call and to bring your cousin she turned to charlotte with a scrutinizing eye miss barnaby i believe you said charlotte put on the most innocent air she could imagine and all but curtsied she was supposed to be shy and grateful seeking london society and as a single woman of desperate age a husband how do you do mrs york it is most kind of you to receive us i hope we find you as well as you look maam jacks flattery was automatic it was the usual coin of exchange and he had dined out most of his adult life on his charm you make me forget it is winter outside and several years since we last met i see your manners have not changed she said a trifle tartly but there was a flush of pleasure in her cheeks she might protest discard it as convention but she liked it all the same of course you know my daughterinlaw she said indicating the younger woman with no more than a glance in her direction jack bowed again very slightly but enough for grace of course i was most grieved to hear of your loss and i hope that the future will hold some happiness for you thank you a tiny smile touched the corners of veronica yorks lips watching closely charlotte could see there was an old understanding between them that had been picked up effortlessly a thought of emily flashed into her mind and she pushed it aside that was another problem to be faced at another time veronica was looking past jack and assessing charlotte judging the cut of her gown its newness its cost as was loretta charlotte was satisfied that it communicated her new status preciselyit was the gown of a country woman somewhat retired from society by duties of compassion but of good family and more than adequate means i do hope you will find london to your liking miss barnaby veronica said graciously there will be much to divert you but of course you must take care because there is also company you would not wish and it is easy enough to find yourself in distasteful places if you are not wise in your choices charlotte seized the chance she smiled shyly that is most kind of you mrs york i shall be sure to take your advice a womans reputation can be so quickly ruined quite loretta agreed pray do be seated miss barnaby charlotte thanked her and sat carefully on a stiffbacked chair arranging her skirt for a moment she was reminded with unpleasant clarity of the time before her marriage when she had often been in situations something like this she had been escorted by her mother to all the right functions shown off to best advantage in the hope that some eligible man would be attracted and a suitable marriage arranged always she had ended by expressing too forceful an opinion upon something or laughing inappropriately or being altogether too willful and failing to charmquite often on purpose but then she had thought herself in love with her elder sisters husband and the idea of marrying anyone else had been unspeakable how long ago how girlish that seemed now nevertheless she remembered the relentless good manners the pursuit of fashion and all directed towards finding a husband have you been in london before miss barnaby the elder mrs york was inquiring her cool gray eyes summing up charlottes very handsome figure and noting the tiny needle holes where the bodice had been let out for once charlotte did not mind this was only a part she was playing and she must remember to observe closely so as to have something to report back to emily oh yes but not for some time owing to my aunts illness happily she is quite recovered and i am free to take up my own life again but i do feel i have missed so much i imagine a great deal has happened in society since no doubt mrs york said with a tiny smile although there is a certain sameness in events from year to year and only the peoples names change oh i think the people are quite different also veronica argued and certainly the theater is mrs york shot her a glance that charlotte noted with interest critical then instantly muted there was no gentleness in it you know very little of the theater she pointed out you have scarcely been till this year she turned to charlotte my daughterinlaw is a recent widow naturally she has remained in mourning until quite lately charlotte had already decided to pretend complete ignorance of the affair in hanover close and anything to do with it she put on an instant expression of sympathy i am so sorry please accept my deepest condolences i should not have troubled you had i known she turned to jack who studiously avoided her eye it has been three years veronica said into the rather awkward silence she looked not at her motherinlaws face but downward to the rich winecolored brocade of her own skirt then back at charlotte we too are taking up our lives again you are mrs yorks tone made the distinction delicate but perfectly plain it was charged with emotion but try as she might charlotte could not define it was she reminding the younger woman that her own loss of a son was irreplaceable and somewhat deeper than the loss of a husband since veronica planned to remarry there seemed more in her face than awareness of her daughterinlaws pain or even envy or anything so vulnerable as selfpity her small strong hands were white in her lap and her eyes were glittering and sharp had not such an idea been so out of place even ridiculous charlotte might have thought it a warning of some sort but that was groundless and an inaccurate observation veronicas full lips curved upwards in a tiny smile clearly she understood the significance of the reply indeed mr radley you may congratulate me she said looking up at him i am to be married again in that instant charlotte made a mental note that veronica york and jack radley had certainly had a friendship that was more than merely amicable at least on her part jack smiled as if it were a happy surprise to him i hope you will have every blessing and good fortune and so do i charlotte added i hope sadness will be completely in the past for you you are something of a romantic miss barnaby mrs york remarked with her eyebrows raised she was almost smiling but there was a coldness in her that was palpable something hard deep inside that was unresolved perhaps it was an old wound and nothing to do with this one never knew what pain or disillusion lay in other peoples lives what lost hopes charlotte must endeavor to meet the honorable piers york at some time it might explain much that she could only guess at now she smiled as dazzlingly at mrs york as she could oh but of course even if the reality is not always as one would wish i hope for the best was that the right sort of naivete or had she overdone it she must not sit here for the brief half hour that was socially acceptable and then leave again without having learned a thing it would be some time before she could call again so do i veronica reassured her and it is most kind of you mr danver is an excellent man and i am sure i shall be very happy do you paint miss barnaby mrs york asked changing the subject abruptly this time without looking at veronica perhaps mr radley might take you to see the winter exhibition at the royal academy i daresay it may interest you i dont paint very well let them take that as modesty or the truth as they chose actually like all wellbred young ladies she had been taught to paint but her brush was never equal to her imagination since she had married pitt and had two children her only hobby had been meddling in his cases and detecting a great deal she had a gift for iteven pitt admitted sobut she could hardly own to that now i had not supposed you to enter a work miss barnaby merely to observe mrs york replied with a small gesture of her hand a wry dismissal of foolishness that stung charlotte but in her role as miss barnaby she was helpless to retaliate no skill would be required mrs york continued except to look elegant and speak modestly i am sure you could do both of those with the greatest of ease you are very kind charlotte said between her teeth veronica leaned forward she really was a beautiful woman her face combining both fragility of bone with strength of mouth and eye her manner was as friendly as if they had known each other for some time charlotte found herself hoping pitt would find her blameless enough to satisfy the people at the foreign office the thought of their judgments lit a spark of anger inside her perhaps you would care to come with me veronica offered i should be delighted to have your company we could make all the remarks we wished and be utterly frank about what we like and dislike she did not look at her motherinlaw but raised one slender shoulder in the smallest gesture of exclusion i should be delighted charlotte accepted sincerely it would be the greatest pleasure she was aware of jack coughing in the chair next to hers and reaching for a handkerchief to hide his smile then it is settled veronica said firmly it is not a favorite outing of mamainlaws i am sure she will be grateful for being spared it this year i have accompanied you to many places that were not especially to my liking mrs york said with cold eyes on veronica and doubtless will do so again family responsibilities are something one never grows out of nor is one able to escape them i am sure you would agree with me miss barnaby she spoke to charlotte but it was veronica her glance fell on first before turning with a change of expression so slight it was barely definable charlotte had the sudden intense feeling that the two women disliked each other perhaps even more than that veronica stiffened and a tightness crept into her neck the long line of her throat and her passionate mouth she said nothing charlotte believed they were speaking of something quite different and for all the tension between them and the underlying violence they understood each other perfectly of course charlotte murmured after all she was supposed to have spent the last two years nursing a sickly relative what sacrifice to duty could an unmarried woman have greater than that families are bound by both love and obligation it was almost time for them to leave she must make one last effort at learning something deeper beyond this sharp unhappy impression she discreetiy glanced rapidly round the room without turning her head she noticed an ormolu clock if she were going to lie she might as well do it in the grand manner oh what a delightful clock she said admiringly my cousin used to have one very like that only a trifle smaller i think and one of the figures was clothed differently she shivered to add verisimilitude unfortunately it was taken in a robbery such a dreadful experience she ignored jacks horrified expression and plunged on quite as painful as the loss of possessions was the awful feeling that someone had broken into your house and perhaps actually stood within yards of your bedroom as you lay asleep it took us all ages before we could retire again with the slightest peace of mind through her lashes she was watching their faces she was rewarded by a gasp from veronica and a sudden rigidity in mrs yorks body under its folds of sumptuous silk we called the police of course she went on relentlessly but no one was caught and none of our precious things was ever recovered veronica opened her mouth sat perfectly still then closed it without speaking what a misfortune for you mrs yorks voice was quite low but there was a curious edge to it and her words were unusually distinct as if her control over them were precarious i am afraid it is part of presentday life one is seldom as safe as one imagines be thankful miss barnaby that it was only goods of which you were robbed charlotte maintained her facade of innocence although it stabbed her conscience she gazed back at mrs york in bewilderment jack had already affected ignorance of the affair so he could not now help charlotte saw the color drain from veronicas face again she seemed about to speak but then to lose the words she raised her eyes to her motherinlaw then before their glances met she looked away again finally it was the older woman who broke the hot silence my son was killed by an intruder in the house miss barnaby it is something we still find too distressing to discuss that is what made me say you were fortunate to have lost only material possessions oh i am so sorry charlotte said instantly please forgive me for having brought you pain how could i have been so clumsy a real feeling of guilt was burning inside her already not everything can be justified by the need for solutions to mysteries however intriguing or needed for emilys sake you could not know veronica said huskily please do not feel at fault i promise you we do not hold you so i am sure your sensitivity will prevent you from raising the subject again mrs york said levelly and charlotte felt the heat rise in her cheeks veronica was quick to see her embarrassment and rushed to ease it that hardly needs to be said mamainlaw her tone carried reproof and the undertone of dislike was there again bleak and painful in this opulent and comfortable room it was not a flash of irritation but a longlived and bitter thing surfacing suddenly i am sure miss barnaby needs to feel no blame for having mentioned her own misfortune how could she have known of ourour tragedies one cannot cease from all conversation in case it should waken a painful memory in someone else i believe that was the substance of my remark mrs york stared at her daughterinlaw her brilliant eyes almost hypnotic in their concentration if miss barnaby is the person of sensibility i take her to be having discovered our loss she will not mention any subject close to it again while in our company surely that is plain enough veronica turned to charlotte and put out her hand i hope you will call on us again miss barnaby and that you will come to the academy with me i most sincerely meant my invitation it was not merely a pleasantry i shall be delighted charlotte said taking the offered hand warmly it will be the greatest pleasure and i look forward to it she rose it was now time to leave after that conversation it was the only possible course jack rose also and together they expressed their thanks and good wishes and five minutes later they were in the chilly carriage with the clatter of hooves and the hissing of wheels in the rain charlotte wrapped the rug round herself more tightly but nothing could keep all the icy spears of the draft away next time she borrowed a gown from emily she would take a fur muff to go with it i assume you will be going to the academy with veronica jack said after a moment or two of course she turned in her seat to look at him dont you think there is a great deal between veronica and mrs york which the police could never discover i think they both know something about the night of the burglaryalthough how well ever learn it i cant imagine pitt had no idea that charlotte had gone to hanover close he both knew and understood her concern for emily and he expected her to use all her powers of judgment and deduction to find out just how emily felt about jack radley and to measure his worthiness if emily truly cared for him and if it turned out he was not satisfactory there would be the major challenge of either dissuading emily from pursuing it any further or discouraging radley himself pitt suspected that it might well take all charlottes skill to bring the affair to the conclusion that would cause emily the least pain therefore he did not mention the york burglary or robert yorks death to charlotte again nor keep her up to date on his own pursuit of a solution ballarat was evasive about the precise reason for opening the case again it was unclear whether they hoped to discover who had murdered robert york at this late date or whether learning the motive was the real purpose of the investigation perhaps they wanted to establish beyond a doubt that it had been no more than a simple robbery that had erupted into unplanned violence putting an end to the rumors of treason once and for all or were they really concerned that veronica york was somehow involved the unwitting catalyst of a crime of passion inexpertly covered to look like robbery or did they know the truth and simply wish to make doubly sure it was successfully concealed forever by having the police test it and if it did not break then they could rest easy that it was buried beyond anyones recall pitt found this last possibility acutely distasteful and possibly he wronged his superiors by letting it enter his mind but he was determined to think it through until he could present ballarat with an answer that was beyond denial or dispute he began with the stolen articles and the curious fact that none of them had turned up in the places one might have expected despite the vigorous search the police had kept up throughout the following year all the wellknown fences pawnbrokers and less fastidious collectors of objects darts had been questioned at regular intervals as a matter of course and on each occasion the york pieces had been on the list of goods mentioned but pitt had been in the metropolitan police for nearly twenty years and he knew people ballarat had never heard of secretive dangerous people who tolerated him for past and future favors and it was to these he went while charlotte was arranging her visit to the drawing rooms of hanover close he left bow street and walked sharply eastward towards the thames disappearing into one of the vast dockland slums he passed crowded warped buildings dark under the lowering skies and filled with the sour reek of the fog that crept up from the slow grayblack water of the river there were no carriages with lamps and footmen here only dim wagons laden with bales for the wharves and carts with a few limp vegetables for sale a tinker with pans clattered as he jiggled over the uneven cobbles an oldclothes seller shouted ol clo ol clo in a mournful penetrating voice his horses hooves had no echo in the drenching gloom pitt walked quickly his head down and his shoulders hunched he wore old boots with loose soles and a grimy jacket torn at the back which he kept for such visits he pulled the thin collar up round his ears now but still the rain trickled down his neck to his back a wandering icy finger that made him shudder no one paid him any attention apart from the occasional glance when a peddlar or coster half hoped he might buy something but he did not look like a man who had the means to purchase and with face averted and body tight with the knowledge of the warmth he had left behind he hurried deeper into the alleys and passages of the warren finally he found the door he sought its wood black with age and dirt metal studs worn smooth by countless hands he knocked sharply twice and then twice again after a moment or two it opened six inches on a chain stopping with a clunk as it reached its limit even though it was midmorning the daylight scarcely penetrated these narrow alleys their jettied stories almost meeting overhead eaves forever dripping in incessant uneven rhythm a rat squeaked and scuttled away someone tripped over a pile of rubbish and swore in the distant street the wail ol clo came again and down on the river the moan of a foghorn the smell of rot filled pitts throat mr pinhorn he said quietly a matter of business there was a moments silence then a candle flame appeared in the gloom he could see little beyond it but the outline of a large sharp nose and the black sockets of two eyes but he knew pinhorn always answered the door himself afraid that his apprentices would keep the trade for themselves and do him out of a few pence its you pinhorn said sourly recognizing him wotcher want i got nuffink for yer information mr pinhorn and a warning for you pinhorn made a sound deep in his adenoids as if he were going to spit then changed it into a bark it expressed ineffable contempt robberys one thing and murders another pitt said carefully not at all disturbed he had known pinhorn for over a decade and this reception was exactly what he expected and treason is a third thing nastier than both again there was silence pitt knew better than to push his case pinhorn had fenced stolen goods for forty years he understood his risks perfectly or he would not still be alive a prisoner only of poverty ignorance and greed he would be in one of her majestys prisons like coldbath fields where labor such as the treadmill or passing the shot would have broken even his thick hard body the chain rattled as he took it off and the door swung wide noiselessly on oiled hinges come in mr pitt he locked the door behind him and led the way down a passage piled with old furniture and smelling of mold round a corner and into a room that was surprisingly warm a fire in an open grate shed a flickering light on the stained walls a piece of heavy red carpet no doubt garnered from some burglary lay before the grate between two plushcovered armchairs all the rest of the room apart from that cleared space was piled with dimly perceived objects carved chairs pictures boxes clocks pitchers and ewers piles of plates balanced at a crazy angle a mirror caught the firelight and winked a red eye wotcher want mr pitt pinhorn asked again eyeing pitt narrowly he was a big man barrelchested bulletheaded his gray hair in a terrier crop such as prisoners wore although he had never actually been caught or tried in his youth he had enjoyed something of a reputation as a bareknuckle fighter and he was still capable of beating a man senseless if he lost his temper which happened suddenly and violently from time to time have you seen a pair of miniature portraits pitt asked seventeenthcentury man and a woman or a silver vase a crystal paperweight carved with a design of scrolls and flowers and a first edition of gullivers travels by jonathan swift pinhorn looked surprised that all you come all the way ere ter ask me vat vat lot int worf much i dont want them i just want to know if youve heard of them about three years ago probably pinhorns eyebrows shot up incredulously free years ago yer bleedin eejut dyer fink id member vat sort of aul fer free years you remember everything youve ever bought or sold pinhorn pitt said calmly your trade depends on it youre the best fence this side of the river and you know the worth of everything to the farthing youd not forget an oddity like a swift first edition well i ant ad none who has i dont want it i just want to know pinhorn screwed up his little black eyes and wrinkled his great nose suspiciously he stared at pitt for several seconds you wouldnt lie ter me mr pitt nah would yer itd be very unwise as men i wouldnt be able ter elp yer no more he tilted his head to one side might not even be able ter stop yer gettin urt on yer little hexpiditions inter places where rozzers int natrallike ere waste of time mr pinhorn pitt replied with a smile same as you lying to me have you heard of the swift wots it yer said abaht murder an treason theyre strong words mr pitt hanging words mr pinhorn pitt elaborated distinctly theres murder for certain treason only maybe have you heard anyone speak of the swift anyone at all you hear most things this side of the river no i ant pinhorns face remained in the same tortured expression of concentration if anybodys fenced any fink like vat vey done it outside o the smoke or they done it private to someone as vey already know as wanted it although why anybodyd want it stole i dunno it int worf vat much you said first edition dincher not andwrit ner nuffink no just a firstedition printing cant elp yer pitt believed him he was not ingenuous enough to believe past gratitude for small favors would have any weight but he knew pinhorn wanted him on his side in the future pinhorn was too powerful to be afraid of his rivals and he had no conception of loyalty if he knew anything that it was in his own interest to tell pitt he would undoubtedly have done so if i ear anyfink ill tell yer pinhorn added yowe me mr pitt i do mr pinhorn pitt said dryly but not much and he turned round to make his way back to the great wooden door and the dripping alley outside pitt knew many other dealers in stolen goods there were the dollyshops those poorest of pawnbrokers who lent a few pence to people desperate enough to part with even their pots and pans or the tools of their trade in order to buy food he hated such places and the pity he felt was like being kicked in the stomach because he was helpless he turned to anger as being better than weeping he wanted to shout at the rich at parliament at anyone who was comfortable or who was ignorant of these tens of thousands who clung to life by such a frail and dangerous thread who had not been bred to afford morality except of the crudest sort this time he was free to avoid them along with the thieves kitchens where kidsmen kept schools of children trained to steal and return the profits to them similarly he did not need to scour the slop trade those who dealt in old clothes rags and discarded shoes taking them apart and making up new articles for the poor who could afford no better often even the worst rags were laboriously unraveled and the fiber rewoven into shoddyanything to cover those who might otherwise be naked the articles from the york house had been taken by a thief not only of taste but also of some literacy and would have been fenced similarly they were luxuries that could not be converted into anything useful to the patrons of dollyshops he made his way back through the tangle of passageways uphill away from the river towards mayfair and hanover close thieves usually worked their own areas since he could not trace the goods the best place to start was with those who knew the patch if it was one of them word of the theft would probably have reached the old hands if it had been an outsider that too would be known by someone the police had investigated at the time it had been no secret the underworld would have its own information it took him half an hour after reaching mayfair to track down the man he wanted a skinny loplegged little man of indeterminate age called william winsell and known contrarily as the stoat he found him in the darkest corner of a tavern of particularly ill repute staring sourly at half a pint of ale in a dirty mug pitt slid into the vacant seat beside him the stoat glared at him with outrage wot you doin ere bleedin crusher oo dya finkll trust me if vey see me wiv ve likes o you he looked at pitts fearful clothes dyer fink we dont granny yer just cos yer aht o twig in them togs still look like a crusher wiv yer clean ands wot never worked and crabshellshe did not even bother to glance at pitts feetlike ruddy barges ruin me you will im not staying pitt said quietly im going to the dog and duck a mile away to have lunch i thought you might like to join me in say half an hour im going to have steak and kidney pudding hot mrs billows does that a treat and spotted dick made with suet and lots of raisins and cream and maybe a couple of glasses of cider brought up from the west country the stoat swallowed hard yer a cruel man mr pitt you must want some poor bastard cropped he made a sharp gesture with his hand at the side of his throat like a noose under the ear perhaps in the end pitt agreed right now its only burglary information dog and duck half an hour be there stoat or i shall have to come and see you somewhere less agreeableand less private he stood up and without looking backwards head down he pushed his way through the drinkers and out into the street thirtyfive minutes later he was in the more salubrious parlor of the dog and duck with a mug of cider bright and clear as an indian summer in front of him when the stoat crept in nervously ran his fingers round his grimy collar as if easing it from his neck and wriggled onto the seat opposite him he glanced round once or twice but saw only dull respectable minor traders and clerks no one he knew steak and kidney pudding pitt offered unnecessarily wotcher want orf of me first the stoat said suspiciously but his nostrils were wide sucking in the delicious aroma of fresh sweet food it was almost as if the steam itself fed him oore yer after someone who robbed a house in hanover close three years ago pitt replied nodding over the stoats head to the landlord the stoat swiveled round furiously his face suddenly creasing with outrage oore yer signin at he snarled oozat the landlord pitt raised his eyebrows dont you want to eat the stoat subsided vaguely pink under the gray of his skin a robbery three years ago in hanover close pitt repeated the stoat sneered free years ago bit slow incher runnin beind vese days are we wot was took pitt described the articles in some detail the stoats lip curled yer int after vem fings yere after oo croaked ve geezer wot caught em at it id be interested pitt conceded but primarily im concerned to prove someone innocent vats a turnup the stoat said cynically friend o yours hungry pitt smiled the landlord appeared with two steaming dishes piled high with meat gravy and featherlight suet crust a few green vegetables decorated the side and a maid stood by with an earthenware jug of cider sweet as ripe apples the stoats eyes glazed a little murders not good for business pitt said very quietiy gives robbery a bad name bring on the scran the little man snapped then licked his lips and smiled yer rightits clumsy and it int necessary he watched with rapture as his plate was set in front of him inhaling the delicate steam and sucking his teeth as the cider was poured eyeing it right to the brim of the tankard what do you know about it stoat pitt asked before he took the first mournful the stoats eyes opened very wide they were a clear gray the redeeming feature of a cramped face they must once have been handsome he filled his mouth with food and chewed slowly rolling it round his tongue nuffin he said at last and that int nuffin if yer sees wot i mean usual yer ears a word if not straight orf men in a munf er two or if es in lavender cos it turned a bit nasty men a year mebbe but vis un clean mizzled if he was in lavender in some nethersken youd know pitt pressed in lavender meant in a hiding place from the police but the stoat was indicating that this particular thief had vanished the stoat filled his mouth again and spoke round the food with difficulty course id know he said contemptuously know every slapbang lurk nethersken flash ouse and paddyken fer miles pitt understood him he was referring to cheap eating houses hiding places low lodging houses criminal pubs and taprooms an i tell yer vis the stoat went on sipping his cider appreciatively e werent no professional from wot i ear e got no crow no snakesman and oo but a foold go in the front like e did in a place like anover close yer gotta know the crushersd be rahnd every bleedin twenty minutes a snakesman was a thin or underdeveloped child who could creep through the bars of a window and once inside open the doors for the real thief a crow was a lookout frequently a woman to warn of police or strangers approaching pitt already knew the thief was no professional from pc lowther but it was interesting that the stoat knew this also so he was an amateur he said has he done anything else anything since the stoat shook his head his mouth full he swallowed told yermizzled never done nuffink afore ner since e int on our patch mr pitt i never eard o ven fings fenced ner no one in lavender cos o the feller toppedan vey would be its no stretch in coldbath ner even takin ve boat like it used ter be murders croppin business no cockchafers ner scroby just newgate and a long drop early one mornin wiv a rope collar a long drop and only the devil ter catch yer cockchafer was the graphic term for the treadmill used in prisons a device to keep a man perpetually in motion scroby meant the prison sentence of the lash the stoat sat back and patted his belly vat was a fair tightener mr pitt he said gazing at his empty plate id elp yer if i could ve best i can tell yer is ter look fer some toff wot fought as thievin was simple and tried is and at it an fahnd it werent he pulled over the plate of spotted dick pudding thick with fruit and dipped his spoon in it then looked up with a sudden idea or mebbe the lady o ve ouse ad a lover an e did away wiv er usband an it werent nuffink ter do wiv thievin at all ad yer fought o vat mr pitt it aint one of ve family vat i know yes stoat i had thought of it pitt said pushing the cream across to him the stoat grinned showing sharp gappy teeth and poured the cream generously yint daft fer a crusher is yer he said with grudging respect pitt believed the stoat but even so he felt compelled to pursue any other contacts he had right up until christmas eve he found nothing but a blank ignorance and a total absence of fear which was in itself a kind of evidence he tramped miles through dingy alleys behind the grand facades of the great streets he questioned pimps fences footpads and keepers of bawdy houses but no one told him anything of a thief who had broken into hanover close and tried to sell or dispose of the missing property or who was hiding from a murder charge the whole underworld turned a dirty conniving but quite innocent face to his inquiries it was a fine sharp evening dark by half past four after a pale green sunset gas lamps burned yellow carriages rattled back and forth over a shining film of ice on the cobbles people called out greetings drivers shouted abuse and street sellers cried their wares hot chestnuts matches bootlaces old lavender fresh pies penny whistles toy soldiers here and there little knots of youths sang carols their voices thin and a little sharp in the frosty air pitt felt a slow blessed cleanliness wash over him as the smell of despair receded and the grayness was infused with the beginnings of color the excitement around him drove out memory and buoyed him up even expunging the pity and guilt he usually felt when leaving the rookeries and returning to his comfortable home today he cast off those feelings like a soiled coat and was left with only gratitude he flung open the front door and shouted out hello there was an instants silence then he heard jemima jump from her stool and the clatter of shoes on linoleum as she ran up the hall to meet him papa papa is it christmas eve yet it is isnt it he threw his arms round her and lifted her high into the air yes my sweetheart it is it is christmas eve right now he kissed her and held her on his arm striding into the kitchen all the lights were blazing charlotte and emily sat at the table putting the finishing touches on the icing of a great cake and gracie was stuffing the goose emily had arrived an hour earlier with a footman in tow laden with colored paper boxes and ribbons edward daniel and jemima had clustered round him speechless with excitement edward hopping up and down from one foot to the other his blond hair flopping on his head like a silvergold lid daniel was doing a little dance on the floor round and round in circles until he fell over pitt put jemima down kissed charlotte welcomed emily and acknowledged gracies presence he took his boots off and stretched out in front of the stove warming his feet and legs and watched contentedly as gracie moved the kettle over onto the hot surface and got down the teapot and his large breakfast cup after the meal he could hardly wait for the children to go to bed so he could bring out his carefully hidden gifts and begin to wrap them up he and emily and charlotte sat round the scrubbed kitchen table now piled with scissors bright paper and pieces of ribbon and string every so often someone would disappear into the parlor demanding not to be disturbed and returning with a satisfied smile and gleaming eyes they went to bed a little before midnight and pitt only heard charlotte get up once in the pitch darkness when a small voice on the landing asked plaintively isnt it morning yet he woke properly at seven to find daniel at the door in his nightgown and charlotte fully dressed at the window i think its snowing she said softly its too dark to see but theres a sort of gleam in the air she turned round and saw daniel happy christmas darling she said bending over to kiss him he stood still he was nearly five and not sure about being kissed anymore at least not in front of other people is it christmas he whispered into the soft hair around her cheek yesyes it is get up thomas its christmas she held out her hand to daniel do you want to come and see what is under the tree in the parlor before you get dressed he nodded his wide eyes never leaving her face then come on and she whisked him out leaving the door wide open behind her and calling for edward and jemima to follow pitt scrambled out of bed pulled on his clothes in even worse disarray than usual and after splashing his face from the pitcher on the dresser ran downstairs charlotte emily and the children stood in the parlor staring at the tree and the pile of bright parcels under it no one spoke breakfast first then church then well see whats in there pitt said breaking the spell he did not want emily to turn and see his face and think of george jemima opened her mouth to protest then thought better of it wheres gracie he asked i sent her home last night charlotte replied with two of us we can do everything quite easily wouldnt she rather have been here with us pitt thought of the difference between gracies home and this house with its warmth its happiness and the goose in the oven maybe charlotte agreed leading the way to the kitchen but her mother wouldnt emily gave her a chicken she added under her breath then went on briskly breakfast in thirty minutes everyone go and get dressed come on she clapped her hands and emily took the children back upstairs while she went to prepare porridge bacon eggs toast marmalade honey and tea pitt went back up to shave outside there was a fine dusting of snow and banners of pearlgray cloud across the winter blue of the sky between the rooftops they walked together to the church half a mile away everywhere bells were ringing the cold air was full of the sound the service was short and they sat packed together in the narrow pews while the vicar told the familiar story the organ pealing out all the familiar hymns oh come all ye faithful and god rest ye merry gentlemen and everyone sang till the sound seemed to roll round them like an ocean they walked back in a shower of snow making footprints in its newness taking another look at the pile of parcels under the tree then after a short stage of flurry in the kitchen they all sat down to roast goose with savory stuffing and all the trimmings crisp brown roast potatoes and parsnips and a good french wine and plum pudding fired with brandy to the delight of the children and covered with cream charlotte had made it and cut it with great care so everyone got a silver threepence finally the presents could be kept no longer bursting with excitement they all trooped into the parlor to portion them out and watch as three children tore off paper scattered it in mounds and were lost in a daze of boundless wonder for daniel there were the engine and wagons pitt had made him and a jackinthebox emily had brought for edward a box of bricks of every color shape and size which pitt had carved and painted and a set of tin soldiers from emily and for jemima a doll for whom charlotte had sewn three different outfits of clothing and from emily a kaleidoscope which when she shook it and held it to her eye presented an everchanging magic world of glittering designs from charlottes mother they each had books lewis carrolls alices adventures in wonderland for jemima charles kingsleys the water babies for daniel and robert louis stevensons treasure island for edward charlotte was thrilled with her pink alabaster vase and the garnet brooch emily gave her and emily was equally delighted with the lace collar from pitt and charlotte pitt was totally happy with the shirts charlotte had sewn for him and the gleaming leather wellington boots emily had brought he thanked her for them sincerely not only for the gift but for the tact she had shown in not giving too much she knew quite well that as a constable pitt had earned about the same as a chimney sweep and even now as an inspector his entire months salary was less than her months dress allowance emily in turn was grateful for the emotional warmth and the sense of belonging and she let them see her pleasure as the most delicate way of thanking them when the flurry of gifts and thankyous subsided at last they sat in front of the fire sparing no expense in letting it roar red and yellow up the chimney emily and charlotte talked and pitt dozed with his feet on the fender in the evening when the children had gone up to bed exhausted clutching their presents charlotte pitt and emily took out a giant jigsaw puzzle of the coronation of queen victoria they sat up till midnight when emily finally put in the last piece with a crow of triumph two days later in a crisp north wind that froze the slush on the pavements into slippery crackling ridges and scattered ice from the gutter like broken glass pitt went back to work after leaving various instructions regarding the other burglaries in his charge he left bow street for hanover close he was increasingly curious to meet the yorks and he had an idea a somewhat surprised cabbie set him down in the calm elegant close with its georgian facades and the complicated filigree of bare black trees against a heavy white sky he opened his mouth to ask pitt if he was sure this was where he meant to be then saw the look on his face and changed his mind the cabbie took the money and slapped the reins on the horses faintly steaming rump pitt walked up to the front door prepared for the scorn of the footman who would tell him a policemans placeif he must come at allwas at the tradesmens entrance in back he was used to this sort of treatment but he still felt his shoulders tighten the door opened almost immediately and a footman in his late twenties failed to keep the slight surprise out of his face my name is thomas pitt pitt did not mention rank yet it is possible i may have some information about a matter of interest to mr york i would be obliged if you would ask if i may see him the footman did not dare turn down such a request without reference to his master a fact which pitt had counted on if you will wait in the morning room sir i will inquire the footman stepped back and opened the door invitingly he had a tray in his hand but pitt did not have a card to place on it perhaps that was something he should consider just a plain one with his name and nothing else the morning room was spacious and comfortable a mans room with cool green furnishings and sporting prints on the walls there were leatherbound books in two glassfronted cases and a rather fine sphere on a table by the window with all the nations of the empire marked in red and encircled by vast reaches of canada australasia india most of africa all the way up to egypt and islands in every ocean an engraved brass meridian encircled it the footman hovered may i tell mr york what the matter is in connection with he said earnestly with the death of mr robert york pitt answered stretching the truth only slightly the footman found no reply to that bowed very minutely and left closing the door behind him pitt knew he would not have long to wait and there would be little point in studying the books to learn the personalities of those in the house handsome books were all too often purchased for their appearance rather than their content instead he rehearsed again what he intended to say preparing himself to lie to a man for whom he felt profound pity and might well develop a liking the honorable piers york appeared within five minutes he was tall with the build of a man who had been slender in his prime approaching seventy he held himself erect except for a slight rounding of the shoulders and his lean face was full of a wry private humor which was deeply ingrained beneath the present patina of grief and the years of selfrestraint mr pitt he inquired curiously closing the door and indicating one of the armchairs in a tacit invitation john said you have something to say about my sons death is that correct pitt felt more ashamed than he had expected but it was too late to withdraw now without explaining his lie yes sir he swallowed it is possible that some of the articles stolen may have been discovered if you would give me a closer description of the vase and the paperweight yorks eyes were puzzled the shadow of loss was there also a gleam of something which might have been humor or irony as he took in pitts shining and perfectly fitted boots are you from the police he asked pitt felt the heat in his face yes sir york sat down with an elegant movement despite a faint stiffness in his back what have you found pitt had his story prepared he sat down opposite and avoided yorks eyes as he replied we have found a great deal more stolen property lately and among it are several pieces of silver and crystal i see york smiled bleakly i cant see that it matters much now they were not of great value it was just a small vase cant really remember the thing myself the paperweight had engraving on it i think flowers or something i wouldnt go to too much trouble mr pitt surely you must have more important work there was no alternative but to say it it may be through the articles that we can trace the thief and thus the man who killed your son he explained gravely york smiled polite but weary he had already divorced the matter from his emotions after three years mr pitt surely it will have changed hands many times since then it was an observation not a question i dont think so sir we have many contacts with the dealers in stolen goods i suppose it is necessary york said with a sigh i really dont give a damn about the vase and im sure my wife doesnt either robert was our only son cant we his words died away was it necessary would the whole charade he had planned really lead to any information about robert yorks murderer would it even shed any light on the possible involvement of his widow was it not merely a further exercise in pain inflicted upon a family that was already deeply hurt but there was something different about this crime it was not a common housebreaking he believed pinhorn the stoat and all the others who said it had not sprung from the underworld perhaps an acquaintance of the york household had turned to sudden crime and when robert had recognized him the burglar had killed robert in his panic rather than be betrayed or else it was a murder first and a burglary second robert york had surprised his wife with a lover and the perpetrator had taken the articles to mask the real crime or worse still perhaps it had been premeditated there was of course the possibility feared by the foreign office that the real theft involved papers robert york had taken home and not only was this murder but also treason yes im afraid it is necessary pitt said firmly im sorry sir but i am sure even in her grief mrs york would not wish a murderer to go free when there is a possibility we may catch him york stared at him levelly for several seconds then stood up slowly i suppose you know what youre doing mr pitt there was no slight in his voice he spoke as one gentleman to another he pulled the bell rope near the door and when the footman answered he sent him for mrs york she was several minutes in coming but neither of them spoke again until she appeared pitt stood up immediately and regarded her with interest this was the woman whose composure had so impressed lowther on the night of her sons death and mowbray the day after she was of barely average height her slender build a little thickened at the waist with wellcovered shoulders and a white neck draped in lace not an old ladys lace but expensive heavy french lace such as greataunt vespasia might have chosen even from a distance of several feet pitt could smell the faintest aroma of an elusive sweet perfume like gardenia she had smooth rounded features an almost greek nose and lips that were still well defined her skin was flawless and her hair though faded in color still richtextured and full with natural wave she had been a beauty in her own fashion she regarded pitt with cold surprise mr pitt is from the police york said in explanation he may have found some of our belongings that were stolen can you describe the silver vase im afraid i wouldnt know it if i saw it her eyes widened after three years you may be able to return me one silver vase i am unimpressed mr pitt the criticism was just and he knew it pitts voice sounded sharper than he intended justice is frequently slow maam and sometimes the innocent suffer as well im sorry she forced herself to smile and he respected her for that it was about nine inches high on a round base but squared up the body with a fluted lip it was solid silver and took about five or six stems i usually put roses in it that was very precise there was nothing vague or distorted about her description he looked at her closely she was intelligent in complete command of herself but there was no lack of emotion in her face in fact pitt could easily imagine great passion there he glanced down at the small strong hands at her sides and saw that they were stiff but not clenched thank you maam and the crystal paperweight spherical with two tudor roses engraved on it and something else a ribbon or scroll it was about three or four inches high and heavy of course her brow puckered have you found the thief there was a slight tremor in her voice now and a tiny muscle flickered under the pale skin of her temple no maamat least that was the absolute truthonly property through a dealer in stolen goods but he may lead us to the thief york was standing several feet away from her for a moment pitt thought he was going to reach out to her in a gesture of comfort or merely of companionship but he changed his mind or else pitt had misunderstood the slight movement what lay behind his wry patrician face her regular carefully preserved beauty did they suspect that their daughterinlaw had had a lover or that their son had been murdered for his countrys secrets or that some associate even a family friend had fallen deeply into debt and had turned in desperation to robbery rather than face the disgrace and perhaps even imprisonment brought by financial ruin he would learn nothing from staring at them all their nurturing in the cool obedient childhood of the aristocracy had bred into them selfmastery the knowledge of duty to dignity and to class whatever fear or grief lay inside no policeman no gamekeepers son was going to see it naked in a wavering voice or a shaking hand pitt almost wished charlotte could see them she might be able to read far more into their manner he could not prolong it anymore and he could think of no appropriate excuse to meet the widow he thanked them and allowed the footman to show him to the door and the gray icewhipped street it took him three days to find a vase that fit mrs yorks description and even then it was an inch and a half short and had five sides rather than four but it was near enough the paperweight was impossible the stolen goods hauls presented nothing remotely like it and he would betray his deceit if he brought one that differed vastly from the description he had been given it was new years eve and snowing hard he rode through muffled streets the wheels of the hansom almost silent in the pall and stepped out at number hanover close a little after three he had asked the constable on the beat and knew that this was the best opportunity to catch the younger mrs york at home while the elder mrs york was out visiting this time the door was answered by a pretty young snip of a parlormaid with a crisp lace apron and a cap on her dark head she eyed pitt up and down suspiciously from the tousled hair poking out under his tall hat and his wellcut but illused coat its pockets stuffed with all manner of objects he had thought he might find useful to emilys beautiful boots yes sir he smiled at her i have called to see mrs york she is expecting me within these few days she considered his smile more than the information which she found hard to believe mrs york has company at the present sir but if you come into the morning room ill inform her you are here thank you he stepped in and handed her one of the cards he had acquired since his last visit perhaps it was a trifle presumptuous for a policeman to have a card but he liked it and it might justify its expense one day he had not told charlotte about it in case she secretly thought him foolish the morning room was unchanged a bankedup slow fire glowing in the grate this time pitt deliberately opened the door to the hall after the maid had gone and stood a little out of the way of it so that he could overhear any conversation unseen the visitors were probably irrelevant but he was curious there had been no carriages outside so they must intend staying long enough to be worth sending them round to the mews at the back that meant more than the half hour or so of a normal afternoon call the misunderstanding he hoped for materialized it was the younger mrs york the parlormaid informed and after nearly ten minutes it was she who came accompanied by a fairhaired man of about forty with a face not handsome but of intelligent and compelling cast they were both civil but extremely guarded veronica york was indeed a beautiful woman very slender with delicate shoulders and bosom and she moved with an unusual grace her face was more sensitive than her motherinlaws more finely boned it appealed to pitt instinctively there was a haunting quality in it and he had the impression that beneath the calm lay an intense passion poised to break through mr pitt she said with obvious doubt i hope you do not mind mr danver has accompanied me i regret i do not recollect our acquaintance danver put one arm half round her as if he would protect her from any attack of discourtesy but there was no hostility in his face only caution and an awareness of her vulnerability im sorry pitt apologized immediately it was mrs piers york who was expecting me i should have made myself plainer but i expect if you would not mind you could assist equally well he took the silver vase out of his coat pocket and held it up it is possible that this is the vase stolen from you some three years ago if it is would you be kind enough to assure yourself and then confirm it to me the blood fled from her face and her eyes widened as if he had held up something appalling and incomprehensible danver tightened his arm round her as though he feared she might faint then he turned on pitt furiously for heavens sake man have you no pity at all you walk in here without the least warning and hold up a vase that was stolen the very night mrs yorks husband was violently murdered he looked at veronica york and his voice rose as he saw her anguish deepen i shall complain to your superiors about your gross insensitivity you might at least have asked for mr york pitt did feel compassion for her but he had felt it for the guilty as well as the innocent many times before for julian danver it was different either he was a superb actor or it had not occurred to him that the truth was anything other than what had already been presumed im sorry pitt apologized honestly mr york told me on a previous visit that he would not know the vase again it was mrs piers york who described it to me i can ask a servant if you prefer with your permission veronica was struggling to master herself you are being unfair julian she said with some difficulty she swallowed dryly and caught her breath she was still bloodlessly pale mr pitt is only doing his duty it would not be any less distressing to motherinlaw she raised her eyes to meet pitts and he was struck again by the power of emotion in her she was no mere society beauty but a woman who would be unique and compelling anywhere i am afraid i am not sure whether it is our vase or not she said struggling to keep her voice in control i never took much notice of it it was in the library which is a room i did not frequent a great deal perhaps if you would ask one of the servants rather than distress my motherinlaw with seeing it of course pitt had hoped to find an excuse to speak to the servants and this was ideal if you will instruct your butler or housekeeper that you have given your permission i shall go through to the servants quarters and perhaps find the housemaid who dusted the library at that time yes she agreed unable to hide her relief yes that would be an excellent idea ill attend to it danver offered would you prefer to go to your room for a while my dear ill make your apologies to harriet and papa she swung round quickly please dont tell them of course not he assured her ill merely say you felt a little faint and went to lie down for half an hour and will rejoin them later would you like me to call for your maid or your motherinlaw no this time there was a fierceness in her voice and her hand on his arm was clawlike in its grip noplease dont i shall be perfectly all right dont disturb anyone else i shall go up for a little eau de cologne and then return to the withdrawing room if you will be kind enough to call redditch and explain to him about mr pitt and the vase he acquiesced with some reluctance uncertainty still plain in his face good afternoon mr pitt she said courteously turning away danver opened the door for her and she disappeared into the hall danver rang for the butler a mild slightly anxiouslooking man of middle age who still retained some of the bewildered innocence of extreme youth it was an odd combination in the dignity and responsibility of his position pitts errand was explained to him danver excused himself and pitt was conducted across the hall through the green baize door and into the housekeepers sitting room which was unoccupied at present im not sure who was downstairs maid at the time sir the butler said dubiously most of the staff have changed since mr robert was killed im new myself so is the housekeeper but the scullery maid was here then she might remember if you would pitt agreed he was left for some twenty minutes to sit and wait turning over his thoughts on veronica york until at last a pleasantlooking girl in her early twenties came in she was wearing a blue stuff gown and a small white apron and cap obviously she was not the scullery maid her looks were trim and soft and her hands were not reddened by constant water it had been a long time since she had scrubbed a floor the butler came with her presumably to make sure she was discreet in her answers im dulcie sir she said with a tiny bob policemen did not rank a full curtsy they were something like servants themselves i was the tweeny ere when mr robert was killed theres only me and mary the scullery maid left mr redditch said as i could elp you sir it was a pity the butler remained but pitt should have expected that any senior servant in his position would have yes if you please pitt took out the silver vase again and held it up for her look at this carefully dulcie and tell me if it is the vase that used to be in the library up to the time of mr robert yorks death oh she looked startled apparently redditch had been very fair and told her only that she was wanted because she had been a housemaid three years ago her eyes widened and fixed on the vase in pitts hand she did not touch it well dulcie redditch prompted is that the vase girl you must have dusted it often enough its very like it sir but i dont think thats it like i remember it it had four sides to it but i could be wrong it was the best answer she could have given it allowed him to pursue the subject never mind he said easily smiling at her just think back to what you used to do three years ago do you remember that week oh yes she said her voice hushed tell me something about it were there many visitors to the house oh yes memory brought a momentary smile to her face there was lots of people then the light vanished of course after mr roberts death all that stopped only people coming to give their condolences ladies calling in the afternoons pitt suggested yes most days either on mrs piers or mrs robert there was usually one of them in and one out paying visits erself dinner parties not very often more often they dined out or went to the theater but some came here of course mr danver mr julian danver and is father mr garrard and miss arriet she replied quickly and mr and mrs asherson she mentioned half a dozen more names which pitt wrote down under the disapproving eye of the butler now see if you can recall a particular day he went on and go through your duties one by one yes sir she looked at her folded hands and recited slowly i got up at alf past five and came downstairs to clean out all the grates taking out the cinders to the back maryd give me a cup o tea then id make sure all the arths was clean and things blacked as should be and the brasses firedogs and the like polished and id lay the fires and light them so when the family came down in the roomsd be warm id make sure the footman brought in the coals and the scuttles was fullsometimes you ave to be beind them all the time then after breakfast id start dusting and cleaning did you clean the library he had to press for an identification to justify his position yes sirsir i remember now thats very like the vase we ad but it int it youre sure the butler put in sharply yes mr redditch that int our vase id swear to it thank you pitt could think of nothing else to ask at least he had some names and could begin looking for a possible amateur thief he stood up and thanked them redditch relented would you like a cup of tea in the kitchen mr pitt pitt accepted immediately he was thirsty and he would very much like a hot cup of tea he would also like an opportunity to observe as many of the servants as he could half an hour later after three cups of tea and two slices of madeira cake he went back to the main hallway and opened the library door it was a gracious room lined with bookshelves on two sides the third taken up with windows from floor to ceiling curtained in rust red velvet on the fourth side was a huge marble fireplace flanked by semicircular tables inlaid with exotic wood there was a massive desk in oak and green leather its back to the windows and three large leathercovered armchairs pitt stood in the middle of the floor imagining the scene on the night robert york was killed he heard a slight sound behind him and turned to find the maid dulcie in the doorway as soon as he saw her she came in her brow was puckered and her eyes bright there was something else he asked quickly sure he was right yes sir you asked about guests people callin ere yes well that week was the last time i saw er or anything belonging to er she stopped biting her lip suddenly uncertain whether she should be so indiscreet saw who dulcie he must be gentle not attach too much importance to it and frighten her saw who i dont know er name the woman what wore the cerisecolored gowns always something o that shade she werent a guestat least she never came in the front door with other people and i never saw er face except that one time in the light from the gas lamp on the landing there she was one moment and gone a second later but she wore cerise always either a gown or gloves or a flower or something i know miss veronicas things and she adnt nothing that color but i found a glove one day in the library alf under one of them cushions she pointed to the furthest chair and once there was a piece o ribbon are you sure they werent the elder mrs yorks oh yes sir i knew the ladys maids then and we talked about the mistresses clothes its a hard color that i know as neither of them wore it it was the woman in cerise sir but oo she was i swear i dont know cept she came and went like a shadow like no one should see er and i avent seen er since that week sir im sorry as it werent the right vase sir i wish as you could catch ooever done it it int the silver mr piers says as you can always get money from the insurance like e did when mrs loretta lost er pearls with the sapphire clip she bit her lip and suddenly stopped thank you dulcie pitt looked at her worried face you did the right thing to tell me i shant repeat it to mr redditch unless i have to now show me to the door and no one will notice your being here yes sir thank you sir i she hesitated a moment as if she would say more then changed her mind and bobbed a brief curtsy before leading him out across the large hall and opening the front door a moment later he was outside in the silent close ice crackling under his boots who was this woman in cerise who apparently had never called again after robert yorks murder and why had no one else spoken of her perhaps she did not matter she might be a friend of veronicas a relative with eccentric or unacceptable behavior or she might be just what the foreign office was concealing and hoping he could not tracea spy he would have to speak to dulcie again when he knew a little more emily returned home the day after boxing day the ashworth town house was large and extremely gracious george had had much of it redecorated to please emilys taste the first year after they were married and he had been characteristically generous nothing that added charm or personality had been denied and yet the overall effect was not ostentatious in the least there were no ornate french pieces no gilt or curlicues the furniture was regency and georgian in keeping with the architecture of the house itself emily had argued with george at the time about his parents love of tassels and fringes and had banished most of the indifferent family portraits to unused guest rooms the result had both surprised and pleased george who had compared it with satisfaction to the crowded houses of their friends now as emily stood in the hallway while the servants obeyed her instructions carrying in cases preparing luncheon for edward and herself she felt a void of loneliness close round her as if the house were alien she drew in her breath wanting to tell them to stop that she would be returning to charlottes much smaller house it was positively cramped by comparison with secondhand furnishings and located in a narrow unfashionable street but emily had been happy there for a few days she had entirely forgotten about her new state of widowhood physical differences had been irrelevant they had all been together and if she woke once or twice in the night in her bed alone and thought of charlotte lying in a warm bed with thomas just beyond the wall those were short moments quickly banished by returning sleep now the contrast was like a newly whetted blade making the spacious air of this house of which she was sole mistress feel chilly as if cold water were touching her skin it was ridiculous the servants had fires burning in every grate and there were the sounds of quick busy feet in the passage the clink of silver in the dining room and the chatter of maids on the landing and the green baize door swung with a faint bump as a footman came through she walked quickly up the stairs undoing her coat as she went her ladys maid appeared and took it from her along with her hat she would unpack the cases sort out what needed laundering and hang up the gowns the nurserymaid would do the same for edward downstairs again the cook knocked on the boudoir door and inquired for instructions about dinner and whatever emily might care for on the menu over the next few days there was nothing emily had to do herself but make decisions about things that hardly mattered that was the trouble day after day stretched before her empty of any necessary or interesting occupation all the bleak january days she might fill with needlework writing letters playing the piano to an empty room or messing around with brushes and paints and failing to create what she envisioned whatever she did she did not want to do it alone but most of the people she knew were merely acquaintances to consider them friends would be to devalue the word their company would disturb the silence without giving her a sense of companionship and she was not yet so desperate that she craved any presence at all regardless of its quality in the sensible part of her mind was the realization that company of any value meant relationships and emily was not sure what relationship she was prepared for outside of her family although her mother was also fairly recently widowed emily felt she had little in common with her caroline ellison had been married a long time and had been comfortable enough by everyday standards but she had discovered an aloneness in widowhood that was not at all unmixed with exhilaration for the first time in her life she answered to no one neither her autocratic father her ambitious mother nor her agreeable but essentially opinionated husband even her motherinlaw was not the dictatorial old matriarch she had been while her son was alive at last caroline was free to express her own ideas on more than one occasion she had startled the old lady into a paroxysm of rage by telling her to mind her own business something she would never have dared do when emilys father was alive it would simply not have been worth the ensuing unpleasantness nor the impossibility of explanation but then emilys father had died peacefully after a short illness and he had been sixtyfive george had been murdered while scarcely in his prime and emily had never really lacked the freedom to do things as she wished anyway the restrictions placed upon her were those of society and she was more tightly bound by them now george was dead than she had been while he was alive her hollow feeling of loneliness frightened her it would probably only get worse and she might be driven to fill her life with pointless activities and silly conversation with people who cared nothing for her the alternative seemed remarkably attractive to pursue her friendship with jack radley at the moment she did not feel it would be too hard to force out of her mind the sort of questions her more rational self would ask was there more to him than charm humor the ability to make even quite ordinary pastimes seem fun and to understand her so well that explanations were seldom necessary and justification never liking was fine for friends but emily knew that in a man one was to marry there must also be trust the knowledge that the important values were shared that if she were ill or in distress if she were maligned by others he would support her and if he were unfaithfulthe thought hurt with almost physical sharpness as the wounds george had dealt were not completely healedif he were unfaithful it would be meaningless and he would be discreet enough that she would never know about it and above all neither would her friends and there must be respect what could she possibly share with someone who did not possess the courage to fight for what he believed or the largeness of heart to be moved to pity she would quickly grow to despise a man whose imagination never went beyond his own concerns she caught herself with a start of horror and embarrassment what on earth was she thinking marriage she must be mad jack needed to marry into money she knew that from his presence at cardington crescent that was why uncle eustace had originally invited him as a suitable husband for tassie he was to provide the family connections and she the money but of course emily herself was many times wealthier than tassie march now she had inherited georges estate and that ugly thought must be forgotten she was a wealthy widow the fortune hunters would begin to come circling like vultures round the dying waiting their turn not too soon or they would appear unseemly and spoil their chances not too late or they would be beaten to the prize the thought was so repellent it was sickening her first time in the marriage market emily had enjoyed the game she had everything to win and she had won she had deserved to she had played the game superbly she had all the innocence and arrogance of inexperience now she felt so much less sure of herself she had tasted failure very recently and she had everything to lose was veronica york in the same position had she turned over these same thoughts in her mind her husband had been murdered and presumably she was heir through him to whatever fortune the yorks possessed did she now regard admirers with suspicion in her imagination devising tests for them to see if their love was truly for her or merely for her means what monumental arrogance jack radley had never mentioned marriage nor given emily the slightest indication that it was what he intended or wished she must control her thoughts or she would end up saying something idiotic in front of him and betraying herself completely which would make this entire situation impossible if only there were an urgent crime that she and charlotte could come to grips with something real and undeniably important that would drive all this ridiculous speculation and dreaming out of her mind how could any woman of the least intelligence occupy all her thoughts with giving orders to servants who knew perfectly well what to do anyway the parlormaid could have easily organized the running of a household for one woman and a small boy so it was with very mixed and somewhat turbulent emotions that emily greeted the butler the following morning when he came into the withdrawing room to announce that mr jack radley presented his compliments he was in the morning room and wished to know if lady ashworth would receive him she swallowed and sat still for a moment composing her features it would not do for the butler to see her confusion what an odd time to call she said casually there is a matter he was looking into for me perhaps he has some news yes wainwright ask him to come in yes mlady if wainwright noticed anything at all it was absent from his smooth face he turned slowly and went out of the room as though he were part of a procession he had been with the ashworths since he was a boy and his father before him as head gardener emily still felt uncomfortable around wainwright jack came in a moment later unhurriedly as decorum required but there was a lightness to his step and his face was eager as always he was fashionably dressed but he wore his clothes with such ease his elegance seemed a happy accident rather than something contrived it was a look men paid fortunes to achieve he hesitated on the edge of telling her she looked well discarding that lie in favor of a fleeting smile and the truth you look as bored as i am emily i hate january and its almost here we must do something terribly interesting to make it pass quickly while we are too occupied to notice in spite of herself she was moved to smile indeed and what do you suggest pray do sit down he obeyed with elegance and looked at her candidly we must pursue our detecting he replied surely charlotte will go back to the yorks wont she i got the distinct impression she was as keen as we were in fact was it not her idea it was the ideal excuse and emily seized it without thinking yes it was im sure she would welcome a chance to call again she did not need to add that it would require jacks assistance they both knew that no single woman in the position charlotte had pretended to would press such an acquaintance herself and anyway charlotte had not the financial means even to come in a carriage let alone suitably dressed emily could provide those things but not an escort charlotte must be prompted in case she had forgotten about the yorks in the excitement of christmas i will send her a note she added aloud and it is always possible pitt will learn something further so we should keep abreast of that too jack looked thoughtful gazing at the floor i have tried extremely discreetly to sound out one or two acquaintances about the danvers but i discovered very little the father garrard danver is fairly senior in the foreign office which may be how they came to know the yorks so closely although society is surprisingly small everyone knows everyone else at least by sight or repute if not to speak tobut of course that is a different thing from calling upon them there were two sons one was killed in the indian army some time ago the other is julian danver who may or may not marry veronica york depending upon pitts inquiries emily gave a little snort of irritation she was developing an empathy with veronica york which made the concern about her reputation all the more infuriating i wonder if anyone has bothered to consider whether he is good enough for her she said tartly instantly emily regretted the words she would have bitten her tongue rather than say something so betraying of her own loathsome suspicions please god he would not make the connection she opened her mouth to rush into speech and smother it then was afraid he would realize that was what she was doing instead she brazened it out jack looked a little startled you mean his reputation now she had no answer to expect a mans reputation to have the same purity as a womans was absurd she would mark herself as eccentric to the point of idiocy if she suggested such a thing but the alternative was the truth and that was worse but how could she back out of this discussion without being caught in a lie she could feel the hot blood in her cheeks she must say something the silence positively prickled well they might be concerned that he was a man of honor as much as he seems she said scrambling for something that sounded better more specific some men have most disreputable habits perhaps you dont know but having assisted in the investigation of one or two crimes i have learned of some terrible things which were quite unknown to their families she forced herself to look at jack she was talking too much would it have anything to do with robert yorks murder he asked his eyes revealed nothing no she said slowly unless of course he killed him julian danver why not because he was already veronicas lover he took her point yes thats possible he said it with assurance apparently the idea did not seem farfetched to him divorce would not have been open to veronica even with grounds such as proven adultery let alone with no grounds at all emily knew that only men could divorce for unfaithfulness and even then the woman was ruined women were expected either to prevent such a misfortune or else to put up with it with grace and if veronica herself were cast aside as an adulteress then julian danver would lose all prospect of a career if he were to marry her in fact they would not even be received in society to all intents and purposes they would cease to exist do you suppose he was so infatuated with her that he lost his head his morality enough to do that she asked not because she thought jack could possibly know but because she wanted to test his opinion of veronica did he see her as a woman who could inspire such a reckless passion the answer was the one she had feared i dont know danver he answered seriously but if he was capable of it then veronica would be just the woman to waken such a feeling oh emilys voice was tight a little high then we had better pursue the matter forthwith for justices sake if nothing else she sounded businesslike very crisp i shall write to charlotte to follow up on the invitation to visit the winter exhibition and you must do what you can to obtain an invitation for her to meet the rest of the people who might be involved her frustration boiled up suddenly and erupted despite her intentions i wish i were not shut up here like a hermit its damnable i could do so much if only i were free to socializeoh hellfire he looked startled for a moment but there was laughter in his eyes i dont think youre ready for the honorable mrs piers yorks withdrawing room yet emily he said wryly on the contrary she snapped her face hot im overready but there was nothing she could do and her choice lay between accepting it with a good grace or an ill one after another few minutes of general chatter jack took his leave with a commission to contrive the necessary invitation emily was left alone again to go over and over in her mind all that she had said changing a word or two an inflection here and there to make it more gracious less revealing she wished she could go back and conduct the whole meeting again and this time be more casual perhaps occasionally say something witty men liked women who amused them as long as they were not too clever or too spiteful could she possibly be in love with jack that would be indecent so soon after georges death or was it just that she liked him and she was bored and so crushingly lonely it was six days later past new years and into january with all its bleak and desperate cold snow lining the streets and freezing fog creeping up like a white presage of death clogging the throat devouring light distorting sound and isolating each person who ventured out into it when emilys carriage called for charlotte in the late afternoon it took her to emilys house where she changed into a royal blue silk dinner gown while emily and her maid fussed over her then wrapped in wool and fur she rode in jacks carriage to the house of garrard danver and his family in mayfair at the farther end of hanover close the carriage moved slowly through the swirling fog and charlotte could barely see the faint luminescence of gas lamps above one moment clear yellow and the next swathed and blinded with dirty white rags of vapor she was glad when they pulled up and it was time to begin being elisabeth barnaby again it was easier to take the plunge into activity than to sit hunched up in the dark turning it over in her mind and worrying about all the things that might go wrong if they were to catch her out how could she possibly explain herself it would be ghastly she would be stuck there wriggling like a moth on a pin while everyone stared at her and thought how absurd and tasteless she was she would have to say she had lost her witsit was the only possible excuse and even if she were entirely successful in duping them would she discover anything at all that could shed any light on robert yorks death perhaps this whole attempt was nothing to do with robert or veronica york but was merely a silly farce to take emilys mind off her boredom and an opportunity for charlotte to make some judgment on jack radley and only a temporarily successful attempt at that the carriage door was open and the footman was waiting to hand her down she stepped out glad of his grip for a moment or two as the cold acrid air hit her like wet muslin then she went quickly up the steps and into the wide warm hallway there was no time to look at the furnishings or the pictures beside the flight of stairs that swept upwards to the landing the butler took her coat and muff and a maid held open the door into the withdrawing room charlotte took jacks arm and tried to sweep in with confidence holding her chin high her silk skirt swishingor to be accurate emilys silk skirt jack nudged her sharply and she realized she was overdoing it she was supposed to be modest and obliged for their help she lowered her gaze with a sense of irritation she was tired of being obliged they were the last to arrive which was very suitable since they were the only ones not known closely to the others already the six people in the room turned to look at them with varying degrees of interest the first to speak was a young woman in her late twenties with a most individual face which only just missed being pretty her nose was tiptilted too far from the classic and there was a frankness in her dark eyes that seemed out of place in an unmarried woman her figure was not nearly rounded enough for fashion but her dark hair was shining and thick enough to have pleased anyone she came forward to greet charlotte with a goodmannered smile how do you do miss barnaby i am harriet danver i am so pleased you were able to come are you finding london agreeable apart from this wretched weather how do you do miss danver charlotte replied courteously oh yes thank you for asking even in this fog it is such a nice change from the country and people are so kind a tall lean man with an aquiline highly asceticlooking face came forward from where he had been half sitting on the back of a huge armchair charlotte judged him to be in his midforties until he passed directly under the chandelier and she saw that the graying at the temples touched the rest of his head as well the lines on his face were finer and more numerous than the shadows had betrayed i am garrard danver his voice had a fine timbre to it i am delighted to meet you miss barnaby he did not take her hand but instead smiled at jack bidding him welcome also and introduced them to the remaining people in the room of these the most interesting by far was julian danver indeed he was the principle reason charlotte had been so keen to come he was about the same height as his father with a more athletic build but it was his face that held her attention he must have gotten his features from his mother because charlotte could see no family resemblance to garrard at all whereas in harriet it was quite recognizable especially about the eyes julian was fair his eyes were gray or blueshe could not tell in the light of the chandelierand his hair was brown with a fair streak across the front his features were strong and there was intelligence and restraint in his bearing she could well imagine that veronica york found him most attractive the last member of the danver family was garrards maiden sister miss adeline danver she was rakishly thin her deep green dress failing to mask the sharp bones of her shoulders her features exaggerated the flaws in harriets faceher chin was smaller her nose more prominentbut she had the same dark eyes and fine head of hair more faded but still thick aunt adeline is hard of hearing harriet whispered softly to charlotte if she says something odd please smile and disregard it she frequently gets quite the wrong sense of what is said of course charlotte murmured politely the only other guests were felix asherson and his wife a striking man with black hair and unexpectedly vivid gray eyes he worked in the foreign office with julian danver but it was his mouth charlotte noticed she could not make up her mind about it was it sensuous and strong or was that wide lip a sign of selfindulgence his wife sonia was a handsome woman with bland regular features empty of expression the sort of face fashion advertisers like because it sets off a hat without drawing the eye from it in the least her figure was wellproportioned and on this occasion she wore a gown in a most becoming shade of coral pink revealing plump milkwhite shoulders after the formal greetings had been exchanged the usual small talk began since all the others were known to each other it centered upon charlotte and jack radley and charlotte concentrated on giving answers that made sense factually and were also in keeping with the character she had created for herself she was supposed to be a young woman of modest means and good breeding and naturally in search of a husband maintaining this role required all her attention and it was not until they were at dinner round a table gleaming with silver and crystal partaking of a rather too salty soup that she was able to take time to observe the rest of the company the conversation was still very general comments upon the unpleasantness of the weather then minor points of newsnothing political or even remotely contentiousand then remarks about a play that most of them had seen charlotte replied only when good manners demanded which gave her time to think she might not get this opportunity again so she must take full advantage of it the things she hoped to discover were few but they would add to the little she had learned from pitt how long had julian danver and veronica been acquainted did their love predate robert yorks death and thus cause it was julian danver an ambitious man either in his profession or socially was there a noticeable difference in their financial status so that money might have been a motive either for veronica or for him charlotte had grown up in a home where quality was intensely admired even on those occasions when it could not be afforded it was one of a wellbred young ladys attributes that she should be able to distinguish the excellent from the merely good and naturally also its cost she had been in the hall and withdrawing room of the york house and she judged that they had had money long enough to be comfortable with it there was none of the tendency to show off which so often accompanied recent acquisition they felt no necessity to parade new furnishings or decorations or put objets dart in prominent positions of course she was quite aware that peoples circumstances can change she had seen many houses with fine rooms where guests were received while the rest of the building lacked even a carpet and grates did not know a fire from one christmas to another and some prefer to keep a full complement of servants while they themselves eat barely enough to keep alive rather than be seen to have a poor establishment but charlotte had noticed the womens clothes they were of the latest cut and there were no worn places on cuffs or elbows nothing had been altered to fit another season or turned to hide patches and she had done enough of that kind of thing herself to know precisely where to look for the telltale needle holes the slightly different shading of fabric now as she pretended to listen to the conversation across the table she glanced as discreetly as she could at the dining room and its furnishings the whole effect was silver and blue pale on the immaculate wallpaper dark royal blue in the curtains which seemed to be without the usual faded marks that the sun so quickly made in blues which meant they were not above a season old perhaps that indicated a tendency to extravagance there was a painting of a venetian scene on the wall opposite her but charlotte could not tell whether it was excellent or merely agreeable the table itself was mahogany or at least the legs were the top was completely covered by crisp damask of heavy quality the chairs and two sideboards were of the adam style and might well be genuine after checking that no one was watching her she took a quick glance to see the hallmark on the reverse of her silver spoon perhaps the salty soup was a mere mischance even the best people could have an accident with a cook perhaps they even liked it like this she considered the womens clothes again with an eye to cost as well as to the indications to character they might show presumably both harriet and aunt adeline as unmarried women were dependent upon garrard for their support adelines gown did not have the panache of high fashion but then nothing she wore ever would she was not that kind of person and charlotte guessed she never had been nonetheless the dress was well cut and of excellent fabric much the same could be said of harriets gown no unless there was some hidden factor some inheritance or the like it did not seem as if money entered into the match dont you miss barnaby she realized with a start that felix asherson was talking to herbut what on earth had he said i find mr wagners operas a little longwinded and i am tired some time before the end he repeated looking at her with a slight smile i prefer something rather closer to life dont you i dont care for all this magic im not surprised aunt adeline put in suddenly before charlotte had time to find an answer theres enough of it we cant avoid as it is everyone stared at her and charlotte was totally confused the remark seemed to make no sense he said magic aunt addie harriet said quietly not tragic she did not seem in the least put out oh really i dont care for the magic element very much do you miss barnaby charlotte swallowed i dont think so miss danver i am not sure that i ever met with it jack coughed discreetly into his napkin and charlotte knew he was laughing julian smiled and offered her more wine a footman and two maids served the fish course unrequited love seems to be the theme of a great many operas and plays charlotte said to break the silence in fact it is almost a necessity i suppose it is something most of us can imagine even if we have been fortunate enough not to feel it julian answered do you think such tales are true to life charlotte asked gently watching his face for sympathy or contempt he gave her the courtesy of a thoughtful answer not in detail drama has to be condensed or as felix says it becomes too boring our attention is short but the emotions are real at least for some of us suddenly he stopped and looked down at the table then quickly up again at her in that moment she found herself liking him he had said something he had not meant to but she was certain his embarrassment was not for himselfthere was no anger or resentment in it at allbut for someone else at the table my dear julian garrard said irritably you are far too literal i dont suppose miss barnaby intended anything so grave no of course not julian agreed quickly i apologize charlotte was intensely aware that they were talking about something real and known to both of them it had to be either adeline or harriet harriet was past the age when one might have expected a personable and wellbred woman of sound financial prospects to marry why had they not arranged a suitable match for her charlotte smiled charmingly her warmth was quite truly felt indeed i was only thinking as you were that too much magic or coincidence spoils ones belief in the story and therefore ones emotional rapport with the characters it was quite a trivial remark she plunged on mrs york has been kind enough to invite me to go and view the winter exhibition at the royal academy with her have any of you been yet i went sonia asherson said mildly but i cant say that i recall anything in particular any portraits aunt adeline inquired i love faces so do i charlotte agreed as long as they are not idealized so that all the flaws are removed i often think the true character lies in those lines and proportions that depart from the classicwhere the individuality is revealed and the marks of experience how perceptive of you aunt adeline said with sudden pleasure and for the first time she looked with interest directly at charlotte charlotte realized at once what a vivid creature lived inside the thin rather quaint exterior how shallow to judge from smooth conventional looks like sonia ashersons instinctively her eyes went to felix how trivial of him to have preferred a bland creature like sonia rather than someone unconventional but full of feeling like harriet but perhaps he didnt she had no right to assume he was happy anything might lie behind felixs polished manners and elusive face this was another line of thought altogether charlotte reminded herself and nothing to do with veronica york or roberts death it was so kind of mrs york to invite me to accompany her charlotte repeated a little abruptly she must keep the conversation to the point do you know does she paint i like portraits but i love those delicate watercolor pictures some travelers make so clearly and with such sensitivity that you can imagine yourself there i recall some wonderful pictures of africa i could almost feel the heat on the stones so well was it drawn they were all looking at her now right round the table their faces were turned towards her sonia asherson was clearly surprised at her sudden garrulity while felix seemed amused harriet was looking but not listening her thoughts elsewhere garrard gazed at charlotte politely only aunt adeline had a brightness in her eyes that followed her sentiment jack was uncharacteristically silent apparently he was going to leave the field to her it was julian who answered i dont think she does paint weve never spoken of it have you known her long charlotte asked trying to be artless and wondered immediately if she had been too blunt i imagine in the diplomatic service you must have traveled not to africa he said with a smile but it is something i should like to do far too hot felix said with a grimace i can understand youd rather not aunt adeline said with a sharp glance at him but it might be an excellent thing all the same harriet caught her breath her fingers round the stem of her wineglass were so tight the knuckles paled in that instant a dozen memories flooded back to charlotte of how she had felt before she had met thomas when she was still in love with dominic her eldest sisters husband she remembered the agonizing fear the hopelessness of being left out the wild moments of imagined intimacy a glance an accidental touch the singing heart when he seemed to take extra care speaking to her the tenderness she thought she saw and underneath it all the cold sane despair but she would not have dreamed of marrying anyone else no matter what efforts her mother made was this not what she was seeing now in harriets lowered eyes pale lips and hot cheeks he did not say he would rather not aunt addie julian corrected he said it was far too hot i presume he meant for veronica to accompany me aunt adeline dismissed the idea with scorn nonsense some englishwoman i forget her name went up the congo all by herself id love to do that what an excellent idea garrard said waspishly shall you go in the summer or the winter she looked at him with bright eyes of disgust it is on the equator my dear so it hardly matters dont they teach you anything in the foreign office not how to row up the congo in a canoe he retorted it doesnt seem to serve any purpose we leave it to spinster ladies who according to you have a taste for it good she snapped you had better leave us something jack came to the rescue he turned to julian i knew mrs york several years ago before her marriage to robert but i cant remember whether she was interested in travel and of course one may change i daresay marrying into the foreign office will have broadened her knowledge and perhaps her ambitions charlotte silently blessed him and composed her face into an expression of great interest was mr york a traveler there was a moments silence a knife clinked on someones plate out in the hall a servants footsteps sounded quite clearly no julian replied no i dont believe he was although i did not know him well i came to the department in the foreign office only a couple of months before his death felix knew him better he liked paris sonia asherson said suddenly i remember him saying so i wasnt at all surprised he was such a charming man elegant and witty paris would be bound to please him she looked at her husband i wish we could go abroad sometimes to somewhere sophisticated like that africa would be terrible and india only marginally better charlotte looked at harriet and this time she was almost sure her guess was right the dark hollow look in her eyes the aura of loss surrounding her was exactly what charlotte herself had once felt when sarah and dominic had talked quite lightly of moving away yes harriet was in love with felix asherson did he know it dominic had never had the faintest idea of the turmoil he had caused in his sisterinlaw the agony the embarrassment or the idiotic dreams she looked at felix asherson but he was staring at the white damask cloth in front of him i shouldnt anticipate anything he answered her irritably i cant imagine any circumstance in which i should be sent to any part of europe except perhaps germany all the interest in my department is with the empire particularly africa and who colonizes where and if i went there it would be on business i should be there and back in weeks and most of the time would be spent on the voyage harriet was still too absorbed in trying to hide her feelings from the company to say anything garrard was leaning backwards in his chair admiring the sparkle of the wine in his glass as the light from the chandelier caught it a little selfconsciously elegant charlotte decided although she felt there was more emotion behind that highly individual face than she had first imagineddeeper lines round the mouth a sharper curve to the lips gestures that told of control mastering an inner restlessness he was not as unlike adeline as he had seemed at first i must ask mrs york about paris she said smiling dazzlingly at no one in particular i have never traveled and i daresay i will not have the opportunity but i love to hear about other peoples experiences mostly experiences of barbarous food and plumbing that doesnt work garrard looked at her with irony a much overrated occupation i assure you miss barnaby you will usually be too hot or too cold someone will mislay your baggage the channel crossing on the steamer will make you ill and once you reach calais you will not understand a word anyone says charlotte was about to retort with asperity that she spoke french when she realized she was being teased and for his amusement not hers indeed she raised her eyebrows all experiences i am quite used to in england except for the channel crossing perhaps you have not lately left london mr danver bravo aunt adeline said with satisfaction she has your measure my dear his smile touched only his mouth indeed he said but he left it more a question than a concession you shouldnt spoil peoples dreams papa julian began eating again slowly anyway miss barnaby may find things quite different if she comes to travel i remember roberts mother used to enjoy it she mentioned brussels in particular was that recently charlotte asked eagerly perhaps things have improved since you were there mr danver his face hardened the light shone on the smooth tight skin of his cheeks and charlotte sensed a powerful anger inside him why on earth should he be abraded by something so trivial no one had proved him mistaken merely expressed a different opinion was his temper so unstable perhaps my dreams will never be realized she said quietly but it is pleasant to have them god preserve us from dreaming women garrard raised his eyes to the ceiling and there was an edge to his voice that charlotte would ordinarily have called him to account for it is frequently the only way we can get anything aunt adeline said picking up her glass and sniffing at her chablis but of course you wouldnt realize that everyone looked nonplussed felix glanced at julian sonias face with its regular features and flawless skin registered what charlotte was convinced was stupidity although it was totally unfair to judge her so harshly she was being too partisan towards harriet and she knew it i beg your pardon miss danver jack said with a frown not at all your fault she said graciously i daresay you are in a similar position jack turned to charlotte totally confused what are you talking about aunt addie harriet asked gently scheming women aunt adelines eyebrows rose above her bright eyes too round for beauty arent you listening my dear henderson garrard called loudly for heavens sake bring on the pudding whatever it is dreaming women aunt addie julian said patiently papa said dreaming women not scheming oh really she smiled quite suddenly at jack i apologize mr radley do forgive me nothing to forgive he assured her one can very easily lead to the other dont you think one begins by dreaming and without the restraint of morality isnt it often too easy to end in working out ways to bring about whatever it is one wants charlotte glanced from one face to another not daring to look at julian too long had they any idea why she was here was she perhaps far more transparent than she supposed and they were merely playing with her you are overrating peoples morality garrards smile still curved his lips upward but there was derision in it rather than pleasure it is more often a perception of what is practical and what is notalthough god help us there are some hideous exceptions thank you henderson put it down man he accepted the steaming treacle pudding and syrup and brandy sauce miss barnaby let us talk of something less sordid have you any plans to go to the theater there are plenty of amusing plays on one is not restricted to mr wagner by any means the subject had been changed and she realized that without the most extraordinary ill manners she could not pursue the topic further even if she did it would be profitless now she would betray herself and ruin all future plans oh i certainly hope to she said eagerly is there anything you recommend it would be lovely to go to the theater wouldnt it jack and so the meal concluded and nothing more was said that seemed to have any bearing upon robert yorks life or death or the danver familys relationship with the yorks the ladies left the table before the port was brought in and returned to the withdrawing room charlotte had expected the conversation to be stilted as she sensed what harriets feelings for felix were whether sonia was aware of them or not they could not possibly feel at ease with each other as for felix himself charlotte had not yet decided whether he knew of harriets love or whether he returned it and if so with what sincerity or honor aunt adelines sharp tongue and dull hearing were unlikely to help matters charlotte was ready to do her best to smooth the awkwardness with small talk but she found her assessment mistaken apparently they had all known each other long enough to have found their own accommodation either by trial or by instinct they knew what harmless comments to make on fashion what gossip of mutual acquaintances to exchange and which short stories in the london illustrated news they all had read charlotte did not have the time or the money to take the illustrated news nor had she ever heard of their friends she sat with a smile of polite interest which became more fixed and less natural as the minutes dragged by once or twice she caught aunt adelines eye saw a flash of amusement there and looked away finally aunt adeline stood up miss barnaby you expressed an interest in art perhaps you would care to see one of the landscapes in the boudoir it was my sisterinlaws favorite room and she was quite fond of travel she hoped to visit so many places and did she charlotte asked rising also adeline led the way no she died young she was twentysix harriet was barely walking julian was seven or eight charlotte was touched with a sudden sharp sense of loss for the woman whose life had ended when she was on the brink of so mucha husband and children one a mere baby how would she feel if she had to leave daniel and jemima and thomas to manage alone im so sorry she said aloud it was a long time ago aunt adeline replied half over her shoulder as she crossed the hall going down a wide passage and opening the door into a ladys sitting room known as a boudoir it was decorated in cream and a muted tone the color of dry sand with touches of cool liquid green and one splash of pale coral provided by a single chair it was most unusual and rather out of character with the rest of the house it led charlotte to a sudden thought that perhaps the young mrs danver had not felt at home here perhaps she had made this room into an island for herself contrasting it with the other rooms as strongly as she dared on the wall opposite the fireplace was a painting of the bosphorus looking down from the topkapi palace on the golden horn fleets of little boats plied the bluegreen waters and in the distance blurred by the haze of heat and the dazzle of the sun loomed the shore of asia a strong man might easily swim as far as leander had done for hero had young mrs danver thought of that when she chose it you say nothing aunt adeline remarked charlotte was very weary of triteness she wanted to discard the conventionimprisoned miss barnaby and be herself especially with this woman whom she liked more and more what could i possibly say that could meet the loveliness of this or all the ideas and the dreams one might find in it she demanded i refuse to add any more platitudes to the evening oh my dear child you are doomed to disaster adeline said candidly you will take wings like icarus and like icarus fall into the sea society does not permit women to fly as you will doubtless discover for heavens sake do not marry suitably it may well be like walking into cold water inch by inch until it covers your head charlotte had a tremendous impulse to tell adeline she had already married highly unsuitably and was extremely happy remembering emily she held her tongue at the last moment shall i marry unsuitably if i can she asked with only half a smile it was wry and she knew it a little painful i dont suppose your parents will allow it aunt adeline demurred mine wouldnt charlotte drew breath to say again that she was sorry then knew it would sound too condescending adeline was not the sort of person for whom one should feel ever the most glancing touch of that pity which has no fellow feeling she did not believe that adeline danver had shrunk from any decision out of cowardice but even if she had passing judgment on it now was none of charlottes right nor desire instead she drew a little on truth remembering what had actually happened to her my grandmother is the one who would make the worst fuss she said adeline smiled bleakly but her eyes held no selfpity she sat sideways on the arm of one of the big sandcolored chairs my mother enjoyed poor health she played it for every second of obedience and attention she could extract from it but when i was young we all believed she might die from one of her turns eventually it was garrard who called her bluff for which i shall always respect him but then it was too late for me she took a deep breath of course had i been a beauty i should have lived a life of glamorous sin but having never been asked i am obliged to pretend that i would not have accepted her brown eyes were brilliant have you noticed how one condemns most selfrighteously that which one has never had the opportunity to do yes charlotte agreed with a candid smile indeed i have it casts a new meaning upon making a virtue of necessity it is one of the hypocrisies that irritates me the most youll see a great deal of it youd do well to hide your feelings and learn to hold conversation with yourself i fear you are right i am most certainly right adeline stood up she really was very gaunt but there was a strength of vitality in her which made her the most interesting person in the house she looked at the picture again do you know that a courtesan named theodora rose to be empress of byzantium she said quite casually i wonder if she wore outrageous colors i love royal blues and peacock greens and scarlets and saffron yelloweven the names of them sound good but i dare not wear them garrard wouldnt give me a moments peace he would certainly stop my dress allowance she stared fixedly at the picture as if she could see beyond it you know there was a woman who used to visit this house once or twice in the middle of the night very beautiful like a black swan she wore gowns of blazing cerise not fiery not a yellow red like flames but shot with blues fearful color on anyone else i should look like a nightmare in it she turned round with a look of faint surprise but she looked marvelous cant imagine what she was doing here except to see julian perhaps but he really should have been more discreet garrard would have been furious still since he began courting veronica york as far as i know he has been above reproach and that is all one can reasonably expect of a man a mans past is his own affair i wish it were so for a woman but i am not ingenuous enough to believe it ever will be charlottes mind was whirling adeline had said so much she needed time to disentangle it i have an aunt whom you would like she said realizing even as she spoke how daring she had become lady cumminggould she is nearly eighty but she is marvelous she believes in women having the vote for parliament and she is prepared to fight to help bring it about how unselfish of her adelines eyes were bright although there was selfmockery as well as enthusiasm in them she will not live to see it dont you think so if we all pressed as hard as we could would not men eventually see the justice of it and the expression on adelines face made charlotte feel naive and her voice died away my dear adeline said shaking her head slightly of course if we all spoke together we could persuade men or even force thembut we never do speak together how often have you seen half a dozen women agree and band together for a cause let alone half a million her thin fingers smoothed over the velvet back of the chair we all live our separate lives in our own kitchens if we are poor our withdrawing rooms if we are welltodo and we do not cooperate for anything but see ourselves as rivals for the few eligible and wellfinanced men that are available men on the other hand work fairly well together imagining themselves the protectors and providers of the nation obliged to do everything they can to preserve the situation precisely as it isin their controlon the assumption that they know best what is right for us and must see that we get it come hell or high water her head jerked up and there are only too many women who are happy to assist them since the status quo suits them very well also and they are invariably the people with power miss danver i think you are a revolutionary charlotte said with delight you must meet greataunt vespasia youd love each other before adeline could respond there were footsteps in the passageway and harriet appeared at the door her face pale and her eyes heavy as if she lacked sleep the gentlemen have rejoined us wont you come back aunt addie then she remembered her manners miss barnaby a look of pity passed over adelines face and vanished so rapidly that charlotte was almost doubtful she had seen it perhaps she had only imagined an echo of her own quick understanding of course adeline moved towards the door we were admiring your mothers painting of the bosphorus come miss barnaby asylum is over for this evening we must leave theodora and byzantium and return to the world and the pressing matters of the present such as whether miss weatherly will become engaged to captain marriott this month or next or whether perhaps he will evade her entirelyshe shrugged her thin shouldersand go to sea in a sieve harriet looked puzzled glancing uncertainly at charlotte edward lear charlotte hazarded an explanation their heads were blue and their hands were green or the other way round and they went to sea in a sievei think but he was also an excellent artist his paintings of greece are beautiful oh harriet looked relieved but no wiser well jack asked her as soon as they were alone in the carriage huddled together in biting cold breath white as steam outside the wind moaned and rattled and the gutters were filled with freezing slush dark with mud and frozen manure for once odorless the horses hooves thudded heavily on the ice all sorts of things she replied with chattering teeth she decided not tell him that harriet was in love with felix asherson it was young miss danvers own private heartache and if he had not noticed it then it should remain so they seem to have quite as much money as the yorks so that is not a motive and apparently the two families have known each other for some time so julian and veronica might have fallen in love before robert died on the other hand and this really is most interesting aunt addie whom you like enormously he interrupted whom i like enormously she agreed but that doesnt blind my wits of course not it doesnt aunt adeline said that twice at least she had seen a strange and beautiful woman in the house at night up until three years ago but not since she wore an outrageous shade of cerise always you mean both times all right both times but who was she maybe she was the spy after julians secrets from the foreign office perhaps she inveigled him then why hasnt she been seen since perhaps after robert yorks death she went away or into hiding or maybe he was the one with the secrets and since he is dead there is nothing for her anymore maybe julian danver wouldnt fall for herhe loved veronica i dont know are you going to tell thomas she took a deep bream and let it out slowly her hands deep in emilys muff were numb with cold it was so late that she was going to have to stay the night with emily and go home tomorrow which would not please pitt she could tell him emily was upset so she had remained which was true after a fashion but she hated lying to him and it was a lie at heart the alternative was to tell him the truth and the reasons for pursuing the york murder yes she said slowly i think so are you sure thats wise he said doubtfully im an awfully bad liar jack you amaze me he said his voice rising mockingly i would never have guessed it pardon she asked sharply i should say id witnessed a bravura performance this evening ohthats quite different it doesnt count he started to laugh and although she was furious she liked him for it perhaps emily would be all right charlotte got up before dawn the following morning and by seven oclock she was at home in her own kitchen frying prime bacon and fresh eggs a peace offering from emily is emily ill pitt looked worried but she knew he was on the edge of losing his temper if her answer was not satisfactory she knew perfectly well that she looked too excited too pleased with herself to have been up all night by a sickbed thomas she had thought about this a long time at least an hour of the short night yes his voice was guarded emily isnt ill but she is very lonely and being in mourning is pretty wretched i know that my dear now there was compassion in his voice and it made her feel guilty so i thought we should get involved in something she hurried on she poked the bacon and it hissed gently sending out an exquisite aroma something he pressed with heavy skepticism he knew her far too well for this to succeed yes something totally absorbinglike a mystery so we started to look into robert yorks death which you told me about she reached for an egg and cracked it into the pan then another jack radleyand thats another reason i really do want to get to know him rather better just in case she hurried on taking a deep breath emily considers marrying him someone has to look after her interests charlotte well i did have two reasons she insisted then went on hastily anyway i went to tea with veronica york and her motherinlaw emily arranged it so that jack radley took methat way i was able to observe him while making some discoveries about the yorks she could feel pitts presence behind her as she turned the eggs gently then took them out and put them on his plate next to the bacon there you are she said smiling sweetly last night i dined with the danvers i met them all and they are most interesting by the way the yorks and the danvers appear to have about the same financial status so neither veronica nor julian danver would marry the other for money as she spoke she made the tea and set it on the table all without meeting his eyes and aunt adeline told me the oddest thing she saw a beautiful glamorous woman wearing an outrageous shade of cerise in the house do you suppose she was a spy at last she looked at her husband and was immensely relieved to see amazement in his face his eyes were wide and his hand had stopped halfway to his mouth a woman in cerise he said after a moments silence did she say in cerise yes yes why have you heard of her is she a spy thomas i dont know but the maid at the yorks saw her too charlotte slipped into the seat opposite him and leaned forward forgetting her own bacon what did she say when did she see her do you know who she is no but i shall go back and speak to the maid again i think and ask her for a closer description and exactly when she saw this woman i must find out who she is if i can but before he went to hanover close again he called by at the bow street station to attend to a few other inquiries particularly a burglary in the strand he was halfway through reading the reports when a constable came in a mug of tea in one hand he put it down on pitts desk thank you pitt said absently thought youd like to know mr pitt the constable said with a sniff as he reached for a large cotton handkerchief sneezing into it and blowing his nose been a haccident yesterday sir at anover close very sad one of the upstairs maids fell out o the window poor soul musta leaned out too far for suffink or other maybe to call to someone anyow the poor girl is dead sir dead pitt looked up startled and chilled who the constable looked down at the paper in his hand dulcie mabbutt sir ladys maid when charlotte left to go back home emily was wide awake an endless day stretching ahead and nothing planned she tried to go back to sleep againquarter to six was far too earlybut her mind was restless at first she contemplated charlottes evening with the danvers who was the mysterious woman in the cerise gown probably just an old love of julians he had been indiscreet enough to entertain under his fathers roof no that would not do no man with half an ounce of intelligence would do such a thing and by charlottes account julian danver was quite a presence she had spoken of him with some admiration and said she completely understood why veronica york should wish to marry him and charlotte could never abide a fool even though she imagined she was tolerant there was another answer either julian or garrard was a traitor and the woman in cerise was the spy who had turned the mans loyalty it was simply coincidence that she had not been seen since robert yorks deathshe had been more careful that was all no that was silly too if the woman in cerise had had nothing to do with robert yorks death why bother to think about her at all she was just what she seemed a paramour being indiscreet perhaps julian had tired of heror garrard at a stretch of the imaginationand she had become desperate and foolish enough to pursue him to his house or again maybe harriet was leading a double lifepossibly even keeping an assignation with felix and in such flamboyant clothes so different from her usual attire that aunt adeline had failed to recognize her in the middle of the night when aunt adeline had presumably woken from sleep that seemed more than likely she sounded like a quaint old lady at the best would emily herself grow into a quaint lonely old lady visiting relatives too often and so bored she lived other peoples lives vicariously misunderstanding everyone and seeing things that were not there with this wretched thought emily decided to get up even though it was still only five minutes to seven if the servants were startled let them be it would do them good she rang for her maid and had to wait several minutes for her to come then she had a bath and dressed carefully as if she were to entertain someone of great importanceit was good for her moraleand went downstairs of course her ladys maid had warned the rest of the house so she took no one by surprise whatever they felt there was nothing in their faces but bland goodmornings carrying in the poached eggs wainwright looked like a church warden with a collection plate and he put it down in front of her with the same reverence she would have loved to startle him enough to make him drop it when she had finished breakfast and had taken three cups of tea she went to the kitchen she thoroughly irritated the cook by interfering with the weeks menus and then tried the patience of her own maid by checking on the mending and ironing of her gowns when she finally realized how unfair she was being she went into her boudoir closed the door and began to write a letter to greataunt vespasia simply because she would have liked to talk to her she was on the fourth page of her letter when the footman knocked and came in to tell her that her mother mrs ellison was in the morning room oh ask her in here she answered its much brighter she covered the letter and with mixed feelings prepared to welcome her mother caroline came in a moment later dressed in a fashionable winecolored barathea trimmed with black fur and a rakish hat which made her look more elegant than emily could remember there was a flush in her cheeks doubtless the bitter weather and she was full of good spirits how are you my dear she kissed emily delicately and sat in one of the most comfortable chairs you look peaked she observed with maternal candor i hope you are eating well you must look after your health for edwards sake and your own of course this first year is terribly difficult i know but another six months and it will be past you must prepare for the future by midsummer it will be acceptable for you to start mixing in a few suitable gatherings emilys heart sank the word suitable was like a damnation she could imagine those gatherings coteries of blackclad widows sitting round like crows on a fence making pioussounding meaningless remarks or else tutting over the latest giddiness of society picking it over endlessly because it was the only way they could participate in its life i think ill take up good works she said aloud very commendable caroline agreed with a little nod as long as you do it in moderation you might speak to your vicar about it or if you prefer i will speak to mine i am sure there are committees of ladies who would welcome your contributions in time when it is appropriate for you to begin going out of your home to such meetings sitting on committees of women was the last thing emily had in mind she was thinking of the sort of work greataunt vespasia didvisiting workhouses and campaigning for better conditions and agitating for changes in the employment laws for children trying to increase the number and scope of ragged schools for pauper children perhaps even fighting for the political franchise for women now that she had the money there might be quite a lot she could do emily decided you dont look dressed for good works she said critically in fact ive never seen you look so well caroline was startled there is no need to dress like a dowd or to look wretched in order to do good works emily i know this has been tragic for you but you must not allow yourself to become eccentric my dear emily could feel her temper boil up inside her mixed with frustration and despair imprisoning walls seemed to be closing in around her it was as if someone were padlocking a gate and she could hear her mothers calm reasonable voice like the swish of closing curtains shutting out everything that was spontaneous bright and exhilarating why not she demanded why shouldnt i become eccentric dont be foolish emily carolines tone was still gentle but overly patient as if she were speaking to a sickly child who would not eat her rice pudding in due course you will want to marry again you are far too young to remain a widow and you are extremely eligible if you behave circumspectly during the next two or three years you may quite easily marry at least as well as you did before and be most comfortable and happy but this next short time is crucial it could make or mar everything emily raised her eyebrows high you mean if i do something immodest or unseemly no duke will have me and if i am seen to be eccentric i may not even manage a baronet you are in a very trying mood this morning caroline said struggling to remain patient you know the rules of society quite as well as i do really emily you used to be the most sensible of the three of you but you seem to be getting more like charlotte every time i see you perhaps i should have counseled you against spending christmas with her but i thought it would be nice for edward to have some other children to play with and to be quite frank i know charlotte must have been grateful for all the financial assistance you were able to give herdiscreetly charlotte is perfectly happy emily said far more waspishly than she had wished to she was being unfair and she knew it even as she was unable to prevent herself from going on and i enjoyed christmas with her and thomas in fact i loved it carolines face eased into a smile and she quickly put her hand over emilys im sure you did my dear your affection for each other is one of the nicest things in my life emily felt a ridiculous prickle of tears and was furious with herself she did not wish to distress her mother and yet with the best will in the world caroline was devising a future for her which so utterly misunderstood what she wanted it was unbearable mama i refuse to sit on parish committees so on no account speak either to your vicar or mine you will only embarrass yourself because i shall not turn up if i do any good work it will be something real perhaps with greataunt vespasia but i wont sit around pontificating on other peoples morals handing out saving tracts and homemade broth from a great height caroline sighed gritting her teeth emily at times you are most childish you really cannot behave like lady cumminggould she has quite a name in society people tolerate her because she is very old and because they still retain a certain respect for her late husband and at her age it doesnt matter a great deal what she does it can always be discounted as senility i never met anyone in my life less senile than greataunt vespasia emily defended her furiously not only in her affection for vespasia but for the wit and pity she represented she has more good judgment about what really matters in her little finger than most of the rest of society in all its fatuous heads put together but no one would marry her my dear caroline said exasperated shes nearly eighty for goodness sake emily shouted caroline would not be diverted by reason exactly the point i am trying to make you are barely thirty consider your position with some sense you are a pretty woman but you are not a great beauty as vespasia was nor are you born of a great family you have no alliances to offer no connections with power she looked at emily seriously but you do have a considerable amount of money if you marry beneath yourself you will lay yourself open to fortune hunters and men of the most dubious sort who may well court you out of greed and the desire to gain entry to society on the strength of your past connections with the ashworths it is a sad thing to have to say but you are not a child you know that as well as i do of course i know emily turned away jack radleys face came vividly to mind he was charming and seemed so frank with those marvelous eyes fringed with long lashes was he a superb liar capable of skilled and sustained deceit all his future might depend on it if he wooed and won her he could stop worrying about money for the rest of his life for the first time since his childhood he would be secure he could dress as he liked buy horses and carriages gamble go to the races invite people to dinner instead of incessantly seeking invitations in order to dine well he would no longer have to curry favor he could afford at last to like and dislike as he chose the thought was intensely ugly and it hurt more deeply than she would have believed even a few weeks ago emily took a deep rather shaky breath of course i know she said again loudly but i have no intention of marrying a bore simply to be sure his motives are not financial now you are being ridiculous carolines patience was wearing positively threadbare you will make a reasonable accommodation as we all do charlotte didnt i think the less said about charlotte the better caroline said in exasperation and if you imagine for one instant that you could marry someone like a policeman or any other sort of tradesman or artisan and be happy then you really have taken leave of your wits charlotte is extremely fortunate that it hasnt turned out to be worse than it has oh certainly thomas is a pleasant enough man and he has treated her as well as he is able but she has no security if something should happen to him tomorrow she will be left with nothing at all and two small children to raise by herself she sighed no my dear do not delude yourself into thinking that charlotte has everything her own way it would not suit you to be cutting down last years dresses to do this year and cooking in your own kitchen with sundays meat having to last you through till thursday and dont forget you would have no wealthy sister to help you as she has have your daydreams by all means but remember that is all they are and when you have woken up from them behave yourself like a widow of charm and dignity with a considerable fortune and a social position that is very much worth your while to maintain undamaged by eccentric behavior give tongues no cause to whisper emily was too crushed to argue yes mama she said wearily the whole realm of answers and explanations was too tangled in her mind too alien to caroline and too little understood even by herself for her to begin to unravel and present them good caroline smiled at her now perhaps you will offer me a dish of teait is extremely cold outside and in a few months i shall speak to the vicar there are committees for various things that would do very nicely as suitable places for you to begin to associate again yes mama emily said again hollowly and reached for the bell rope the rest of the day was thoroughly miserable outside the wind blew showers of sleet against the windows and it was so dark all the gas lamps were burning even at midday emily finished her letter to greataunt vespasia and then tore it up it was too full of selfpity and she did not want aunt vespasia to see that side of her it was understandable perhaps but it was not attractive and she cared very much what vespasia thought of her when edward finished his lessons they had afternoon tea together and then the long evening stretched to an early bed the following day was utterly different it began with the morning mail which contained a letter from charlotte posted late the previous evening and marked most urgent she tore it open and read dear emily something very sad has happened and if we are right then it is also evil and dangerous i think the woman in cerise is the key to it all thomas knew of her too from the ladys maid at the yorks of course he didnt tell me about her at the time because then he did not know we had any interest she saw cerisei shall call her thatat the york house in the middle of the night when i told him what aunt addie said you can imagine his reaction but the dreadful thing is that when he went into the station at bow street before going back to question the maid at hanover close again he heard that she had been killed the day before apparently she fell out of an upstairs window thomas is very upset of course it could have been an accident and nothing to do with his inquiries or the fact that she told him about cerise but on the other hand someone may have overheard her and this is the interesting thing all the danvers were in the house when thomas was there so anyone might have been in the hall at the time she and thomas were in the library talking what we need to do is find out who was there when she fell thomas cant do it because there is no reason to suspect it wasnt an ordinary domestic accident people do sometimes fall out of windows and one cannot start casting suspicions on a family like the yorks and if the whole investigation of veronica should come out then there would be the most dreadful scandal and goodness knows who would be hurt julian danver would probably be ruined and veronica most certainly would you must tell jack when next he calls if there is anything else i shall tell you as soon as i hear it your loving sister charlotte emily held the paper with tingling fingers her hands were numb and already her mind was racing the woman in cerise and the ladys maid who had seen her in the york house in the middle of the night was now dead but they would never get beneath the smooth supremely disciplined surface of the yorks facade by going for the odd afternoon tea or walking round the winter exhibition and exchanging a few slight confidences on fashion or gossip pitt had disturbed something much deeper than an old burglary or the question of veronicas suitability to become the wife of julian danver this was something of such passion and horror that even three years later it could erupt without warning into violenceand now it seemed quite possible murder they must get closer much closerin fact they must get inside the yorks home but how an idea occurred to her but it was preposterous it would never work to start with she would not be able to carry it off she was sure to be found out immediately they would know how would they know it would be difficultof course it wouldshe would have to behave entirely differently alter her appearance her face her hair even her hands and her voice an englishwomans background could be identified by her voice the moment she spoke no servant had those rounded vowels the precise consonants even if the grammar had been meticulously copied but veronica york would be needing a new ladys maid someone who would be there all the time in the unguarded moments someone who would see everything as only those who are invisible can and domestic servants are invisible knowing it was absurd emily went on planning how it might be done she had had a ladys maid all her lifefirst her mothers then her ownand she knew the duties by heart some she would certainly not be very good at she had never really tried to iron but surely she could learn she was rather good at doing hair she and charlotte had played at doing each others before they had been allowed to wear their hair up she was adequate with a needle there could not be all that much difference between embroidering and mending the difficultyand the dangerwould be in altering her manner so that she passed for a servant what was the worst that could happen if she were discovered she would be dismissed of course but that hardly mattered they would think she was a wellbred girl who had fallen into some sort of disgrace that necessitated taking a menial position they would almost certainly assume she had had an illegitimate child that was the kind of disgrace women fell into it would be a humiliation but a brief one if they ever met her again as lady ashworth they would be unlikely to recognize her because it would never occur to them that it was she if it did she could brazen it out she would look daggers at them and suggest they had lost their wits to make such an offensive and tasteless suggestion as a ladys maid she would not meet any guests to the house she would never be asked to wait at table or answer the door perhaps the idea was not so absurd after all they would never discover who had murdered robert york if they continued as they were they were playing at it touching the fringes knowing there was a terrible passion under the conventional surface but only throwing around guesses as to what it was and whom it had pushed into murder inside the york house she could learn infinitely more she shivered suddenly thinking of the danger being dismissed as a fallen woman would be nothing a brief embarrassment but if by some horrendous mischance they did recognize her as emily ashworth they would assume she had taken leave of her senses that georges death had robbed her of her sanity the scandal would be appalling but there was no reason why that should happen no the real danger was from the person who had already killed robert york and possibly dulcie killed her simply because she had seen or heard something emily would have to be exquisitely careful she must pretend to be stupid and innocent and she must always always guard her tongue the alternative was to give upto go on sitting here in black either alone or talking polite rubbish to the few people who called on her until caroline arranged some wretched committees for her to be righteous on she would get nothing but secondhand reports from charlotte she would not contribute anything at all herself even jack would be bored with her soon by the time jack called at midmorning she had made the decision thank goodness she had not sent that wretched letter to aunt vespasia she was going to need her help she would call on her that afternoon im going to the yorks she announced as soon as jack came in i dont think you can do that emily he said with a slight frown oh not socially she waved her hand dismissing the notion their ladys maid saw aunt addies woman in cerise at the yorks house as well in the middle of the night she told thomasand now shes dead the maid yes of course the maid emily said impatiently the woman in cerise has vanished and she must have something to do with treason and almost certainly robert yorks murder we must find out all we can and we shant do that by calling for tea now and then what else we can hardly walk in and start interrogating them jack pointed out even if we could that wouldnt do any good emily was excited now whatever jack said it was not going to put her off for the first time since georges death she was going to do something totally outrageous which he would certainly have forbidden and she was glad there was no one who could command her obedience we must be subtle she continued we must observe them when they have no idea and little by little they may betray themselves he was at a loss to understand and with delight she dropped her bombshell i am going to take the position of ladys maid i shall write one reference myself and get another from greataunt vespasia he was stunned good god you cant emily you cant go as a servant why not the first minute spark of humor lit in his eyes you wouldnt know how for a start he said i would her chin came up and she knew she must look and sound ridiculous for goodness sake jack ive had a very good ladys maid for years i know perfectly well what she does and i can do it myself in a pinch i certainly had to learn how when i was a girl he started to laugh and at any other time she would have thought it a delightful sound full of joy and vitality now she heard derision in his laughter and it was extremely provoking im not saying it will be easy she said sharply i am not used to having people tell me what to do and i shant like being at someone elses beck and call but i can do it it will be something of a change from sitting here all day doing nothing at all emily theyll find you out his laughter vanished as it dawned on him that she might be serious oh no they wont i shall be a model of good behavior disbelief was written all over his face charlotte has got away with being miss barnaby she carried on determinedly and im a far better liar than she is i shall go this afternoon otherwise i may be too late i have written myself a glowing reference and i shall obtain another from aunt vespasia i have already telephoned her did i tell you i have acquired a telephone its a wonderful thing i dont know why i didnt get one beforeand she is expecting me this afternoon she will write an introductory letter for me if i ask her she was not at all sure that aunt vespasia would do anything of the sort but she would do all she could to persuade her now he looked really concerned but emily think of the danger if what you are supposing is true then someone murdered the maid if they have even a suspicion of you you could end up the same way leave it to thomas she swung round on him immediately and what do you suggest he do go as a footman he wouldnt have the slightest idea how to get on apart from the fact that they know him already and that he is with the police from what charlotte says his superiors arent interested in robert yorks death all they want to do is make sure veronica is suitable to marry julian danver oh come on jack turned sideways in the chair opposite her thats what they said but its obviously an excuse they dont care in the least what veronica does if shes discreet about it and if she werent theyd know without anyones finding out for them theyre suspicious about yorks death and whether veronica had a lover or not and if he or even veronica herself murdered robert they are just too devious to have said so outright she stared at him are they what about treason what about the woman in cerise he thought for a moment well that could have been veronica herself after an assignation with julian danver if they were lovers then then it was julian who killed robert york possibly the fact that hes an agreeable fellow is irrelevant some of the worst cads ive known have been charming as long as you didnt stand in their way or it could have been harriet leading a double life with felix asherson shes obviously in love with him charlotte didnt tell you that my dear girl she didnt need to do you think im a complete fool ive seen too many flirtations not to know when a womans in love she was polite she pretended he was a friend and of no romantic interest she avoided his eyes and looked at him when he was turned away she was so careful it must matter to her very much she had had no idea he was so perceptive it came as a sobering surprise puncturing her confidence indeed she said coldly and of course you are never mistakenyou can read women just like that she tried to snap her fingers and failed to make the sharp sound she wished producing instead only a faint thump hellfire she said under her breath well anyway i am going to the yorks there is something hideously wrong in that house and i shall discover what it is emily please his voice changed completely the lightness vanished if they catch you out in the least thing they may well realize why you are really there if they pushed one maid out of the window they wont hesitate to get rid of you too they cant push two maids out of the window she said with chill reason eyebrows would be raised even at the honorable piers york it doesnt have to be a window he said getting angry himself it could be the stairs or a ladder they could push you under a carriage wheel or it might be something you ate or you could simply disappear along with a couple of good pieces of the family silver emily for gods sake use a little sense i am bored to screaming with using sense she turned round fiercely and glared at him i have worn black seen no one and been sensible for six months and i am beginning to feel as if it was me they buried i am going to the yorks to be a maid and discover who murdered robert york and why now if you wish to come to greataunt vespasias with me you are welcome otherwise will you please excuse me because i have work to do i am telling my own staff that i am going to stay with my sister for a while of course i shall tell charlotte the truth if you want to help that will be very nice if not if you prefer to disassociate yourself i shall understand completely playing detective is not for everyone she finished with immense condescension if i dont help charlotte will be left high and dry he pointed out with a slight smile she had forgotten that she was obliged to climb down but it was hard to do it gracefully then i hope you will feel able to continue she did not look at him we must keep in touch with the danvers they are certainly part of it does charlotte know about thisplan of yours not yet he drew in breath to comment then let it out again in a sigh seeing men behave like fools was one thing but he was not accustomed to this behavior in women he had to readjust his thinking but jack was adaptable and had remarkably few prejudices ill work out a way to keep in touch with you he said after a moments consideration dont forget most houses dont allow maids to have followers and theyll comment on letters maybe even read them if they suspect its an admirer she stopped she had not thought of that but it was too late to withdraw now ill be careful she conceded ill say it is my mother or something and how will you account for the fact that your mother lives in bloomsbury he asked i at last she faced him you havent thought he said candidly for a moment she blessed him for not being patronizing if he had been gentle it would have been the last straw she remembered her own early days of social aspiration the constant struggle to keep up to say the right thing to please the right people those born to acceptance can never understand the feeling that was one of the things she and jack shared a sense of being outside accepted as long as they charmed and amused but not by right he had felt the sting of unconscious superiority too often to practice it himself he was waiting for her to flare up instead emily was reminded of how much she liked him he had said nothing of the risk to her social position no she agreed with a small smile quite calmly i would be obliged if you would help me sort out such details i shall have to say my sister is in service if they ask me there are plenty of residential servants in bloomsbury then she must have the same surname what are you going to call yourself er amelia amelia what anything i cant use pitt they might remember it from thomas i once had a maid called gibson ill use her name then youll have to remember to write to charlotte as miss gibson too ill tell her thank you jack i really am very obliged he grinned suddenly i should think so you are going to do what greataunt vespasias silver eyebrows arched high above her hooded eyes she was seated in her spare elegant withdrawing room dressed in mulberry silk with a pink fichu at the neck that was fastened with a seed pearl star she looked frailer than before thinner since georges death but some of the fire had come back into her glance and her back was as straight as ever im going to go to the yorks as a ladys maid emily repeated she swallowed hard and met aunt vespasias eyes and vespasia stared unflinchingly back at her are you you wont like it my dear your duties will be the least part of your burden even obedience will be less irksome to you than assuming an air of meekness and respect towards the sort of people you normally treat as equals whatever your private thoughts may be and do remember that goes for the housekeeper and the butler as well not just the mistress emily could not dare to think of it or her nerve would desert her a small timorous voice inside her wished aunt vespasia would come up with some unanswerable reason why she could not possibly go she knew she had been unfair to jack he had been concerned for her that was all she would have been hurt if he had not objected to the plan i know she admitted i expect it to be difficult i may not even last very long but this way i can learn things about the yorks that years of visiting couldnt achieve people forget servants they think of them as furniture i know i do it myself yes aunt vespasia agreed dryly i daresay your own maids opinion of you might be a salutary thing for you to learn if you ever get above yourself no one knows your vanity nor your frailties quite like a maid but remember my dear for precisely that reason one trusts a maid if you break that trust do not expect to be forgiven i do not imagine loretta york is a forgiving woman you know her only in the way everyone in society knows everyone else she is not my generation now you will need some plain stuff dresses and some caps and aprons some petticoats without lace a night shift and some ordinary black boots i am sure one of my maids will be near enough to your size and a plain box to carry them in if you do this highly bizarre thing you had at least better do it properly yes aunt vespasia emily said with a sinking heart thank you late that afternoon without perfume or the merest rouge to heighten her pale color and clad in a dowdy brown dress and a brown hat emily alit from the public omnibus carrying a borrowed and much used box she walked to number two hanover close to present herself at the servants entrance she had in her reticule also borrowed two letters of recommendation one from herself and the other from greataunt vespasia she had been preceded by a call on the new telephone which aunt vespasia delighted in to announce her coming after all there was no point in applying for this position if it were already filled aunt vespasia had learned that it had not been filled although there were applicants in mind the elder mrs york was very particular even though the maid was actually to serve her daughterinlaw still she was mistress of the house and would say who worked in it and who did not aunt vespasia had asked after mrs yorks health then proceeded to commiserate with her about the distress and inconvenience of losing a maid in such circumstances she had remarked that her own ladys maid amelia gibson who had served her most satisfactorily was now in aunt vespasias declining years and semiretirement from society really more than she required and was consequently looking for a new position she was a girl of reliable family long known to vespasia who had also been in the service of her greatniece lady ashworth whose accompanying testimonial would bear witness vespasia hoped that mrs york might find amelia of satisfactory skill and disposition vespasia would vouch for her character mrs york thanked her for her courtesy and agreed to see amelia if she presented herself forthwith emily clutched her reticule with the letters and three pounds fifteen shillings in silver and copper maids would not have gold sovereigns or guineas and lugged the unaccustomed weight of a box containing a change of dress aprons caps and her underwear a bible and some writing paper pen and ink as she descended the area steps her heart knocking in her ribs her mouth dry she tried to rehearse what she was going to say there was still time to change her mind she could turn round and simply go away and write a letter making some excuse she had been taken ill her mother had diedanything but her feet kept going and just as she was about to weigh up this lunatic decision in the last moment left the back door opened a scullery maid who looked to be about fourteen came out with a bowl full of peelings to throw in the waste bin you be come fer poor dulcies position she said cheerfully eyeing emilys shabby coat and the box in her hand come on in then youll freeze out ere in the yard give yer a cup o tea afore yer see the mistress make yer feel better yer look alf starved in the cold yer do ere give that there box ter albert ell carry it for yer if yer staying emily was grateful and terrified now that the decision to come had been made she wanted to thank the girl but her voice simply refused to obey mutely she followed the scullery maid up the steps into the back kitchen past the vegetables the hanging corpses of two chickens and a brace of game birds complete with feathers and into the main kitchen her hands were numb in her cotton gloves and the sudden warmth engulfed her bringing tears to her eyes and making her sniff after the stinging cold on the walk from the omnibus stop mrs melrose this is someone applyin ter be the new ladys maid and shes fair perished poor thing the cook a narrowshouldered broadhipped woman with a face like a cottage loaf looked up from the pastry she was rolling and regarded emily with businesslike sympathy well come in girl put that box down in the corner out of the way dont want folk falling over it if you stay we can ave it taken upstairs for you whats your name dont stand there girl cat got your tongue she dusted the flour off her bare arms flipped the pastry the other way on the board and began again with the rolling pin still looking at emily amelia gibson maam emily said falteringly realizing she did not know exactly how deferential a ladys maid should be to a cook it was something she had forgotten to ask some folk call ladys maids by their surnames the cook remarked but we dont in this ouse anyway youre too young for that im mrs melrose the cook thats prim the scullery maid as let you in and mary the kitchen maid there she pointed with a floury finger at a girl in a stuff dress and mob cap who was whisking eggs in a bowl youll find out the rest of the ousehold if you need to know sit down at the table there and maryll get you a cup o tea while we tell the mistress youre ere get on with your work prim you got no time to stand around girl albert she called shrilly where is that boy albert a moment later a roundeyed youth of about fifteen appeared his hair standing on end where it grew away from his forehead in a cowlick a double crown at the back giving him a quiff like a cockatoo yes mrs melrose he said swallowing quickly he had obviously been eating on the sly the cook snorted go up and tell mr redditch as the new girls ere after dulcies place go on wi you and if i catch you in them cakes again ill take a broom to yer yes mrs melrose he said and disappeared with alacrity emily accepted her cup of tea and sipped it giving herself hiccups and then feeling ridiculous when mary laughed at her and the cook scowled she tried holding her breath and had only just conquered them when the trim pretty parlormaid came to say that mrs york would see her in the boudoir she led the way and emily followed all along the passage past the butlers pantry through the green baize door and into the main house she kept rehearsing in her mind what she must say how she must behave eyes candid but modest speak only when spoken to never interrupt never contradict never express an opinion no one cared or wanted to know what maids thought it was impertinence never ask anyone to do anything for you do it yourself call the butler sir or by his name address the housekeeper and the cook by name and remember to speak with the right accent always be available night or day never have headaches or stomachachesyou were there to do a job and short of serious illness there were no excuses the vapors were for ladies not for servants nora the parlormaid knocked on the door opened it and announced the girl to see you maam about being miss veronicas maid the boudoir was ivory and pink with touches of deeper rose very feminine indeed there was no time to look for character or quality now mrs loretta york sat in an armchair she was a small woman a little plump around the shoulders an inch or two thicker at the waist than she probably wished but otherwise the beauty she had been in her youth was excellently preserved emily knew instantly that there was steel under the womans soft white skin and for all the lace handkerchiefs the waft of perfume and her thick soft hair there was nothing remotely vague in her wide eyes maam emily bobbled a very small curtsy where do you come from amelia loretta inquired emily had already decided the safest thing would be to copy her own maids backgroundthat way she would be certain not to contradict herself kings langley maam in hertfordshire i see what does your father do hes a cooper maam makes barrels and the like my mam used to be a dairymaid for lord ashworth as was the old gentleman before he passed on she knew not to say died it was too blunt a word for a servant to use on such a delicate subject one did not speak of death and you have worked for lady ashworth and lady cumminggould do you have your references yes maam she took them out of her reticule fingers stiff with nervousness and passed them over she looked at the floor while loretta first read them and then refolded them and passed them back both letters were written on crested paper she had taken care to see to that well these seem to be satisfactory loretta observed why did you leave lady ashworths service she had thought of that my mam passed on she said catching her breath and swallowing hard please heaven the hiccups did not return it would be disastrous if loretta thought she had been tippling at the cooking sherry i had to go back home to care for my younger sisters until we could find places for them and of course lady ashworth being a lady of society had to find someone to take me place but she said shed speak well for me and then lady cumminggould took me on i see the chill eyes regarded her unemotionally it was odd to be looked at as if one were a property to be purchased or passed by without regard to manners or feelings it was not peculiar to loretta york anyone else would have been similar and yet she would be employed to care for her on the most intimate terms brush her hair launder iron and mend her clothes even her underwear wake her in the morning dress her for dinners and balls wait on her if she were ill no one else knew a woman as intimately as her maid her husband certainly did not well amelia i presume you can sew and iron and care for a wardrobe properly or lady ashworth would not recommend you she has a reputation for being in the height of fashion without vulgarity although i cannot recall meeting her myself emily felt a rush of blood into her face then an immediate chill as fear washed through her the chance of recognition had brushed close sooner than she had anticipated the peril had come and gone in one awful moment and when it had passed she opened her mouth to thank loretta for the compliment realizing with a start that a reply would have betrayed her into the very pitfall she had just avoided in her new station no comment was expected of her you may begin immediately loretta continued and if you prove satisfactory after a month we shall make you permanent you will attend my daughterinlaw you will be paid eighteen pounds a year and have one afternoon off every second week if it is convenient but you will be home again before nine we have no girls out late you may have a day off to go home and see your family every three months emily stared at her thank you maam she said in a rush she had been given the position it was decided she felt at once frightened and victorious thank you amelia that will be all you may go lorettas voice brought her back to reality thank you maam she said again letting the relief show in her face after all she really did want the place she bobbed very briefly and turned to leave feeling an overwhelming sense of freedom just at being out of the room and past the first obstacle well the cook looked up from the apple pie she was finishing off with carefully cut pastry leaves emily smiled at her more broadly than she should have i got it then be about your unpacking the cook said pleasantly dont stand around ere girl youre no use to me ousekeepers sitting room is second on the left mrs crawford should be in there this time o day go and see er and shell tell you where youll sleepdulcies room i daresayand shell have joan the laundry maid show you where your iron is and the like i daresay someonell find edith for youthats mrs piers yorks maid youll be for miss veronica yes mrs melrose emily went to the corner to pick up her box dont you bother wi that albertll take it up liftin and carryins not your job less youre asked on wi you yes mrs melrose she went to the housekeepers sitting room and knocked on the door she was told sharply to come in it was small crowded with dark furniture the smell of polish mixing with the thick greenhouse odor of a potted lily on a jardiniere in one corner there were embroidered antimacassars on the backs of the chairs and along the sideboard which was littered with photographs two handstitched samplers framed in wood hung on the walls emily felt overpowered even before she stepped inside the housekeeper mrs crawford was short and thin with the face of an irritable sparrow gray hair escaped a screwedback hairstyle that was considerably out of date and crowned with white lace like froth yes she said sharply who are you emily stood up straight the new ladys maid mrs crawford mrs melrose said as you would tell me where i should sleep sleep at four oclock in the afternoon girl ill tell you where you can put your box and ill show you to the laundry and joan can give you your iron and table i daresay edith is sitting down shes not so well these days youll have met nora the parlormaid and theres libby the upstairs maid and bertha the downstairs maid and fanny the tweeny but a useless little article she is and of course mr redditch the butler but youll not have much to do with him nor john the footman who valets for mr york and albert the bootboy yes mrs crawford and youll have met mary the kitchen maid and prim the scullery maid well thats all outside staff grooms and the like dont need to concern you and youll not have anything to do with anyone outside the house unless mrs york sends you on an errand youll have sunday mornings off to go to church youll eat in the servants hall with the rest of us i expect that dressll do you she looked at it without favor youve got caps and aprons of course i should think so if miss veronica wants them changed shell tell you i hope i dont need to remind you youll have no followers no gentlemen callers of any sort unless youve a father or brother in which case if you ask permission i daresay theyll be allowed to see you at convenient times thank you maam emily could feel the walls tightening round her as if she were a prisoner no callers no admirers one half day off a fortnight how was she going to keep in touch with charlotte and jack well dont stand there girl mrs crawford rose and smoothed her apron briskly her keys jangling at her waist she led the way out moving like a little rodent with busy jerky steps in the laundry she patted and touched things showing emily coppers for boiling linen bins of soap starch ironing tables flatirons and airing rails all the time clicking her tongue over the absence of joan upstairs emily was shown veronica yorks bedroom it was cool green and white with touches of yellow like a spring field and her dressing room had cupboards full of clothes all fashionable and of high qualitybut nothing in pink let alone cerise upstairs on the servants floor she was led to a small room about one fifth the size of her own at home bare but for an iron bedstead with a tickingcovered mattress gray blankets and a pillow one small cupboard and a table with a basin on it no pitcher under the bed was a plain white china chamber pot the ceiling sloped so that in only half of the room could she stand upright and the dormered window had thin unlined brown curtains the linoleum on the floor was like ice to the touch there was one small rag mat by the bedside her heart sank it was clean and cold and infinitely grim compared with home how many girls had stood in doorways like this with tears welling up inside them knowing there was no possible escape and this was the best they could hope for not the worst thank you mrs crawford she said huskily alberts put your box there you unpack it and when miss veronica ringsshe pointed to the bell emily had not noticed beforeyoull go down and attend to her dressing for dinner shes out now or id have taken you to her yes mrs crawford and the next minute she was alone it was ghastly all she had was a box of clothes a narrow bed as hard as a bench three blankets to keep warm no fire no water except what she fetched for herself to put in that basin and no light but for one candle in a chipped enamel holder and she was at the beck and call of a woman she had never met jack was right she must have lost her wits if only he had forbidden her if only aunt vespasia had begged her not to do it but jack was not worried about her loneliness the bare floor the cold bed the chamber pot the strip wash in one basin of water or the obedience to a bell he was afraid because someone had committed murder in this house twiceand emily was an intruder who had come to try and catch the murderer she sat down on the bed her legs shaking the springs creaked she was cold and her throat ached with the effort not to weep i am here to find a murderer she said to herself quietly robert york was murdereddulcie was pushed out of a window because she saw the woman in cerise and told thomas there is something terrible in this house and i am going to find out what it is thousands of girls tens of thousands all over the country live like this if they can do it so can i i am not a coward i do not run away just because things are frightening and certainly not because they are unpleasant they are not going to beat me before ive even begun at half past five the bell rang and after straightening her cap in front of the piece of mirror on the mantel shelf and retying her apron emily went down to meet veronica york carrying the candle on the landing she knocked on the bedroom door and was told to go in she did not glance at the room she had seen it before and curiosity would not do and indeed her real interest was in veronica herself yes maam veronica was sitting on the dressing stool in a white robe tied at the waist her black hair falling loose like satin ribbons down her back her face was pale but the bones were beautiful her eyes large and dark as peat water at the moment her fragile skin was a little blue around the slender nose and across her high cheeks and she was definitely too thin for current fashion she would need a bustle to plump out those narrow hips and swathes to make her bosom look fuller but emily had to admit she was a beautiful woman with the qualities of delicacy and character that haunt the mind far longer than mere regularity of feature there was passion in her face and intelligence im amelia maam mrs york employed me this afternoon suddenly veronica smiled and all her color returned it was like illumination in a gray room yes i know i hope youll like it here amelia are you comfortable yes thank you maam emily lied bravely what she had been given was all a maid could expect will you be dressing for dinner maam yes please the blue gown i think edith put it in the first cupboard yes maam emily went through to the dressing room and brought back a royal blue velvet and taffeta gown cut low with balloon sleeves it took her a few moments to find the right petticoats and lay them out yes thats right thank you veronica agreed would you like your hair done before your gown maam it was the way emily herself dressedit was so easy to drop a hair or a pin a smudge of powder or a perfume stain yes veronica sat still while emily took the brush then polished the long shining hair with a silk scarf it was lovely thick and dark as a moonless sea had jack looked at it with such admiration she forced that idea away this was no time to tease herself with jealousies you will find we are a little behind veronica said interrupting her thoughts emily saw her shoulders stiffen and the muscles pull across the back of her neck i am afraid my previous maid hada terrible accident emilys hand with the comb stopped in the air oh she had decided to affect ignorance none of the servants had told her and the sort of person she was pretending to be would never have read about the accident im sorry maam that must have been distressing for you was she hurt badly the answer was very quiet im afraid she was killed she fell out of the window dont worry it wasnt the room you are in emily saw veronicas eyes on her in the mirror deliberately she put on an expression of surprise and sympathy knowing she must be careful not to overact oh thats terrible maam the poor creature well ill be very careful i dont like heights anyway never did she began coiling veronicas hair and pinning it sweeping it away from her temples at any other time she would have enjoyed the task but now she was nervous she must look skilled they had to believe this was her profession how did it happen maam it would be only natural to ask veronica shivered i dont know no one does nobody saw it happen did it happen at night then no it was in the evening we were all at dinner how awful for you emily said with what she hoped sounded more like compassion than curiosity i hope you didnt have guests maam yes we did but fortunately they left before we discovered what had happened emily did not probe any further she would be able to find out from one of the other servants who the guests had been although she was prepared to wager one had been julian danver what a terrible time youve had she curled the last strand of hair and put in the pins is that comfortable maam veronica turned her head one way and then the other in front of the glass youve done that very well amelia its not how i usually wear it but i think its an improvement emily was greatly relieved oh thank you maam veronica stood up and emily helped her into the petticoats and then the gown fastening it carefully veronica looked very striking indeed but emily was uncertain whether a compliment might be considered too familiar she decided against it after all a maids opinion hardly mattered there was a sharp rap on the door and almost before veronica had said come in it opened and loretta york elegant in lavender silk embroidered in black and silver swished in regarding veronica up and down critically she appeared not even to see emily you look pale for goodness sake pull yourself together my dear we have a duty to do the family deserves our best courtesy as well as the guests your fatherinlaw will be expecting us we do not wish him to think we crumble to pieces because of some domestic tragedy he has enough to concern himself with what happens at home is our affair and we must protect him from any disturbances a man has a right to a calm and wellordered home she looked at veronicas hair carefully people do die death is the inevitable end of life and you are not some tuppenny bourgeoise to fall into the vapors at the first affliction now pinch a little color into your face and come downstairs veronicas body stiffened the blue silk tightening as the line of her jaw hardened into a sharp angle i have quite as much color as usual motherinlaw i do not wish to look as if i have a fever lorettas face froze i am thinking of your welfare veronica she said icily i always have your good in mind which you will realize if you think back the words were reasonable even kind but her voice cut like a knife veronica grew paler and she spoke with difficulty i am aware of that motherinlaw emily was transfixed the emotion was so strong she could feel it prickling her skin and yet the issue was so slight sometimes i wonder if it slips your mind loretta did not alter her fixed gaze i want your future happiness and security my dear dont ever forget that veronica swiveled her throat jerking with the effort i never never forget what you do for me she whispered i will always be here my dear loretta promisedor in the hot motionlessness of this room was this a veiled threat always then as emilys paralyzed figure caught the corner of her vision what are you staring at girl she asked her voice stung like a sudden slap be about your business emily leapt to attention and the dressing robe slid from her hands to the floor she bent and picked it up clumsily fingers stiff yes maam she almost ran from the room her face burning with frustration and embarrassment for having been caught eavesdropping the words had been so ordinary any mother and daughterinlaw might have exchanged them but there had been no lightness or ease in the air it was charged with multiple layers of meaning and emily felt with a crawling electricity under her skin that beneath it all was an immense hatred emily took her first meal in hanover close in the servants hall at a large table presided over by redditch the butler he was in his midforties and just a trifle pompous but his face had such an inoffensive air of slight surprise about it that she could not dislike him it was late by the time the meal had been served in the dining room found satisfactory and cleared away the scullery was filled with dirty dishes at the foot of the table sat the cook who was still solicitous since emily was a newcomer but there was no doubt that motherly concern would be quickly replaced by motherly discipline should emily speak out of turn or fall short in her duty mrs crawford the housekeeper was dressed in black bombazine with an immaculate lacetrimmed cap more elaborate than the one she had worn previously she was very much on her dignity she obviously considered herself the mistress in any other part of the house and only tolerated the cooks supremacy here because mrs melrose was so immediately concerned with preparing the meal throughout the conversation mrs crawford made sharp little remarks reminders of rank edith the other ladys maid apparently felt recovered enough to come to the table she was in her midthirties plump and sullen her black hair still shiny but her country complexion dulled with two decades of london fog and soot and too little air whatever her indisposition and although she seemed ill pleased with the food she managed to eat all of it and came back for second helpings of the bread cheese and pickles which was all there was offered the main meal having been eaten at luncheon emily had the strong suspicion that edith was more lazy than unwell and she determined to find out why the disciplinarian mrs york tolerated her she spent what was left of the evening in the servants hall listening to scraps of conversation and learning all she could which was little enough because they spoke mainly of their own affairs domestic matters the tradesmen and their shortcomings and the general decline of the national character as exhibited by other peoples servants and the standards of households in general edith sat next to the fire and sewed a chemise and the mystery of her employment was solvedshe was an exquisite needlewoman idle and ungracious she might be but there was genius in her fingers her needle flashed in and out drawing the gleaming silk behind it and flowers took shape under her hand delicate as gossamer and perfectly proportioned emily glanced at her work and saw the reverse was almost indistinguishable from the top she realized that she might well be expected to pull ediths weight in fetching and carrying and she would have to do it without complaint or she would be replaced girls who would run errands were two a penny since the coming of machinery and the consequent disappearance of hundreds of home crafts the traditional occupations for women no longer existed tens of thousands of them poured in from the country to take domestic service most of them with nothing to offer but willingness and the need to survive girls who could stitch like edith were worth their weight in gold it was a lesson to be remembered fanny the tweeny who was only twelve was sent to bed at half past nine so she could be up at five to clean out the grates and polish the brasses she went with a halfhearted complaint made more from habit than any hope she would be reprieved and prim the scullery maid followed fifteen minutes later for similar reasons and with a similar complaint on with you the housekeeper said sharply quick sticks up them stairs girl or youll be late in the morning yes mrs crawford gnight gnight mr redditch good night came the automatic reply i know there is a big dinner party tomorrowwill there be many guests emily asked as casually as she could twenty nora replied we dont do very big parties here but we have some important people she sounded a little defensive she looked at emily coldly prepared to counter any slight should it be offered we used to ave more mary said looking up from the mending she was doing afore mr robert was killed thatll do mary the cook said quickly we dont want to talk o things like that youll be givin them girls bad dreams again emily deliberately misunderstood i love parties i love to see the ladies all dressed up not parties the housekeeper said crossly talking about death you cant be expected to know amelia but mr robert died terrible ill caution you to hold your tongue about it you go tattling all over the place and upsetting people and youll have no position in this house and no character to take with you now you go upstairs and put out miss veronicas things for the night an make sure you got your tray set for the morning you can come down here again for cocoa at half past nine emily sat motionless her temper rising her eyes met the housekeepers and she saw the start of surprise in them maids do not question their orders least of all new maids it was her first mistake yes mrs crawford she said demurely her voice thick with anger both at herself and at being subjected to discipline uppity that girl mrs crawford said as emily was almost out of the door you mark my words mrs melrose uppity can see it in her eyes and the way she walks got airs that one shell come to no goodi can always tell emilys first night in hanover close was wretched the bed was hard and the blankets thin she was used to a fire and a feather quilt and thick velvet curtains over the windows these curtains were plain cloth and she could hear the sleet lashing against the glass until sometime in the shivering darkness when it froze and turned to snow then there was silence thick strange and penetratingly cold she hunched up her knees but she could not get warm enough to sleep finally she got up the air so bitter that the touch of her gown against her skin made her wince she swung her arms sharply but was too tense to succeed in warming herself instead she put her towel on top of the bed and then the mat from the floor over that and climbed back in this time she slept but it seemed only moments before there was a sharp rap on the door and the tweenys pale little face came round it time to get up miss amelia for a moment emily could not think where on earth she was it was cold and the room was stark she saw iron bedposts and a heap of gray blankets and the floor mat over her the curtains were still closed then with a rush of misery it all came back to her the whole absurd situation she had got herself into fanny was staring at her you cold miss im freezing emily admitted ill tell joan shell find you another blanket youd better get up its near seven oclock and youll ave ter get yerself ready then make miss veronicas tea and fetch it up and draw er bath she usually likes to be up by eight an if nobody told yer edithll probly sleep in an youll ave ter make mrs yorks tea too and draw er bath maybe emily threw the bedclothes off and plunged out her body shaking the floor without the mat was like dry ice does edith often skive off she asked with chattering teeth she pulled open the curtains to let in the light oh yes fanny answered matteroffactly dulcie always did alf er work as i spec you will too if you stay its worf it anyway if miss veronica likes you shell probly take you wif er when she marries mr danver an then youll be all right she smiled and her eyes moved up to look at the gray sky through the window maybe youll get ter meet someone real niceandsome an kindwhat as is own shop maybe and fall in love she let the thought hang in the air beautiful and bright as a bubble too precious to touch emily felt tears prickling her eyes she turned away but she was too cold to stop dressing nor was there time is miss veronica going to get married how exciting whats he like mr danver i expect hes welltodo fanny let the dream go and came back to reality lor miss i dunno nora says e is but then she would got eyes for the gentlemen she as my ma used ter say all parlormaids as fancies theirselves rotten what was mr robert like emily put on her apron and reached for a brush to untangle her hair and pin it up i dunno miss e died afore i come ere of courseshe was only twelve she would have been nine when robert york was murdered stupid question fanny was not to be deterred mary says e was ever so goodlooking and a real gentleman never tried it on like some gentlemen do and lovely spoken e liked nice rings dressed a treat but not showy like in fac she says e was the best gentleman she ever saw she thought the world of im o course i fink she eard it all from the front servants like er being scullery maid then devoted to miss veronica e was an she to im she sighed and looked down at her plain gray stuff dress terrible sad im bein killed like that fair broke er eart she wept suffink wicked poor soul i reckon as ooever done it should be topped but nobody never caught im she sniffed fiercely id like to find someone asd love me like that she said then sniffed again she was a realist and half of her knew it would always be a fantasy but it was precious in the long day of practicalities she needed to let go for a moment and permit the mind to take wing even the remotest chance was infinitely cherished emily thought of george with a vividness she had learned to avoid for months now a year ago her life had seemed so safe and here she was shaking with cold in an attic at seven in the morning dressed in plain blue stuff and listening to a twelveyearold tweeny pour out her dreams yes she said honestly it would be the best thing imaginable but dont run off with thinking that it only happens to ladies some of them cry themselves to sleep too you dont see all that happens and some people youd never think of can find happiness dont give up fanny you mustnt give up fanny wiped her nose on a rag from her apron pocket youre a caution miss dont let mrs crawford ear you say that she dont approve o girls wif ideas says its bad for em unsettles em like she says appiness comes from knowing yer place an keepin to it im sure she does emily said she dashed the cold water from the bowl onto her face and snatched the towel from the bed to rub it dry it hurt her skin but at least the roughness made her blood sing i gotta be goin fanny said turning to the door i only done alf me grates and berthall be arter me to elp er wi ve tea leaves tea leaves emily did not know what she meant on the carpet fanny stared at her the tea leaves on the carpet to clean it afore the master and mistress comes down mrs crawfordll ave me if i dont get on and with a note of real fear in her voice she scuttled away emily heard her rapid feet along the uncarpeted passage and down the stairs the day was an endless whirl of one task after another emily began by cutting fine bread and butter and taking a tea tray to veronica pulling back the curtains inquiring for instructions for bathing and dressing then she did the same for loretta and suddenly felt idiotically nervous her fingers fumbled and she nearly spilled the tea the cup rattled and for a moment she was afraid she was going to knock it over the curtains stuck and she had to yank them and her heart stopped as she had visions of the whole rail coming down on top of her she felt lorettas eyes boring two holes in her back but when she turned round loretta was busy with her bread and butter and had no interest in her whatsoever would you like me to draw your bath maam she asked certainly loretta did not look up edith has already put out my morning dress you can come back in twenty minutes yes maam she said and excused herself as hastily as she could when both the ladies were bathed and dressed edith deigned to put in an appearance so emily had only veronicas hair to do after which she was permitted to hurry down to the kitchen and take her own snatched breakfast then she was required to go back upstairs and help libby the upstairs maid with turning out the bedrooms each room had to be aired thoroughly and before this could be done the cheval glasses must be laid down so the draft could not knock them over and break them then in the freezing wind from the open sashes they turned the bottom mattresses plumped up the middle ones and thoroughly kneaded and pummeled the top feather ones till they were as light as souffles finally they remade the beds the carpets were rolled and taken downstairs to be beaten only once a fortnight and thank heavens it was not today this time they only swept the carpets dusted every surface emptied and washed all the basins and chamber pots cleaned the baths thoroughly and laid out fresh towels by the time they were finished emily was tired and dirty her hair had fallen out of its pins and mrs crawford caught her on the stairs and told her that she looked a disgrace she had better smarten herself up if she wished to remain emily was on the point of retaliating that if mrs crawford had done a hands turn herself she would also look a little untidy when she caught sight of veronica pale and tightfaced she was walking quickly away from loretta and the butler with the morning newspapers freshly ironed going across the hall towards the dining room yes mrs crawford emily said obediently remembering why she was there she was so thirsty she could taste feathers in her mouth and her back was stiff from bending and lifting but she would not be defeated by a housekeeper this was the only place to discover who had killed robert york and whyand who had pushed poor dulcie out of the window to her death already she had learned more about the characters of the two women than she could have in a month of social visiting it was loretta not veronica who slept in shell pink satin sheets with pillowcases embroidered in selfcolored silks either veronica was happy with linen or she had not been offered anything else it was loretta who had the expensive oil of musk perfumes in crystal and lalique bottles with silver filigree stoppers veronica was more beautiful by natures gift with her slender height and grace and those haunting eyes but it was loretta who was the more elegantly feminine she bothered with the details of care the perfume in the handkerchief and in the petticoats to waft to the nostrils as she moved or passed the taffeta to rustle and whisper as she walked the many pairs of boots and slippers to match every gown and be shown in a glimpse under her skirts had veronica not thought of these things or did their subtlety elude her was there some reason for this difference that emily did not yet understand there was obviously a strong emotional bond between the two women although its exact nature still eluded emily loretta seemed protective guarding the younger and seemingly weaker woman after the grief of her widowhood yet at the same time her patience was thin and she was highly critical and veronica resented her motherinlaw while appearing to depend upon her a great deal when they changed for luncheon after the mornings outing emily was busy taking care of wet coats and soiled skirts humping them back and forth to be dried out brushed off sponged and pressedand she had both to do since edith was missing again she overheard a sharp exchange as veronicas voice rose and lorettas remained calm and cold in what was seemingly a warning emily tried to overhear but just as she was about to bend to the keyhole the upstairs maid came by and she was obliged to continue with her duties luncheon in the servants hall was called dinner and emily was caught out in misnaming it and received a curious look from the cook think youre upstairs do you my fine lady the housekeeper said tartly well therell be no giving yourself airs down here and youd best remember it youre just the same as the rest of the girls in fact youre not as good until you prove yourself oh maybe some gentleman acquaintance of miss veronicall take a fancy to er an shell become a duchess nora pulled a face ceptin you need to be a parlormaid to meet dukes and you avent got the looks for it you arent tall enough for a start an you avent got the colorin either peaked you are i dont suppose there are enough dukes to go around anyway emily snapped back since even parlormaids have to wait till all the ladies are suited well ive a sight more chance than you ave nora retorted at least i know my job i dont ave to ave a tweeny show me ow to do it duchess edith giggled thats a fine name for er walks with er ead in the air like she already got a tiara on an was afraid it might slip over er nose she made a mock curtsy dont wobble yer ead yer grace thats enough the butler said with a frown of disapproval shes done most of your work this morning you should be obliged to her maybe thats whats wrong with you edith was busy with mending and shes not strong mrs crawford gave redditch a look of irritation which would have quelled anyone less than a butler youve no call to pick on her edith is bone idle and wouldnt be kept if she wasnt the best seamstress in the city redditch replied quickly but his reproach was robbed of some of its bite by the slightly wary air with which he immediately followed it ill thank you to attend to your own responsibilities mr redditch the maidservants are mine and ill look after them my own way which suits mrs york well enough well it doesnt suit me mrs crawford to see girls lowering themselves to make mock of each other and if i hear it again someonell have their notice well see who has their notice mr redditch mrs crawford said darkly you mark my words itll be them as can best be replaced that seemed to be the end of the matter for the time being but emily glancing at their faces knew that battle lines had been drawn and the exchange would not be forgotten she had made enemies of both edith and nora and the housekeeper would be happy to catch her in any shortcoming from now on if she wanted to survive she would have to cultivate the butlers regard till her position became a matter of his pride as well the afternoon was dreadful emily had superintended her own maid often enough and had imagined she knew her duties but watching someone use a flatiron on lace ruffling was a very different thing from doing it oneself and it was much more difficult than she had thought the only good thing about it was that she did not scorch anything so it was possible for joan to rescue her and the outcome was a debt to joan emily had no break all afternoon not even for a cup of tea and finally rushed upstairs at half past five exhausted her head throbbing back aching and feet pinched in the unfamiliar boots barely in time to help veronica change for the dinner party after receiving several callers for tea veronica seemed tired also and more nervous than emily could understand she was not the hostess the responsibility for the dinners success rested with her motherinlaw so all she had to do was be charming nevertheless she changed her mind three times about which gown to wear was dissatisfied with her hair and when emily had taken it all down and put it back up again she still did not feel confident she stood in front of the cheval glass and frowned at her reflection emily was exhausted her mind crowded with thoughts of how selfish this woman was she had done nothing whatsoever all day except visit eat and chatter while emily had worked like a trojan missed afternoon tea and been picked on and jeered at and all veronica could think of was to tell emily to take her hair down yet again and do it a third time it becomes you very well the first way maam emily only barely controlled the tone of her voice veronica picked up the perfume bottle and it slipped through her fingers splashing perfume down the front of her skirt emily could have wept now the whole thing had to be changedthere was no possible alternative and on top of that she did not know how to get rid of the stain and would have to ask edith who would crow over her ignorance almost certainly letting mrs crawford know about it and probably the rest of the staff she did not trust herself to speak it was only when she was in the dressing room fetching a fourth gown that she realized that she herself often gave no more thought to her own maids feelings than veronica was doing now back in the bedroom with the fresh gown she saw veronica sitting on the bed in her petticoats and chemise her head low her hair fallen forward she looked very slight her shoulders almost childlike and painfully vulnerable this was an acutely private moment did anyone else ever see her like this without the glamor and the confidence emily wanted to put her arms round her she looked so bitterly alone she too understood widowhood in the shadow of murder but she knew that would be impossible there was a gulf between them at least from veronicas side dont you feel very well maam she said gently i can get you a tisane if you like as lovely as you are no one will mind if you are a minute or two late come down after the other ladies and cause a bit of a flutter veronica looked up and emily was surprised to see the gratitude in her face she smiled faintly thank you amelia yes i would like a tisane i can drink it while youre doing my hair it took five minutes for emily to sort through the ingredients available and select a soothing camomile and another three for the kettle to boil after which she had to carry the herb tea back upstairs she met mrs crawford in the hall what are you doing down here amelia an errand for mrs york emily replied tartly and whisking her skirts around the corner of the stairpost she went up without looking back she heard mrs crawford snort and the muttered words well see about you miss but she could not take time to worry over it now veronica greeted her with pleasure and sipped the tisane as if it were indeed a life restorer she made no demur when emily put her hair up as she had the first time and helped her on with the fourth gown black taffeta stitched with beads it was very dramatic and on a less beautiful woman it would have been overwhelming you look marvelous maam emily said sincerely there wont be a man in the room has eyes for anyone else veronica blushed the first color in her cheeks emily had seen all day thank you amelia dont flatter me or youll make me immodest a little confidence doesnt do any harm emily picked up the stained gown to take it away she would have to attend to the stain immediately perhaps joan would help her she had just got through the dressing room door and was turning to close it when she heard the bedroom door open and saw loretta come in she was wearing dove gray and silver and looked very feminine good gracious her eyebrows rose when she saw veronica do you really think thats suitable it is most important you impress the french ambassador favorably my dear especially in front of the danvers veronica drew a deep breath and let it out slowly emily could see her hand clench in the folds of her skirt yes i think its perfectly suitable she said unsteadily mr garrard danver is an admirer of elegant clothes he does not care for the ordinary lorettas face colored deeply then the blood drained away as you wish her voice was tight but i dont know why you are so late you came up in plenty of time is your new maid no good shes perfectly goodin fact shes excellent i changed my mind about what i was wearing it wasnt amelias fault a pity you were probably better advised the first time still its too late now is that a tisane cup yes there was a moments silence then lorettas voice came quietly with an edge to it but remaining perfectly controlled she had moved slightly so emily could no longer see her face veronica you must not start giving in to nerves it is a selfindulgence you cannot afford if you are ill we will call the doctor otherwise you must exercise a little discipline put a smile on your face and come downstairs you are already close to being late it wont do there was silence emily pulled the door open an inch wider but dared do no more in case the movement caught lorettas eye im perfectly ready veronica said at last no you are not being ready is more than having your gown on and your hair done veronica her voice sank lower and there was an urgency in it you must have your mind prepared as well you are going to marry julian danver dont give anyone cause to doubt your happiness least of all julian himself or his family smile no one likes a sulky or nervous womanwomen are expected to add to a mans comfort and pleasure to be easy company not a strain and no one willingly marries a woman whose health is not robust we hide our petty complaints courage and dignity are expected of usin fact they are required sometimes i hate you veronica said so softly emily only just heard her but with a passion that made her skin crawl and that too loretta answered with stonelike calm is a selfindulgence you cannot afford my dear any more than i can perhaps it would be worth it veronica said between her teeth oh think again my dear think again loretta answered her softly then quite suddenly her voice changed and became rasping choked with fury pull yourself together and stop your weak stupid whining i can only carry you so far then you must look after yourself i have done everything for you that i can and it has not been as easy for me as you sometimes seem to think there was a rustle of skirts then the outer door opened and emily heard an entirely new voice a mans intelligent and individual are you ready my dear its time we went to greet our guests that must be piers york the only person in the house emily had not met veronica you look quite ravishing thank you papainlaw veronicas voice shook even with those few words i am quite aware of the time piers loretta said briskly no trace of her previous emotion remaining she had transformed it into a slight irritation at being checked up on i was reminding veronica she has a new maid and new maids always take a little longer oh has she he said mildly dont think ive seen her no reason why you should loretta answered you have enough to do without organizing the servants veronica was disposed to argue it wasnt amelias fault it was mine i changed my mind a costly thing to do there was warning under lorettas polite comment and veronica must know that as much as emily only piers was seemingly unaware of it nonsense my dear ladys privilege this time loretta did not argue again she changed her tone becoming courteous and familiar oh veronica and i know each other very well we have shared much grief so i assure you my dear we have no misunderstandings she knows exactly what i mean come it is past time we were downstairs our guests are due and the hollingsworths at least are never late most tedious i think theyre all rather tedious he said frankly i dont know why we keep on having them here cant see that its necessary the rest of the evening was miserable the kitchen was chaotic as the cook superintended the finishing and serving of a dozen different dishes mary was frantic with pastries gravies sauces and puddings redditch was busy in the cellars and the dining room where john was and albert kept rushing back and forth nora was primped up and sweeping around with her skirts swishing her apron so white and full of lace it looked like a breaking sea as she ordered the housemaids around imperiously prim was up to her elbows in the sink trying to get a start on the washing up at least the saucepans but as soon as she finished one pile another descended on her everyones temper was short and any supper was to be snatched as the opportunity arose only cold game pie being availableabout the last thing emily felt like eating it was not part of her duty but emily helped with the clearing up washing and polishing glasses and putting away extra silver and plates she could not comfortably go to bed leaving mary prim and albert with that monstrous pile and she needed as many allies as she could earn mrs crawford was now unalterably an enemy since the butler had made his regard unfortunately plain nora was jealous and kept referring to emily as the duchess and edith made no secret of her contempt it was quarter to one the wind whining outside and seeking every crack in the windows and every open door to send daggerlike drafts sleet battered against the glass when emily climbed the last bare flight of the attic stairs and crept into her small icy room there was only a candle to light it and the bed was so cold it felt wet to the touch she took off her outer clothes and pulled on her nightgown over all her underwear then turned back the blankets and slid into bed she was so cold she was shaking and the tears came to her eyes in spite of all her determination she rolled over burying her face in the frozen pillow and cried herself to sleep for once charlotte managed to contain both her astonishment and her anxiety when she heard from jack radley about emilys extraordinary decision to disguise herself and go to the yorks in service fortunately jack had called early in the afternoon so she had had plenty of time to recover her composure by the time pitt returned home a little after six consequently he knew nothing about it and assumed in contented ignorance that emily was sitting at home where all society and pitt himself expected her to be he was deeply distressed over the death of the maid dulcie not only because he had liked her but because he felt guilty it was unreasonable and he told himself so she might very well have fallen out of her window accidentally and the whole matter was merely one of the numerous domestic tragedies that happen every year but he could not seem to shake the fear that had she not told him about the strange woman in the house and the missing jewels and had he not been careless enough to listen to her with the library door open then she would still be alive at first he did not mention her death to ballarat sure that he would dismiss it as the yorks misfortune and no business of pitts and he did not want to run the risk that ballarat would actually forbid him to look into it but as he thought more and more about the woman in cerise pitt became convinced he must pursue her identity before he could give any answer to the foreign office regarding veronica yorks reputation and her suitability to marry a rising diplomat his determination to keep quiet weakened when ballarat sent for him two days later he was caught mentally on the wrong foot well pitt you dont seem to have accomplished much in the york case ballarat began critically he was standing by the fire warming the backs of his legs a malodorous cigar burned in the stone ashtray on his desk there was a small bronze lion beside it rampant one paw in the air pretentious ass pitt thought angrily i was doing quite well until my principal witness was killed he said aloud and instantly knew he had been unwise ballarats face darkened the blood ruddying his cheeks he rocked backwards and forwards on his feet very slightly his hands behind his back he blocked most of the heat from the rest of the room with wet boots and trouser legs pitt would have welcomed the warmth witness to what for heavens sake ballarat demanded irritably are you trying to tell me youve uncovered some scandal about the yorks after all and the man who might have betrayed them has died no im not pitt retorted im talking about murder its none of the polices business if they all had lovers thats their own affair but robert yorks death was murder and that was our responsibility to clear up and we havent yet for heavens sake man ballarat interrupted him that was three years ago and we did our best some thief broke in and poor york caught him in the act the wretch will have disappeared into the slums he came from he might even be dead himself by now your trouble is youre not man enough to admit failure even when its obvious to everyone else he glared at pitt daring him to argue pitt rose to the bait and if it was an inside job he said rashly a friend turned amateur thief or someone in the house who was in debt and stealing it wouldnt be the first time or what if veronica york had a lover and it was he who murdered her husband do you want to know about that or assuming it was julian danver would the foreign office rather we covered it up a series of expressions chased over ballarats face first sheer horror then anger and confusion then fear as he understood the full implications of the last possibility he would be caught between two masters the foreign office who had ordered the inquiry and the home office who were in charge of the police and justice either one could easily ruin his career he was furious with pitt as the instigator of such a dilemma pitt saw this as quickly as ballarat and took a distinct and deep satisfaction from it even as he realized that ballarat would make him the butt of his otherwise impotent anger damn you pitt you incompetent interfering he searched for an adequate word and failing to find it began again you idiot thats aa totally irresponsible suggestion and the yorks not to mention the danvers will sue you for slander if you whisper one word of it to anyone shall we decline the case pitt asked sarcastically dont be insolent ballarat shouted then his duty towards the home office who were after all his employers reasserted itself ballarat controlled his temper with an effort what conceivable grounds have you for making such an appalling suggestion this time pitt was less prepared and ballarat saw the second of hesitation with victory in his eyes his body relaxed slightly becoming more jaunty and he resumed rocking on the soles of his feet still he blocked the fire glancing down at pitts wet legs with satisfaction pitt tried to organize his thoughts his reply must be unassailable no fence in london has handled or seen any of the goods he began no thief in the area has heard of them or knows of any strangers working the patch no one has seen anyone hiding up or running from a murder he saw ballarats face hover between belief and disbelief he was a climber a currier of favor and it was a long time since he had been personally involved in the investigation of a crime but he was neither ignorant nor stupid and although he profoundly disliked pitt deploring his manners and his social judgments he respected his professional skill the thief knew where to find a first edition among the other books in the library and yet has apparently not disposed of it and he left all the silver in the dining room pitt went on ive started looking in their social circle for anyone with debts he noticed ballarats alarm with satisfaction discreetly and ive got someone inquiring into yorks own affairs he added spitefully but the curious circumstance i was investigating was the appearance in the small hours of the morning of a glamorous and furtive woman in a cerise gowntwice at least in the york house prior to robert yorks death and also in the danver house again in the small hours of the morning and again wearing a startling shade of cerise and apparently not wishing to be seen the maid who described her at the yorks fell out of a window to her death the day after she spoke to me ballarat stopped rocking and remained motionless his round little eyes on pitts face veronica york he said slowly wouldnt this maid have recognized her i would have thought so pitt agreed she was the ladys maid but people see what they expect to see and it was only for a moment in the gaslight and the woman was dressed entirely differently from the slight description it could have easily been veronica same height and build same coloring damnation ballarat swore furiously i suppose it couldnt have been robert yorks mistress and mrs york knew nothing about her possibly but what was she doing in the danver house obviousdanvers sister shes a loose woman pitt raised his eyebrows who goes in for married diplomats first robert york now felix asherson ballarat scowled what about felix asherson what has he to do with it pitt sighed harriet danver is in love with him dont ask me how i know i do and i think its pretty unlikely she was the woman in cerise but if she was then the foreign office should know damn it pitt it could be this woman in cerise is just some daft relative who likes to dress up and creep about lots of families have their embarrassments a damn nuisance but no actual harm of course pitt agreed she may be just gently mad or she may be an expensive harlot who entertained robert york or conceivably his fatherhe saw ballarats face darken but he did not stopor julian danver or garrard danver and maybe dulcie mabbutt fell out of the window in a curiously timed domestic accident he held ballarats eyes or maybe the woman in cerise was a procurer or carrier of treason a blackmailer or a lover and she was working on robert york before she either murdered him herself or some of her colleagues did good godare you saying young danver was her master ballarat exploded no for once pitt could deny it honestly i dont see why he should need to be isnt he in the foreign office as well another traitor ballarats jaw set his cigar was crumbling away to little rings of ash unnoticed maybe all right all right ballarats voice rose find out who she was the security of the empire may be involved but if you want to keep your job pitt be discreet if youre clumsy i cant and wont protect you do you understand me clearly yes thank you sir pitt said with open sarcasm it was the first time he had called ballarat sir in years he had always managed to evade it without being downright rude my pleasure pitt ballarat replied showing his teeth my pleasure pitt left the bow street station and stepped out into a pea soup fog feeling savage and determined there was always charlotte and he would certainly rely upon her judgment as much as possible he had to admit now that he was glad she had been able to connive an invitation to the yorks and the danvers at least she might give him an informed opinion of veronica yorks character and whether she had been devastated by her husbands death or freed by it to marry julian danver if the latter were true then the woman had remarkable control to have waited a full three years and behaved throughout with such apparent decorum or had julian insisted upon that in order to keep his career all the same it was remarkable if there had been no indiscretion no selfindulgence in all that time especially if veronica had been the woman who dressed dramatically in cerise for her assignations or perhaps she still did and that had made waiting bearable for her the fog in the strand was so thick he could not see across to the opposite pavement it hung thick and yellowgray full of the fumes from thousands of smoking chimneys as the film suspended in the dampness rose up from the wide coils of the river that laced through the suburbs past chelsea the houses of parliament the embankment wapping and limehouse down to the pool of london greenwich and the arsenal and finally the estuary if cerise whoever she was had dressed as glamorously as dulcie said then she had not done it merely to flit around landings in the middle of the night she had gone out somewhere in public it was a disguise an alter ego for some woman who would be known in society or else she was a courtesan with whom neither the yorks nor the danvers would be seen by their own friends so where would she have been able to meet her lovers he stood on the curb as carriages hansoms and carts clopped by him slowly in the yellow mist looming suddenly and disappearing swallowed up the horses only dark shapes and muffled sounds the road was slimy and more spattered with dung than usual this was the sort of weather when crossing sweepers got knocked over sometimes even killed there was a onelegged sweeper in piccadilly who had lost his limb that way pitt knew there were hotels restaurants and theaters where such assignations could be kept places where if a gentleman saw an acquaintance both men would have enough tact to overlook the meeting neither wishing it referred to these places were dotted round the borders of fashionable london in the haymarket leicester square piccadilly he knew where to find them and the touts and doormen to ask cabbie he shouted into the street catching his breath as the fog threatened to choke him making him cough cabbie a hansom slowed up and stopped harness dripping horses head down drivers voice disembodied in the gloom haymarket pitt requested and climbed in it was the following day the fog still clamped heavily over the city acrid in the throat sharp to the nose before he found his first success he was in a private hotel a little off jermyn street near piccadilly the doorman was a richly mustached exsoldier with liberal ideas on morality and an injury from the second ashanti war which prevented him from doing any physical labor he was also illiterate which precluded any clerical work he was quite amenable to answering pitts questions for a consideration ballarat had been very little help with information or influence but he had given pitt as much financial license as he could youre goin back a bit guv the doorman said cheerfully but sure i remember er right andsome she was an always wore them sort o colors looks wicked on most people but suited er summink marvelous black air and dark eyes she ad an graceful as a swan tall woman not a lot o shape to er but she ad summink special all the same what sort of something pitt said curiously he wanted to know what this man thought his judgment even with his limited vocabulary his opinion would be worth a great deal he knew street women he watched them every night and he saw their clients too he would see them working and yet not be part of it few of them would fool him the man pulled a slight face as he considered quality he said at last she ad a quality about er never acted like she was ustling people anxious like it was always them as was after er she didnt give a cuss he shook his head it were moren that though it wereit were like she were doin it fer fun yeah thats itshe ad fun she never laughed not out loud she ad too much class for that but she were laughing inside like did you ever talk to her pitt pursued me he looked a little surprised no i never did she didnt say a lot and always spoke quiet like only saw er oh maybe alf a dozen times can you remember who she was with different blokes elegantshe liked em real elegant didnt like any scruff and money o course but then so do they all no one without a bit o real money comes ere he gave a short laugh can you describe any of them not sos youd know em again no he smiled try a little pitt pressed him you couldnt pay me that much guv you goin ter give me another job when they throw me out of ere an black me name pitt sighed he had known before he started that describing the woman was very different from being indiscreet about her clients clients had money position they expected privacy and no doubt bought it for a generous price selling the secrets of one would lose the trust of all all right he conceded be general old or young dark fair or gray what sort of height and build yer goin ter search all london guv i can eliminate a few the doorman shrugged if yer like well those as i can recall was older above forty dont think she took em fer the money dunno why but i ad the feelin she could afford ter pick and choose gray none i recalls an none eftyall on the slim side he moved closer to pitt look guv for all i know it could ave bin the same gent it dont pay me ter peer into their faces they comes ere discreetthats what they pays for like i said she could afford ter pick i always ad the feelin she was doin it fer fun did she always wear that color shades of it yeah it was likeer trademark why you so keen ter know about er anyway she aint bin ere in oh two or three years which two or three well if yer want it that precise guv three i reckon and youve not seen or heard of her since then come ter think of it no i avent his faced relaxed into a grin maybe she married well sometimes they do maybe shes a duchess sitting in some grand ouse by now ordering around the likes o you an me pitt pulled a face the chance was slight at best and they both knew it it was far more likely she had lost her looks by disease or assault in a fight with another prostitute or a pimp who felt he had been cheated a lover whose demands had become too perverted or possessive or that she had simply moved downmarket from a hotel such as this to a simple brothel he did not mention the possibility of treason or murder that would complicate the question unnecessarily the doorman looked at him closely why you after er guv she puttin the black on someone its a possibility pitt conceded its a definite possibility he took out one of his new cards and gave it to the man if you see her again tell me bow street police station just say youve seen cerise again that er name whats it worth itll do and its worth my goodwillwhich believe me is a lot better than my ill will you wouldnt pick on me just cause i aint seen someone i cant see er if she int ere an you wouldnt want lies now would yer pitt did not bother to answer what theaters and music halls do your clients patronize geez pitt waited the man bit his lip well if yere after er yer call cerise i eard she bin ter the lyceum an i suppose she tried the alls although dont ask me which ones cause i dunno pitts eyebrows rose the lyceum a lady of courage to ply her trade there i told yer she ad class yes you did thank you the man tipped his hat a little sarcastically thank you guv pitt left him and went out into the street again the fog wrapped round him again like a cold muslin damp and clinging to the skin so cerise had both courage and style she was certainly not veronica york on a mere affair with julian danver if it was veronica then she led a secret life of the sort to scandalize the foreign office to the core of its collective soul for a diplomat to have a wife who was a practicing prostitute of whatever price or degree of discrimination was impossible he would be dismissed instantly and ruined neither was she harriet danver pursuing her affair with felix asherson although he had never actually thought that charlotte had said harriet was in love as yet he had no knowledge of whether asherson returned her feelings but either way that answer offered no explanation as to why cerise should be in the york house no it seemed she was what he had first thought a woman who used her beauty and unusual quality of allure to trap and then blackmail her foreign office lovers for the secrets of their work robert york had refused either immediately or after some time and as a result either she herself or perhaps her accomplices had had to murder him to avoid betrayal it was getting dark and the fog was beginning to freeze the air filling with tiny pellets of ice which sent shivers through him as they crept into the folds of his muffler and touched his skin he began to walk briskly north into regent street then turned left towards oxford circus there were other people he could ask upmarket prostitutes who would know the competition and be able to tell him more about cerise where she plied her trade what clients she chose whether she only picked men who were of use to her and whether she was a real threat to the others by taking general business an hour later after some persuasive argument and the exchange of more money he sat in an overheated overfurnished little room off new bond street the woman in the pink chair opposite him was well past her prime her bosom overflowing from the strict corsets and loose flesh visible under her chin had lost its elasticity but she was still handsomer than most women ever are there was an ease about her from years of being desired but the bright bitterness in her eyes reflected the underlying knowledge that she had not been loved she picked at some candied fruit in a pink tissuelined box well she said guardedly what do you want luv it isnt my style to tell tales i dont want tales pitt did not waste his time or insult her with flattery they both knew he did not mean i want a woman who almost certainly tried putting on the black thats bad for your trade you dont need that sort she pulled a face and ate another piece of fruit nibbling all round the edges before putting the center whole into her mouth had her walk of life been different led to different dress less paint on her skin the hardness of survival out of her eyes and the small lines now clearly formed round the corners of her lips she might have been one of her generations great beauties the thought passed through pitts mind with irony and sadness as he watched her eat go on she prompted i dont need telling my business if i wasnt the best you wouldnt be ere asking me favors i dont need your money i earn more in a day than you do in a month pitt did not bother to remark that her risks were higher and her time short she knew it a woman who always wore a shade of cerise dark or light anything from plum to magenta always something that color she was tall and slender not much flesh on her but loads of style dark eyes and black hair have you ever seen her or heard your girls mention her doesnt sound like shed ave much to offer thin black air oh she had something pitt said with certainty and in spite of himself veronica yorks face with its high cheekbones and haunting eyes came back to his mind could she have been cerise and have killed robert when he discovered that he looked at the lush feminine woman in the pink chair opposite him with her glowing almost titian hair and her appleblossom skin she had fire and style he finished the womans eyes opened wide know er well did yer pitt smiled i never met her im going on the impression she made on others she gave a little laugh part derision and part genuine humor well if she put the black on people she was a fool thats a sure way ter kill business in the long run its suicide i dont know anything about er sorry luv pitt did not know if he was pleased or disappointed he had to find cerise and yet he did not want her to be veronica york are you sure he said automatically it may be three years back three years well why didnt yer say so she reached for another piece of fruit and bit into it she had beautiful teeth white and even i thought yer meant now there was one like that about three or four years ago terrible color she wore but she could carry it black air an eyes thin as a washboard need pounds of orse air to pad er out but she ad fire the sort that comes from inside yer cant get it out of a pot or in a glass all the champagne in london wouldnt give it yer lit up like she enjoyed erself every minute like she was avin the time of er life on the edge o danger and loved it mind she were a real beauty none o yer powder an paint jobs bones to break yer eart she ad pitt felt suddenly suffocated in this overstuffed room and at the same time there was a coldness inside him tell me more about her he said quietly how often did you see or hear of her where who with and have you any idea what happened to her the woman hesitated her eyes wary ill be very unpleasant if i have to pitt said levelly its murder ill turn over this entire place and make such a fuss none of your clients will dare come back all right she snapped angrily but there was no outrage in her that required the element of surprise and she had known the dangers too long and felt them too often for that all right i ant seen or eard of er in three years an only a few times before that she werent reglar in fact for what its worth its my opinion she werent professional anyway thats why i never took no trouble to find out more about er she werent no rival she didnt take genral trade just paraded around showed off and picked up one or two all in all she were good fer us cause she drew attention stirred up appetites and then left more for us did you see her with anyone you can remember its important she considered for several minutes and pitt did not hurry her seen er once with a real elegant gent goodlooker one of the other girls said shed seen er with im before because shed tried to pick im up erself but e ad eyes for cerise and no one else did you ever learn her name no anything about her no cept what i told yer all right you know the world and the business whats your best guess what sort of woman was she and what happened to her the woman laughed abruptly then the bitterness softened into pity for herself and all those who shared her lot even peripherally i dunno she said could be dead for all i know or more like come down in the world life in this business can be short ow the hell do i know what appened to er poor bitch she was different you said that so did the others who saw her whats your best guess as to where she came from come on alice i need to know and youve the best chance of being right she sighed my guess is she was quality out slumming it god knows why maybe she was just bent that way some is although why any woman thats got a roof over er ead and food for the rest of er life should want ter risk it is beyond me still i reckon insanity can it the quality like the rest of us now thats all i int got nothing else to add to it you ad your time i got things to do i bin moren fair an i ope youll remember that pitt stood up i will he promised as far as i know you keep a lodging house good day he spent two more days going from one place to another in the haunts of the demimonde the theaters and restaurants where such women plied their trade and he heard occasional mention of cerise or someone who might have been her or might not but he learned nothing that added to what he already knew no one remembered who she had been with whether it was several men or only a few although it was certainly more than one in every account no one knew her name nor where she came from she was tolerated because she came very seldom and robbed them of little business it was a hard world and they expected competition if a man preferred one woman to another there was nothing to be done about it except in extreme cases usually it was better to take defeat gracefully scenes embarrassed the clientele whether any of the men with her had been robert york it was impossible to say she frequented places where he was likely to have been but then so had half london society at least among the men the descriptions of her companions were general enough to have fit him or julian danver or garrard danver or even felix ashersonor just about anyone else with elegance and money in the early evening of the second day a little after six as the fog cleared at last leaving only a few dark pockets pitt took a cab to hanover close this time not to the york house but further along to where felix asherson lived pitt had chosen to see him at home in order to form a more complete impression of the man to make some judgment as to his circumstances and possibly his character away from the formal and rather intimidating atmosphere of the foreign office he might be more inclined to relax his caution in his own home he would feel safer and could be certain none of his colleagues would interrupt perhaps suspecting him of indiscreet disclosures to the police also inside the house pitt might form a more precise picture of his financial situation there was still the possibility that robert york had surprised a friend burgling his house and his recognition had sparked a murder pitt had not forgotten that possibility he knocked on the front door and waited till a footman came yes sir there was no expression in the polite inquiry pitt produced one of his cards thomas pitt i have a matter of some importance to discuss with mr asherson if he is free it concerns one of his colleagues at the foreign office that was literally true if not true in its implication yes sir will you come in sir and i will inform mr asherson you are here he looked at pitt dubiously his boots were not emilys new ones those were too good for all the walking he had been doing lately and he did not want to wear them out his jacket was serviceable but no more only his hat was of quality he was not library material the morning room was good enough for him if you will come this way sir the fire had died to a few embers but the room was still warm at least compared with the cab pitt had just taken he found the room pleasant enough modest compared with the yorks but agreeably furnished and with at least one good picture on the wall if asherson were short of money he could have sold it for enough to keep a housemaid for several years so much for debt the door opened and asherson came in his dark brows drawn together in a frown it was a handsome face but too volatile there was something uncertain about it pitt would not want to rely on this man in a crisis good evening mr asherson he said pleasantly sorry to disturb you at home but the matter is delicate so i thought it would be more private here than at the foreign office oh damn asherson pushed the door closed behind him are you still ferreting around after poor old yorks killer i told you before i didnt know anything remotely useful i still dont im sure you arent aware of knowing anything pitt agreed and what do you mean by that asherson was plainly annoyed i wasnt there that night and nobodys told me anything i know a great deal more than when i first spoke to you sir pitt said watching ashersons face the gas lamps threw shadows in the room exaggerating his expression as a yellow gleam highlighted the planes of his cheeks and nose and created darkness where sunlight would have eliminated it there was a woman who seems to have had a role in it ashersons eyes widened in yorks death you dont mean it was a woman burglar i didnt know there were such things there was nothing but surprise in his face the burglary may be incidental mr asherson possibly even the murder was too perhaps the only thing that really mattered was the treason asherson stood absolutely motionless not a muscle moved in his face or his body it was an unnatural stillness a silence that hung too long pitt could hear the hiss of the gas in the lamps on the wall and a slight sound as the coals settled in the hearth treason asherson said at last pitt did not know how far he dared stretch the truth he decided to evade an answer what was robert york working on before he was killed he asked again asherson hesitated if he said he did not know pitt would have to believe him africa he answered finally the er he bit bis lower lip gently the partition of africa between germany and britain or perhaps it would be more fortunate to phrase it as the division of spheres of influence pitt smiled i take the point is it confidential secret very there was a shadow of humor in his alarm perhaps at pitts ignorance good god if all the terms of a treaty wed accept were known to the germans in advance it would ruin our bargaining position but far far worse than that would be the impression it would make on the rest of the world particularly france if the french were to make our deliberations public the rest of europe would prevent us from making the agreement at all three years ago pitt reaffirmed watching his face oh yes its not a hasty negotiation its not all over in a few months you know there had been hesitation in his face a shadow of doubt or cunning there was a lie in it somewhere a deceit by implication if not in actual words pitt took a guess but he made it a statement rather than a question as if he already knew and some of this information has leaked through your negotiations have not been without difficulty yes asherson said slowly only odd piecesthey could even be educated guesses theyre not fools pitt knew what asherson was doing he was building escape routesbut for whom robert york was dead was asherson using him as a decoy for someone who was still alive himself cerise veronica one of the danvers when was the last instance in which this information might have been stolen and passed to the germans pitt asked i presume we can be certain it was not given to the french oh asherson was confused yes it certainly wasnt given to the french but the germans i dont know it isnt possible to say information like that may not be used for some time after it is received that was true but pitt believed it was also an evasion was asherson just naturally reluctant to trust anyone outside his own office or was he still protecting someone pitt tried approaching it from another direction it hasnt seriously impeded your negotiations no asherson agreed quickly as i said it could even be the natural ability of the germans it isnt the french that is certain then its hardly worth murdering over what not worth murdering to hide pitt repeated carefully asherson said nothing his lips tightened and he stared back across the lamplit room pitt waited no asherson said at last i think you must be mistaken it was a burglary that went wrong pitt shook his head no mr asherson that is one thing it was not if it wasnt treason then it was murder personal and intentional by someone who knew robert york again asherson waited men his face eased pitt could spot the exact moment the idea came to him you mean york was robbed by someone he knew some acquaintance who had been to the house and knew where to look for valuables no all they took amounted to barely a hundred pounds at best less by the time it would have been fencedwhich it wasnt fenced resold to a receiver of stolen goods wasnt it he said carefully can you know that yes mr asherson oh asherson looked down at the floor his face heavy with concentration the gaslight caught the curious gray of his eyes and the black lashes again pitt stood motionless allowing the silence to settle somewhere out in the hall a servants feet made a brisk sound on the parquet floor the sound died away again along the passage as a door thudded at last asherson reached his decision he faced pitt other information has gone missing he said very quietly more important information but none of it has ever been acted on by our enemies as far as we can tell god knows why not pitt was not surprised but it gave him no satisfaction he had still hoped he was wrong that some other explanation would present itself was this the whole truth yet or only part of it he looked at ashersons grim unhappy expression and believed at least this much was honest as far as it went and would you know he asked yes this time asherson did not hesitate yes papers that have been temporarily missing a copy replaced instead of the original dont ask me for anything more i cant tell you no doubt theyll use it when theyre ready pitt said flatly perhaps if they used it now youd know their source and theyre protecting him as long as hes useful asherson sank down onto the arm of one of the chairs sitting awkwardly this is awful i had hoped it was simply roberts carelessness but if he really was murdered over it then that doesnt seem reasonable god what a tragedy and none of it has gone since his death asherson shook his head have you seen a beautiful woman tall and slim with dark hair wearing an unusual shade of cerise asherson looked at him incredulously what a sort of hot bluish pink like magenta or cyclamen i know what color cerise is you fool he shut his eyes suddenly damn it im sorry no i havent seen her what the hell does that have to do with it it seems likely it was this woman who lured york into betrayal of his country pitt replied he may have been having an affair with her asherson looked surprised robert i never saw him take the slightest notice of any woman but veronica hehe just wasnt a womanizer he was very discriminating a quiet sort of man with excellent taste and veronica adored him it seems he was two men pitt said sadly he would not tell asherson that it could have been veronica herself in cerise if asherson had not thought of it it would not help and just in case asherson himself were the traitor no need to warn him of pitts closeness well hes dead now asherson stood up let the poor devil rest in peace you wont find your mysterious woman in hanover close im sorry i cant help you have helped mr asherson pitt said smiling bleakly thank you for your frankness sir good evening asherson did not reply but stepped back so pitt could pass him and go out of the door in the hall a footman appeared from the shadows and showed him to the step and the dark street beyond outside in the close the last fog had blown away in the north wind bitter as the pole and the stars were glittering in a sky barely marred by an occasional smear of smoke ice crackled underfoot in the frozen puddles and gutters pitt stepped out briskly in a tidier man it could almost have been called a march he climbed the immaculate porch steps of number two and pulled the brass bell when the footman opened the door he knew precisely what he was going to say and to whom good evening may i see mr york please i require his permission to speak to his staff about one of them who may have had knowledge of a crime it is most urgent er yes sir i spect you may the youth looked taken aback youd better come in library fires lit sir you can wait in there it was a few minutes until piers york came in his benign slightly quizzical face marked with an unusual frown what is it this time pitt not the damn silver again surely no sir he stopped hoping york would not press the point but he stood staring at pitt his eyebrows raised his eyes small and gray and intelligent there was no avoiding an answer treason and murder sir balderdash york said smartly i doubt the servants even know what treason is and they never leave this house except on their half days off which are only twice a month his eyebrows rose even higher or are you suggesting this treason took place here pitt knew he was on very dangerous ground all ballarats warnings jangled in his ears no sir i think an agent of treason may have visited your house unknown to you your maid dulcie mabbutt saw her others may have saw her yorks eyebrows shot up good god you mean a woman well dulcie cant help you poor child she fell out of one of the upstairs windows and died im sorry his face was pinched and sad pitt found it impossible to believe he was not genuinely grieved probably he knew nothing about any of itcerise or roberts or dulcies death he was a banker he alone of the men in the case had nothing to do with the foreign office and pitt could not imagine a spy wasting her energies on this wry rather charming man well into his sixties and he had too much innate humor to harbor the vanity necessary to be so ridiculous i know dulcie is dead pitt agreed but she may have confided to the other maids women do talk to each other where and when did dulcie see this woman of yours upstairs on the landing pitt replied in the middle of the night good heavens what on earth was dulcie doing out of her own room in the middle of the night are you sure she wasnt dreaming this womans been seen elsewhere sir and dulcies description was very good well go on man tall and slender with dark hair very beautiful and wearing a gown of a startling shade of fuchsia or cerise well i certainly havent seen her may i speak to some of your girls who might have been friendly with dulcie and then perhaps to the younger mrs york i believe dulcie was her maid i suppose soif its necessary thank you sir he spoke to the upstairs maid the downstairs maid the laundry maid the other ladys maid the kitchen maid the scullery maid and finally the tweeny but it seemed dulcie had been remarkably discreet and had kept total confidence on all that she saw of her mistresss household he wished she had been less honorable and yet there was a kind of bitter satisfaction in it virtue of any sort kept its sweetness whatever surrounded it he saved the questions about dulcies death for veronica if she was innocent it was cruel but he could not afford kindness now her motherinlaw was out the first stroke of good fortune pitt had had in some time and veronica received him in the boudoir i dont know how i can help you mr pitt she said gravely she was dressed in deep forest green which heightened her slightly ethereal quality she was pale her eyes shadowed as if she had slept badly and she remained standing some distance from him not facing him but staring at a goldframed seascape on the wall i see no purpose in going over and over the tragedies of the past nothing will bring my husband back and we dont care about the silver or the book we would much prefer not to be constantly reminded of it he hated what he was doing but he knew of no other way if he had pressed harder and been cleverer if he had solved it the first time dulcie would still be alive im here about dulcie mabbutt mrs york she turned quickly dulcie yes while she was in this house she saw something of great importance how did she die mrs york her gaze did not waver and she was so pale anyway he could detect no change in her aside from the distress he would have seen in almost anyone she leaned too far out of a window and lost her balance she replied did you see it happen noit was in the evening after dark perhaps in the daylightperhaps she would have seen what she was doing and it would not have happened why should she lean so far out of a window i dont know maybe she saw something someone in the dark she bit her lip perhaps she dropped something pitt did not pursue it the unlikeliness was obvious enough who was in the house that evening mrs york all the servants of course my parentsinlaw and dinner guestsperhaps dulcie was talking to one of the footmen or coachmen of the guests then they would have raised the alarm when she fell oh she turned away blushing at her foolishness of course who were your guests he knew the answer before she spoke mr and mrs asherson mr garrard danver and mr julian danver and the misses danver sir reginald and lady arbuthnott and mr and mrs gerald adair did any of the other ladies or you yourself wear a gown of a brilliant cerise or magenta color maam what her voice was barely a whisper and this time her face was so ashen the skin looked like wax a brilliant cerise or magenta he repeated it is a bluish pink the sort of color cinerarias grow she gulped and her lips formed the word no but no sound came from her throat dulcie saw a woman in such a dress mrs york upstairs in this house before he could finish she gasped and pitched forward onto the floor hands out to save herself knocking into the chair as she went he dived forward too late to catch her and half falling over the chair himself knelt down beside her she was completely unconscious her face ivory in the gaslight he uncrumpled her limbs and picked her up it was awkward because she was a deadweight but she was so slender there was hardly any substance to her he laid her on the sofa arranged her skirts to cover all but her feet then rang the bell almost yanking the cord from the wall as soon as the footman appeared pitt ordered him to get the ladys maid with some smelling salts his voice sounded rough even frightened he must steady himself there was a violence of emotion inside him he feared he had been too clumsy and had provoked the very scandal ballarat would pay any price to avoid anger at the loss of life pity for it a sense of betrayal because he had not wanted it to be veronica but surely the gay and daring cerise would not have crumpled into a faint at the first suspicion of the law the door opened and the ladys maid came in a pretty slight creature with fair hair and god almighty the breath hissed out between his teeth and pitt felt the room lurch a little round him also emily oh her hand flew to her mouth and she dropped the bottle of salts thomas all right for a moment there was a silence of utter incredulity then his fury broke explain yourself he ground out between his teeth dont be foolish she whispered keep your voice down what happened to veronica she knelt down picked up the salts and unstoppered them waving them gently under veronicas nose she fainted of course pitt snapped back i asked her about cerise emily youve got to get out of here you must be mad dulcie was murdered and you could be next i know she wasand im not leaving her face was determined as she stared at him defiantly you are he grasped her arm she snatched it away no im not veronica isnt cerise i know her far better than you do emily but it was too late veronica was beginning to stir her eyes opened dark with horror then as memory came back and she recognized pitt and emily the mask returned i beg your pardon mr pitt she said very slowly im afraid i am not very well ii havent seen the person you spoke of i cannot help then ill not disturb you any further ill leave you with yourmaid pitt forced himself to be civil even gentle i apologize for having disturbed you emily rang the bell for the footman and when he came she gave him his instructions john please show mr pitt to the front door and then ask mary to bring mrs york a tisane pitt glared at her and she looked back with her chin high thank you he said and followed the footman out he took a hansom home and strode up his own hallway to the kitchen charlotte charlotte she turned round with innocent surprise at the rage in his voice then saw his face you knew he said furiously you knew emily was in that house as a maid god almighty have you no wits at all woman it was the wrong approach and he knew it even as he shouted at her but he was too angry to control himself for a moment she glared back at him then she changed her mind and lowered her eyes meekly im sorry thomas i didnt know until it was too late i swear and then there was no point in telling you you couldnt have done anything about it she looked up with a very small smile and she will learn things there that we cant he gave up swearing long and savagely under his breath before he ran out of vocabulary he could use in front of charlotte and accepted the cup of tea she was pouring i dont give a damn what she learns he said fiercely have you thought for one moment in all your idiotic plans about the danger shes in for gods sake charlotte two people have been murdered in that house already if she were found out what could you do to help her nothing nothing at all he flung his arm out shes there completely on her own i cant get in there how could you be so bloody stupid i am not stupid she said hotly indignation bright in her cheeks and eyes i didnt know anything about iti told you that i only heard about it afterwards dont equivocate he snapped back you drew emily into this she would never have heard about it if you hadnt started meddling get her out sit down now and write to her telling her to go home where she belongsnow charlottes face was set theres no point she wont come do it he roared dont argue with me just do it there were tears in her eyes but no obedience or submissiveness she wont listen to me she said furiously i know the danger do you think i cant see it and i know youre in danger too i sit at home and wait for you when youre late wondering where you are if you are safeor lying bleeding in the street somewhere thats unfair and it has nothing to do with emily he answered more levelly get her out charlotte i cant she wont come he said nothing he was too angryand too frightened emily was appalled when she came into the library in answer to alberts summons and saw pitt standing there thank heaven the circumstances had given him little time to express his outrage or to press his demand that she leave when veronica returned to consciousness pitt had been obliged to remain silent except for the few remarks to excuse himself leaving emily alone with her mistress propped up against the cushions looking like death warmed over emily felt so intense a pity for her it was like a new wound but she also knew that she would probably never have a better chance than now when veronica was shocked and off balance to draw some unguarded word from her as to what had frightened her so profoundly she bent down beside her and touched her hand maam you do look ill she said gently whatever did he say to you he ought not have been allowed she stared so intently at veronicas ashen face that some sort of answer was unavoidable ii think i fainted veronica whispered at last mentally emily apologized to pitt for the injustice she was about to do him then with all the skill she could muster she let genuine compassion fill her eyes did he threaten you maam what did he say he has no right you should report him what was it no veronica said quickly then bit her lip struggling with the lie nohehe was really quite civil i for a moment her eyes met emilys and she hesitated on the brink of speech the temptation to trust so vivid that emily could trace every thread of it the wavering the rival fears emily held her breath but the moment passed veronica turned away and the tears spilled and ran down her cheeks she lay back and closed her eyes emily longed to put her arms round her and tell her she understood she knew what it was like to lose your husband suddenly violently in the horror of murder with the knowledge that someone must hate so much that only death could satisfy them and she also knew the fear that grew day by day fear of confusion of a whole world become incomprehensible and full of secrets some of them hideous and the fear that the truth might be worse than you could bear and there was the fear that with knowledge you too might become a victimand at the back of every other fear the one that you might be guilty of some stupidity or some neglect that had contributed to it all a permanent rising whispering guilt and for emily too there had been the fear that the police would suspect her her motive had looked to be so obvious was that what veronica was afraid of now did she feel pitt treading closer was it terror for herself that had made her faint or was she afraid for someone she was protecting someone like julian danver it was more like pitt to be oblique to go for the weakest link in the chain of events not the murderer himself but the person most likely to yield to pressure or was veronica afraid as emily had been of the people in her husbands family who believed she was guilty or who wanted her to benot only of errors of judgment of the occasional selfishness but literally physically guilty of murder was that the passion between loretta and veronicathat loretta believed her daughterinlaw had killed her son was taking her revenge in her own way slowly day by day turning the knife collecting one word after another until she had proof it was a far more delicate torture than the simple hangmans noose and loretta could administer it herselfand watch or was it cerise she was afraid of or in spite of the fear now was she cerise herself and was it her paymasters of whom she was terrified now that the net was closing in whatever the truth there was no point in pursuing it at present the moment when she might have spoken was gone and emily knew it would be foolish to betray her curiosity she felt a little sick she did not want it to be veronica she could not help liking her even feeling a kind of identity but emily was angry also because of her own inability to judge her emotions were strong she wanted to protect the victims and attack the offenders of all sorts whether guilty of murder or only of hatred and meanness of soul but she could not discern who they were would you like to go upstairs maam she said perhaps less tactfully man she might have before anyone comes and she realized how far she was committing herself and stopped but veronica understood she swung her legs down from the sofa and sat up very slowly still dizzy yesyes i would rather there was no need to add lorettas name all the implications hung in the air between them perfectly understood but it would not do to speak them aloud slowly side by side they left the library crossed the hall to the stairs and went up that evening edith had another one of her spells and emily was asked to lay out the dinner gowns for both veronica and loretta poor edith she should see a doctor she said with cloying sweetness shall i ask mrs york to call one for her im sure she would she thinks so highly of edith fanny tittered and then stopped abruptly when the housekeeper glared at her theres no need for you to tell us what to do and what not to miss mrs crawford snapped at emily well call a doctor if its necessary youre a sight too ready with your advice emily affected innocence and a slight air of having been hurt im sure i was only trying to help mrs crawford being that i shall see mrs york in the line of duty to save you going out of your way ill go where i please miss and none of your business the girl was only trying to help the butler said reasonably and maybe we should get a doctor to edith she has more turns than a hurdygurdy libby burst into a fit of giggles and half slid under the table oh you are so witty mr redditch bertha said admiringly nora snorted she had observed berthas eye for redditch and having tried her own hand there and failed regarded it with scorn anyway she had every intention of doing better than a butlerbertha could have him and welcome she wasnt going to spend the rest of her life living in someone elses house she was going to have one of her own with nice linen and crockery and a maid of all work redditch smirked slightly admiration was very pleasant control yourself libby he said sententiously no call for all that yes mrs crawford i think amelia might mention it to mrs york yes amelia nora agreed with a little sniff why dont you do that joan opened her mouth to say something then changed her mind but she stared at emily and shook her head so slightly it might have been an illusion of the gaslight except for the expression of warning in her eyes scorch any slips today nora asked sarcastically emily smiled back no thank you did you spill any soup i never spill soup i know my job you used to albert said with satisfaction in his opinion nora was a step above herself he had tried to be friendly with her and she thought herself too good for a junior footman and she had ticked him off in front of the tweeny i remember when you dropped a potato in the french ambassadors lap and i remember a few of your mistakes too nora said fiercely do you want me to begin do as you please im sure albert said airily but his face was bright pink i will how about the day you stood on lady wortleys train i can still hear the taffeta rip redditch decided to take control thatll do the butler straightened himself in his chair and fixed them with a stern eye i wont have namecalling and interfering with other peoples jobs nora what you said was uncalled for nora made a face behind his back emily stood up the windll change and youll get stuck like that she said simply betraying to everyone what nora had done anyway its time i went upstairs its more than time the housekeeper added seeing as you have both ladies to care for should have gone quarter of an hour since i didnt know edith would be taken with one of her spells again emily answered back although i suppose i might have guessed seeing how often they happen ill have none of your impertinence the housekeeper snapped watch your tongue miss or youll be out on the street without a character and theres only one way to make your living then nora added spitefully we all know what appened to daisy not that youd be much good at that either youre too thin and youve no color at all and i should imagine youd be perfect emily returned instantly youve just the face for it youre wasted here at least i suppose you are oh nora flushed scarlet ive never been so insulted she stood up and flounced out of the room slamming the door behind her albert started to giggle and libby slid down under the table again burying her face in her apron only fanny stared in horror she understood the power of jealousy instinctively and she had seen enough to be frightened of it emily left the room on the crest of her victory but she had only got as far as the doorway when she heard the whispers start behind her shes a bad lot that one the housekeeper said sharply shell have to go mark my words airs above herselftrying to talk with a fancy voice nonsense the butler was very quick shes got a bit of spirit thats all noras been queening around here too long time someone matched up to her shes just not used to having another girl as handsome as amelia is handsome amelia mrs crawford snorted thin as a tuppenny rabbit she is and all that pale hair and skin like a dish of whey if you ask me shes not healthy shes a sight healthier than edith redditch said with evident satisfaction emily closed the door on mrs crawfords gasp of temper and went along to the green baize door and up the main stairs by the time emily had laid out veronicas clothes and gone to lorettas room loretta was already waiting for her for several minutes she merely gave instructions almost absentmindedly then at last she seemed to make up her mind to speak amelia yes maam emily heard the difference in her tone something peremptory in it or perhaps she was anxious is miss veronica unwell this evening emily considered her answer for a moment if only she knew more about loretta and her relationship with her son had the marriage been arranged had loretta selected veronica or had she and robert fallen in love against lorettas wishes perhaps she had been one of those possessive mothers for whom no woman could have been good enough to marry her son yes maam i think she was she must be careful if veronica herself said otherwise she would create trouble by betraying her to her motherinlaw and at the same time destroy the trust she needed in order to learn anything i didnt like to ask her in case i intruded loretta was sitting on the stool in front of the dressing table her face was grave her blue eyes wide cascades of deep wavy hair framed her perfect pink and white skin amelia i must confide in you her eyes met emilys in the glass veronica is not very strong and her health needs care at times perhaps more than she realizes i hope you will help me to protect her her happiness is very important to me you understand not only was she my sons wife but in the time she has lived here we have grown very close emily was startled into attention she had been mesmerized for a moment by the steady almost unblinking gaze in the glass yes maam she agreed hesitantly surely it was a liewasnt it or could the violent emotion between them be a form of love of dependence and resentment how should she answer this she must behave like a maid and yet not lose the chance to learn did loretta already know about pitts visit emily must not be caught in a lie or shed be thrown out and would fail completely of course i will do whatever i can she said smiling back nervously the poor lady does seem what word should she use frightenedterrified was the truthbut of what loretta was watching her waiting delicate emily finished desperately do you think so lorettas perfect eyebrows rose what makes you say that amelia emily felt ridiculous she could not possibly respond with the truth she was left with fatuous answers was she being tested for loyalty to see if she would recount veronicas fainting that afternoon which albert had seen and might have reported there was no time for judgment she answered instinctively she was overcome with a faint this afternoon maam it passed quickly and she seemed quite well again afterwards that would not be so remarkable ladies did faint tight stays waists pulled into a handspan often made one ill loretta stopped fiddling with the pins in the silver tray on her dressing table indeed i didnt know thank you for telling me amelia you have done the right thing in the future you will tell me anything else concerning miss veronicas health and inform me if she is distressed or seems nervous so i may give her all the assistance i can this is a most important time in her life she is shortly to become engaged to marry a very fine man i am deeply concerned that nothing whatsoever should jeopardize her happiness you understand me amelia oh yes maam emily said with a sickly smile ill do everything i can to help good now you may dress my hair and you had better hurry because you have miss veronicas to do as well yes maam it seems edith is poorly again emily met lorettas eyes in the glass and there was a dry humor in them startling and unexpected it indicated a sharpness of perception that was unnerving shell be completely better tomorrow loretta said with conviction i promise you edith was indeed up with the lark the next morning but she was in a vile temper whatever had been said to her she blamed emily for it and held a bitter grudge she followed emily around overseeing her workespecially the ironing which she knew was her weakest pointcriticizing the slightest error until emily lost her temper and told her she was a fat idle mischiefmaking slut and if she put half as much effort into doing her own job as she did into meddling in other peoples then no one else would need to cover for her edith threw a bucket of cold water at her emilys first thought was to retaliate by hitting edith as hard as she could across her stupid face but that would undoubtedly get her dismissed and then she would discover nothing she took the opposite course and stood in the middle of the laundry room floor shivering and dripping joan who had heard edith shriek in fury appeared in the doorway and saw edith with the empty bucket in her hand and emilys pathetic state emily thought for a moment what she must look like how furious her mother would be and how absurd the whole situation was and was terrified she would burst into giggles to smother the slight hysteria she felt rising inside her she pulled her apron up to cover her face and stifled her laughter in its ample folds joan disappeared and two minutes later the butler came in his face pink his sideburns bristling edith whatevers come over you girl you can stay here till mrs york wants you and iron all the rest of the sheets thats not my job edith protested with outrage hold your tongue and do as youre told and therell be no dinner for you today or tomorrow either if you give me any impertinence he turned to emily gently and put his arm round her holding her far more firmly than necessary come now get out of those wet things and then maryll get you a hot cup of tea you havent been hurt youll be all right soon come come stop crying youll make yourself ill emily did not know if she could her laughter was too close to tears to stop easily after the loneliness the cold the tension and the strangeness it was a relief to let go and pour her feelings out she felt redditchs arm around her warm surprisingly strong it was really quite pleasant and she relaxed into itthen the appalling thought struck her that he might well misread her compliance she had already noticed he seemed to like her a great deal and had championed her more than once that would be all she needed to lose control of this altogether she sniffed fiercely commanded herself to behave dropped her apron from her eyes and straightened up thank you mr redditch you are quite right it is nothing but shock because the water was cold she must not forget she was supposed to be a maid she could hardly afford arrogance or the kind of distance a lady might affect thank you youre very kind his arm fell away reluctantly are you sure oh yesyes thank you she moved away slowly keeping her eyes averted this was preposterous she was thinking of him as a man not a butler or on second thought he was a man all men were men perhaps it was society that was preposterous thank you mr redditch she said again yes ill go and get changed im frozen and a hot cup of tea would be lovely she turned and all but ran out of the room and along the corridor to the stairs by the time she came down into the kitchen again everyone had heard of the affair and she was met with wideeyed stares whispers and a snigger or two ignore them mary said softly bringing her a steaming cup and sitting down beside her her voice dropped till it was barely audible did you really call her names what did you say emily took the tea carefully her hands still shaking i told her she was a fat lazy slut she whispered back but dont repeat that mrs crawford would have me out i expect ediths been here for years and mrs crawfords always known her no she hasnt mary moved a little closer shes only bin ere two year and mrs crawford fer three everyone seems new emily said artlessly why its a good place lovely house fair wages and miss veronicas not hard dunno i suppose it must be the murder i didnt ear no one say as they would leave all the same everyone did thats silly emily kept her voice down but she was excited perhaps she was on the verge of some real detecting did they think the murderer would kill someone elseoh she affected amazement and horror swinging round on her wooden seat to look at mary directly you dont think dulcie was murdered do you marys eyes blue as the rings on the kitchen china stared at her in disbelief then gradually the possibility took hold and emily was afraid she had gone too far a second maid in hysterics in one day would certainly get her thrown out without any excuses even redditch could not save her she could have bitten her tongue for being so hasty you mean pushed er outa the window marys voice was almost inaudible but she was made of sterner stuff than edith she did not hold with hysterics they usually made people cross and men hated them and her mind was quite sharp she could read and had a pile of penny dreadfuls under her pillow upstairs she knew all about crime well dulcie was ere when poor mr robert was killed she said with a tiny nod mebbe she saw summink so were you werent you emily sipped her tea gratefully well youd better be careful dont speak to anyone about anything that happened then did you see anything mary was apparently unaware of the contradiction in emilys instructions no i never did she said regretfully important people never come into the kitchen and i ardly never got out of it i was only scullery maid then you didnt see any strange people upstairs ever people who shouldnt have been no i never what was mr robert like the others must have talked marys brow puckered in thought well dulcie said e was very particlar never untidy like an always politeleast as polite as quality ever is but then old mr york is always polite too although es terrible untidy leaves is things all over the place and forgets summink awful i know e was out a lot james as was footman then e was always sayin mr robert was out again but that was mr roberts job e was summink very important in the foreign service what happened to james mrs york got rid of im said as since mr robert was dead there wasnt no need sent im off the very next day she did on account of lord somebodyorother was lookin for a valet and she spoke for im mrs loretta oh yes o course poor miss veronica werent in no state to do anything terrible grieved she were in an awful state poor soul mr robert were er ole world adored im she did not that mrs loretta werent terrible upset too o course white as a ghost dulcie said mary leaned so close her hair tickled emilys cheek dulcie told the she eard er crying summink wicked in the night but she didnt dare go in cause she couldnt do nuffink people as to cry its natural of course it is suddenly emily felt like an intruder what on earth was she doing here in some unfortunate womans house deceiving everyone pretending to be a maid no wonder pitt was furious he probably despised her as well come on mrs melrose interrupted briskly breaking her train of thought drink up your tea amelia marys got work to do even if you avent an id watch your tongue if i were you my girl dont do to be too smart ediths a lazy baggage an you got away with it this timebut you made enemies now drink that up an get along with you it was excellent advice and emily thanked her for it meekly and obeyed with an alacrity that surprised them both the next two days were uncomfortable edith was nursing a resentment which she did not dare exercise but it was the bitterer for that and emily knew she was only biding her time mrs crawford felt she had somehow been bested and constantly found tiny faults with emily which provoked redditch into criticizing the housekeeper until everyone was on edge the laundry room became her only sanctuary since once again edith had contrived to get out of the ironing she had bruised her wrist and the flatiron was too heavy for her mrs crawford let her get away with that but she could not overrule redditch on the matter of dinner and two delicious midday meals went by without ediths presence mrs melrose seemed to have made a special effort as was customary the servants shared the fine wine in the family cellars in the evening after supper they drank hot cocoa and played games in which edith did not join emilys only immediate problem was how to fend off redditchs friendship without hurting his feelings and thus forfeiting his protection she had never had to be so diplomatic in her life and it was a considerable strain she sought refuge in unnaturally diligent attendance upon veronica that was how she came to be in the boudoir in the middle of the afternoon when nora announced that a mr radley had called and would miss veronica see him emily suddenly felt flushed the book she had been reading aloud slid off her lap onto the floor all this had begun as an adventure but she was not sure she wanted jack to actually see her as a maid her hair was back in a style far less flattering than usual and there was no color in her faceas a servant it was not allowed unless it was natural of courseand because she was inside all the time sleeping in that cold bed up too early there were shadows under her eyes and she was sure she was thinner perhaps she did look like a tuppenny rabbit veronica was thin but in her gorgeous clothes she merely looked delicate not bloodless oh yes please veronica said with a smile how nice of him to call is miss barnaby with him too no maam shall i bring him in here nora glanced quickly at emily implying that she should leave yes do and have mrs melrose prepare some tea and sandwiches and cakes yes maam nora turned on her heel and went out her skirts swishing round the door before she closed it in her opinion ladys maids had no business being where they could meet gentlemen callers that was a parlormaids privilege jack came in a moment later smiling easily graceful and full of life he did not even glance at emily but his face lit with pleasure when he saw veronica and she held out her hand to him emily felt a shock of rejection almost as if she had been slapped it was idiotic had he spoken to her it would have spoilt everything and she would have been angry with him and yet she felt crushed inside because he had carried out his part perfectly he had treated her like a servant not a woman at all how kind of you to see me he said warmly as if it was more than just a social ritual i should have sent my card but it was a spurofthemoment call how are you i heard you had a misfortune in the house i do hope you are beginning to recover veronica clung to his hand oh jack it really was dreadful poor dulcie fell out of the window and she was crushed on the stone beneath i cant think how it happened no one saw anything jack she had called him by his christian name so naturally that it must be how she thought of him even after all this time why had she not married him when they knew each other before money her parents they might well have refused someone like jack who had no prospects they had picked robert york instead an only son who had both money and ambition but would she have preferred jack and infinitely more important would he have preferred her they were talking as if emily were not there she could have been another cushion on the chair veronica was looking up at jack her cheeks flushed looking happier than emily had ever seen her the light shone on that hair like black silk and her eyes were wide she was more than beautiful there was individuality and passion in her face emily was caught in a turmoil of feelings that tightened her throat so she thought she might choke as amelia she liked veronica and pitied her because she realized she was desperately unhappy over something it came to emily with clarity as she sat there like a fool watching jack that veronica was wound up like an oldfashioned thumbscrew inside hurting a little more each day was it still grief over robert or was it fear was it because she knew somethingor because she did not know and her sense of uncertainty warped everything and at the same time emily was burningly jealous and jealousy brought back the agony of watching george become infatuated with sybilla of knowing the man she loved preferred in fact adored someone else it was a pain like no other and the fact that george had woken up from his affair before he died did not wash away her knowledge of what it was like to be rejected there had been no time for the wound to heal fully emily could not help seeing veronica as a rival jack had started as an amusement a graceful and charming toy to be played with then he had become a friend far more comfortable to be with than almost anyone except charlotte but now he was a part of her life she could not lose without profound loneliness now he was laughing and talking with veronica and emily was powerless even to speak let alone to fight for his attention it was a kind of pain she had never experienced before some other time she would give thought to what it must be like always to be a maid condemned only to watch now she was full of her own anger and hurt and had no time for anyone else and she should slip away maids had no business remaining in the room as if they were guests she did not excuse herself that too was unnecessary an interruption she simply stood up and tiptoed out jack did not even turn his head at the door she looked over her shoulder at him but he was smiling at veronica and emily might not have existed charlotte was frightened when pitt described emilys danger with such clarity but she was helpless to save her sister even if charlotte went to the yorks as often as she could she could hardly rescue emily over the teacups and cucumber sandwiches the only comfort was that she did not actually believe veronica was cerise from what pitt had said she had not the nerve to be a spy she raised the subject again the next day hoping to ease the rift between them if she is a spy dont we have to discover her for the nations sake no we do not he said pointedly i do but we can help nobody in hanover close is going to talk to you because you are police whereas they take no notice of us they dont think we have enough brains for them to have to lie pitt grunted and raised his eyebrows he looked at her pointedly and she decided to ignore him it might be wiser to let the subject drop in case he forbade her going to the yorks she really did not want to have to disobey him she wanted very much to avoid another quarrel she could not possibly allow emily to face whatever danger there was alone but there was nothing she could say that pitt would believe if she were too docile he would become suspicious so she merely resumed eating her supper and presently spoke of something else the following morning as soon as pitt was out of the house she wrote a letter to jack radley and had gracie put it in the ten oclock post while she was ironing pitts shirts charlotte laid her plans it was saturday two days later when they came to fruition by which time she had been visited by jack with an account of his call upon veronica york emily had been in the room on his arrival but had left shortly afterwards he had been concerned that she looked very pale and rather unhappy although he had not dared to do more than glance at her the news of emily was not good but charlotte was quite elated that he seemed so anxious for her looking at his face which usually revealed nothing but charm and the superficial pleasure society expected she saw something of the man beneath and found she liked it perhaps for emily to be in danger was precisely what he needed to show her that he had in him the depth she wanted for emily consequently it was with a high heart and some exhilaration that she set out alone from emilys house in the early afternoon dressed in one of her sisters older gowns let out judiciously here and there because she was a couple of inches taller and handsomer of bust than emily even before the tragedy of georges death it was golden brown the color of old sherry and extremely becoming to her warmtoned complexion and her hair with its auburn lights she chose a hat trimmed with black fur and a muff to match altogether she had never looked so well in a winter outfit in her life she had sent a letter and received one in return from veronica so she was expected she drew up in emilys carriage hoping no one would notice if asked she was going to explain that it had been lent for convenience since lady ashworth was out of town veronica was awaiting her in the withdrawing room and her face lit with pleasure as charlotte was shown in she rose immediately how nice to see you im so glad you came do sit down i wish it were not so terribly cold but all the same i thought we might go for a ride just to be away from the same surroundings all the time unless you would like to see the winter exhibition again charlotte saw the urgency in her eyes as she waited for an answer not at alla carriage ride is an excellent idea charlotte responded with a smile it was not what she had planned but it might serve and she must court veronicas friendship if they were alone together in a carriage secure from interruption she might elicit some confidence i should enjoy that very much she added for good measure veronica relaxed some of the tension easing out of her slender body she smiled im so glad i wish you would call me veronica and may i call you elisabeth for a moment charlotte was startled she had almost forgotten her alias of course she said after a moments hesitation then in case veronica thought she disapproved that is most kind of you where do you care to drive i veronicas pale cheeks colored very slightly and instantly charlotte understood she was not yet ready to commit herself to such trust why not let us see where the wish takes us charlotte suggested tactfully no doubt something agreeable will occur to us once we are started veronica was visibly relieved how sympathetic you are the moment had passed without the need for explanation and she was grateful have you had a pleasant time since we visited the exhibition she asked charlotte had to invent a reply on the spot if you wish for a frank answer i am afraid nothing worthy of repeating veronicas smile expressed her comprehension completely she had endured years of being a model widow a decorous wife and before that a demure young lady seeking a suitable marriage she had an intimate acquaintance with boredom charlotte was about to introduce another topic when loretta came in her face registering goodmannered surprise good afternoon miss barnaby she said how pleasant of you to call i hope you are well and enjoying your stay in london before she could fumble for an appropriate response veronica helped her by announcing their plans we are going to take a drive lorettas eyes opened wide in this weather my dear it is bitterly cold and looks as if it might well snow again very bracing veronica said immediately and i am longing to get a little air the corners of lorettas fulllipped mouth curved upward minutely are you going to call upon anyone this time veronica was slower and her eyes slid away from her motherinlaws i er we have not decided charlotte interrupted for her smiling at loretta we thought we could go wherever the whim took us i beg your pardon loretta was put off her stride by such an unexpected answer we have not decided veronica repeated seizing on the escape we shall drive for pleasure i have been inside too much lately i am sure fresh air would do me good i feel peaked and what about miss barnaby loretta inquired she is not in the least peaked in fact she appears in the most robust good health charlotte knew she had anything but the pale and languid look of fashion but she did not care i am perfectly happy to take a ride she insisted perhaps we should see some sights you are too amiable loretta said coolly i thought perhaps you might have considered visiting harriet danver they all knew she meant julian but they kept up the fiction with charlottes moral support veronica had gathered courage this time she met lorettas eyes no she said blandly we had merely said it would be nice to take a ride i thought i might show elisabeth some of the fashionable places in london that she has not seen in this weather loretta said again there is no sun whatever and it will be dark by four really my dear you are being a trifle impractical then we had better hurry veronica was not to be dissuaded her will was growing stronger charlotte could see it in the angle of her head and the increasing quickness of her answers loretta smiled sweetly taking them both by surprise in that case i shall come with you then if you do decide to call upon the danvers you will not be unchaperoned which would be most unsuitable after all it is saturday and mr danver may well be at home we must not be ill thought of suddenly veronica seemed seized by panic as if she were enmeshed in a net and every new twist to free herself only bound her more tightly charlotte could see the rise and fall of her bosom as she fought for bream and her hands clenched at her sides as if she would tear at her skirt i shall have elisabeth with me her voice rose sharply almost out of control i know the rules i loretta stared at her eyes careful steady almost warning a tight smile on her lips my dear girl how generous of you charlotte immediately wished she had not stepped in it might have been more productive to let the scene play itself out she should have thought more of detection and less of friendship but it was too late now i am sure we should enjoy your company especially if we take a walk in the park she thought of the raw wind slicing in off the open grass and whining through the wet leafless trees but loretta was not to be deterred so easily i think miss barnaby that when you step outside you will change your mind but if that is what you wish then i shall wait in the carriage for you youll freeze veronica said desperately i am much stronger than you think my dear loretta replied levelly and as veronica turned away charlotte was startled to see tears in her eyes what was this emotion between these two women veronica was afraid charlotte had seen fear often enough to know and yet veronica was not naturally submissive and now that robert was dead she ought to have no need to cater to his feelings for his mother financially she was secure and she was all but engaged to marry again why was she so afraid everything loretta had done at least on the surface had been in her interest if only charlotte could learn what sort of a marriage it had been how it had begun had loretta adored her only son and had she been too demanding of her daughterinlaw had she interfered criticized been open in her disappointment because there had been no grandchildren there could be a dozen passions or griefs behind the driving emotion that bound these two women the tense silence in the room was broken when the door opened and piers york came in charlotte had not met him before but she knew him immediately from pitts description elegant a trifle stooping face wry with selfdeprecatory good humor ah he said with slight surprise on seeing charlotte veronica forced a smile it was ghastly a travesty of pleasure papainlaw this is miss barnaby a new friend of mine who has been good enough to call we were going to take a short drive what an excellent idea he agreed rather cold but better than sitting inside all day how do you do miss barnaby how do you do mr york charlotte replied warmly he was the sort of man she liked without needing to think about it im so glad you approve mrs yorkshe glanced at lorettawas afraid we should not enjoy it because it is so chill outside but i feel exactly as you do that whatever the weather it is better to go out for a little while even if only to better appreciate the fire when we return what a sensible young woman he smiled i have no idea why fashion so admires the drooping young creatures who lie about being bored with everything they have no idea how tedious they are i pity the man who is naive enough to marry one of them still i suppose they are all taking a pig in a poke anyway piers loretta said tartly please keep that sort of unfortunate language for your club it has no place here you will offend miss barnaby he looked surprised oh im sorry miss barnaby did i offend you i assure you i only meant that one can get very little idea of a persons true nature from the sort of social twitterings that are all one is allowed before marriage charlotte smiled broadly i am not in the least offended i know precisely what you mean and then when you do discover of course it is too late mrs york was just saying that if we come to call upon the danvers it would be necessary for veronica to be chaperoned but i would be quite happy to make sure nothing is done that could be remarked upon i give you my word i am sure you mean well miss barnaby but that is not sufficient for society loretta said firmly nonsense piers contradicted her perfectly all right anyway who would know about it harriet certainly isnt going to say anything it would be as well if i were to go with you she insisted taking a step towards the door this is a most delicate time for heavens sake stop fussing loretta he said with unusual sharpness you worry over veronica far too much danvers a decent enough fellow and no stickinthemud miss barnaby is perfectly adequate as a chaperone and its good of her to oblige piers you dont understand lorettas voice grated with the power of her emotion i wish you would accept my judgment there is far more to this than you realize about a carriage ride his disbelief was tinged with annoyance her face was white there are delicacies things that indeed what for example she was angry but she had no answer that she was prepared to give him charlotte looked at veronica wondering whether the brief escape would be worth the unpleasantness which would undoubtedly follow come elisabeth veronica said without looking at loretta we shall not be long but it will be good for us to go out charlotte excused herself and followed veronica out into the hallway she waited a few moments while the footman was dispatched to fetch veronicas cloak and muff and veronica herself went to change her boots the withdrawing room door was ajar you know nothing whatever about that young woman lorettas voice rose angrily most unsuitable brash totally unsophisticated she seemed very pleasant to me piers answered in fact altogether attractive for heavens sake piers just because she has a handsome face really you are so naive sometimes and you my dear see complications where there are none i anticipate which is not the same thing it is very often exactly the same thing charlotte was prevented from overhearing any more by veronicas return emily came downstairs too with a cloak over her arm at first charlotte hardly recognized her she looked so different with her hair under a cap wearing a blue stuff dress with no bustle and a plain apron over it she looked thinner than before although it was probably the clothes and terribly pale their eyes met only for a moment emilys wide and very blue then veronica put on the cloak emily smoothed it over her shoulders and charlotte and veronica went out of the front door as albert held it open for them the drive was chilly even with rugs over their knees but it was exhilarating to be bowling along at a good pace with fashionable streets wide avenues and squares passing their windows for a moment veronica turned her eyes almost black in the carriage interior her lips parted but charlotte knew where veronica wanted to go before she could ask of course she said quickly veronica clasped her hand inside the muff thank you they were received without surprise at the danver house and shown into the withdrawing room since charlotte had written to veronica two days ago it was possible veronica had written to julian and they were expected julian danver himself was there and greeted them taking veronicas hands and holding them warmly for a moment before turning to charlotte how charming to see you again miss barnaby he smiled at her his gaze was very direct and charlotte remembered how much she had liked him i am sure you remember my aunt miss danver and my sister harriet of course she said quickly looking first at aunt adeline whose thin intelligent face regarded her with interest and then at harriet this afternoon she seemed paler than before there was a deep shadow of unhappiness behind her answering look i hope you are well very well thank you and you all the usual greetings were exchanged and the polite meaningless topics of conversation touched upon it was the sort of formal ritual charlotte had been used to as a girl but had been able to cast aside after her marriage indeed with the dramatic fall in her social standing the opportunity had been removed from her a loss she had been grateful for she had never been skilled at it her own opinions far too ready on her tongue no one wanted them it was unseemly for a woman to be opinionated and a great deal of feminine charm lay in listening and admiring and making perhaps an occasional remark of optimism and good nature of course it was almost always acceptable to laugh if ones laughter was musical and not too loud it should never be the rich mirth of one who understood the absurd or the farcical charlotte had lost the polish she had cultivated when her mother had tried so hard to marry her successfully now she sat primly on the edge of her chair with her hands folded in her lap and watched speaking only when civility demanded veronica had practiced the feminine graces so long it was second nature to her to find the words to courteously say nothing but watching her face which on the surface seemed so fragile until one looked at the balance of the bones and the strength of passion in the mouth charlotte could see her mind was occupied with other more distressing thoughts her smile was brittle and although she appeared to be listening to whomever was speaking at the moment her eyes frequently flickered to julian danvers face more than once charlotte had the feeling veronica was uncertain of his attention to her it seemed foolish to wonder whether such a lovely woman already experienced in marriage and the object of sympathy for her bereavement but never of the kind of pity reserved for the unmarried like harriet or aunt adeline could be unsure of herself julian danvers intentions were plain all his actions the way he conducted himself in front of others made it obvious no man would behave in such a manner unless he had promised marriage to withdraw without the most drastic of reasons would open him to ruin such a promise once given was unforgivable to break so why did veronica twine her fingers in her lap and keep glancing first at julian then at charlotte why did she talk just a little too much and with a fine almost indiscernible edge to her voice cutting charlotte off in the middle of a remark and then smiling at her so frankly it was an apology charlotte thought she understood harriets pain perfectly it was very simple to explain if she really loved felix asherson whether he returned it or not there was nothing she could do about it nor would there ever be unless sonia asherson died and why should she die sonia was an almost offensively healthy young woman buxom and serene as a good country cow she would probably live to be ninety she was far too well versed in the arts of survival not to mention contented with her lot to abandon all sense and give felix cause to divorce her and it was quite impossible she should divorce him even if she discovered he loved harriet yes harriets colorless face and quiet voice took no leap of the imagination to understand and charlotte grieved for her without being able to do anything at all even compassion would only have been like vinegar to the wound robbing her of the sole comfort of supposing her pain to be private finally charlotte could bear the tension no longer she remembered seeing a doorway to the conservatory when they were shown in and she turned to julian i believe i noticed your conservatory as we passed through the hall i love conservatories so much perhaps you would be kind enough to show me it would be like stepping in a moment from londons winter into a foreign land full of flowers veronica drew in her breath with a sharp sound how well you describe it you have added instantly to my pleasure julian said quickly i should be delighted to take you we have some very fine liliesat least that is what i believe they are im not good at names but i can find you the most beautiful and those with the richest perfume he stood up as he spoke charlotte rose also veronicas back was to julian so he could not see her face charlotte smiled directly at her meeting her hot gaze steadily it was full of anger and dark wounded bitterness charlotte extended her hand palm upward in invitation at last and quite suddenly veronica grasped her meaning she came quickly to her feet her face first pale then a deep pink ohoh yes she said awkwardly yes if you will be kind enough to excuse us charlotte asked aunt adeline and harriet of course they murmured yes of course it was successful immediately the conservatory was quite large and there were elegant ferns and vines hiding one walk from another and a small green pool with flawless lotuses which charlotte stopped to admire without needing to feign delight julian then pointed out the fragrant lilies he had mentioned after making all the right comments charlotte at last caught veronicas eye and with the tiniest smile she turned and walked back to the lotus pool after enough time had passed she tiptoed back out into the hall again she could not return to the withdrawing room or she would betray the whole fabric of the excusenot that anyone was deceived but forcing the others to acknowledge it was another thing entirely she felt foolish standing there in the hall doing nothing she walked over to a large painting of a landscape with cows and stopped in front of it as if she were regarding it closely actually it was very agreeable of the dutch school but her mind was busy with all she knew of veronica and the danvers she stood for some time with her eyes on the peaceful scene she could hear in her mind the chewing of the cud and almost see the jaws gentle rhythm they were beautiful creatures oddly angular and yet graceful the curve of their horns ancient as civilized man she turned away from the painting suddenly she was not there to indulge her taste for art nor even her friendship for veronica veronica might be cerise she and julian danver might have murdered robert york duty demanded that charlotte creep back and attempt to overhear their conversation distasteful as that was just inside the conservatory door she stopped and solemnly regarded a red canna lily as if it held her interest then she sidled further in glancing from the lilies on the ground up to the vines overhead and back again she was several yards along the path and had nearly collided with a potted palm when she saw veronica and julian danver in an embrace of such passion she blushed for having seen them it was an intrusion which at any other time would have been inexcusable and she could not possibly explain without betraying herself completely and everything she hoped to achieve even perhaps putting emily in a position of the greatest embarrassment culminating in social ruin quickly she stepped back into the arms of a vineand almost fainted with horror at the first instinctive thought that the clinging touch was human she swallowed a shriek realizing the truth and with an effort pulled herself together and stepped out smartly only to come face to face with aunt adeline she swore under her breath feeling idiotic and knowing her hair was disheveled her cheeks scarlet are you all right miss barnaby adeline raised her eyebrows you look a little distressed charlotte took a deep breath only a really good lie would serve i feel such a fool she began with what she hoped was a disarming smile i was trying to see a flower overhead and i overbalanced i do beg your pardon she put her hand to the trailing strands of her hair and then i got caught in a vine and i couldnt get loose but i havent hurt the plant my dear of course you havent adeline smiled bleakly her eyes like brown velvet boot buttons charlotte had no idea whether the woman believed a word of what she had said i think perhaps it is time we had some tea shall i call julian and veronica or will you i er without thinking charlotte moved to block the path im sure theyll come in a few moments adelines gaze was steady and skeptical i wondered if it was bougainvillea charlotte said abruptly such a wonderful shade of cerise is that not the color you said you saw veronica wearing one night adeline looked startled that was not veronica for once she dropped her usually clear fine voice perhaps her most attractive feature im perfectly sure of that oh i must have misunderstood you i assumed her words trailed away she did not know how to finish she had been trying to surprise something out of adeline while preventing her from going into the conservatory and seeing that wildly immodest embrace and it was not only for veronica she wished it but for adeline herself perhaps no one had ever held her so or would do now oh no adeline said with a tiny shake of her head her walk was quite unlike veronicas you can tell a great deal about a woman by the way she walks and her walk was unique there was a grace in it a daring she was a woman who had power and knew itand yet i think she had much to be afraid of if she were to allow herself to be afraid oh charlotte faltered thenwho adelines face reflected wisdom pain and the merest shadow of humor i do not know miss barnaby and i do not ask there are many old loves and old hates that are better left unspoken you surprise me charlottes words were suddenly sharp almost accusatory i had thought you were more candid than that adelines plain sensitive mouth tightened the time for candor is past you have no idea what pain may lie behind these things a little blindness can allow them to ease where to speak may make answer inevitable she inclined her head towards the interior of the conservatory now you have done your good turn for the day miss barnaby either you will call veronica or i shall i will charlotte said obediently her mind in a whirl had cerise been a lover of julians did veronica know or guess was that the ghost she was fightingan old mistress was that why she allowed herself such abandon before an engagement was even announced let alone a marriage if so then who had killed robert york and why they were back to treason could it possibly be that veronica herself was hunting her husbands murderer could it be julian who had killed robert and did she know it was that the terror consuming herand what lay between her and loretta veronica charlotte said aloud miss danver says that tea will be served in a few minutes veronica pitt chose to walk to mayfair it was not a pleasant day a flat gray sky closed over the city like a heavy lid and the wind scythed across the park stinging his skin above his muffler it crept into the space round his ears and its coldness hurt making his body tighten against it carriages rattled along park lane but he saw no one on foot it was too cold for pleasure the street vendors knew there would be no business for them here where residents could afford to ride he walked because he was going to the danvers and he was putting off arriving there as long as he could dulcie was dead so there was no one left to ask about cerise except adeline danver part of the chill inside him was guiltdulcies bright frank face came back to his mind far too easily if only he had taken the precaution of closing the library door before allowing her to speak he still did not know which of her two remarks had caused her deaththe mention of cerise or of the missing necklace but pitts investigation of piers yorks affairs had proved him to be more than financially secure and in spite of his remark to dulcie he did not seem to have claimed for the gems all inquiries into other friends of robert york who might have acquired debt and turned to amateur burglary had also proved fruitless so far nor had pitt succeeded in tracing many of the servants who had been employed in hanover close at the time and dismissed soon after the butler had taken a position in the country the valet had gone abroad the maids had disappeared into the vast mass of female labor in london and its environs he stopped he was outside the danvers house already the air was damp raw in the throat with the sour smell of too many fires jetting smoke out into the leaden sky he could not stand around like a vagrant someone held a thread that eventually wound back to murder if he picked at it teased it he thought he might find an end lying with adeline danver she received him civilly but with undisguised surprise he had formed a very clear picture of her in his mind from charlottes description nevertheless he was taken aback by the sharp intelligence in her rather round eyes under their wispy brows she was a plainer woman than charlotte had implied her nose was tiptilted and narrow her chin very receding it was only when she spoke in a voice of remarkable timbre and diction that he saw her beauty good afternoon inspector i have no idea how i might be of assistance but of course i shall try please do be seated i dont believe i have ever met a policeman before she regarded him with open curiosity as if he were some exotic species of creature imported for her entertainment for the first time in years pitt felt selfconscious he seemed all hands and feet and coattails he sat down gingerly trying to arrange himself with some neatness and failing thank you maam not at all her eyes never wavered from his face i assume it is about poor robert yorks death that is the only crime with which i have even the remotest connectionand believe the it is remote but i knew him of course although there are many others who knew him far better she smiled very slightly i suppose i have the advantage of being an observer of life rather than a player so perhaps i have seen something that others may have missed he felt transparent guilty of great insensitivity not at all miss danver he smiled very faintly he was not at all sure he should try to be charminghe might end up making a complete fool of himself i approach you because i have a very specific question in mind and you are the person in the house least likely to have any involvement with this event and therefore to be embarrassed by it or distressed you take trouble to be tactful she said with a slight nod of approval thank you for not insulting my intelligence with an idle courtesy what event do you imagine i may know of i confess i cannot think what it might be have you ever seen in this house alone and not as an ordinary guest a woman of striking appearance tall slender and very dark wearing a gown of a vivid and unusual shade of magenta or cerise adeline sat motionless she might not have been breathing but for the faintest stir of the fichu over her thin almost bosomless chest pitt waited staring back at her bright brown eyes now there was no possibility of evasion between them either she would lie outright brazenly or she would tell him the truth outside in the hall a clock struck eleven the chimes seemed endless until eventually the last one died away yes mr pitt she said i have seen such a woman but there is no point whatsoever in your asking me who she is because i do not know i have seen her twice in this house and to the best of my knowledge i have never seen her anywhere else either before or since thank you he said gravely was she wearing the same clothes on both occasions no but it was a very similar shade one darker than the other as i recollect but it was at night and gaslight can be misleading can you describe her for me all that you do remember who is she inspector the use of his title set a distance between them again warning him not to take her for granted i dont know miss danver but she is the only clue i have as to who murdered robert york a woman her eyes widened i assume you are suggesting something sordid it was a statement he smiled broadly not necessarily miss danver i think there may gave been a theft unreported because only mr york himself knew of it and that this woman may have been the thief or may have witnessed the murder you are full of surprises adeline danver conceded with an answering softness touching the corners of her mouth and you cannot find this woman not so far i have been singularly unsuccessful can you describe her for me i am fascinated she bent her head very slightly to one side how do you know she exists someone else saw her in the york house also by gaslight and their description is not adequate or do you fear they are misleading you deliberately should he frighten her dulcies trusting face came back as sharply as if she had gone out of the library door only yesterday her description was very brief he said without moderating the blow at all but i cant go back and ask her again because the day after she spoke to me she fell out of an upstairs window to her death adelines thin cheeks were white she was well acquainted with tragedy she was over fifty and had known many deaths but none of them had left her untouched much of her life lay in the triumphs and the sorrows of others it had had to im sorry she said quietly you are referring to veronica yorks maid i assume yes he did not want to seem melodramatic foolish miss danver he stopped yes inspector please do not speak of our conversation to anyone else even in your own family they may inadvertently repeat it without intending harm her eyebrows rose and her thin hands gripped the arms of her chair do i understand you correctly her voice was little more than a breath but still perfectly controlled beautifully modulated i believe she is still here somewhereat times very close he replied someone among your family or your acquaintances knows where she is who she isand possibly what really happened on that night three years ago in hanover close it is not i mr pitt he smiled bleakly if i thought it were miss danver i should not waste my time asking you but you think one of us someone i daresay i am fond of does know this terrible thing people keep secrets for many reasons he replied most often out of fear for themselves or to protect someone they love scandal can blow up out of sins that are very slightif they catch the imagination and scandal can be a worse punishment for some than imprisonment or financial loss the admiration of our peers is a far greater prize than some realizemore blood has been shed for it than is seen and more pain women marry men they do not love rather than be imagined to be unloved people pretend all the time so that others will imagine they are happy we need our masks our small illusions few of us can bear to go naked into the worlds gaze and people will kill to keep their clothes she stared at him what an odd person you are why on earth do you choose to be a policeman he looked down at the carpet it did not occur to him to evade still less to lie originally because my father was convicted for something he did not do the truth has its uses miss danver and although it can be painful lies are worse in the end though there are times when i hate it when i learn things i would rather not have to know but thats cowardice because we are afraid of the pain of pitying and do you expect it to hurt this time mr pitt she asked her eyes on his face her thin fingers picking very slightly at the lace in her skirt no he said honestly no more man the murder already has done what did she look like miss danver could you describe this woman for me she hesitated for a moment searching her memory she was tall she said slowly i think quite definitely taller than average she had a kind of grace short women cannot possess and she was slender not she blinked grasping for the word which eluded her not voluptuous and yet sheno her voluptuousness was not in her shape but it was there quite definitely it was there it was in the way she moved she had passion style a kind of daring as if she were dancing a great ballet along a razors edge im sorry do i sound ridiculous no he shook his head without taking his eyes from hers no if what i guess about her is right then that is a fitting analogy go on she had dark hair black it seemed in the gaslight i only caught the briefest glimpse of her face and i remember she was very beautiful what sort of face pitt pressed there are many kinds of beauty unusual she said slowly and he knew she was trying to picture the moment again the gaslight on the landing the vivid dress the turn of the head till she saw the features there was a perfect balance between the brow and the nose the cheek and the curve of the throat it was all a matter of bones and a sweeping hairline it was nothing ordinary like arched eyebrows or a pouting mouth or dimples she reminded me vaguely of someone and yet i am perfectly sure i had never seen her before are you yes and you may choose to believe me or not but it is the truth it was not veronica which i assume you are imagining and it was most certainly not my niece harriet who did she remind you of please try to recall i have tried mr pitt i can only think it may be someone whose picture i have seen artists impressions can be most misleading they change so much with the fashion of the times have you noticed they paint you as they think you wish to look but photographs give a remarkable likeness i am sorry i have no idea who it is so there is no purpose in your pressing me if at any time it comes to me i shall certainly tell you that i promise then promise me also miss danver that you will not discuss this with anyone else nor entrust a message to anyoneanyone at all i really do mean what i say he leaned forward a little if he frightened her it was a small price to pay for saving her life robert york is dead and so is dulcie both in their own homes where they thought they were safe give me your word miss danver very well mr pitt she agreed if you really believe it is so serious i shall discuss it with no one you may cease to worry about it she looked at him levelly her round clever eyes very grave good gracious mr pittyour concern is a trifle unnerving outside again in the gray street he turned and walked south he must find the woman in cerise he had already exhausted the easier avenues the hotels and theaters where she would have been most likely to meet her clients he had questioned the doorkeepers the prostitutes who might have been her rivals as well as the pimps and madams they either did not know her or would not say it all confirmed what he imagined from the beginning that she was a spy not a woman earning her living from prostitution she was not interested in general trade only certain men in particular and she had taken great care not to be traced finding cerise would be a matter of laborious detailed police work he knew at least one place which she had patronized several times and now he had a close and unusual description no one in the business of sexual favors for hire was likely to help him further all the middlemen reaped their profits from silence but there were always people in a london street who were almost invisible people who might remember who made their livelihood from passersby their hungry eyes watching each one for even the tiniest signs of willingness to buy he stepped over to the curb and raised his arm shouting to a hansom as it plodded along park lane through the thickening mist there was snow in the wind he climbed in and gave the address of the hotel where he had found the doorman who remembered cerise sitting back to wait out the slow cold journey this was not the best time to beginthe vendors he wanted would be the ones who worked at nightbut he had nothing else to pursue and there was an urgency inside him he stopped short of the hotel itself and left the cab on the comer opposite a stall where a man wearing a white apron and a black hat with a ribbon round it was selling hot eels beside him a girl ladled out thick pea soup at a halfpenny a cup the aroma drifted on the wet air and pitt automatically reached in his pocket he had never acquired the native londoners taste for eels but he was partial to pea soup a redfaced woman was before him in the queue but after she was served he produced his halfpenny and took the hot cup gratefully the liquid was thick and a little lumpy but the flavor was rich and its warmth rippled through him creating a tiny heart of strength inside you here in the evenings he asked casually sometimes in the summer wiv ve eels the man answered vis time o year anyone wiv an ome ter go to is in it vem as asnt usual dont ave money neither whod be here in the evening the man went on ladling eels wot time yer talkin abaht early on till eight or nine er he gestured to a small girl about fifty yards up the pavement who stood shivering in the cold a box of sweet violets by her bare feet she might have been ten or eleven years old ill take another cup of soup pitt gave the man a second halfpenny and took the cup from the girl thank you he turned to walk away hey i want the cup back the man shouted behind him youll get it pitt said over his shoulder when its empty he approached the flower girl she was only a few years older than jemima with a pinched face and few underclothes beneath her plain dark dress and faded shawl her feet were mottled red and blue with extreme cold he put the cup of soup down on the pavement and fished in his pocket for two more pennies ill have two bunches of violets for my wife he said holding out the coins thank you sir she took the pennies glancing at him out of clear blue eyes then stole a glance at the steaming soup he picked it up and took a sip then set it down again ive bought more than i can eat he said you can finish it if you like she hesitated nothing came into her life without a price i dont want it he repeated very carefully she reached out her hand and picked it up still watching him have you been on this street long he asked knowing as he said it that she was probably too young to be any help to him but he had bought the soup without thinking of cerise two year she replied sipping soup with a slurp and sucking it round her mouth is it busy in the evenings fair are there other traders here some bout two or free who what do they sell theres a woman wot sells combs but she goes early girl wot sells matches sometimes an o course theres im wot sells ot plum duff es ere of an evenin an sometimes theres patterers they moves abaht mostly from seven dials way cause vats were the printers is he did not need to question her he knew what running patterers were men of prodigious memory and usually a nice turn of humor who sold redhot news generally of crime and seduction and if there was nothing sufficiently grisly in truth then they were not above inventing something replete with detail and frequently showing pictures thank you he said civilly picking up the empty cup ill come back this evening he went home for dinner and gave charlotte to her surprise and delight both bunches of violets then at about ten oclock he forced himself to go out again into the freezing fog it was a vile night and there was no one in the street outside the hotel except a fat pastyfaced youth selling hot plum duff a cooked dough filled with sultanas and kept at a good temperature with layers of steaming cloth the youth was well patronized by the men leaving the hotel but after half an hour of standing and stamping his feet to keep the circulation going and a couple of brisk turns round the block pitt had seen none of the women who used the hotel rooms for their trade he questioned the plum duff boy and learned nothing at all the boy had been there five years he thought but he had never noticed a woman in cerise the following night he came again but he was no more successful and the night after that he went instead to the lyceum theatre he spoke to a seller of peppermint water who had seen someone in brilliant pink but could not recall her height and rather thought she had had red hair then after midnight angry with the futility of it all his feet numb in the settling snow and with his collar up round his ears he moved forward amid the din of shouting laughter and occasional jeers as the theater turned out he saw a youth selling ham sandwiches and decided to buy one he was not hungry but he liked ham he pushed his way through the throng jostled by elbows and plump bustles assaulted by the smell of perfume sweat and beery breath till he reached the sandwich man in the street beyond there was a threepence in his pocket but his fingers were too cold to grasp it the youth looked at him expectantly he was thin and there were hectic spots of color in his cheeks it was a wretched living and pitt knew it standing outside in all weather often half the night and to make enough to survive they had to buy the meat on the bone and cook it themselves then cut the sandwiches he made less than a halfpenny profit on each sandwich sold and pitt knew that anything spoiled or lost could wipe out the days takings ill have two please he gripped the threepenny bit at last and produced it the youth gave him two sandwiches and a penny change thank you pitt bit into the first sandwich and found it surprisingly good have you been here long abaht eight hour the boy replied but theyre fresh guv i made em meself he looked anxious theyre excellent pitt agreed with more enthusiasm than he felt for anything except the idea of going home i meant have you had this patch for long for example were you here three or four years ago oh yeah i bin ere since i were fourteen do you ever remember seeing a very beautiful woman in a dark very bright plum pink dress about three years ago very striking woman tall with dark hair please think carefully its very important what sort o woman guv yer mean one o them he inclined his head very slightly towards a lushlooking woman with a pile of loose fair hair and rouge on her plump cheeks yes but more expensive more class one as i saw like that wearing that sort o color looked more like a lady ter methough she were with a gent as was never er usband pitt deliberately quelled his feeling of excitement how do you know gam the boy pulled a face of disbelief e were all over er eyes like limpets e ad an she were leading im on proper all very tasteful like but i seen too many not ter know some folks as class and some asnt but its all the same in the end proper beauty she were though was she buxom pitt made an hourglass in the air with his hands almost losing his sandwich in the process no the youths eyebrows rose in surprise no she werent it were summer an she ad a real low gown an she were right scrawny but ever so elegant tall or short pitt could not keep his voice from rising tall tall as me i reckon at least why she someone you know i ant seen er since then i cant elp yer she must ave moved uptown or got marriedwhich int likely ter be honest wiv yer more like she come to a bad end got some sickness or someone carved er up mebbe she got the pox or the cholera maybe can you describe the man she was with how did she leave which direction did she go you are keen i didnt take no notice o the gent she was wiv cept e were dead elegant as well looked betterclass than most yer get rahnd ere e werent no clerk or tradesman out for an evenin e were definitely a toff come slummin but yer gets a few o them if they wants a bit o relaxation wivout the missus ner anyone as they know asd tell on em where did they go did they go together the youth looked at pitt scornfully course they went together no toff treats no tart to an evenin at the theayter owever classy she is just ter wish er good night on the steps arterwards in a cab or a carriage a cab o course dont take their own carriages ifn theyre out on the sly use a bit o common guv good where is the nearest rank of cabs from here rahnd the corner an baht undred yards down the street thank you and before the youth could express his doubts pitt had disappeared into the swirl of falling snow beyond the canopy of the theater crazy the boy said cheerfully and curled his fingers round the pennies in his pocket am sammiches fresh am sammiches only a penny each over the next two days pitt plowed through the snow feet freezing legs wet from the slush in the gutters as he coughed in the smoke and fog clamped over the city roofs by an icy sky he found every cabdriver from the rank and questioned them all he also found two crossing sweepers who had worked the area at the relevant time one had come up in the world and had an interest in a hot coffee stall the other had found a better crossing none of them could do more than describe cerise and say that she had arrived at the hotel and the theater in a cab and left in one only one cabbie could remember where he had taken her and that was to hanover close pitt returned home so cold he was sick inside his hands and feet hurt and failure seemed to close round him as completely as the thick sourness of the night it was long after midnight and the house was silent only the light just inside the hall was on he put his key in the lock finding it carefully with the tips of his frozen fingers it took him several moments inside it was warm charlotte had banked up the fire and there was a note pinned on the parlor door where he could not miss it dear thomas the kitchen fire is still warm the kettle is full and there is hot soup in the pan if you want it the oddest man came just before dark and left a letter for you he said he knew about the woman in pinki suppose he means cerise he was a running patterer whatever that is i left the letter on the parlor mantelpiece wake me up if i can help love charlotte he pushed open the parlor door and felt for the knob of the gas lamp and turned it up he saw the letter and tore it open ripping out the paper and straightening it dear mr pitt i heard as you been asking around after the woman who wears a strange color of pink and you are very desirous of finding her i know where she is and if you are willing to make it worth my trouble i will take you to her if you are interested come to the triple plea public house in seven dials tomorrow evening about six oclock s smith pitt smiled and folded the letter carefully putting it in his pocket he tiptoed through to the kitchen the following evening he walked slowly through the fine icecold drizzle woolen muffler high round his ears along a gray alley in the district of seven dials he knew why the man had chosen this part of the city it was as the flower girl had said where the news sheets were printed and the natural headquarters of the running patterers they made their living selling news or song sheets by the yard constantly on the move crying the thrills and dramas within their pages most were based on the latest crimethe more gruesome the better occasionally it was love letters of the utmost indiscretion they might be of a famous person an international beauty or more tantalizingly an unnamed lady of this neighborhoodto a gentleman not a hundred miles away if the truth were currently a little flavorless then they had wit and imagination enough to retell some of the old favorites wronged women who murdered either their faithless lovers or the poor infants of the union which well told would bring tears to many a readers eye running patterers were usually men of some enterprise and a keen observation of human nature it did not surprise pitt that it should be one of these who had noticed and remembered cerise the mans occupation was the retelling of tales of passion murder and beautiful women it was bitterly cold and the narrow alleys made funnels for the wind the dim figures pitt passed were hunched forward heads sunk into their shoulders faces averted in doorways sleepers piled together like sacks for the heat of each others bodies the splinters of a broken gin bottle caught a gleam of light from a gas lamp pitt found the triple plea after only one false turn pushing his way through the raucous drinkers in the public bar he reached the counter the landlord in a beerstained calico apron shirt sleeves at half mast looked at his unfamiliar face warily yeah anyone asking for me pitt asked quietly names pitt an why should i know that i int a public service oh but you are pitt forced a civil expression to his face he fished in his pocket and brought out a sixpence and services should be paid for when theyre worth it when someone does ask you tell me meantime ill have a cider the man eyed the money ungraciously pulled a draft cider into a tankard and pushed it across there yare is names black sam an es over in the corner wiv a blue shirt and a brown coatan the ciderll be extra naturally pitt agreed and added another tuppence he took the glass and sipped from it gingerly actually it was rough and sweet and surprisingly good taking a long drink he made his way quite slowly over to the corner indicated his eyes roaming to find the patterer several of the men here were probably of that occupation they were not far from the printing houses and they had the mobile faces the quick eyes and lean figures of men who were constantly on the move he saw a man with an unusually dark complexion and a bright blue shirt sitting over a jar of ale almost immediately their eyes met and pitt knew it was s smith there was an air of waiting in him a restless scanning of faces pitt forced his way through and stopped in front of the cramped table mr smith thats right pitt you said that for a consideration you could help me so i can drink yer cider then when i leave foller me out a minute or two beind dont want ter give folks reason ter think thinkin int good fer em ill be outside on the street opposite i ope yerve brought summink genrous wiv yer i dont give no credit noos is noos an i makes me livin by it sometimes it is pitt said coolly sometimes its lies ive heard plenty of good cocks before a cock was a colorful melodrama invented when real news was slow there were several famous ones making the rounds black sam smiled showing crooked teeth that were surprisingly clean sure but theyre fer entertainin ladies as like a good cry an no arm done if the story is a bitdecorated like thats art quite well id like nature or nothing oh youll get it dont fret and he stood up tipped his mug back and drained it to the last drop set it back on the bench and pushed past pitt without looking at him again a moment later he had disappeared pitt finished his cider without hurrying then edged his way out into the night the fine drizzle had stopped and it was beginning to freeze over there were no stars because of the pall of smoke that hung over the city from the tens of thousands of chimneys he could see the dim outline of black sam on the far curb he crossed over and approached him how much sam said pleasantly without moving if i find the woman in the pink dress and shes the right one half a crown an wots ter stop yer sayin it int the right one pitt had already thought of that my reputation if i fiddle you out of whats rightly yours for services rendered no onell give the information in the future and then i cant do my job sam thought it over for a moment but he was not long in his decision word spread fast among people who lived on the edge between survival and despair and he made his own way by judging people yer on he agreed follow me and at last he straightened up and began to walk with a gait that was a deceptively rapid kind of lope pitt was hard pressed to keep up with him although he was used to being on his feet all day it was with a measured tread even back when he had been a constable now he was accustomed to riding and the patterers speed left him breathless fifteen minutes later they were almost at the far side of seven dials and in a more salubrious neighborhood but still the streets were narrow and a practiced eye could recognize cheap lodging houses and several that were almost certainly used as brothels if cerise were here then she had indeed fallen on hard times since the days of the lyceum and the hotel where the doorkeeper had remembered her the patterer stopped and stood still on the grimy pavement up them stairs black sam said smoothly he might have been on an evenings stroll for any difference the run had made to him knock on the door at the top an ask ter see fred ell tell yer where yer party is ill wait ere and if e does ill trust yer ter come back down an give the the alf crown cant say fairer than that if e dont then weve ad a nice walk fer nuffin pitt hesitated but it was hardly worth the haggling wordlessly he went across to the steps indicated and climbed them slowly making as little noise as possible the door at the top was heavy and closed he knocked hard hurting his knuckles after a moment it opened and a thin youth with a knife scar across his cheek looked at him without interest i want to see fred pitt said standing well back wot fer i int seen you afore business pitt replied get him fred geezer ere for yersays its business the youth shouted pitt waited for several minutes in silence before fred appeared he was rotund redfaced and surprisingly agreeable he smiled toothlessly yeah im looking for a woman in a pink dress very vivid dark pink black sam said you know where i can find her yeah thats right she rents a room orf me now yeah o course now wots the matter wiv yer think im daft is she there now in this room of yours yeah but i dont let just anybody in mebbe shell see yer an mebbe she wont she might already ave company like naturally i dont expect something for nothing what does she look like this woman in pink of yours wot does she look like his pale eyebrows rose up to his nonexistent hairline geez wot do you care you must ave a lot more money than yer look like if yer can afford ter care i care pitt said between his teeth thats what matters to me a good lie came to his mind im an artist now tell me all right all right he shrugged genially if you say so but i dont know why yer want ter paint er shes as thin as a washboard dont ave no bosom and no ips but she as got a face ill give er that she as a curious fine face an black air now make up yer mind an dont stand ere on the doorstep like a fool i ant got the time even if you ave ill see her pitt said instantly i owe black sam let me go and pay him then ill be back to pay you for your trouble then get on wiv it fred urged i got work ter do ten minutes later pitt debts discharged stood in a redcarpeted passageway with faded dirty footmarks along the center and a gas lamp hissing gently on the wall he knocked on the door at the end of the passage nothing happened he knocked again more loudly fred had assured him she was there and he had described her too closely not to know who she was he had spoken of characteristics pitt had not even mentioned a door opened behind him and a large woman with a cascade of blond hair came out a shawl wrapped round her more than ample figure her bare shoulders smooth rippling with fat leave off that racket mister she said curtly yer want in then go in doors not locked dont stand there disturbin everyone i got customers you sound like a raid put people off yes maam he said with a lift of excitement so cerise was actually in there in a moment he would see her and perhaps know the secret of robert yorks death he turned away from the blonde already returning to her customer and twisted the handle of the door she was right it was not locked it opened easily under his hand and he went in the room was more or less what he had expected comfortable but messy overfurnished smelling of perfume fine dust and stale sheets there were too many cushions and too much red the bed was large and rumpled two quilts thrown carelessly so he could not see at a glance whether there was anyone lying under them or not he closed the door behind him when he was standing beside the bed he recognized the human outline of the form and saw a flash of magenta satin a strand of black hair like a loose band of silk the womans face was turned away he was about to address her then realized he had no idea what her name was he had thought of her as cerise when he knew of her she had been on the crest of the wave in three years she had fallen to this she was hardly the same person his excitement on the point of discovery was suddenly shot through with pity the more dashing the more reckless she had been the deeper this reduction cut with its tawdry intimacy she might have been an instrument of treason a murderess or accessory to murder still he felt intrusive now madam he said inadequately she did not move she must be very heavily asleep perhaps even drunk he leaned forward and touched her shoulder under the quilt then shook her very slightly still she did not move he pulled her more strongly turning her over revealing the vivid magenta silk bodice with its low neck and slash of fuchsia she had drunk herself insensible he leant forward taking both his hands to her shoulders and shook her her hair fell back off her face and the quilt slipped at first he could not believe it the head lolled a little sideways unnaturally not with the unresponsiveness of sleep but the limp finality of death her neck was broken it must have been a single blow of great force she was thin he could see now the fragility of her bones it was hard to tell if she had been beautiful without vitality there was only a certain grace of proportion left oh gawd for a moment he thought he had spoken himself then he realized there was someone in the room you bloody fool wot yer go an do that fer poor little bleeder she never done you no arm pitt straightened up slowly and turned to look at fred whitefaced he blocked the door i didnt kill her pitt said impatiently she was dead when i got here youd better go out and find a constable who came in here before i did oh ill send for a rozzeryer can be sure o that fred said savagely but i cant leave you ere gawd knows oo else i might find dead if i did i didnt kill her pitt said between his teeth holding his temper with difficulty i found her dead go and get the police fred remained motionless and o course youll wait ere for me to come back wiv em you must take me fer a fool pitt stood up and moved towards him instantly fred stiffened and his fists came up for the first time pitt realized that for all his apparent civility fred had every intention of stopping him with violence if necessary and he was built to succeed with it i am the police he said abruptly weve been looking for this woman in connection with a murder maybe treason yeah an im the duke o wellington fred was wedged massively in the doorway his arms hanging loosely in case pitt should attempt any sudden attack rosie he shouted without taking his eyes off pitt rosie come ere quick pitt began again i am shut up you fred snapped rosie get yerself ere afore i comes and gets yer the huge blonde appeared wrapped in a voluminous pink sheet and flushed with irritation look fred i pays good rent cos i do the business ere i dont look to get yelled at an disturbed every she stopped sensing something serious wots the matter wot appened this ere geezer done fer the girl wot wears that orrible pink color strangled er by the looks poor little cow rosie shook her head int no call fer that well go an get the rozzers yer fat bitch fred said angrily dont just stand there theres bin murder dont you go callin me names fred bunn she said tartly an i int going lookin fer no rozzers ill send jacko downstairs and wrapping her sheet round her in a more dignified manner she turned her back and went towards the stairs pitt sat down on the edge of the bed there was no point in arguing with fred who was set in his belief when the police came it would all be sorted out fred leaned against the doorpost wot yer want ter go and do that fer he said sadly yer didnt ave to kill er i didnt pitt repeated i wanted her alive i needed to ask her some very important questions oh yeah treason fred snorted well yere original ill say that for yer poor little cow how long has she been here pitt asked he might as well make use of the time i dunno couple o days only a couple of days pitt was surprised where was she before that ow the ell do i know she paid er rent thats all i care about pitt felt inexpressibly weary it was all so pathetic cerise whatever her name really was had had a childhood somewhere then a brief career as a courtesan glittering by night perhaps dangerous even then hidden by day then fortune had changed her looks had faded and she had fallen out of fashion reduced to the status of an ordinary prostitute finally she had had her neck broken in some senseless quarrel in this shabby rented room he turned back to look at her this was the woman who had held such power briefly over robert york and either julian danver or garrard such power that she had entered their houses flouting every convention running desperate risks what if veronica had seen her or loretta or even piers york loretta would not have turned the other way as adeline had she was of far more ruthless mettle she would have tackled robert and told him precisely where he should conduct his amours he looked down at the thin form on the bed her skin was dark almost olive and smooth as an old sepia print over her shoulders but above the brilliant magenta ribbon round her neck it was already coarsetextured and there were fine lines in her face purplish shadows under her eyes the bones were delicate the mouth fulllipped but it was hard to tell now if she had once been beautiful but life could have wrought magic she might have had wit that rare smile that lights a face the gift for listening with the kind of attention that makes the speaker feel for a moment that he is the center of all laughter and wisdom pretty faces were a shilling a dozen charm was something else altogether poor cerise pitt was jerked out of his thoughts by the heavy tramp of feet in the passage beyond freds motionless figure he heard rosies voice shrill and indignant and somewhere a man wailed the constable appeared his blue cape wet with the fine rain and his bullseye lantern at his belt truncheon ready in his hand well he demanded wheres this ere woman you said as was dead then ere fred answered sullenly he did not like policemen and it was grudgingly he conceded the necessity now and this is the geezer wot killed ergawd knows why but i let im in ere quarter hour ago cause e was askin for er most particlar then i as ter come up ere fer suffink else and shes as dead as mutton poor beggar so i sends rosie to tell jacko ter fetch yer shell tell yer the same the constable pushed past fred and stared into the room his round face puckering with a mixture of sadness and distaste he looked at pitt and sighed now wot yer go an do a fing like that fer int yer wife or anyfink like vat is she no or course not pitt said angrily suddenly all the pretense seemed ludicrous im a police officer inspector pitt from the bow street station and weve been looking for this woman for weeks i tracked her down here but i was too late to stop her being murdered she was an important witness the constable looked up and down at pitts knitted muffler his old coat rather shapeless trousers and worn boots disbelief was patent in his face check with bow street pitt snapped superintendent ballarat ill take yer ter seven dials they can send ter bow street the constable said stolidly yer make no fuss and yer wont get urt get nasty an ill ave ter get rough wiv yer he turned to fred oo else as bin up ere since you seen erhe gestured to the dead woman on the bed alive geez a little skinny geezer wiv newgate knockers he said putting his fingers up in a spiral to describe the cheek curls fer clarrie but she came down an fetched em an a baldeaded feller baht fortyish fer rosie an i brought im up ere and saw im inter rosies room but es a reglar so no one else as bin up ere but im an the girls fred finished ask em oh i will you can be sure o vat an yer better all be ere when we wants yer or yerll be unted down an arrested fer idin hevidence in a murderan end up in coldbath fields or newgate he looked at pitt nah you comin quiet or do i ave ter be unpleasant wiv yer gimme yer ands what pitt was startled yer ands mister you take me for a fool i int a walkin yer back through the streets in the dark wivout the bracelets on yer pitt opened his mouth to protest then realized the pointlessness of it and thrust out his hands obediently two hours later sitting in the seven dials police station still manacled he was beginning to feel panic rising hot inside him a message had been sent to bow street and a neatly written answer had been returned yes they knew thomas pitt who answered the description precisely but they could not agree that he had been sent to arrest anyone they knew of no prostitute in a pink dress and as far as they were concerned there was nothing of the sort connected with the case upon which pitt was working he had been assigned to look more carefully into the robbery at the home of piers york in hanover close some three years ago and the murder by an intruder of his son robert york as far as superintendent ballarat knew pitt had failed to discover anything of material interest the officer in charge of this unfortunate murder must handle it with all the justice and dispatch of which he was capable of course superintendent ballarat wished as a professional courtesy to be kept informed of events as they should transpire with the profound hope that thomas pitt was not guilty of anything except foolishness and perhaps the kind of immorality that men fell prey to from time to time nevertheless justice must be done there could be no exceptions when fred had first found him pitt had only been able to think of cerise the futility of finding her when it was too late the shabby reality of death that they had mistaken him for the murderer had seemed farcical at the time but now it was becoming appallingly clear that they did not believe him and all his protestations instead of making the truth obvious were falling uselessly on their ears like the excuses of any other criminal caught redhanded and ballarat had no intention of risking societys indignation and his superiors displeasure by stepping forward to defend pitt or his actions he did not want there to have been treason he did not want to have to investigate the yorks or the danvers or felix asherson and he was only too happy to be rid of the one man who was pressing him to do it if pitt were convicted of murder he would be even more effectively silenced than if he were dead the sweat broke out on pitts skin then chilled instantly leaving him shivering and a little sick what would happen to charlotte emily would see to her financially thank god but what about the disgrace the public shame policemen had few friends a policeman hanged for murdering a prostitute had none at all charlotte would find every hand turned against her neighbors and erstwhile friends would abhor her the underworld that normally had some care for its own who might have given something to an ordinary hanged mans widow would have no pity for a policemans family and daniel and jemima would grow up with the shadow of the gibbet across their hearts always hiding who they were trying to defend him never really knowingpitt stopped these thoughts were unbearable come on the voice yanked him from his inner misery back to the urgency of the present coldbath fields fer you yer cant sit ere all night lets be avin yer he looked up to see the chill boiledblue eyes of a constable regarding him with the kind of loathing that police reserve for their own kind who have betrayed everything they have given their lives to preserve on yer feet gotter learn ter do as yere told you ave charlotte had expected pitt to be late getting home so she went to bed a little before eleven unhappy that things between them were still unresolved she woke with a start in the morning aware even before she opened her eyes that something was wrong there was a coldness a silence she sat up pitts side of the bed was as neat and untouched as it had been when she put the sheets on clean the day before she scrambled out and reached for her robe without any clear idea of what she was going to do perhaps there was a note downstairs could he have come in and had to go out again without time to sleep at all for the moment she dared not think beyond that she did not even bother with slippers and she winced as her bare feet touched the cold floor in the passageway she looked first in the kitchen but there was nothing the kettle was where she had left it and the cups were unused she went to the parlor but there was nothing there either she tried to fill her mind with good reasons for pitts absence so her fears could not intrude he was on the trail of something and so close to victory he could not leave it he had actually made an arrest and was still at the police station there had been another murder and he was so busy with it he could not come home and he had not sent a messenger during the night because he did not want to waken her and no stranger could get in without his keybut her common sense stopped her there there was always the letter box it would have been simple to slip a note in to tell her well any minute now someone would come perhaps even pitt himself she should get dressed she was shuddering with the chill and her bare feet were numb there was no point in standing here gracie would be up soon and the children must have breakfast she turned and went upstairs quickly into the oddly empty bedroom she took off her robe and nightgown still shivering and put on her camisole petticoats stockings and an old dark blue dress her fingers were clumsy this morning and she could not be bothered to do anything with her hair except wind it in a loose coil and pin it up she would wash her face in the kitchen downstairs where the water was hot surely by then there would be a message she had just reached for a rough dry towel and felt its clean abrasiveness on her skin when the doorbell rang she dropped the towel onto the bench accidentally dragging it with her elbow and pulling it onto the floor she ignored it running along the passage to the front door which she flung open a redfaced constable stood on the doorstep misery so heavy in his features that she was instantly afraid her breath stopped mrs pitt he asked she stared at him speechlessly im terribly sorry maam he said wretchedly but i as ter tell yer that inspector pitt as bin arrested fer killin a woman in seven dials e said as er neck was already broke when e found herno doubtin it was ed never do such a fing but fer ve time bein es bin took to the ouse o correction at coldbath fields es all right maam theres no need terter take on he stood helpless unable to offer any comfort he did not know how much she knew of the steel but lies were useless she would find out soon enough its nickname was a corruption of bastille and with good reason charlotte remained frozen at first she felt relief at least he was not dead that had been the fear she had not dared to name then a kind of darkness closed round her as if it were dusk not dawn arrested in prison she had heard more than even pitt knew of the houses of correction like coldbath fields they were the shortterm jails where people were taken before trial or for brief sentences no one could survive for more than a year in them they were crowded brutal and filthy it had been one of aunt vespasias passions to get rid of at least the worst of the epidemic jail fever but surely pitt would only be there for a few hoursa day at mostuntil they realized their mistake maam the constable interrupted anxiously his blue eyes puckered and very earnest mebbe you should sit down maam take a cup o tea charlotte looked back at him in surprise she had forgotten he was still there no her voice seemed to come from far away no ii dont need to sit down where did you say he wasdid you say coldbath fields yes maam he wanted to say something else but the words eluded him he was used to horror and misery but he had never had to tell a colleagues wife that he was charged with murderof a prostitute his face was blurred with pity for her then ill have to take his things she was reaching for a solid idea something practical she could latch on to something she could do to help him shirts clean linen will they feed him yes maam but im sure a little extra wont come amiss if its plain like but ave yer got a brother or someone as could go for yer it int a very nice place fer a lady no i havent ill go myself ill just make sure the maid is up to care for the children thank you constable yer sure maam int nuffin i can do yes im sure leaving him on the step she closed the door gently and walked back towards the kitchen on wobbling legs she bumped into the door lintel on the way in but her mind was so dazed it was moments before the pain of it registered in time there would be a purple bruise but all she could think of now was pitt cold hungry and at the mercy of the warders of the steel very carefully she cut the fresh loaf buttered the slices and then carved the cold meat that was to have done them all for the next two days she wrapped the sandwiches and put them in a basket next she went upstairs and took out his newly laundered underlinen and a good shirt then realized that was foolish and chose the oldest ones instead she was still at the press on the landing when gracie came down from her attic bedroom and stopped on the last stair you lost summink maam charlotte closed the cupboard doors and turned round slowly no thank you gracie i have it i must go out i dont know when i shall be back it may be late i took the meat for mr pitt youll have to find something else for us gracie blinked hugging her shawl closer round her maam you look terrible white as summink appened her little face was pinched with dismay there was no point in lying charlotte would have to tell her soon enough yes they have arrested mr pitt they say he killed some woman in seven dials im going to taketo take some things for him i suddenly she was on the edge of tears she could feel her throat tighten and her voice would not come i always thought some o them constables was daft gracie said with profound contempt now they really as gorn the ole way ooever made that mistakell spend the rest of is life eatin worms an serve im right are you goin ter see the commissioner o police maam they cant know oo they got why there int nobody in lunnon solved more murders than mr pitt sometimes i think some o them couldnt detect an ole in the ground if n they fell in it charlotte smiled bleakly she looked into gracies plain indignant little face and felt reassured yes i will she said more firmly ill take these things to mr pitt first then ill go and see mr ballarat at bow street you do that maam gracie agreed an ill take care o everythin ere thank you thank you gracie and she turned away quickly and hurried downstairs before emotion could overtake her again best not to talk action was easier and infinitely more useful but when she reached the massive gray tower and gates of her majestys house of correction and asked to go in they would not allow her to see pitt a rednosed jailer with a perpetual cold took her basket with the food and the linen promising lugubriously to see that they reached the prisoner but she could not come in it was not visiting hours and no he could not make an exception he would not take a note for her he was sorry but rules was rules there was no argument against such bleak refusal and when she saw the unreachable uninterest in his watery eyes she turned and left walking back along the wet footpath the wind in her face trying to think of what she would say to ballarat temper passed quickly fury at the stupidity and the injustice and she began to think how to be practical what would be the best way to make ballarat act immediately surely a reasoned and calm explanation of the facts he could not know what had happened or he would have done something already he would have contacted the police station which had made such a blunder and pitts release would have been assured as soon as the appropriate message was received she took the next public omnibus which was crowded with women and children she paid her fare to the cad as conductors were known and squeezed in between a fat woman in black bombazine with a bosom like a bolster and a small boy in a sailor suit she tried to occupy her mind by staring round her at the other passengersthe old lady with the withered face and outofdate lace cap the girl in the striped skirt who kept smiling at the youth with the side whiskersbut sooner or later every thought came back to pitt and her terrible sense of being shut off from him the threatening wave of panic at her helplessness by the time she got off in the strand and walked up bow street to the police station charlottes heart was knocking in her chest and her legs felt shaky and uncertain she breathed in and out deeply but that did not steady her she went up the steps tripping on the top one because her feet no longer seemed coordinated she pushed the door open and went in suddenly realizing she had never been here before pitt came here every day and spoke about it so often she had assumed it would look familiar but it was much darker and colder than she had expected she had not imagined the smell of linoleum and polish the worn brass of the door handles the shiny patches on the bench where countless people had rubbed against it waiting the duty constable looked up from the ledger where he was writing in studious copperplate yes maam what can i do for yer he sized up her respectability instantly lorst summat ave yer no she swallowed hard thank you i am inspector pitts wife i should like to see mr ballarat if you please it is most urgent the mans face colored and he avoided her eyes er yes maam ifif yerll wait a few moments ill go an see he closed the ledger put it away under the shelf and disappeared out of the glasspaned door into the passageway she could hear his muffled voice speaking hurriedly to someone beyond she stood on the worn linoleum floor and waited no one came back and she knew they were too embarrassed to face her not knowing what to say it frightened her she had expected anger defensiveness repeated assurances that it must be a mistake and would be put right immediately this evasion must mean either that they doubted pitt themselves or that they dared not express their feelings was there no loyalty among them at all no trust even after all the years they had known him panic rose inside her making her sick without realizing it she stepped forward desperate to make a noise to shout till someone came even to scream the door swung open suddenly and she jumped the same constable looked at her this time meeting her eyes if yerd like ter come this way maam still he did not use her name as if he were ashamed somehow and wanted to pretend she was someone else she stared at him coldly mrs pitt she told him mrs pitt maam he repeated obediently even the tops of his ears turning pink she followed him along the passage up the stairs and across into ballarats large warm office a fire was burning on the grate and ballarat himself was standing in front of the hearth feet slightly apart boots shining come in mrs pitt he said expansively come in and take a seat he waved his arm at the leather easy chair but he did not move to allow her the fire she sat on the edge upright the constable closed the door and fled im deeply sorry that i had to send such a message ballarat began before she could speak it must have been a dreadful shock for you of course it was she agreed but that is hardly important what is happening to thomas dont they realize who he is have you been to coldbath fields and told them perhaps they dont believe a letter certainly they know who he is mrs pitt he nodded several times naturally i made certain of it immediately but im afraid the evidence is quite unarguable i dont want to distress you by recounting it i do think my dear lady it would be better if you were to go home perhaps to your own family and i have no intention of doing anything so perfectly useless as going home to my family she tried to swallow back her fury but her voice was shaking and im perfectly capable of hearing the supposed evidence whatever it is he looked uncomfortable his rather florid face becoming even more mottled ah he cleared his throat to give himself time to order his thoughts if you will allow me to know better that is because you do not understand what it is i assure you it would be far better if you were to leave your interests in my care and go home what are you doing to show his innocence she interrupted fiercely you know he didnt do it you must find the evidence my dear ladyhe held up his hands plump and well manicured the firelight catching a gold signet ringi must abide by the law just like everyone else of course he said carefully and with a patience so obvious she could taste it in the air of course i wish to believe the best of him he nodded again pitt has been a good police officer for years he has served the community in many ways she opened her mouth to retaliate against such condescension but he was not to be interrupted but i cannot override the law if we are to uphold justice we must abide by due process like everyone else he was well launched now we cannot set ourselves above it he opened his eyes very wide naturally i do not for a moment believe pitt would do such a thing but with all the best will in the world i cannot and must not say that i know he smiled very slightly showing the superiority of male reason over emotionalism we are not infallible and my judgment of a man is not enough to clear him before the lawnor should it be she stood up facing him with tight cold rage no one is asking you to be judge mr ballarat she glared at him what i had expected before i met you was that you were loyal enough to fight to defend one of your own men whom you know perfectly well would not have committed such a crime even if you did not know him i would have assumed you would suppose him innocent and do everything to check the evidence over and over again to find the flaws really my dear he said soothingly taking a step forward and then meeting her eyes and stopping really my dear lady you must accept that you do not understand this is police business and we are experts you are a coward she said witheringly he looked startled then regained his composure with a smooth glassy gaze of course you are upset it is to be expected but believe me when you have taken a rest and had a little time to think about itperhaps it would be wise to leave the matter to your father or if you have a brother or brotherinlaw she swallowed hard my father is dead so is my brotherinlaw and i have no brother oh he looked confused an avenue of escape had closed unexpectedly it was damnable that there was no man to take care of herfor everyones sake well he floundered yes she inquired staring at him furiously his eyes wavered and slid away im sure everything will be done that can be mrs pitt but i am also sure you would not wish me to interfere with the law even if i were able he was satisfied with that his tone grew stronger you must compose yourself and trust in us i am perfectly composed she said chokingly and left the second half of the reply deliberately unsaid thank you for your time and without waiting for him to summon any polite parting words or offering him her hand she turned on her heel and went to the door she flung it open and walked out leaving it swinging but anger was a short comfort it died quickly when she was out in the icy street brushed by indifferent people splashed by a passing carriage when she stood too close to the curb gradually as she walked along the strand towards the omnibus stop the meaning of it all sank in ballarat was not going to do anything she had expected him to be only a little less outraged man she wasafter all pitt was one of his own men and probably the best he should have been up in arms doing everything to get this appalling mistake put right instead he was backing out equivocating finding excuses for doing nothing perhaps he was even relieved that pitt had been silenced and how more effectively could pitt be stopped from asking embarrassing questions or unearthing anything that implicated the yorks or the danvers or ballarats superiors at the home office and the diplomatic departments that had been penetrated by treason she stopped short and a man with a tray of pies bumped into her swearing in his surprise im sorry she murmured she stood rooted to the gray footpath as people jostled and grumbled past her could that be it was it conceivable ballarat himselfno surely not he was only weak and ambitious but who had murdered cerise what had she known that was still so dangerous even now that someone had sought her out in a back room in seven dials and broken her neck someone she could still betraythat was obvious and whoever had done it was afraid pitt was too close if it were mere coincidence that she had been murdered just as he reached her then ballarat would be doing everything he could to uncover the truth she started to walk again quickly now she had hold of a definite fact ballarat was part of the conspiracy either because he was implicated or because he was merely weak she thought the latter she and emily must do something about it there must be ways then the chill made her gasp how could she reach emily she was a ladys maid at the yorks she might as well be in france charlotte could not even be sure a letter would be given to her promptly extra extra the newsboys voice cut into her thoughts as he shouted sharp and high extra policeman murders woman in pink extra he stopped next to her ere lady yer wan a paper thomas pitt a famous rozzer killed a he glanced at her face and amended what he had been going to say killed a woman o the streets her voice barely came through her lips no thank you the boy turned away and drew in his breath to shout again then she realized it was foolish to run away from it if she were to be of any use she needed to know yes please yes i will buy one she called after him fishing in her reticule for a coin and offering it to him there yare lady ta he gave her a penny change and went on his way extra rozzer commits orrible murder in seven dials she pushed it under her arm out of the way she would rather look at it alone the omnibus had nearly arrived and when it came she climbed on giving her fare to the cad and sat down this time oblivious of the other passengers when she got off it was raining heavily and she was thoroughly soaked by the time she reached her own front door and got inside she was greeted almost immediately by gracie her eyes redrimmed and her apron filthy charlotte took off her sodden coat and hung it up without caring where it dripped what is it gracie she said impatiently oh maamim terrible sorry gracie was on the edge of tears again her voice thick with crying what mrs biggs as gorn maam never so much as did the floors said she wouldnt work for nobody what murdered women im terrible sorry maami wouldnt a told yer but i ad to say as why she went an she gulped deeply tears running down her cheeks an the butcher wouldnt give no credit as good as said as ow ed sooner we got our meat somewheres else charlotte was stunned she had not even thought of that and here it was so soon she felt breathless and a little sick maam gracie sniffed fiercely but it did not stop her crying suddenly charlotte put her arms round her and they clung to each other letting the tears come in a storm of misery it was several moments before charlotte was able to pull herself together blow her nose and go into the kitchen she splashed her face with cold water and rubbed it dry so fiercely her red eyes hardly showed ordering gracie about was a kind of relief chopping vegetables savagely helped to calm her while she tried to think she told daniel and jemima nothing doing what she could to behave normally daniel was too hungry to be observant but jemima noticed and asked what was wrong i have a cold charlotte said forcing herself to smile dont worry about it she might as well get the initial news over now she was dreading the lies but the sooner she started the less horrible it would be papa wont be home for a few days hes away on a very special job is that why youre unhappy jemima said slowly watching her the closer she could stay to some kind of truth the better yes but dont worrywell keep each other company she tried to smile and knew it was a disaster jemima smiled back and immediately her lip began to tremble she had always been quick to grasp charlottes mood whether she understood it or not she was like a little mirror reflecting gestures expressions tones of voice now she knew there was something wrong yes i will miss him charlotte repeated and i miss aunt emily too since she went on holiday never mind i shall have to be busy and then the time will pass now eat your supper or it will get cold she bent to her own plate forcing herself to spoon down the stew and mashed potatoes although she was barely aware of their taste her throat ached and her stomach felt like stone she was barely finished when the doorbell rang both she and gracie stopped fear returning who could it be for one wild moment charlotte thought perhaps pitt had been released and somehow lost his key then she realized it was far more likely to be some neighbor seeking to confirm the worst full of curiosity and spurious pity or worse another tradesman it rang again more insistently this time she looked at gracie dont ave me answer it maam gracie said urgently ynever know oo it is she stood up reluctantly lessn i can ave yer word ter shut it in their faces if it int nobody good i dont say as i can be civil wiv em you have my permission charlotte agreed open it on the chain yes maam and tightening her apron a little and gritting her teeth gracie disappeared up the passage jemima and daniel stopped eating and they all sat ears straining to hear as grades heels clicked on the linoleum there was a moments silence the rattle of the chain on the door latch a murmur of voices too indistinct to identify then another rattle and returning footsteps charlotte stood up stay here she ordered who is it mama jemima whispered daniel stared at her truculently frightened and ready to fight i dont know stay here and charlotte went out into the passage just in time to meet jack radley as he came whitefaced ahead of gracie he put out his arms and she walked straight into them he held her tight saying nothing at all and gracie squeezed past with a little sniff of relief she thought very highly of charlotte but it always needed a man to sort things out properly thank heaven one had come charlotte disengaged herself reluctantly she could not stand here pretending someone else could mend everything come into the kitchen she said there was no fire in the parlorgracie had not even thought of itand the weather was too bitter to take anyone into an unheated room gracie youd better take the children up and get them ready for bed i havent had any pudding daniel said with burning injustice it was on the tip of charlottes tongue to tell him he would have to do without until she looked at his face and saw the fear in it blind knowing only that she was frightened too and his world was threatened she made an intense effort and controlled her own feelings youre quite right and i forgot to make any im very sorry will you accept a piece of cake instead if i bring it upstairs for you he regarded her with great dignity yes i will he conceded and climbed down from his chair thank you when they had gone she looked at jack i read it in the newspaper he said quietly for gods sake what happened i dont know a constable came this morning and told me thomas had been arrested for killing a prostitute in seven dials it must be cerise i bought a newspaper myself but i havent had time to look at it yet i darent take it out jemima can read ill look at it this evening and then put it straight into the stove id put it in the stove now he said biting his lip theres nothing in it you want to read he went into seven dials to find the woman in cerise he said he was told where she was by a running patterera man who sells news storiesand when he went into the house he was shown upstairs to her room he says he found her dead neck broken and the people in the house say she was all right when they last saw her and no one else went up except regulars and they are all accounted for that cant be true of course it cant theyre lying and i daresay well paid for it but for the time being they wont be shaken its going to take some workbut well do it only this time we dont have pitt to help us she sat down again on one of the kitchen chairs and he took gracies jack i dont know where to begin i went to see mr ballarat i was sure he would be moving heaven and earth to find the truth and all he did was talk to me as if i were a child and tell me to go home and leave everything to him only id swear he isnt going to do anything at all jack she hesitated wondering if what she was thinking would sound hysterical to him but what alternative did she have jack i think he wants thomas to stay in prison hes afraid of him she expected disbelief and hurried on to explain herself hes afraid of what thomas will uncover thats embarrassing to people who matter the yorks and the danvers or the people in the home office ballarat wants to sweep the whole lot under the carpet he hopes if he says nothing it will all go away and hed rather that and that someone should get away with treason and murder than be the one who has to expose what everyone will hate people can be very unjust they can hate the person who makes them see what they would prefer not to who topples idols and shows their clay feet they blame them for the truth and the responsibility it leaves us we dont often forgive those who destroy our illusions ballarat doesnt want to be that person and he will be by implication if thomas discovers what cerise knew thats why they killed herit has to be of course it has he agreed he reached out across the table and took her hands quite gently it was in no way a familiarity just friendship and she found herself gripping him back hard hanging on do you want me to fetch emily he asked yesplease do i dont trust myself to go to the yorks she searched for an excuse youll have to tell her its family illness or something i dont know how youll explain knowing her but you can scrape up a good lie before you get there the thought of seeing emily was such a relief almost like someone lighting a fire in a cold room perhaps she would even come and stay with charlotte they could work together as they had done in the past on other cases ones that mattered infinitely less than this then what would you like me to do he asked ive never tried detecting before and this is a damn sight too important for amateurs but ill do whatever i can i dont know where to begin she said her misery returning cerise is dead apart from the murderer she may be the only one who knew the truth well at least we know she wasnt the murderer herself he pointed out someone killed her and it would be too much to assume its coincidence just as thomas found her and we must suppose someone almost certainly the same person killed poor dulcie she stared at him that means someone in the york house or one of the danvers or felix or sonia asherson thats right but what would any of them be doing in a place like seven dials murdering cerise to keep her silent he answered very quietly his face more somber than she had ever seen it there was an anger in him a weight she had not found before i think that means they knew where she was all the time he went on they could hardly have run into her by chance one of the yorks the danvers or the ashersons she said again emily she stopped emily was alone in the york house unable to defend herself except by a disguise of ignorance and pitt was imprisoned in coldbath fields awaiting trial for murder both could end in death but emily was free at least she could fight for herself but surely justice the truth ballarat would she must stop behaving like a child deceiving herself into comfort finding excuses to avoid the painful ballarat would do nothing ive changed my mind she said quietly dont ask emily to come home the only way she can help thomas is by staying where she is whoever murdered cerise and robert york and dulcie is in hanover close and the only way we are going to find that person is by watching them so closely we see what emotions lie behind the facades who is frightened who is lying he sat still for a moment she was afraid he was going to argue point out the dangers to emily perhaps even tell her all the accidents that could be made to happen but he said nothing you and i can keep going as often as possible she went on but we can never see them in their unguarded moments as she can have you any idea how much a woman trusts her ladys maid for the first time he smiled i imagine about as much as a man trusts his valet he answered or perhaps a trifle more women spend more time at home and on the whole give more attention to appearance there was another aspect that needed explaining charlotte realized jack she probably wont see a newspaper maids dont especially if there is something sensational in it the butler will keep it from them she saw the surprise in his face of course he will he wont want all his maids swapping horror stories under the stairs and up half the night with nightmares it was plain from jacks face that he had never thought of that and she realized with a brief shadow of pity that he had very few roots he was an eternal guest never a host too wellbred to be poor but without the means to keep up with his peers but there was no time for such issues now then she remembered that already one of her own servants had left and if pitt was not cleared very soon there would be pressure on gracie too her mother would try to persuade her to find a better place and come to think of it charlotte had no money and she would not be able to keep gracie anyway or anyone else she had enough of her allowance from her own inheritance to eat at least for a few weeksthe fear loomed up again she was not only afraid of isolation and insufficient means but worst of all life without pitt there was not even time to make up for the stupid arguments to be to him all the things she wanted to be she must not think of it it would destroy her she took a long breath her lungs hurting as if the air were sharp she must fightanybody and everybody if necessary please ask emily to stay there she repeated i will jack hesitated and for the first time he looked awkward his eyes avoiding hers scanning the tabletop the row of blueringed dishes on the dresser beyond charlottehave you any money she swallowed for a while its going to be hard i know he colored faintly i can give you a little she shook her head no thank you jack he searched for words dontdont let pride its not pride she assured him im all right for now and when im not please god she would have found the murderer by then and pitt would be free when im not emily will help ill go and tell her ill say its a family illnesstheyll let e in for that even the butler wouldnt be martinet enough to deny anyone the right to that sort of news but how will you explain knowing it youll have to explain that or theyll be suspicious always at the front of her mind was the necessity to learn the truth before everything else they wont leave you alone with her you know therell be the housekeeper there or the other ladys maid for propriety if nothing else he looked taken aback for a moment then he brightened write a letter ill say its from her family explaining the situation she can ask for a day off to come and visit you on your sickbed half day she corrected automatically she hasnt been there long enough for one yet but they might give it to her on grounds of compassion please do jackgo today ill write a letter straightaway and ill tell her to burn it as soon as shes read it there are plenty of fires she stood up even as she was speaking and went hastily into the parlor turning up the lights not noticing how cold it was till her fingers touched the icy surface of the desktop she took out paper ink and pen and began to write dearest emily something completely appalling has happenedthomas found cerise but she was already dead someone broke her neck and they have arrested him for her murder they have taken him to the steel in coldbath fields to await trial i went to mr ballarat but he will do nothing either they have told him to leave it alone or he is simply a coward and is only too glad to be rid of thomas before he unearths something embarrassing about someone in power it is all up to us now there is no one else please stay where you are and be very very careful remember dulcie half of me wants to beg you to come home with jack immediately tonight so you will be safe the other half knows you and i are thomass only chance he must have been close on the trail of someone very powerful and very dangerous please emily be careful i love you charlotte she blotted it rather clumsily it was scribbled and her fingers were stiff then without rereading it she folded it not very straight and slipped it into an envelope she sealed it put the top back on the ink and turned the gas down before going back to the kitchen she gave the letter to jack ill be back tomorrow he promised we must plan she nodded overwhelmed with loneliness now that he was going with him here she did not feel so frightened even with gracies loyalty and the children she would be alone when he was gone then there would be time to think and nothing to do all the long cold night she dreaded waking in the morning good night she forced the moment to come because waiting for it was worse and she did not want to weep again it was pointless and too hard to stop good night now at the point of going he also seemed reluctant he was worried for her and she knew it perhaps he really did love emily what an unspeakable way to discover it jack hesitated a moment more then as he could think of nothing further to say turned and went to the door she followed to let him out and watched him step into the street where the wet cobbles shone in the dim gaslight globes hung like baleful moons in haloes of rain he touched her cheek gently then walked rapidly away towards the main road and the passing hansoms she was so tired she should have slept well but her dreams were filled with fear and she woke up many times fighting for breath her body aching with tension and her throat sore the darkness seemed interminable and when at last the gray dawn came with rain beating on the window it was a relief to get up she was so tired she fumbled with her gown when she went downstairs to draw the pitcher of hot water then changed her mind and washed in the kitchen anyway it was warmer before dressing she decided to have a cup of tea the taste of it would wash away some of the gritty feeling and its heat might wash out the tightness in her throat she was still sitting at the kitchen table when gracie came in also in her dressing gown her hair down over her shoulders she looked like a child charlotte had never noticed how threadbare her nightclothes were before she must get her new onesif she could ever afford it again she wished she had done it sooner gracie stood still eyes wide afraid to speak and uncertain what to say but her gaze was perfectly steady and hot with loyalty she longed to ask charlotte if she was all right but did not dare in case it seemed impertinent have a cup of tea before we begin charlotte offered the kettles still just about boiling thank you maam gracie accepted with some awe she had never in her life before sat at the kitchen table taking tea in her nightgown but from then on the day got worse the bakers boy did not call but passed on down the street the fishmongers boy on the contrary rang loudly presented the account up to date and demanded payment in full with the warning that should madam be buying fish in futurewhich he appeared to doubtall transactions would be strictly for payment in cash and on delivery gracie told him to be about his business and all but boxed his ears on the doorstep but she was sniffing fiercely and her eyes were red when she came back to the kitchen charlotte thought of sending her for bread then realized how unfair that would be and perhaps rash obviously her loyalty was intense and she would retaliate against any jibes even if only overheard charlotte was older and surely could learn to keep the peace she should not hide behind a girl the experience was worse than she expected she had never been more than civil to most of her neighbors they knew from her speech her manner the quality of her clothesthough cut down from previous yearseven the sight of emilys carriage now and then that charlotte was not of their background or stock on the surface they were civil even friendly from time to time but resentment lay close under the surface fear of the different envy of privilege though most of it was long in the past now it was not forgiven she walked down the pavement with the wind pulling at her coat and the rain soaking her skirts she was glad to reach the corner and the shelter of the grocers shop as she went in the door the few women inside stopped talking and stared at her one of them had a son who was a petty thief serving six months in the scrubs she hated all police and now was her chance to gain a little revenge with impunity no one could blame her for it nor defend the wife of a man who imprisoned other men and then murdered a prostitute himself she glared at charlotte hitched her basket onto her hip and walked out of the shop passing her so roughly that charlotte was nearly knocked off balance bruising her and leaving her startled by the suddenness as much as the pain the other women tittered with amusement good mornin mrs pitt im sure one of them said loudly an ow are we today then not so igh an mighty take our turn with the rest will we good morning mrs robertson charlotte replied coldly i am quite well thank you is your mother better i heard she caught a chill in the rain shes poorly the woman said taken aback that charlotte had not retaliated more in kind whats it ter you nothing at all mrs robertson except good manners charlotte answered have you finished your purchases no i avent you wait yer turn and she moved to stand square in front of the counter again her eyes roving slowly over the shelves deliberately taking as long as she could there was nothing for charlotte to do but contain her temper and wait the grocer shifted from one foot to the other weighing where his profit lay and chose the obvious he ignored charlotte and smiled toothily at mrs robertson ill ave alf a pound o sugar she said with satisfaction tasting power like a sweet in her mouth hif you please mr wilson the grocer dipped into his sack and put half a pound little by little into the scales then emptied it into a blue paper bag and gave it to her i changed me mind she glanced at charlotte maliciously and then back at the grocer im feelin rich this mornin ill ave an ole pound yes mrs robertson o course the grocer weighed another half pound carefully and gave it to her the door opened and the bell rang as another woman entered and took her place behind charlotte an ill ave some pears soap mrs robertson added fer the complexion its very good int it mrs pitt is that wot you use not that yerll be able ter afford it now come down in yer ideas a bit wont yer possibly but it takes more than a bar of soap to make a beauty mrs robertson charlotte said coldly did you ever find your umbrella no i didnt mrs robertson said angrily theres a lot o people round ere int as honest as they makes out i reckon as somebody stole it charlotte raised her eyebrows call a policeman she said with a smile the woman glared at her and this time it was the other woman who sniggered under her breath but the verbal victory was brief and gave her no pleasure and at the bakers it was worse no jibes only silence until she was leaving when there were whispers behind hands and a nodding of heads she was asked for cash and it was counted carefully before being put into the till with a snap if things became hard there would be no credit for her she knew without askingno allowances and probably from now on no deliveries the greengrocer made some excuse about being short of help even though there was a boy standing idle over the sack of potatoes obviously waiting for something to do and charlotte had to carry her heavy bags home herself a boy of about nine or ten ran past her yelling haya rozzers in the steel theyll ang im fer sure dingle dangle see im dance and did a little skip in and out of the gutter she tried to ignore him but the words struck black terror in her and by the time she got home soaking wet her arms aching shoulders dragging with the weight of her purchases she was close to despair she was barely inside and had just taken off her wet boots and was setting them near the stove in the kitchen when she heard the front doorbell gracie looked at her and without being asked went to open it she came back a moment later her feet light along the passage her skirt swishing round the door maam maam its your mama mrs ellison shall i bring er through ere its terrible cold in the parlor ill make yer a cup o tea then ill go upstairs an get on wiv the bedrooms charlotte felt little of gracies trust she was much less certain of what caroline would have to say she stood up quickly yesyes youd better there was no alternative she could not ask anyone to sit in the freezing parlor nor could she bear to herself her wet feet were still numb and the edges of her skirts were steaming as the kitchens warmth reached them ill make the tea she added it would give her something to do and it would allow her an excuse to turn her back yes maam gracie disappeared her feet tiptapping lightly on the linoleum caroline came in having already divested herself of her coat and since she had naturally come in a carriage she was not wet except for the soles of her neat highbutton boots oh my dear she held her arms open perfunctorily because there was nothing else to do charlotte responded holding her for only a moment before stepping back ill make us a cup of tea she said quickly ive only just come in myself and im perished and wet charlotte my dear you must come home caroline sat down a little gingerly on one of the kitchen chairs no thank you charlotte said instantly she reached for the kettle and filled it setting it on the hob but you cant stay here caroline argued her voice ringing with reason the newspapers are full of the story i dont think you realize i realize perfectly charlotte contradicted her if i hadnt before i went to the shops i certainly do now and i am not running away darling its not running away caroline stood up and came over as if to touch her again then sensed her daughters resentment you must face reality charlotte you have made a mistake which has turned out tragically for you if you come home now take your maiden name again i can charlotte froze i will not how dare you suggest such a thing youre speaking as if you imagined thomas were guilty she turned round slowly cups and saucers in her hands for the childrens sake you can take them if you will if you wont then theyll have to stay here as any ordinary mans would have to im not ashamed of thomasim ashamed of you for wanting me to run away and deny him instead of fighting i am going to find out who killed that woman and prove it just as i did for emily when they thought she murdered georgefor which she had far more reason caroline sighed and kept her patience which made it worse my dear that was quite different she began oh why because she is one of us and thomas isnt carolines face tightened if you insist on putting it that wayyes well youve been glad enough to have him one of us when you needed him charlotte could feel herself close to losing control and it made her furious both with herself and with caroline you must be realistic caroline began again you mean desert him quickly so people can see i have nothing to do with it charlotte demanded how honorable you are mama how brave charlotte im only thinking of you are you charlottes disbelief was strident because she thought what caroline said was probably honest it was what other people would think too and it terrified her she did not care if she was being unjust she wanted to hurt are you sure you arent thinking of the neighbors and what your friends will say about you she went on mimicking their voices savagely you know that nice mrs ellison well youll never believe it but her daughter married a policemanisnt that dreadfuland now hes gone and committed a murder i always said no good comes of marrying beneath you charlotte i didnt say that but you thought it you are being quite unfair and the kettle is boiling you are filling the kitchen with steam and itll boil dry for goodness sake make the tea and have a cup perhaps you will be able to think a little more clearly loyalty to thomas is all very well but it is selfindulgent this has happened and you must be practical and think of the children she was quite right at least in that the room was filling with steam charlotte made the tea burning her hand on the kettle and refusing to admit it she set the teapot on the table and fiddled furiously in the cupboard for biscuits when she found them she spilled them onto a plate and set it down then poured the tea and passed it finally she sat down hardly more composed i would be very grateful if you took the children she said carefully it would protect them fromfrom the worst at least she stopped she had been going to say for the time being and even that thought was a betrayal of course caroline said quickly and as soon as you want to come too you know there is always a place for you iamnotcoming charlotte said very slowly and deliberately then go and stay with emily in the country caroline urged her thomas would understand he wouldnt expect you to stay here what can you do make a show of being brave and letting everyone know you believe he is innocent my dear it will only get you hurt and it will make no difference at all in the end leave it to the police charlotte felt the tears running down her face she fished out a handkerchief and blew her nose then took a sip of her tea before replying she could hardly tell her mother that emily was no more in the country than pitt was the police are perfectly happy to leave it as it is she said coldly thomas has discovered something they would prefer not to know i have no wish to join emily i have written to her of course but i am a very good detective myself i shall discover who killed robert york and it will be the same person who killed this woman in pink my dear you cannot know what really happened or why thomas was in seven dials with thisthis woman in pink carolines face was very pale we dont know really as much about our husbands as we sometimes imagine out of her own pain charlotte was deliberately cruel you mean as you didnt know about papa caroline flinched and the words died before they reached her lips charlotte was sorry but it was too late but he didnt kill those girls did he she said finishing what she had begun no and i was grateful to the police for proving it caroline admitted but i could not give back the knowledge of what he had done nor ever stop wondering at how little i had known him how much i simply thought i did dont press for the truth charlotte you would be much wiser to leave it to the police and hope they will tell you only what you have to know if that is the best you can offer it would be better if we did not discuss it charlotte stood up leaving the rest of her tea ill go and pack some things for the children and you can take them with you now it will be easier than saying long goodbyes anyway theres no point in your going and then having to come back for them thank you i appreciate it and without waiting for caroline to offer any answer she went straight out of the kitchen and upstairs leaving her mother at the table with the teapot and the biscuits after caroline was gone taking daniel and jemima with her holding onto their hands as she had with charlotte and emily when they were children charlotte felt truly ashamed she had been unjust she had expected caroline to understand things that were completely outside her world but her mother did not have charlottes experience and it was both unfair and stupid to suppose she could think as charlotte did it was not so long ago pitt had had to be patient with her excuse her prejudices and assumptions and what was worse she had reminded caroline of pain disillusionment that still cut deep tarnishing old memories whichnow that edward was deadwere all she had charlotte had known what she was doing and done it just the same when this was all over charlotte would say something to her now she was too frightened too worried to find the words or to trust herself to deliver them she started by being practical how much money was there and what had to be done with it if it came to a choice between food and coal how should she portion out the resources the best thing was to check the cellar and see what there was from now on it would be more potatoes and bread and less meat she would have to ask gracie where the cheapest places were to shop jack came a little before three it was heavily overcast and the light was already beginning to fade gracie let him in and he went straight to the kitchen i saw emily he said immediately i told the butler a wonderful lie about her sister being ill and that i knew it through lady ashworth for whom emilysorry for whom amelia had worked before they swallowed it all he swung his coattails aside elegantly out of habit and sat down at the table he looked at charlotte very soberly she agreed to stay there in fact she insisted i hope to god shell be all right ive racked my brain for some way to protect her but i cant think of anything shes got a half day off on saturday and she said shell meet you in hyde park on the first seat as you go in nearest hanover close at two in the afternoon regardless of the weather until then what can i do i dont know charlotte admitted i went to the prison yesterday but they wouldnt let me see thomas i only know what i read in the newspapers i went out and got them all he could not keep the anxiety from his face they say he asked people all over the city where he could find cerise several street sellers will swear to that it seems the running patterer who actually took him to seven dials only watched pitt go in he didnt go in himself it was a brothel of sorts and the landlord says pitt asked him to describe the woman very closely and only wanted to see her if she was the right one the landlord took him up no one else passed and when the man went up a few minutes later he found pitt bending over with his hands around her neck he was very pale im sorry she searched his face but his gaze did not waver then theres no point in going to seven dials she said as calmly as she could not that i ever thought there would be the answer is in hanover close i must go and see veronica york again will you take me of course and ill take you to coldbath fields as well you shouldnt go alone thank you she tried to think of something else to say and failed this time she was allowed into the prison a great cold place whose massive walls were like misery set in stone condensation making even the inner corridors feel cold and sour everywhere was the smell of human sweat and stale air the warden did not look at her as he spoke and she was led into a small room with a scarred wooden table and two upright chairs this privilege was granted only because pitt was still technically an innocent man it took all the strength she possessed not to weep when she saw him his clothes were dirty the clean shirt she had brought him was already torn and there were bruises on his face she dared not imagine what there might be on his body that she could not see neither wardens nor prisoners had any love for a policeman turned murderer the warden commanded charlotte and pitt to sit at opposite sides of the table while he stood upright in the corner like a sentry and watched them for several moments she just sat and stared it would be ridiculous to ask him how he was he knew she cared that was all that was necessary and there was nothing she could do to alter any of it then the emotion became too strong and she spoke simply to break the tension mama has taken the children it will be easier for them and for me gracie is wonderful i sent a letter to emily jack radley took it to her i asked her to stay where she isdont argue with me it is the only way we shall learn anything charlotte you must be careful he leaned forward then as the jailer stepped towards them realized the uselessness of it you must get emily out of thereits too dangerous he said urgently someone has already killed three times to keep the silence over what happened that night in hanover close you mustnt go again send a letter to say you are sick or that youre going back to the country that would be better promise me leave it to ballarat hell handle it now they havent told me who hes put on the case but whoever it is will come and see me and ill tell him all i know we must be getting close for them to have killed cerise promise me charlotte her hesitation was only momentary she would defend him in whatever manner necessary and by whatever means she could find she did not stop to think or weigh judgment any more than she would have done had daniel or jemima been in the street in front of a runaway horse it was as instinctive as gasping for breath when the water closes over your head yes thomas of course she lied without a flicker emily will stay with me for a while or ill stay with her dont worry about any of us well be perfectly all right anyway im sure mr ballarat wont take long to discover the truth he must know perfectly well that you couldnt have killed cerise whyever should you some of the fear eased out of his face and he tried to smile good he said quietly at least i know youre all right thank you for your promise there was no time for guilt the hangman waited she smiled back of course she said with a gulp dont worry about us emily watched the ashes of charlottes letter crumbling in the morning room fire and felt a numbness a sense of disbelief invade her mind it was impossible thomas arrested for murder and imprisonedit was absurd any moment now reality would reassert itself she should not have burned the letter she must have misread it she looked at the red hollow in the coals where the paper had collapsed there were only little incandescent folds left and even as she watched the draft caught them and they shivered to pieces and were consumed the door opened behind her and the butler came in are you all right amelia he said gently there was concern in his voice even something close to a personal tenderness dear god she could not be coping with that now yes thank you mr redditch she said gravely my sister has been taken ill yes so mr radley said it was very good of him to come lady ashworth must think most highly of you what is it your sister suffers from she had not even thought of that i dont know she answered helplessly thethe doctors dont knowthats what is so worrying thank you for letting me have saturday afternoon its very good of you not at all my dear girl edith can cover for you goodness knows youve covered for her often enough now you go into the kitchen and sit down take a cup of tea and recover yourself he touched her arm gently and his hands were warm thank you mr redditch she said quickly sir he stepped back reluctantly if there is anything i can do please feel you may ask he added she wanted to thank him to smile and meet his eyes let him know his kindness was not unnoticed but she dared not it might only cause more hurt in the end i will sir she said looking down at her apron and ill go and get a cup of tea as you said thank you and she hurried past him out into the hall through the baize door and into the kitchen she sat in the kitchen with the large round teacup in her hands her mind whirling as she tried to think what to do her first instinct was to rush to charlotte to be with her to protect her from the jeers the doubts and to be with her in the long evenings when there was nothing else to interrupt the fear but charlotte was right pain was incidental it must be overcome alone if need be because there was no time for comfort they could not afford to huddle together for todays hurt at the cost of tragedy which would darken all tomorrows the answer was in the truth and that lay here in hanover close as amelia emily was the only one with any chance of finding it she could no longer allow things to progress at their present pace obviously it all had to do with the woman in cerise and whatever had happened here in this house three years ago perhaps it had been between her and robert york maybe there had been a third person but emily believed one of the women who was here now either knew or suspected the truth and she was determined to wring it from her somehow what made people crack shock panic overconfidence pressure gradually increased until it was unbearablethat was it there was no time to wait for mistakes to happen three years had accomplished nothing and loretta certainly was not one to give way to carelessness her guard was impenetrable one had only to look at her bedroom with its tidy drawers everything in its place all her gowns with their matching boots and gloves to know that her underwear was extremely expensive but it was all coordinated nothing odd or impulsive her dinner gowns were individual highly feminine but there were no experiments none of the errors of judgment emily had in her own wardrobe attempts to imitate someone elses panache that had not quite worked shades that had not flattered after all there was nothing in the entire house that did not suit loretta either among her personal belongings or in the general furniture loretta did not make mistakes veronica was different a generation younger and far more beautiful by nature she had more flair more courage sometimes she ordered things on impulse and they were marvelousthat black gown with the jetencrusted bodice was superb better than anything loretta could ever wearbut the gray silk was a disaster loretta would have known that and never run the risk sometimes veronica was uncertain full of selfdoubt and that made her rash she tried too hard emily had been amazed at first to see her change her mind as to what she would wear or how she would dress her hair yes veronica might well break under pressure if it was severe enough sustained enough it was a cruel thought and an hour ago emily would not have entertained itbut an hour ago she did not know thomas was in prison awaiting trial for his life she regretted her decision but she did not consider any other she finished her tea thanked the cook for it with a meek smile and set out to go upstairs and begin the first thing she did was to find a pair of veronicas boots which needed resoling to give her an excuse to go out a breath of fresh air and a walk would be a kind of freedom and she was longing just to be alone to move swiftly without being closed in by walls she had never realized before how little time a maid ever had unwatched or supervised by someone and even in weather like this she missed the opportunity to be outside to see the sky other than in tiny pieces blocked off by the frame of a window the claustrophobia of being available all the time of having her solitude or her company ordered for her was increasingly difficult to bear even though there was a certain pleasure in sharing the evenings the simple humor and at times a little fun but the main purpose was to be able to account for her news when she returned today no one questioned her as she left with the boots under her arm at five oclock emily was back and in veronicas room laying out clean linen when veronica came in im so sorry about your sister amelia she said immediately youre very welcome to take saturday afternoon off to go and visit her if she should get any worse please tell me yes maam emily said solemnly thank you very much im hoping shell get better and there are people with worse troubles i just took your black boots to the cobblers and i heard them say down there that that policeman who came here about the stolen silver and things has been charged with murdering a woman in a magenta pink dress to do with some investigation he was on she stopped staring at veronicas face which was suddenly bleached of every vestige of color it was exactly what she had hoped for and although she was perfectly capable of pity it did not make the slightest difference to her continuing that must be the same man that upset you so much maam no wonder i suppose we should all be grateful he didnt lose control of himself with you or heaven knows you might be like that poor woman except of course i cant imagine you wearing such an unflattering color from the description it was wicked stop it veronicas voice rose close to a scream stop it what does it matter what color she wore her face was white as a sheet her eyes glittering you are talking about a human being whos been murdered life just snatched emilys hands flew to her face oh maam oh maam im terribly sorry i clean forgot about mr york oh i am so terribly sorryplease forgive me ill do anything she stopped as though she were too upset to speak and simply gazed at veronica through her spread fingers did her dreadful pallor reflect the memory of roberts death or was it a sign of guilt surely there was panic in her expression had veronica known cerise and did she know now who had killed her for several seconds they stood staring at each other veronica in shocked silence emily studying her through wide eyes affecting abject contrition at last it was veronica who spoke she sat down on the side of the bed and emily automatically began to undo her boots for her ii didnt know anything about it veronica said very quietly i dont see the newspapers and papainlaw didnt mention it did they describe her this womanshe swallowedin pink oh yes maam emily recalled everything she could of the descriptions of cerise she was tall rather on the thin side not at all fullfigured especially for aa woman of pleasure but she had a very beautiful face she looked up from the boots buttonhook in hand and saw veronicas horrified eyes her protruding leg was rigid and her knuckles on the side of the bed were white and of course she was wearing that peculiar color of very violent magenta pink emily finished i think cerise is the right name for it veronica made a little sound as if she were about to cry out but tension strangled the word in her throat you look terrible shocked maam emily said ruthlessly they say she was a woman of the streets so perhaps shes no worse off quicker than disease amelia you sound as if oh no maam emily protested nobody deserves to die like that i only meant her life was pretty wretched anyway i know girls who have lost their places been dismissed without a character and had to go on the streets like that they usually die young either of working twenty hours a day or the pox or someone kills them she kept on watching veronicas face and knew she had touched a deep pain a wound that was still bleeding she turned the probe that policeman said he was questioning her about a crime he was investigating perhaps she knew who broke in here and killed poor mr york no it was a whisper little more than a sigh of breath forced between the lips emily waited no veronica seemed to collect her strength policemen must have more than one case at a time what on earth would a woman like that know of thisof this house maybe she knew the thief maam emily suggested perhaps he was her lover for some unfathomable reason veronica smiled it was ghastly like a rictus but there was the shadow of bitter humor in her eyes perhaps she said softly emily knew by some change in the air a difference in the tensions of the body that the immediate weakness was past she would get no more from veronica now she finished with the boots took them off and stood up would you like me to draw you a bath before dinner maam or would you prefer to lie down perhaps with a hot tisane i dont want a bath veronica stood up and went to the window she spoke with growing decision go and make me a tisane and fetch a slice of bread and butter from the kitchen in fact two slices emily had a strong idea it was not so much the bread veronica wanted as an excuse to be rid of her but she had no choice but to obey she fairly ran along the passage and down the stairs earning a sharp word of reproof from the housekeeper for her unseemly behavior yes mrs crawford sorry mrs crawford she slowed down to a more dignified walk until she was out of sight through the green baize door then quickened into a scamper again she asked cooks permission as a matter of policy then put on a kettle and sliced the bread and butter so rapidly she made a mess of the first piece it was too thin and fell to bits ere mary said helpfully you got ands like a navvy today let me do it for yer and she cut two waferthin slices buttering each on the loaf first a trick which emily had not learned thank you bless you emily said with real gratitude then hopped from one foot to the other waiting for the kettle to boil but she had learned her lesson and she did not spill it sright mary said approvingly more aste less speed emily flashed her a smile picked up the tray and went back upstairs with it as quickly as her long skirts would allow unable as she was with her hands full to hold them up she stopped outside the bedroom door hearing a murmur of voices but even standing motionless her cheek to the panel she could hear no distinct words to disturb whoever was within might cut short the very conversation she must overhear the dressing room she put the tray down and very softly tried the handle of the dressing room door making sure the latch did not click she swung it open picked up the tray and put it inside on the chest of drawers closing the door soundlessly the door to the bedroom was closed she had done it herself out of habit now she needed to open it so fractionally the movement would not catch the eye of anyone in the bedroom even if they were facing it of course if they saw the handle move it would all be over she would be caught eavesdropping without a shadow of an excuse she bent to the keyhole and put her eye to it but she could see only the comer of the bed and a small edge of blue skirt over the chair it was only the dress laid out for the evening but she could hear the voices much more clearly the answer was obvious she must kneel with her ear to the keyhole carefully she took a pin out of her hair and put it on the floor as an excuse if she were caught then she knelt to listen but who was it veronicas voice was desperate thick with something very close to panic lorettas answer came back reassuringly gentle my dear i cannot even guess but it has nothing whatever to do with us how could it but the dress veronica cried that color the words seemed to cause her physical pain the dress was magenta pull yourself together loretta snarled you are behaving like a fool for a moment there was silence and emily wondered if loretta had slapped her as one does with hysterics but there was no gasp no indrawn breath no sharp sound of flesh on flesh veronicas voice shuddered and the next words were forced through sobs who was she a harlot loretta replied with icecold contempt exactly what she seemed to be i should imagine although god knows why that idiot policeman should have broken her neck veronicas question was so soft emily strained to hear it her shoulders hunched to keep her ear to the lock did he motherinlaw was it he emily did not even notice the cramp in her knees or the aching muscles in her neck nothing was further from her mind than the tea getting cold on the chest of drawers she could hear no sound in the room not even a rustle of silk well i assume so loretta answered after what must have been only seconds but seemed an age apparently he was found with his hands virtually round her neck so one would presume so there seems no other easy explanation but why my dear how should i know perhaps he was so obsessed with getting his information he tried to throttle it out of her and when she couldnt tell him he lost his temper it hardly matters to us but shes dead veronicas distress was thick in her voice even violent loretta was becoming annoyed which is nothing whatsoever to us she retorted what is one street woman more or less she had a pink dressi daresay many women do especially of that occupation then she spoke more urgently and with a peculiar rasping tone get ahold of yourself veronica you have much to gain and everything to loseeverything remember that robert is dead let the past stay in the grave where it belongs and make yourself a decent future with julian danver ive done everything i can to help you god knows but if you give way to fits of the vapors and maudlin thoughts every time there is a tragedy somewhere then even i cannot carry you through do you understand me there was silence emily strained till she could hear her own heart thumping but there was not even a movement beyond the keyhole do you understand me lorettas voice was low and grating without patience devoid of pity had emily not heard the words quite plainly it would have sounded like a threat loretta had comforted and supported veronica for a long time now and her strength let alone her patience seemed to be wearing thin she too had suffered a loss veronica was on the brink of finding another husband but loretta would not find another son little wonder she thought it was time veronica behaved less selfindulgently yes veronicas voice sounded defiant yet there was no conviction in it yes i understand and she began to weep good loretta was satisfied there was a crackle of taffeta as she sat back apparently she was not interested in veronicas tears perhaps she had seen too many of them there was a brisk knock on the door and emily shot halfway to her feet tripped on her skirt and fell flat this time her hair really did come undone the pin she had removed must have been vital frantically she hitched up her skirts and stood up properly then she let them fall and smoothed her apron to make sure she was decent she grabbed for the tray then realized the knock had been on the outer door to the bedroom not on the dressing room door the relief was overwhelming so physically sharp her legs were shaking she had time to put the tray down again pin her hair rather better take the tray and go out onto the landing and knock at the bedroom door herself when she went in veronica was sitting on the big bed looking exhausted bright smudges of color in her cheeks loretta was perfectly composed at least on the surface piers york stood there looking slightly puzzled a frown of incomprehension on his usually benign face it might have been the angle of the light but for the first time emily also saw the deep sadness in an expression in his eyes that stripped quite naked a patience and a disillusionment then he spoke and it vanished what have you got he regarded emily curiously tea and bread and butter put it on the dressing table yes sir emily moved to obey putting aside the silverbacked brushes and hand mirror she did not offer to pour if they left it awhile they might attribute the teas coldness to their own delay amelia loretta said sharply yes maam emily tried to look demure as an insecure pin slid out of her hair and fell on the dressing table with a tinkle and a coil of hair unwound down her cheek for heavens sake girl lorettas rage exploded you look like aa dollymop emily knew what a dollymop was the cheapest of prostitutes who could be tossed down anywhere for a few pence the hot blood in her cheeks betrayed her but she could not give the insolentiy innocent answer that leapt to her tongue nor could she afford to retaliate on equal terms or she would lose her joband pitts life might depend on it choking with the injustice she lowered her eyes so loretta could not see the hatred in them im sorry maam she whispered forcing the words between her clenched teeth i stood out of the way and brushed against the curtain i must have pulled out one of my pins indeed loretta made no attempt to hide her total skepticism it doesnt say much for your ability to dress hair well when i write your references i shall say nothing about the matter although your manner has not always been what i would wish but your mentioning this vulgar crime in seven dials to miss veronica is inexcusable we do not have servants in this house who know about such things let alone discuss them next thing you know we shall have all the maids in hysterics and the whole household at a standstill i am sorry you have proved unsuitable but no doubt you will find another position you may work out the week till we find someone to replace you edith cannot possibly do the work of two and i need her for other things now you may get on about your business leave the tray there veronica shot up like a jackinthebox she is my maid she said rather loudly staring at loretta and i am perfectly satisfied with herin fact i like her and i shall keep herforever if i choose and she heard about the murder doing an errand for me she told me because she knew i was upset when that policeman called here before now he wont be back and i for one am delighted piers shook his head pity he said with regret cant imagine what can have made him do it seemed such a civilized chap to me must be some explanation i suppose rubbish loretta said swiftly really piers sometimes i wonder how on earth you succeed as well as you do your judgment of people isinfantile the change in his face was so subtle it was not a movement of any one feature but emily knew instantly that loretta had trespassed too far although she herself did not seem to realize it i think the word you were looking for was charitable he said very quietly do you also take a charitable view of the maid coming in here looking as if shed just got out of bed loretta demanded with icy disgust piers turned and regarded emily curiously there was the faintest glint of humor in his eyes have you been scuffling with one of the menservants amelia she looked back at him perfectly steadily no sir i have not not now nor at any time thank you he said gravely the matter is settled i think it is time we all changed for dinner he put his hands in his pockets and walked casually to the door i am keeping my maid veronica stared at loretta if she goes it will be because i dont want her not because you dont drink your tea loretta replied without expression but emily knew from her face the calm power in the set of her mouth that her defeat was only temporary time was short but then time was short for pitt anyway loretta went out and closed the door with a firm click veronica ignored the tea and ate the bread and butter ive changed my mind she said staring into the mirror ill wear the crimson dress the following days passed grimly emily tried hard to be the perfect ladys maid so that not even edith could find fault with her she ironed many articles three and four times redampening them and smoothing them again and again with the flatiron till they were flawless her back and arms ached but she would not be beaten by a crease in a piece of cotton there was no time to sit down and swap gossip as she would have liked to since there was also the possibility that someone else on the staff might have known something there was always the chance that veronicas resolve would weaken or her courage fail and emily would find herself given notice again she bit back any smart replies forcing herself to act meekly to walk with her head less high and without the slight whisk of skirts that was natural to her on the other hand she went out of her way to flatter mrs melrose the cook who became a firstclass ally since she disliked mrs crawford already emily worked on the principle my enemys enemy is my friend she did rather well with the butler also normally it was a tactic she would have despised but she must survive here if she were to be any use to charlotte or thomas and there was no time for fine moral niceties the tweeny and the scullery maid were the lowest forms of life in the household but the tweeny in particular was an observant child and not unintelligent and emily was able through a little kindness to draw quite a lot of information from her of course the girl knew nothing about robert york and very little about the family at all but she had very definite opinions about the rest of the servants there was no room to be subtle on saturday emily took her afternoon off and met charlotte in the park in a fine driving rain it was bitterly cold and they huddled together pulling collars higher and burying their hands in muffs but at least it was highly unlikely that they would be observed who but the illicit or those bound in the utmost haste from one place to another would be out on such a day even the homeless chose the comparative shelter of the streets rather than the open wastes of the park where the wind could sheer unchecked across the flat graygreen winter grass and forbidden lovers had no eyes for anyone but each other they exchanged news which gave them both some new insights but no conclusions beyond what they already knew the murderer was in hanover close and either veronica or loretta knew if not who it was then at least why the crime had been committed but how to break their silence was still a mystery charlotte was frightened she hovered on the edge of begging emily to leave the york house three times she started to and then the almost paralyzing fear for pitt drowned out everything else and her words died in her throat not that it would have made any difference emily had no intention of retiring from the fight and sitting by while they tried pitt and hanged him which did not mean emily was not also frightened after hugging charlotte goodbye she sniffed back the tears and turned from the park gates to run along the wet pavements in the rain past the carriages in the streets along the wrought iron railings and down the area steps into the kitchen she was so cold she was shaking inside she piled her sodden coat and boots into the laundry room to dry ate a silent supper at the kitchen table and went up to her room she lay in bed still shivering and thought how she might trap the man or woman who had murdered three times already and had hidden the crimes so well that the only person suspected was pitt she woke in the dark with a scream in her throat and her body clenched with terror as a footfall made the merest tap in the bare passage outside her door soundlessly she slid out of bed the cold air on her skin cutting through her thin nightgown like a blow by the dim light of the badly curtained window she grasped the one wooden chair and wedged it under the door handle then she scrambled back into bed again pulled her knees up to her stomach and tried to get warm enough to go back to sleep so that she would not be useless in the morning either to work or to match wits with a murderer trap them and survive to show the proof she got up in the chilly gray dawn in time to remove the chair so that when fanny the tweeny called to waken her she knew nothing of it the day was full of tedious timeconsuming chores and emily learned nothing that seemed to be of value this was pointless it could go on for months she must force the issue late in the evening she crept into the pantry pocketed half a dozen biscuits dipped in chocolate and made two cups of cocoa she carried them upstairs where she knocked on the tweenys door and when it was opened whispered her invitation five minutes later they were curled up feet under them on emilys bed sharing the biscuits and sipping hot cocoa emily began to gossip it took ten minutes before she could bring up the subject of dulcies death whatever was she doing leaning out of the window she said eating the last biscuit do you suppose she was calling to someone nah fanny said scornfully ifn thered bin anybody there theyd a said wouldnt they i mean nobody saw er fall anyway she werent like that what do you mean emily affected innocence well fanny hunched her shoulders in a shrug she werent a flirt she were sort oproper quiet like and nobody saw her at all emily said incredulously it were dark she fell out some time in the evening we was all inside emily gazed at her how do you know do you know where everyone was fanny screwed up her face well we would be wouldnt we where else would anyone be on a wet night in the middle o winter oh emily sat back against the thin pillow i thought maybe you actually knew where everyone was at supper in the kitchen or in the servants hall no one knows when she fell out fanny explained patiently anyow she were there at supper wiv us erself you mean emily opened her eyes wider you mean she fell during the night what was the last time anyone saw her edith said good night to er baht alf nine fanny replied thinking hard me an prim was playin cards dulcie werent feelin that special so it must a bin after that mustnt it but that doesnt make sense emily persisted why should she be leaning out of a window during the night you dont think she took a deep bream and waited you dont think she had someone climbing in oh no fannys shock was genuine and profound not dulcie you mean aa follower never not er she werent her little face set in practical lines anyow ifn yer was going to ave a follower in the ouse yer wouldnt ave the poor soul climb up no drainpipe to an attic winder yerd creep down an let im in the scullery door wouldnt yer she werent daft but she werent loose neither she finished the last of the cocoa and looked at emily over the rim of her cup then automatically pushed her hair out of her eyes know what i reckon amelia emily was agog leaning forward to urge her on what fannys voice dropped to a hoarse whisper i reckon as she saw summink the night mr robert were murdered and someone came back an murdered er in case she told that rozzer as was ere askin emily breathed out in a careful sigh of amazement oh fanny you could be right you think there was a breakin fanny shook her head vigorously no there werentwed a known mr redditch is most particlar specially after there were that terrible robbery when mr robert were murdered all the doors and winders is looked ter special every night afore e goes ter bed isself im or albert goes over every one well could anyone have got in before that emily asked eagerly nah fanny smiled at her innocence ow theres only the front door an yer cant come in that less someone opens it for yer and the back doord mean e ad ter come through the kitchen and theres always people there cook or mary at least an on a night wiv guests near all of us who were the guests that night do you know the two danver gentlemen and the ladies miss arriet and the old miss danver an mr and mrs asherson es ever so andsome mr asherson in a sort o broodin way i know noras always on about im i reckon as shes got a fancy for im rotten she sniffed unconsciously imitating the housekeepers tone silly little article whatd she get out of it ceptin misery then it must have been someone already in the house emily whispered back entirely forgetting her accent but fanny appeared not to notice or someone in the house let in another person like oo fanny was indignant int none of us servants d do that anyway we werent none of us ere when mr robert were killed ceptin mary an dulcie erself an marys in the kitchen and nobody came through that way or wed all a seen em come ter that albert was on in the all so it was someone here emily agreed the only other possibility is that dulcie crept down during the night and let someone in herselfor mary did i suppose she added that only in the interests of strict logic she did not believe for a moment that either girl had done such a thing she had the information she wanted it had happened after dinner and could have been before the guests left but there had definitely been no breakin fanny i think youre right she leaned forward gripping fannys thin arm youd better say nothing to anyone at allin case you fall out of a window as well promise me fanny shook her head eyes grave i wont oh believe the i wont i dont want ter end up squashed on the pavement like er poor thing an you better keep a still tongue too i swear emily said with conviction and ill put a chair against my door you better ad fanny agreed me too she uncurled her legs and slid to the floor hugging her nightgown round her shivering now the cocoa was finished gnight melia but even with the chair wedged under the handle emily did not sleep easily several times she woke with a start uncertain if she had heard footsteps in the passage outside and whether they had stopped outside her door could someone have tried the handle the wind rattled the loose sash frame and she froze in terror waiting till the sound came again and she could be certain what it was suspicions churned in her mind slipping in and out of dreams with daylight courage returned but she was still nervous it took all her concentration not to make any mistakes as she went from one pedestrian duty to the next she was always aware of other people of movement shadows by evening she was so tired she could have wept with exhaustion she felt imprisoned in the house hurried from one place to another with never any time to be alone yet carrying her loneliness like a weight inside and always time was the enemy in a way it was a blessing to have work to occupy her charlotte could only imagine what might be happening to emily after they parted in the rain at the park gates it was useless to think about it she could do nothing and she must keep lying to pitt or he would know she was working to find the truthand then he was certain to realize that she was doing so because ballarat was doing nothingno one would do anything the loneliness of having to lie to him was one of the worse pains she had ever known the luxury of hiding nothing carrying no knowledge alone was something she was so used to she had forgotten its value now it would only be selfishness and she did not even consider it nevertheless the hurt caught her by surprise but there were small kindnesses friendships where she had not thought to find them a strange little man in a costers coat and cap brought her a bag of herrings and refused to be paid hurrying away into the rain without looking back as though embarrassed to be thanked one morning she found a bundle of kindling sticks on the back step and two days later there was another bundle she never saw who left them the greengrocer became curt to the point of outright rudeness but the coal merchant continued to deliver and she thought his sacks were if anything a little fuller caroline did not come back but she wrote every day saying that daniel and jemima were well and offering to do anything she could to help the letter that touched her most came from greataunt vespasia who was ill with bronchitis and confined to her bed she had no doubt whatsoever that pitt was innocent and as soon as the time was appropriate if it should come to such a ridiculous pass she would instruct her lawyer to act on his behalf she also enclosed ten guineas for which she hoped charlotte would not be silly enough to take offense one could not fight on an empty stomachand quite obviously a fight was on hand the writing was shaky and a little crooked on the page and charlotte was struck with cold shock as she realized that aunt vespasia was old and frailty was catching up with her she stood in the kitchen in the early morning holding the blue deckled paper in her hand it seemed as if all the good and certain things in the world were fading fast there was a chill so close to the skin no fires could dispel it she went to visit pitt again waiting in the shivering rain with other quiet sadfaced women whose fathers husbands or sons rotted away in the steel some were violent some greedy brutal by nature of circumstance many merely inadequate to cope with life in the struggling overcrowded streets where only the strongest endure charlotte had time for pity time to wonder and think about these other womenit was easier to ache for anothers pain than work through the realities of her own that made it easier to face pitt and lie smiling as if she had confidence and smothering her fear if she occupied the storm of emotion inside herself with something else when at last she was permitted in she was not allowed to touch him only to sit across the table and stare into his face seeing the dirt and the bruises the hollows round his eyes where shock could not be hidden by his forced smile never in her life had she had to live so difficult or so complete a lie he knew her so well she had never succeeded in deceiving him before now she met his eyes and lied as easily as if he had been a child instead of a man someone to be protected and comforted with stories while she bore the truth yes we are all perfectly well she said quickly although of course we miss you terribly but we have enough of everything so i havent had to ask mama or emily for any help although im sure theyll give it if it should be necessary no i havent been back to the yorks im leaving it to mr ballarat as you said well if he hasnt sent anyone to see you yet it must be because he doesnt need to she kept mastery of the conversation permitting no time for interruptions questions she could not answer wheres emily at home they wouldnt let her in here she isnt familyat least not close enough sistersinlaw dont count yes jack radley is being very helpful emily was in the laundry room doing the job she disliked most intensely ironing the starched frills of cotton aprons half a dozen of them somehow edith had taken advantage of some absence of mind to maneuver emily into doing her share as well she looked up in surprise when mary came to the door glanced all round her then slipped in and closed it fingers to her lips what is it emily whispered a man mary said urgently her voice so low her words were almost swallowed you got a follower i havent emily denied fiercely she certainly did not need that kind of trouble and it was totally unjust she had encouraged no one in fact she had given the butchers boy a flea in his ear when he had smiled at her impudent creature yes you ave mary insisted scruffy e is an looks like e just bin up a chimney but spoke awful nice an polite an ifn e were washed e could be real nice i reckon well i dont know him emily said fiercely tell him to go away wont you even come and see no do you want me to lose my character es awful keen ill be thrown out emily exploded but e says e knows you mary tried once more cmon amelia e could bewell dyou want to stay a ladys maid all your life its a lot better than being out on the street without a character emily hissed back well if youre really sure is name is jack suffink emily froze what is name is jack suffink mary repeated emily dropped the iron ill come where is he has anyone else seen him you changed yer mind pretty quick mary said with profound satisfaction but yerd better be sharp if cook catches yer yerll be in dead trouble es at the scullery door on wiv yer urry emily ran from the laundry room along the corridor through the kitchen and scullery to the back door with mary close behind her keeping watch for cooks return emily could hardly believe what she saw the man standing in the rain on the back steps beside the coke scuttles and rubbish cans was dressed in a dark ragged coat that came past his knees and his face was all but hidden by a broadbrimmed hat and a lock of sooty hair that fell over his brow his skin seemed grimy as if he had indeed come down a chimney jack emily said incredulously he grinned showing startlingly white teeth in his filthy face she was so glad to see him she wanted to laugh but realized immediately her laughter would turn to tears it all rushed through her in a torrent so fierce she said nothing at all are you all right he demanded you look dreadful then she did start to laugh a little hysterically but stopped herself when she realized mary could hear her she controlled her voice with an effort yes im fine i put a chair under my door at night but i need to talk to you how is charlotte its very hard on her and were not getting anywhere there was a shout inside the scullery and emily knew someone was back who would betray her if not cook then nora go she said quickly ill go to the cobblers in half an hour or sowait for the round the corner please he nodded and by the time noras curious face came round the outer door he had slipped up the area steps and disappeared what are you doing out ere nora said sharply i thought i eard you talking to someone well you know what thought did emily snapped back then regretted it not that she had any compunction about nora it was just unwise to antagonize her but it was too late to retreat now or it would only make her suspicious for that matter what are you doing out here er nora had obviously come to catch emily out and now she was confused she lifted her chin a little higher i thought if there was someone ere e might be bothering you i came to elp how kind of you emily replied sarcastically as you see there is no one i came to see how cold it is im going on an errand i shall need a greatcoat of course you will nora said waspishly what else do you expect in january rain emily replied with growing confidence it is raining couldnt you see that through the window not much i was in the laundry she stared at noras handsome bold eyes daring her to make an open accusation very well then nora shrugged elaborately she had elegant shoulders and she knew it then youd better be on your way and dont take alf the afternoon about it emily went back to the laundry room to finish the last apron she folded it and put away the flatiron then collected her hat and coat and after telling mary where she was going she set out up the area steps and along hanover close towards the main thoroughfare waiting with every footstep to see jack or hear him behind her she nearly bumped into him round the first corner he still looked a sight and he did not touch her but walked respectfully beside her as if they were both exactly what they appeared a ladys maid on an errand and a sweeps man taking a short time off as they walked she told him about the extraordinary conversation she had overheard between veronica and loretta and the only conclusion possible from her discussion with the tweeny he in turn told her what little news he had of charlotte by the time that was completed she had veronicas boots and was on the way back to hanover close it was raining harder her feet and her skirts were wet and the soot was beginning to run in black trickles down his face you look fearful she said with a rather painful smile she was walking less and less quickly she was dreading going back into the house not only because this was a moments freedom from duty and fear but surprisingly sharply because she would miss jack your own mother wouldnt know you she added he started to laugh at first very quietly then more heartily as he gazed at her straight mud brown coat her plain hat and sodden boots she began to giggle as well and they stood in the street together streaming wet laughing on the edge of tears he put out both his hands and took hers holding her gently for an instant she thought it was on the edge of his tongue to ask her to marry him but whatever words he had were quickly swallowed back she had all the ashworth money the houses the position he had nothing love was not enough to offer jack she said without giving herself time to weigh or judge jackwould you consider marrying the the rain was washing the soot off his face in black drops yes please emily i would like to marry youvery much then you may kiss me she said with a shy smile slowly carefully and very gently he did and standing there filthy and cold in the rain it was exquisitely sweet prison life was unlike anything pitt had imagined at first the sheer shock of his arrest of being suddenly and violently thrust from one side of the law to the other had numbed his feelings robbing him of all but the most superficial reactions even when he was taken from the local cells to the great prison at coldbath fields the reality of it was purely sensory he saw the massive walls and heard the door shut metal clanging on stone and the strange sour smell assaulted him catching in his throat he could taste it on his tongue but still it did not touch his emotions when he woke the following morning stiff muscles tight with cold memory flooded back and it all seemed preposterous any minute someone would come full of apologies and he would be taken out and given a good breakfast hot probably porridge and bacon and lots of steaming tea but when someone did come it was only the regular jailer with a tin dish of gruel ordering pitt to get to his feet and get ready for the day pitt protested without thinking and was told curtly to obey orders or he would find himself at the crank the other prisoners regarded him with curiosity and hatred he was the enemy were it not for the police none of them would be here in this prolonged torture cramped in the narrow airless cells of the treadmill endlessly stepping on slats that gave way under them as they struggled to keep abreast in the slowturning wheel fifteen minutes in one of its cooplike stalls with the hot air suffocating the lungs was all any man could bear then he had to be taken out before he collapsed if one were not eager enough at this there was punishment ever available for outright rebellion a man could be birched or flogged for lesser offenses such as insolence or refusal to obey orders a man could be required to do shot drill it was the third day before pitt found himself ordered to this for answering back laziness and causing a brawl the men were lined up in a hollow square outside in the bitterly cold exercise yard each man stood three yards from his neighbor and was given a twentyfivepound iron cannonball to place at his feet at the command he must pick it up and carry it to his neighbors spot put it on the ground and return to his own spot where he would find a new ball put there by the man on his other side this senseless passing round and round of shot could be kept up for seventyfive minutes till shoulders stabbed with pain and muscles were torn and backs too sore to straighten pitts offense had been a stupid quarrel picked by another prisoner who felt compelled to swagger in front of his companions had pitt been paying more attention to his surroundings he would have noticed the mans brittle temper the slight bounce to his walk his curled fingers pitt would have understood the glitter as the mans eyes moved from side to side to see who was watching him and whether admiration was there the peculiar mixture of fear and respect that the weak have for violence he would have recognized the mans sharp grin as that of the bully on parade but his mind was on the brothel and cerises dead body thrown carelessly on the gaudy bed as he tried to recall the few moments when he had seen her face had she really once been so beautiful or possessed of such charm and wit that robert york had been bewitched by her into betraying his country he would have been risking not merely the love of his wife which he might or might not value but his position in the foreign office and in society the things which governed the whole style of his life if he had been caught the best he could have hoped for would have been a coverup for his familys sake and to prevent a scandal which the government would not want at worst he would have been brought here where pitt was coldbath fields or somewhere like it to await trial and very probably the hangmans noose that reminder was enough to overwhelm him with such anger and fear pitt was careless of the immediate danger he did not see the momentary swagger the quick glitter in the mans eyes nor recognize the challenge the man was marking his territory when the man spoke pitt replied tartly with the first answer that came to his tongue and before he realized it he had placed the bully in a position of having to defend himself to keep from losing face it was stupid an idiotic scuffle that ended with both of them on shot drill and pitt bending straightening carrying the shot replacing it walking back until he thought his back was broken and the sweat drenched his clothes when it finally stopped they stuck to him in clammy cold and the ache of tortured muscles was so sharp that for four days he could not move even in his sleep without pain days went by and pitt became accustomed to the routine the wretched food always being cold except when labor made him sweat and then the worse chill afterwards he hated always being dirty he loathed the lack of any privacy even for essential functions he was lonelier than he had ever been in his life and yet never alone actual physical solitude would have been a blessing a chance to relax the tension the awareness of enmity and to explore the thoughts crowding inside himself without prying cruel eyes watching probing for weakness prurient to invade the first time charlotte came was the worst experience of all to see her talk and yet always be overheard without being able to touch her to have to struggle to put into words communication that was too intimate too formless for such a quantifiable and public medium his own thoughts were chaotic what could he possibly say to her that he was innocent of anything except perhaps gullibility somewhere but he was not even sure where perhaps it was only stupidity he still had no idea who was the spy or who had killed robert york certainly he was guilty of failure he had failed both charlotte and the children what would happen to them what was happening now she must be suffering all the fear the shame of being thought a murderers wife and in time the poverty would come as well unless her family helped but the misery and the humiliation of lifelong dependency was hardly an answer how could he even say he loved her in such circumstances with a dispirited and contemptuous jailer listening and he wanted to to put away forever the brief anger he had allowed to mar the last few days before hed been taken away she had looked pale she had tried hard but she could not keep the shock from her face he could not remember afterwards what they had saidsomething and nothing just noises the silence between the words had been more important and the shining tenderness in her eyes the second time had been better at least she seemed unaware of the reality of the prison and she was confident ballarat was doing everything to get him releasedmore confident than pitt was ballarat had not come anywhere near coldbath fields nor had he sent anyone except a constable who was embarrassed and had asked only the most obvious and meaningless questions what was yer doin in seven dials mr pitt the mr was so habitual he could not drop it even here he fiddled with his pencil and avoided pitts eyes i went there with a running patterer because he told me the woman i wanted to question was there pitt had replied irritably i already told them that so you went lookin for er i told them that too what for mr pitt because she was a witness in the murder of robert york would that be mr york of anover close as was killed by a burglar three years ago yes of course it would an ow do yer know that mr pitt she was seen in the house oh yes oo saw er dulcie mabbutt the ladys maid ow do yer spell that sir dont bother shes dead she fell out of a window the constables eyes had opened wider and for the first time he looked directly at pitt ow did that appen sir was it worth telling him what if he were the only one who ever came just as a formality so all the right papers could be filled in now might be the only chance he must try i think someone overheard her tell me about the woman in cerise he watched the constables face the library door was open you mean she were pushed the constable said carefully yes the constable concentrated hard but this woman in pink was an ore mr pitt why should anyone care that much about er gentlemen as their pleasures we all knows that if e were careless its a domestic matter int it she wasnt just a whore pitt had said gravely keeping his temper because he had to what could he do to persuade this roundfaced constable that there was conspiracy and treason in this ordinary rather sordid tragedy no sir the constable inquired his eyes narrowing a little there are secret papers missing from the foreign office from the department where robert york worked before he was murdered the constable blinked you sayin as e took em mr pitt i dont know felix asherson and garrard danver also work there and of course many others i do know the silver vase and the firstedition book that were reported stolen the night he was killed never turned up at any fences or pawnshop in london and no regular villain anywhere in the city knows anything about them or about the murder are you sure o that sir the constable looked dubious yes i am what the hell do you think ive been doing these past weeks i see the constable licked his pencil but could think of nothing to write no you dont see pitt said angrily neither do i except robert york was murdered dulcie fell out of a window and the woman in cerise who was seen in hanover close had her neck broken in a bawdy house in seven dialsjust before i got to her an yer still say it werent you as done it there was no skepticism in his face now rather he seemed to be looking for confirmation yes the constable had not pressed the matter any further and had taken his leave with a look of deep concentration on his blunt face the days blurred into a long dark procession it never seemed light in the steel even the exercise yard was narrow and walled so steeply the frail winter daylight was lost in it and bent over the backbreaking shot or huddled with other miserable soursmelling prisoners pitt felt the darkness creep into his mind like mold the outside world became remote a story in a childrens book then gradually in spite of himself he was drawn into noticing his fellows iremonger who was middleaged and pastyfaced accused of practicing abortion he proclaimed his innocence with stoic resignation not expecting to be believed he obviously knew some medicine and exercised a certain compassion he knew how to treat the small wounds gained at the crank the worst punishment of all where a man turned a spindle connected to a drum full of sand the weight of the spoonshaped cups lifting against the dead inertia tore the muscles even more than the shot iremonger also doled out advice and peculiarly intimate sympathy for those who suffered from the treadmill harness there was haskins the bully who had fought with pitt a sad shallow man who had won the few victories in his life through violence he was respected to his face but mocked behind his back there was ross a handsome genial man who lived off the earnings of prostitutes and was in for some stupid theft ross saw nothing wrong in either occupation one fulfilled a need the other was merely making the best of an opportunity when he was released he would do precisely the same again the concept of right and wrong in anything except personal loyalties was unknown to him in spite of himself pitt could not dislike him pitt also noticed goodman who was small overwhelmingly greedy but an excellent raconteur even if it was probably all lies he was in for embezzlement from his fatherinlaw and like most of the others proclaimed his innocence if not of the fact then of any moral fault in the matter his weasellike face was full of indignation on the other hand his fertile imagination and some education made his company on the few occasions they were permitted to speak a relief from the corroding boredom and there was wilson a man so savage in his rage he lashed out at everyone wood ignorant and angry with a world which had no use and no place for him fat molloy who had spent most of his life in prison and feared the outside world in spite of his repeated longing for it and poor little raeburn with drooping eyes and mouth who stole simply because he was hungry and incapable of earning his way at first pitt hated them all because they were part of the steel and everything that trapped and held him all the ugliness and the perpetuity of the place then through small acts glimpses of pain he was reached at first these incidents seemed trivial a brushing of the surface of his mind more an irritation because he had no emotion to spare than any real empathy then a stupid and pointless tragedy involving raeburn jerked pitt violently out of his selfpity raeburn was a purposeless simpleminded little man who seemed inadequate to face the world he had only one thing of which he was proud though he was promiscuous and he stole he did not tell lies not even to escape punishment now and again he boasted of it and no one minded it was boring and they took for granted that he was harmless and he challenged no ones territory there was a tacit understanding that one did not victimize raeburn he filled the role of a house pet on this occasion when pitt was sunk deep in his own misery the permanent cold the hunger and the emotional loneliness and fears he was being forced with every succeeding day to face more openly a jailers watch was mislaid and by some mischance raeburn was accused of having taken it he swore he had not but the jailer who did not know him did not accept the denial raeburn was removed to solitary confinement he was terrified of being alone he had no thoughts to fill the silence and it threatened to obliterate him when they came for him he lashed out and for that he was undeniably guilty they dismissed the charge of thieving as no longer important now he had assaulted a warden he was put in a cell in isolation uncomprehending still swearing he had not taken the watch at night in his bunk shivering in the dark pitt could hear raeburn crying out sometimes loudly i didnt do it tell em i didnt do it other times it was only a confused babbling that sank away into silence he was a weak little man and the one thing he valued had been removed his only worth was that everyone knew he did not tell lies but now someone had not believed him his solitude was vast like annihilation itself and he had nothing to cling to he either would not or could not eat a week later they took him away to the bedlam asylum for the insane and within a short time he was dead the effect on the other prisoners was surprisingly deep while he had been alive raeburn was tolerated with a mild contempt but there had been a tacit comprehension that his honesty had been one small light in the darkness of his loneliness and stupidity it was his mark of identity in a nameless sea he had no other strength nor was he aware of any other virtue his weaknesses had let him down so often they were intimately known when he was taken away there rippled through the others a kind of anger that for once had nothing to do with selfishness raeburns fate brought them as close to pity as they could come the incident marked pitt deeply he willed himself to forget it but raeburns cries repeated themselves in his head and his imagination filled in the picture of the mans shallow droopeyed face witless with fear stained with weeping his own selfpity dissolved into anger from hating the other men he surprised himself by managing to forget sometimes for hours on end all the world of difference between himself and them and felt only the pain they had in common at night lying in the cold he turned over every possibility in his mind he could speak to no one about his own case but they could not stop him from thinking surely the key to it lay in the treason who was the spy at first he thought it had been robert york seduced by cerise perhaps with some spy master behind her then since dulcies death which he was certain had also been murder the suspects had been narrowed to either someone in the york house or one of their visitors that night the danvers and the ashersons who also had access to the foreign office now cerise herself had been murderedby whom the unknown spy master who was afraid pitt would find her and that she might knowingly or unknowingly betray him he was growing confused it made no sense if there was such a figure shadowy unknown then that person had no part in the murder of dulcie it had to be someone pitt knew someone he had already seen and talked to dulcie had been killed because she had seen cerise there could be no other reason that was borne out by the fact that cerise herself had been murdered when it became inevitable that pitt would find her but why had robert york been killed was there something he knew something he had seen or heard was it what he had done and thus could reveal perhaps there had been a real thief someone robert york would have recognized when he interrupted and caught him perhaps cerise had not succeeded in her attempts to seduce him and had sent a thief instead then who was the thief someone known to robert york strong enough and skilled enoughand coldblooded enoughto kill him with a single blow even when he was prepared and presumably on his guard after all if you disturb a burglar in your house in the middle of the night and you recognize him and know his intent then surely you would understand he could not leave you to reveal him as you would be bound to julian danver garrard danver possibly although he was twice yorks ageor felix asherson pitt did not even consider piers york he would hardly have needed to offer any explanation for being in the library of his own house whatever the time of night but the danvers and asherson all worked at the foreign office themselves it did not make sense that they should steal secrets from robert york pitt lay awake in the bitter night hearing the now familiar sounds of uneasy movement the echo of coughs groans someone swearing and further away a man weeping with hollow racking sounds of despair he was no further forward the pieces did not fit who was cerise he wondered hovering on the borders of sleep his mind snatching at shadows it all hinged on her in the morning the gray immediacy of the day returned crowding his senses he could close his eyes to some of it even turn his mind from the sounds becoming numb to the creeping cold but he could never completely shut out the sour smell it was there with every breath the taste of it at the back of his throat making his stomach querulous there was no stillness to think with darkness came the illusion of solitude again and his mind returned to gnaw the question he turned it over and over and no answer seemed to satisfy him it still seemed most likely that robert york had interrupted someone and he was killed because of his knowledge as was dulcie and of course cerise but knowledge of what the constable returned graver this time and he did not mention ballarat at all so it was the maid dulcie as first told you about this woman in pink mr pitt he frowned looking at his notebook and then up again ow did you find er in seven dials with a lot of work pitt replied flatly i walked the streets asking costers flower girls sandwich sellers theater doormen prostitutes the constable shook his head slowly must a taken a fair while sir werent there no better way nobody as knew nuffink nobody who would speak except miss adeline danver and she only saw the woman for a moment on the landing in the gaslight thatd be mr julian danvers aunt yes but naturally miss danver didnt know where to find her the constable screwed up his face i could check that with er mr pitt well if you do for gods sake be careful the last person to speak to the police about seeing cerise fell out of a window to her death immediately after the constable sat silently for several moments then slowly began chewing his pencil who do you reckon she was this woman you calls cerise mr pitt pitt leaned a little more heavily on his wooden chair i dont know but she was beautiful everyone who saw her said she had style glamor a face that one remembered felix asherson admitted there was information missing from his department of the foreign office which is also where robert york worked the constable took the end of his pencil out of his mouth there were teeth marks where he had bitten into it mr ballarat didnt believe that mr pitt e made some inquiries very discreet like in several places and theres been no use made of anything that could a come from there and e asked them as would know they dont have to use it straightaway but pitt felt he was fighting on sinking ground ballarat did not want to believe there was treason he was afraid of facing his superiors and telling them something they would be so loath to believe something that was frightening and innately a criticism of not only their competence but their honor he was frightened of their anger of having to muster arguments to persuade them of such a thing showing them that the blame would be laid at their door he wanted to be approved of he had social ambitions that were far deeper than his professional or financial dreams he liked good living he liked petty authority but he had not the courage for real power the hazards the envy and the unpleasantness that it carried were prices he had no stomach to pay he had been entrusted to prove there was no treason or if there had been that it had been safely covered up and to discover it now would signal the utmost failure the constable was staring at him chewing his pencil again viciously i dunno much about that sir but it all seems a bit unlikely to the i spect what men likes in a lady is as different as what they likes fer their dinner but she didnt seem anythink but ordinary ter me dark air darkish sort o skin bit sallow likeprefer a bit o color meself not a bad face but nothin special an not much shape to er not what youd call andsome at all she had grace pitt said trying to find words to explain the subtlety cerise had had in life to this simple straightforward man spirit probably wit beggin yer pardon mr pitt but she looked more like a maid whod lorst er character and taken to the streets to me she was a courtesan he looked at the constables earnest confused face a very highclass prostitute one who selected her own customersjust a fewfor a very high price the constable shrugged if you say so mr pitt but ill tell yer this shed scrubbed a few floors in er time a look at er ands and er kneesd tell yer that i seen too many women with them callouses not ter know they didnt come from prayin thats for certain pitt stared at him you must be wrong no mr pitt i looked at er proper very careful poor soul its the job an i knows ow ter do it see we ad no name for era flash of pity crossed his facewe still avent come ter that a staggering and dreadful new thought was beginning to take shape in pitts mind what if it were not the real cerise he had found but someone else a helpless victim left there to fool him suppose the whole thing had been contrived to get rid of him to land him precisely where he was now in the steel helpless entombed alive someone had murdered that wretched woman in order to cripple pitt someone had been watching him planning for him to arrive and be caught exactly where he waswhile the real cerise was still alive did ballarat know that was he deliberately protecting her by turning away from the case pretending he believed the obvious and that pitt was guilty then how high did it go this corruption this treason no he could not believe ballarat had done it knowingly he was too smug too small in imagination he had not the courage to play such a high game he was complacent insensitive lacking imagination a moral coward a social climber but he was english to the bone in his own stubborn way he would have died before committing treason if there were no england what would be left for him to enjoy what else was there to aspire to no ballarat was being used but by whom are you all right mr pitt the constable said anxiously you look awfultaken back youre sure about the calluses pitt said slowly trying to keep the despair out of his voice what about her face was it beautiful at least could you imagine she might have had grace a kind of loveliness the constable shook his head slowly ard ter say mr pitt the bones pitt leaned forward impatiently i know about the swelling the discoloration but her bones i cant remember he waited eyes fixed on the constables face im sure about the calluses he said carefully and as well as i can reckon sir she were more or less ordinary quite good not plain as yer might say but nothin special neither why mr pitt what is it youre thinking that it wasnt cerise constable it was some poor creature dressed in her clothes and murdered to implicate me cerise is still alive gor blimey the constable breathed out slowly there was only the faintest skepticism in his voice a mere shadow of doubt in his plain round face what do yer want me ter do mr pitt i dont know constable god help us at the moment i have no idea charlottes thoughts were running parallel to pitts although at this point of course she did not know it she began by assuming that pitt was telling the absolute truth he had looked for cerise quite openly and after dogged police work had been approached by someone who had led him to the house in seven dials where he had arrived at precisely the right time to find her with her neck broken and thus be caught in the appearance of having killed her himself was that a coincidence or had the killer organized her death to fall just that way in one act silencing cerise and disposing of pitt a stroke of superb fortune or genius what had cerise known that was worth the extraordinary risk of killing dulcie to keep pitt from her surely that had been a far more impulsive and dangerous murder it must be something damning the truth about robert yorks death or the identity of the spywhich were probably the same thing it still seemed most likely that robert york had been cerises lover and she had tricked or seduced him into giving her secrets which she had taken back to her master then she and robert had quarreled and he had threatened to tell the truth either cerise or her master had murdered robert to protect themselves then why had cerise been killed had she regretted roberts death perhaps she had not bargained for murder or had she cared for him in her own way by all accounts he was handsome elegant and witty and apparently had a reserved character that might make him unusually attractive to women or had cerise simply lost her nerve and become a risk to her master a liability had this master figure in the background learned that pitt knew of cerise through dulcie and attempted to get rid of all those close to him her heart sank with a misery that was becoming familiar the murderer could be anybody there was no clue whatsoever as to who had broken the library window and murdered robert york anyone could have gone to the house in seven dials if they knew cerise was there but only members of the three families in hanover close could have pushed dulcie out of the window charlotte had met them all had sat and talked with them politely and one of them was continuing the slow deliberate judicial murder of pitt she got up abruptly from her seat by the kitchen stove it was dark now gracie had long ago gone upstairs to bed there was nothing more she could do tonight she had twisted her mind round every fact or supposition she knew and the realization was undeniable she would not solve it by thinking they would not let her see pitt again for another four days it was useless to ask ballarat to help but she might find the person who was actually working on the case the constable who had questioned the brothel owner who had seen cerises body and she must go back to hanover close because that was where the answer was if only she could find the first thread that would begin the unraveling even though she was weary with anxiety and exhausted from doing all the heavy housework herself still she slept badly and was awake long before the cold dawn by seven she was in the kitchen riddling out the fire herself and building it up when gracie came down at quarter past she found it done and the kettle boiling she opened her mouth to object then saw charlottes pale face and thought better of it by late morning charlotte was walking briskly in the icy sunlight under the bare trees on the edge of green park looking for constable maybery the duty officer at bow street had informed her unhappily that maybery was investigating the death of the woman in pink he had been loath to tell her but he was even more unwilling to face the prospect of dealing with a hysterical woman in the police station he hated scenes and from the look of her flushed face and brilliant eyes this one might very soon fall into that category charlotte saw the blue figure in his tall hat and cape just as he emerged from half moon street into piccadilly she dashed across the road heedless of oncoming carriages infuriating the drivers and caught up with him in a most unseemly run constable he stopped yes maam you all right maam yes are you constable maybery he looked puzzled his round face wrinkled in apprehension yes maam im mrs pitt mrs thomas pitt oh conflicting emotions crossed his face embarrassment followed by sympathy then an eagerness to speak i went an saw mr pitt yesterday maam e didnt look too badly considerin his eyes flickered doubtfully for a moment there was no guilt in his expression however charlottes courage returned it was just possible he did not believe pitt was guilty perhaps that relief in his face was a sign that they were on the same side constableyou are investigating the death of the woman in pink what do you know about her what was her name where was she before she came to seven dials he shook his head very slightly but his eyes remained perfectly steady we dont know nothin at all about er maam she got to the ouse in seven dials only three days before she was killed an she gave the name o mary smith an nobody ever eard of er before she said nothin and they didnt ask o course in that kind o business people dont but one thing maam mr pitt seemed very certain as she wase said a courtesan very expensive an pickin er own custom but i saw the body beggin yer pardon for discussin it maam but the body as i saw in seven dials ad calluses on er ands an on er knees not eavy like but i seen em enough to know em she werent livin like no expensive kept woman i reckon as e must be wrong about that but she was charlotte was nonplussed whatever she had expected it was not this she was a great beauty oh not traditional certainly we knew that but she was extraordinary people noticed her she was very graceful she had style panache she could never have scrubbed floors he stood firm youre wrong maam she may ave ad character since i never saw er alive i couldnt tell but she were quite ordinary to look at er skin werent particular bit sallow she ad good air if yer like it black an she was definitely on the thin side in fact id say skinny no maam beggin yer pardon again but i seen er and she were ordinary charlotte stood still on the pavement a carriage went by at a spanking pace its brief wind tilting her hat then the woman was not ceriseshe must be someone else someone else had been killed to put pitt and all of them off her trail perhaps it was only a fortunate accident that pitt had found her at just that moment and had been arrested for her murderor was that too part of the plan she must be even more important than they had thought then a startling idea came into charlottes mind it was horrifying perhaps mad certainly dangerousbut there seemed to be nothing else left thank you constable maybery she said aloud thank you very much please give my love to thomas if if youre allowed to and please dont mention this conversation it will only worry him all right maam if thats what you want yes most definitely please thank you and she turned round and hurried away towards the nearest omnibus stop the new idea spun crazily in her mind there must be something better something saner and more intelligentbut what there was no time to wait there was no one left to question no physical evidence to produce like a rabbit out of a hat to force a confession the only thing was to startle someone violently forcing a betrayaland she could think of no other way than the wild idea forming in her mind now she did not go home but to jack radleys rooms in st jamess she had never been there before but knew the address from writing to him normally he spent as little time there as possible preferring to be someones guest in one of the fine town houses it was both more pleasant and easier on his frugal finances but he had promised he would be available as long as this crisis lasted and she did not hesitate to call upon him the building was a good second best and not an address one would be embarrassed to mention she asked the porter in the hall and was told courteously with only the slightest frown that mr radleys rooms were on the third floor and the stairs were to her left her legs were tired when she got there and there was no view to reward her effort since his rooms were at the back she knocked sharply on the door if he was not there she would have to leave a note she shifted from one foot to the other impatiently in the few minutes till the door openedin fact she had been on the point of rattling the handle charlotte jack looked startled caught out then selfconcern vanished and he welcomed her in what is it has something happened she had little time to look round a few weeks ago she would have been consumed with curiositya persons home said much about thembut now she had neither the time nor the need doubts of jack had died without her noticing she observed only that the rooms were elegantly furnished but small and she had economized enough herself to recognize it in others well he demanded i have just met the constable who is investigating cerises death his face darkened what do you mean just met i found him she brushed the means and the circumstances aside coming out of half moon street but the important thing is he described the body jack im sure it isnt her it was made to look like her but it was just some poor woman in a pink dress just a minute why because of her hands but even more her knees his face was incredulous he looked almost as if he might burst out laughing calluses she exclaimed peremptorily from scrubbing floors but jack what it means is that the real cerise is still alive and i have an idea i know it is extreme even idioticbut ive racked my brains and i cant think of anything else at all i need your help we must go again to the yorks and the danvers must be there too and as soon as possible time is getting terribly short every vestige of humor left jacks face no trial date had been set yet but it would not be long and he had never pretended to her that it might now he listened with total gravity what else he asked i must know at least two days in advance so i can make arrangements what arrangements she hesitated uncertain whether to tell him he was likely to disapprove dont be stupid he said abruptly how can i help you if i dont know what youre doing you arent the only one with brains nor the only one who cares she felt for an instant as if he had slapped her she was about to retort when the truth of it overwhelmed her it was surprisingly painless in fact all at once she felt less alone than she had since pitts arrest the danvers come to dinner regularlynext time im going to dress up as cerise and make an assignation with each of the men it might have been she said frankly only piers york the danvers and felix asherson were there the night dulcie was killed ill start with the danvers because aunt adeline saw cerise at their house jack was startled he hesitated for a long tense moment struggling for a better idea himself when nothing came he conceded doubtfully you dont look much like herthat is like the descriptions of her he said at last ill meet them in the conservatory she reasoned the lights very poor in there and ill have the right color dress and a black wig if i can pass for long enough to get a reaction it might be enough the plan sounded desperate as she described it a very slim chance and she felt her hopes thin as wraiths drain from her grasp if he even knows me it will prove something he felt her panic and put his hand on her arm gently it might be dangerous he warned danger would be marvelous it had the kick and the fire of hot wine and seemed very close to outright victory no one would turn up unless he knew cerise and if anyone threatened her with violence it could only be because she was too close to the truth i know she said with a surge of excitement but youll be there and emily i need emilys help ive worked it all out ill take the dress and wig in a bag and give them to emily beforehand then when we are there after dinner i shall pretend to be faint and excuse myself emily will look after me so i can slip up to her room and change then shell watch and tell me when to go down to the conservatory she said the yorks have a large one to keep my trysts youre leaving a lot to chance he said anxiously can you think of anything better he hesitated for a moment no he admitted ill do everything i can to keep all the others occupied in the withdrawing room ill make some riveting conversation he smiled bleakly for heavens sake promise me if there is the slightest danger youll scream i mean it charlotte i promise she giggled a little wildly although it would be awfully difficult to explain wouldnt it what on earth should i say i was doing in their conservatory dressed in a hideous gown and a black wig screaming my head off when i was supposed to be upstairs with the vapors i should have to say youd taken leave of your wits he agreed with a very twisted grin but better that than deadand whoever it is has already killed three times her laughter suddenly stopped becoming tight in her throat bitter tears sprang to her eyes it will be four with thomas she said she made her assignations by letter using as few words as possible and leaving them unsigned she had no idea what cerises handwriting looked like nor what her real name was she used expensive notepaper wrote only the time and place and instead of sealing the letters in an envelope she tied each one with a broad piece of ribbon in a vivid almost painful magenta it was the best she could do emily had written to her banker and provided money so charlotte could purchase the dress and the wig and jack had taken them to hanover close posing as a coalman this time and carrying coke inside to the kitchen for them how he arranged it charlotte never knew and she was too preoccupied with her own preparations to ask that evening she dressed in a very simple smoke gray and white gown of emilys judiciously let out by emilys maid it was not nearly as flattering on charlotte with her darker complexion and mahogany hair as it had been on emilys appleblossom fairness but it had the one merit charlotte was looking for now it was very easy to get in and out of she dressed her hair with the minimum of fuss so it could be squashed flat under a wig without removing a hundred pins first the result did not make her look her most attractive but it could not be helped jack was tactful enough to refrain from commenting although his face registered slight surprise quickly replaced by a smile and a wink they arrived at hanover close a few minutes late as was the acceptable thing to do and were handed down from the carriage onto the icy pavement charlotte took jacks arm up the steps and into the lighted hall as the door was closed behind them she felt a moments panic then forced herself to think of pitt and said rather too effusively good evening mrs york how kind of you to invite us good evening miss barnaby loretta replied with far less enthusiasm i hope you are well our city winter is not disagreeing with you only just in time charlotte remembered that she was going to be taken ill after dinner she chose her words carefully i do find ita trifle different there is a very little pleasure walking in the streets here and the snow seems to get dirty so quickly lorettas eyebrows rose in faint surprise indeed i have never considered walking it is very good for the health charlotte managed to sound agreeable without actually smiling in the withdrawing room veronica was standing by the hearth in a very fine gown of black and white looking considerably more composed than the last time they had met she welcomed charlotte with what seemed like genuine pleasure especially when she saw her very indifferent gray gown the usual greetings followed and charlotte was relieved to see that everyone the plan required was present harriet looking pale aunt adeline in an unfortunate dress of vivid brown which made her eyes the more startling loretta in salmon pink her bodice stitched with pearls at once individual and utterly feminine but far more important the men were there julian danver smiling with candid directness garrard danver elegant more elusive than his son quick of wit and she thought perhaps more original piers york was there as well welcoming her with the sincerity that is a mixture of long practice and genuine awareness of privilege and its responsibilities good manners were as natural to him as rising early or eating all the food on his plate he had been taught them in the nursery and now they were ineradicable with jacks help charlotte devoted her mind to the usual trivial conversation that preceded dinner dinner itself was quite ordinary the talk meandered from one unimportant topic to another it was an uneven party in that there were four unmarried women present and only three unmarried men one of them being garrard danver who could have no possible romantic interest in his daughter or his sister and presumably not in veronica who was shortly to become his daughterinlaw since he was twentyfive years charlottes senior she would have been most unlikely to have been paired with him in anyones mind even supposing he had any desire to remarry and of course jack was assumed to be her first cousin and therefore unsuitable nevertheless loretta was a skilled hostess tonight she seemed to be using all her very considerable charm and poise to strike a perfect balance between dominating the company and making everyone else feel at their best if she tried a little harder than usual or if her hand gripped the stem of her wineglass so her knuckles were momentarily bloodless perhaps it was her daughterinlaw who had given her very real cause for anxiety she could not be blamed if she was nervous in case even at this point veronica should show some trace of the hysteria the willfulness or the latent jealousy so ugly to any man and which had come through her fragile exterior so very lately in the imagined privacy of her bedroom since it was such a small company and the hour was a little later than usual for the end of dinner jack rather boldly suggested that they not separate but all retire to the withdrawing room together he did not even glance at charlotte he was playing his part to perfection it was time charlotte took her cue everyone was rising to leave the table was littered with half empty dishes and crumpled napkins the gas in the chandeliers was hissing gently and the flowers underneath them looked waxy white artificial they must have come from the conservatory charlotte felt ridiculous now that the time had come there had to be a better way it would never workthey would see right through her and there would be nothing for jack to do except say she was mad nursing the sick aunt had turned her wits miss barnaby are you all right it was julian danvers voice coming to her out of a mist ii beg your pardon she stammered elisabeth are you ill veronica came back to her her face full of concern charlotte wanted to laughshe had created the desired effect without even trying she heard her own voice answering automatically i do feel a little faint if i might go upstairs for half an hour im sure i shall recover i just need to rest for a short while its really nothing are you sure shall i come with you veronica offered no pleasei should feel most guilty dragging you from your party perhaps your maid was she being too obvious they were all staring at herperhaps the whole charade was perfectly transparent did anybody really behave like this of course veronica agreed and the words were such a relief charlotte could feel the blood rush back into her face and she felt like laughing they would put her down as a hysteric for goodness sake she must get out of the room and upstairs ill call amelia veronica said quickly going to the bell if you are quite sure oh yes charlotte said too loudly quite five minutes later charlotte was upstairs in emilys small cold attic bedroom she looked at emily and pulling a face she slipped out of the gray and white dress emily presented her with the glowing dress of almost violent cerise oh lord charlotte closed her eyes come on emily urged get into it youve already made up your mind dont waver now charlotte stepped into it and pulled it up cerise must be a remarkable woman to look ravishing in this fasten me up come on ive only ten minutes to get to the conservatory wheres the wig emily finished the fastening and passed her the black wig it took them several minutes to get it right and to apply the rouge charlotte had brought emily stood back and looked at her critically you know thats not bad she said with considerable surprise in fact you look quite dashing in a garish sort of way thank you charlotte said sarcastically but her hands were shaking and her voice was not quite level emily was watching her closely she did not ask if charlotte still wanted to go on with it right charlotte said more firmly see if the passage is clear id hate to meet the parlormaid on the stairs emily opened the door and looked out took half a dozen stepscharlotte could hear her feet on the boardsthen came back again come on quick you can get down these stairs and if theres anyone coming well duck into veronicas room they scuttled along the corridor down the stairs and onto the main landing then emily stopped sharply and held up her finger in warning charlotte froze amelia it was a mans voice amelia i thought you were looking after miss barnaby emily started down again yes i am ive come to get her a tisane avent you got any upstairs not peppermint would you get me some ill stay here in case she callsi dont think shes well at all please albert standing above her at the head of the stairs charlotte could hear the smile in her voice and picture the soft look she was not in the least surprised when albert agreed without a murmur and the next moment emily was back at the bannister again whispering fiercely to her to hurry charlotte came down so rapidly she almost fell on the last step she catapulted across the open hallway and through the conservatory door into the blessed dimness of the sparse yellow nightlights her heart was beating like a triphammer she felt as if her whole body must be shaking and no effort could fill her lungs with enough air she stood under the ornamental palm at the far end of the pathway so she could see the door to the hall if anyone came she could step forward and the light would catch primarily her shoulder and skirt showing that burning color her face would remain in the shadow of the overhanging frond but would anyone come perhaps cerise never made assignations by letter or maybe her writing or the words she used were utterly different from what charlotte had written and the recipients would recognize that instantly she had given julian danver the earliest time if he were going to come he should be here any moment in fact he was late how long had she been here she could hear the faintest sound of footsteps somewhere in the houseprobably albert in the hall they were not coming this way closer to her there was a steady dripping of moisture from one leaf to another and finally onto the damp earth beneath the smell of vegetation was overpowering she tried to occupy her mind and failed utterly every train of thought dissolved into chaos driven out by the tension that was tightening like the slow turning of a ratchet her hands were sticky and felt like pins and needles was she going to stand here in the dark under a potted palm half the night the whisper startled her so violently it could have been at her shouldershe did not even know what the words had been he was standing just inside the doorway eyes wide the yellow light making his cheeks look unnaturally haggard and chiseling his nose more finely charlotte stepped forward just enough to present a clear silhouette against the green and for the light to catch the searing pink dress he was surprised when he saw the color the smoothness of her bare shoulder and the slender curve of her neck the black wig for an instant the pain in him was totally naked it was too late to call it backgarrard danver had loved cerise the storm of it had left the wrack in his face in spite of himself he came towards her she had no idea what to doconspiracy infatuation she had been half prepared for but not such pain unconsciously she backed towards the palm and the light above her fell on her bosom garrard stopped his eyes were hollow he was like a caricature ugly and beautiful even in his despair there was selfknowledge a shaft of irony then she understood of course everyone had said cerise was thin nearly flatchested and charlotte was rather well endowed even with a tight dress and unflattering camisole she still could not pass for the elegant leanness cerise was said to have who are you he said very quietly who did you think i was when you came she had thought of that question long before his smile was ghastly i had no idea i never imagined you were whom you pretend to be then why did you come it was a challenge to see why you wanted me of course if youve blackmail in mind youre a fool youre risking your life for a few pounds i dont want money she said sharply i want she stopped he was close to her now so close she could have lifted her hand and touched his cheek but she was still in so deep a shadow that he had not recognized her there was someone else in the doorway someone motionless with horror and yet with such a passion of jealousy in her face she might truly have seen hell in the quietly dripping leaves and the two figures standing almost touching each other and that harsh incandescent outrageous dress loretta york garrard turned very slowly and saw her he did not look embarrassed as charlotte had expected nor ashamed the wretchedness in his face was fearand worse than that a kind of revulsion water slid off the leaves and landed on the lily petals with a faint plink all three of them stood motionless at last loretta gave a little shudder and turned on her heel and went out garrard looked at charlotte or rather at the gloom where she stood his voice was hoarse he had to make two attempts at speaking whawhat do you want nothing leave go back to the party she hissed he hesitated peering at her unsure whether to believe her or not and she retreated almost backing into the palm go back to the party she whispered fiercely go back his relief was flickering but he did not wait all he wanted was to escape a moment later she stood alone in the conservatory she tiptoed to the door and looked out there was no one in the hall not even emily should she risk running upstairs now or wait until emily gave her the signal perhaps this emptiness was the signal if albert came back it would be too late she was at the foot of the stairs without having made a conscious decision it was too late to go back she picked up the magenta taffeta of her skirt and ran up as fast as she could please heaven there would be no one on the landing nor anyone on the stairs leading to the servants quarters she got to the top breathless her heart pounding the narrow passage was deserted nothing but doors on either side which one was emilys hellfire she had completely forgotten panic rose inside her if anyone came she would have to dive for the nearest room and hope it was empty there were footsteps on the stairs now she scuttled to the door turned the handle and pushed it she was only just inside when the footsteps reached the top she waited if they came in here there was nothing at all she could do frantically she looked around for something to hit them with she could not be hauled downstairs like a common housebreaker charlotte charlotte where are you relief nearly made her sick she felt heat and icy cold rush over her prickling on her skin she pulled the door open with shaking hands im here ten minutes later she was downstairs in the withdrawing room again her hair a trifle disheveled that was easily explained by saying that she had been lying down and yes thank you she was quite recovered now she remained fairly quiet not wanting to risk the amazing luck she had had so far her hands still trembled a little and her mind was crowded with anything but stupid conversation the party broke up early as though by common consent by quarter to eleven charlotte was sitting beside jack in the carriage telling him about garrard and loretta in the conservatory and the expressions she had seen in their faces then she told him what she proposed to do next ballarat agreed to see her with reluctance my dear mrs pitt i am sorry you have been caused such distress believe me he protested but there is really nothing i can do for you he rocked backwards and forwards on the soles of his feet and stood again in front of the fire i wish you wouldnt harrow yourself in this way why dont you go and stay with your family until er he stopped realizing he had painted himself into a corner until they hang my husband she finished for him flatly he was acutely uncomfortable my dear lady that is quite she stared at him and he had the grace to blush but she had not come to antagonize him and giving free rein to her feelings was selfindulgent and stupid im sorry she apologized with difficulty swallowing her loathing of him because his fear was so much greater than his loyalty i came to tell you i have discovered something which i felt i must tell you immediately she ignored his exasperated expression and went on the woman in pink who was killed in seven dials was not the same woman in cerise whom dulcie saw in the york house and miss adeline danver saw on the landing in the danver house that woman is still alive and is the witness that thomas was looking for a twinge of pity touched his face and vanished again witness to what mrs pitt he asked with an effort at patience and even if we could find this mysterious womanif she existsit would hardly help pitt the evidence is still there that he killed the woman in seven dials whoever she was he sounded eminently reasonable certain of his lightness yes it is charlottes voice was rising and there was a sharp note of panic in it in spite of herself someone dressed that woman in a pink dress and killed her to protect the real cerise and to get rid of thomas at the same time dont you see she asked her tone scathing with sarcasm or do you imagine thomas pushed the maid out of the window as well and presumably killed robert york toogod knows why ballarat put his hands up ineffectually as if he would pat her then saw the passion in her eyes and backed away instead my dear lady you are overwrought its very understandable in your circumstances and believe me i have the deepest pity he drew breath again and steadied himself reason must be paramount robert york was killed by a burglar and the maid fell quite accidentally he nodded it does happen sometimes unfortunately extremely sad but not in the least criminal and really my dear lady miss adeline danver is quite elderly and i believe not the most reliable witness charlotte stared at him in disbelief at first and then with sickening comprehension either he was frightened of all the unpleasantness the anger the blame if it were true and there really was treason in the foreign officeor else he was part of it she looked at his rounded jowls his blustery complexion his lidless brown eyes round as buttons she could not believe he was a brilliant enough actor to seem so much the ambitious man tricked and caught out of his depth for a second that passed like a ripple of wind over the surface of a pond she was sorry for him then she remembered pitts bruised face and the fear she had seen in his eyes you are going to feel very foolish when this is all over she said icily i had thought you had more love for your country than to allow treason to flourish merely because uprooting it might prove distasteful and embarrass certain people whose favor you would like to keep ballarats face mottled purple as a turkey cock and he took a step forward you insult me madam he said furiously im glad she glared at him with scorching contempt cutting off his words i had feared i merely spoke the truth prove the wrong and no one will be happier than i in the meantime i believe what i see good day mr ballarat she walked out without looking back leaving the door open behind her let him come after her and close it himself she knew what she must do ballarat had left her no choice had he promised to investigate she would have left it but now there was nothing else she could think of there was a ruthlessness in it of which she would not have thought herself capable but it was shocking to her how easily it came because she was fighting to protect those she loved more than herself whose pain she could not bear as she might have her own her response was primal and nothing to do with the mind charlotte had understood that look in lorettas face in the doorway of the conservatory she was in love with garrard danvertotally obsessively in love which was not hard to believe he had a grace an individuality that was unusual and he would be a challenge to most women there was something elusive in him the suggestion of great passion beneath his rather brittle shell and selfprotective humor if only one could find the secret of touching the heart or the soul inside to lovely loretta bored with the charming but controlled piers the hint of something much wilder might be irresistible and obviously garrard had loved only cerise all that hunger and flood of emotion all loretta dreamt of awakening herself had been plain in his face when for a moment the sight of charlotte outlined in the half light and the flame of the dress had stirred an anguished memory she must get them all together and press and press until someone broke garrard was the weakest link he was afraidshe had seen that in his face tooand repelled by lorettas hunger for him charlotte could remember when a man had once felt such a lust for her and caroline had blindly thought him suitable as a husband charlotte had been nearly hysterical when left alone with him briefly it had seemed ridiculous later caroline had been angry not understanding it was years ago now and the incident had vanished from her mind until she saw garrards face in the lamplight and the peculiar mixture of horror embarrassment and revulsion brought it back with such precision that it made her skin crawl garrard was the one she must press with all the force she had but there was no way within her power to make the yorks invite the danvers the ashersons and herself and no one else they might not ever do itcertainly not within the few remaining days before pitt would be arraigned and brought to trial to have such a gathering in emilys house would be inexplicable and jack had no facilities either although emily would willingly have financed the event no the answer lay with aunt vespasia and surely she would be willing accordingly charlotte abandoned the public omnibus and recklessly took a hansom cab to aunt vespasias house having paid the cabbie and released him she climbed the shallow steps up to the front door and rang the bell she had been here many times before and the maid showed not the slightest surprise at seeing her vespasia received her in the boudoir which was full of light and space sparsely furnished in cream and gold with touches of deep green a great green fern in a jardiniere stood against one wall only the steeply banked fire saved it from chill vespasia herself looked more fragile but she still had the perfect bones of the amazing beauty she had been forty even thirty years ago she had aquiline features heavylidded eyes under arched brows and coiled hair like old silver she was dressed in dark lavender with a high fichu of brussels lace at her throat how are you charlotte asked immediately and it was not merely good manners or the need for help there was no one outside her family and few within it she cared for as much as she did for aunt vespasia vespasia smiled quite recoveredand probably far better than you my dear she said frankly you look pale and considerably fatigued sit down and tell me how you are progressing what may i do to help she looked beyond charlotte to the maid who hovered in the doorway tea please jennet and cucumber sandwiches and some cakes something with whipped cream and sugar icing if you please yes mlady and jennet disappeared closing the door softly well vespasia demanded when charlotte left her plans were perfected down to the finest detail she felt immensely better for the food and realized she had not been eating as she shouldeither shed forgotten or she had no heart for it aunt vespasias determination eased a great deal of the despair tightening inside her she had very gently encouraged charlotte to let go of the selfcontrol which had kept her dryeyed and rigid for so many days charlotte wept fiercely with abandon naming all her fears rather than forcing them down inside her like black devils had robbed them of some of their horror now that she had spoken them aloud and shared them they no longer seemed unconquerable when aunt vespasia sent a handwritten letter two days later to say that the dinner was arranged and the invitations accepted it was time to prepare jack for the last and best gamble of all emily knew of it also in as much detail as charlotte dared tell her in a rather oddly coded letter delivered by gracie by omnibus jack was far more nervous than charlotte had expected when he collected her at quarter to seven on the evening of the dinner but as soon as she was settled in the carriage and had a chance to weigh her thoughts she realized that this was her own blindness just because he had done all he could right from the beginning never questioning pitts innocence or emilys harebrained plan to go to the yorks did not mean he had no emotion under his rather casual exterior after all he was born and bred in a society where manner was all one very quickly became out of fashion if one either loved or offended and real emotions were apt to embarrass which was even worse they could disturb the peace of mind unsettle spoil the pleasure and that was inexcusable if jack were worth anything then of course he was nervous he probably had a sick fluttering in his stomach just as she did and a racing heart and hands that were clammy no matter how often he wiped them they did not speak on the journey they had made all the plans they could and there was no time for trivia it was bitterly cold a rare winter night when the ice was crackling hard on the road and in the frozen gutters the keen wind off the sea had blown the fog clear and even over the city the smoke did not obscure the stars which seemed to hang low as if someone had exploded a chandelier across the sky vespasia had chosen charlottes gown for the evening and had obtained it for her disregarding her protests it was of deep ivory cream satin touched here and there with gold the bodice scattered with pearls it was quite the most flattering garment she had ever worn lowcut and with a beautiful bustle even jack who had wined and dined with the great beauties of the age was startled and impressed they were shown into vespasias withdrawing room and found her seated by the fire on a highbacked chair as if she were a queen receiving court she wore gunmetal gray with a choker of diamonds and pearls and her hair above her arched brows was coiled like a wrought silver crown jack bowed and charlotte without thinking dropped a curtsy aunt vespasia smiled there was deep conspiracy in it the situation was desperate but there was also exhilaration going into battle england expects that every man will do his duty aunt vespasia whispered i believe our guests are about to arrive the first to come were felix and sonia asherson looking agreeably surprised to be there vespasia cumminggould was something of a legend even to their generation and they knew of no reason why they should be among the very few invited to her house what had seemed in sonia to be an unbearably placid complacency in this light appeared merely the rather regular cast of her features and an expression of politeness felix appeared frankly interested he could be extraordinarily charming when he wished he knew how to flatter without words and his infrequent smile was devastating aunt vespasia was nearly eighty as a child she had seen the celebrations after the victory of waterloo she remembered the hundred days and the fall of napoleon she had danced with the duke of wellington when he was prime minister she had known the heroes the victims and the fools of the crimea the empire builders statesmen charlatans artists and wits of the greatest century in the history of england she was happy to play with felix asherson and kept the smile on her own lips flawlessly unreadable the danvers were shown in ten minutes later julian seemed perfectly at ease he felt no compulsion to show off or to push himself into the conversation charlotte decided veronica might well be fortunate garrard on the contrary was quick to speak his face drawn his hands moving nervously as though stillness were an unbearable strain charlotte instinctively scented the kill and hating herself for it made no difference at all to her intentions the choice lay between garrard danver and pitt it was no choice at all harriet danver was also far from comfortable she looked more fragile than she had on previous occasions although it was possible that was due to her wearing a shade of smoky lavender which echoed the shadows in her pale skin and made her eyes look even larger either she was very much in love and finding the pain unendurable or there was some other knowledge or fear preying on her mind aunt adeline was dressed in topaz and gold which suited her very well there was a slight flush on her cheeks which robbed them of their usual sallowness it was several minutes before charlotte realized adeline felt vastly complimented to be invited to aunt vespasias home and the occasion had excited her greatly charlotte felt a sharp spearthrust of conscience she would dearly like to have abandoned this but it was not possible last to come were the yorks veronica ethereal and magnificent in black and silver sweeping in with her head high and color in her cheeks she checked herself almost before she was through the door at the sight of charlotte standing close to julian danver his admiration for her was extremely obvious and it was equally obvious just for an instant that veronica had never before appreciated what a potential rival charlotte might be little miss barnaby from the country was a considerable beauty when she chose veronicas greeting had lost several degrees of warmth by the time they met in the center of the floor for once loretta also looked less sure of herself her aplomb was a shadow of her old certainty as always she was meticulously groomed exquisitely feminine in golden peach but the fluidity had gone the wound charlotte had seen in the conservatory was still raw she did not look at garrard danver piers york was grave as if aware of tragedy without knowing its nature or direction either that or he chose to ignore it his face lit when he saw vespasia and charlotte realized with surprise that they had known each other for years all the customary greetings were made petty courtesies exchanged but already the undercurrents had begun to pull to tear and distort for half an hour they talked of the weather the theater figures of fashion and politics they all seemed to be enjoying themselves except garrard and loretta if piers had any reservations he was too practiced to reveal them charlotte found her attention wandering she must not begin yet she would wait until dinner begin too early and she could dissipate the very tension she was seeking to build they must all be seated facing each other with no escape except the violent act of physically leaving a hostesss presence only illness could excuse that the moments dragged by the inane conversation fell word by word as she watched their faces and planned felix was enjoying himself even with harriet and gradually she lost her pallor and joined in sonia was swapping gossip with loretta veronica was flirting with julian looking in his eyes ignoring charlotte vespasia smiled and spoke to each of them in turn drawing out small selfrevealing comments and now and again her eye caught charlottes with the faintest nod at last dinner was announced and they went in two by two taking the places vespasia had set for them with meticulous forethought harriet next to felix asherson and opposite jack so he could see any expression in their faces julian next to charlotte and most important loretta and garrard next to each other under the chandelier so no flicker of muscle no shadow in their eyes could escape charlotte directly opposite soup was served lobster bisque and conversation flagged next came the fish deviled whitebait then the entree of quenelle of rabbit when they were just beginning the removes of quarter of lamb aunt vespasia regarded julian danver with an agreeable smile i understand you are quite a rising star in the foreign office mr danver she said a most responsible situation not without its dangers he looked surprised danger lady cumminggould i assure you i seldom leave the extremely comfortable and eminently safe rooms of the foreign office itself he smiled at veronica quickly then back again at vespasia and even if i were posted abroad to some embassy i would insist on it being in europe indeed her silver eyebrows rose in what countrys affairs do you specialize in the affairs of germany and its interests in africa in africa she asked i believe the kaiser has some imperial designs there which may inevitably conflict with ours you must be involved in delicate negotiations his smile remained all the other conversation had stopped and faces were turned towards him of course he agreed the corners of vespasias mouth curled upwards very slighdy and do you never fear betrayal or even some slight quite honest mistake that could hand the advantage to your opponentsyour nations opponents he opened his mouth to reply dismissing her fears suddenly the words died and a shadow touched his face then he banished it one has to be careful of course but one doesnt speak of state matters outside the foreign office itself and of course you know exactly whom to trust charlotte made it more of a statement than a question i imagine treason begins little by little first a small confidence elicited perhaps by someone in love she glanced at harriet and then back at felix personal loyalties can make such a mess of morality she said quietly aware of what she herself was doing even at this moment aware of friendship the unwritten laws of hospitalityand of love that overrode them all it was not that she thought she was right or that love excused it simply that it was elemental as an animal protects its own there were spots of color in felixs pale cheeks sonia had stopped eating and she clutched her fork in a white hand whose knuckles shone perhaps she was not as complacent as she seemed after all i think you areromanticizing miss barnaby felix said awkwardly charlotte looked at him innocently do you not believe in the strength of love to overcome judgment mr asherson even for a moment i he was caught he smiled to cover his dilemma you press me to be ungallant miss barnaby shall i say i know no woman however charming who would ask the questions i was not free to answer for a moment charlotte was beaten but then if it were so easy it would not have eluded her thus far you dont know the mysterious woman in cerise the words were out before she had time to judge them she saw jacks eyes widen and aunt vespasia let her fork fall onto her place with a little click veronica held her breath staring at charlotte as if she had cast aside a mask to reveal a reptiles form garrards face was bloodless his skin yellowgray it was loretta who broke the silence her voice grating in the stillness really miss barnaby you have a taste for the melodramatic which is unfortunate at best i think you would be well advised to reconsider your reading matter there was only the slightest quiver in her words barely a tremble of course she did not know charlotte had seen her face in the conservatory doorway you should not read novels of the trashier sort she continued they coarsen the taste i think she has been reading the newspapers jack said hastily certainly not charlotte lied with a touch of irony i heard it from a running patterer it was quite unavoidable he was crying it out all over the street apparently this marvelously beautiful woman led some poor diplomat into revealing secrets and then betrayed him she was a spy rubbish felix said loudly he stared straight at charlotte avoiding even the slightest glance at harriet or her father he might have wavered had he looked at garrardhis face was so ghastly he seemed to be suffering some physical pain rubbish felix said again my dear miss barnaby running patterers make their living by entertaining the masses they invent half of it you know for a moment the tension eased charlotte could feel it slipping away she must not lose it the murderer was here at this shining dinner table with its silver and crystal and white flowers but not out of nothing she argued people do fall passionately in loveso deeply they would forfeit everything betray all the old loyalties she looked round at their faces as if she were appealing to them veronica was numb her dark eyes enormous absorbed with some inner horroror was it fear at last was she after all the real cerise and was that why garrard had known charlotte was an imposter he had just left veronica in the withdrawing room he said he came only because he feared blackmail but if that were so why did he not marry her himself or had she tired of him and chosen his son instead perhaps julian was her mistake her weaknessshe had loved in return or was julian simply a way into a more powerful position he was destined for higher things than his father perhaps even a cabinet position did loretta know that or had she guessed her face was ashen but it was garrard she stared at not veronica piers was confused he did not understand the meaning of what had been said but he knew the fear and the passion that was in the air he looked like a soldier readying himself to face enemy fire harriet looked wretched embarrassed and sonia was pale with defeat aunt adeline spoke miss barnaby she said quietly i am sure such things do happen from time to time if we are capable of great feeling of any sort there is always the chance it may lead to tragedy but does it serve any good end that we should delve into it have we a right to know other peoples griefs charlotte felt the blood hot in her cheeks she liked adeline and she doubted she would ever be forgiven this total hypocrisy and deceit not tragedy she agreed a little less steadily not if it concerns no one else but treason concerns us all it is our country our people who are betrayed harriet put her hands up to her face white with horror there was no treason felix shouted good god any man can fall in love unwisely harriet drew her breath in a gasp of anguish so sharp it was audible to all of them felix swung round harrietthats all i swear i never betrayed anything garrard looked as if he had been struck veronica gaped at felix her mouth open her eyes like sockets in her head felix youand cerise loretta started to laugh at first a gurgle in her throat then it rose higher till it was out of control on the brink of hysteria youand cerise do you hear that garrard do you garrard shot to his feet upsetting wine and water over the cloth no he cried desperately its not true for gods sake stop stop felix looked at him appalled im sorry he whispered staring past his wife to harriet im sorry harriet god knows i tried what julian demanded what the hell are you all talking about felix did you have an affair with this womanthis cerise felix tried to laugh and it died in his throat no no i didntofcourse i didnt there was such bitter humor in his voice that he could only be speaking the truth no i was trying to protect garrard for harriets sake isnt that obvious soniaim sorry no one bothered to ask why the answer was only too obvious in harriets face and indeed in his own that domestic tragedy was laid bare there was no mystery left to uncover father julian turned to garrard now realization was coming to him and a dawning of pain if you did have an affair with this woman what does it matter unless you killed her no the cry came from garrard like the howl of a mortally wounded animal i lovedhis voice droppedcerise he glanced at loretta with a hatred stripped of all its veneer of irony weariness disillusion goddamnyou the words were choked from him there were no tears on his face he was past weeping but his pain pulsated through the brilliant lights and the glittering reflections there was thick silence for a long hot moment no one understood then at last julian grasped the sword you betrayed the department he said very slowly you told cerise about the anglogerman partition of africa thats what felix was covering up for you because of harriet garrard sat down very slowly suddenly stiff no his voice had lost its fire of hate everything had gone out of him felix didnt know i took the papers only that i loved cerise but the secrets had nothing to do with cerise he looked up again at loretta and all the passion of hate flooded back i took them for her he cried his voice shaking she blackmailed me into it thats ridiculous piers said quietly for pitys sake man dont make it worse than it has to be what on earth would loretta want with secrets like that anyway as i understand it the negotiations are going very well arent they yes julians brow furrowed yes they are no one has used your wretched information well then piers sat back his eyes touched with sadness perhaps his dreams of loretta had died a long time ago your charge doesnt make sense charlotte remembered lorettas face in the conservatory doorway and knew that in her was the consuming passion of desire and rejection that governed this tragic violent story yes it does she said aloud the information wasnt taken to be used in negotiations ha julian exploded derisively he had seen hope and he clung to it something much more powerful charlotte cut across him once you have paid blackmail you have to go on paying you have put yourself in your blackmailers power that was what she wantedpower to exercise whenever she wanted power to destroy whomever she chose wasnt that it mrs york he loved cerise not you he didnt love you didnt want you you revolted himand you never forgave him for that she met lorettas eyes and saw that she had drawn the ultimate pain and a hate so terrible that loretta would have murdered charlotte if she could in an instant as their glances locked they both knew it did you think that wretched woman in seven dials was cerise charlotte continued pitilessly is that why you broke her neck you wasted your effort she wasnt cerise she was just some poor maid whod lost her character and fallen on hard times you murdered her garrard accused loretta his voice high and harsh you thought it was cerise so you broke her neck be quiet loretta was cornered trapped and she knew it her soul had been stripped naked in front of all the people round the table her rejection had been exposed for them all to see and taste and garrard was lost forever even the power to hurt him was gone she did not know how to fight anymore garrard had burned under her threat all these years dreading the meetings with her always afraid one day she would betray his weakness ruin his reputation and strip him of his position his career now it was gone anyway and he took his revenge you murdered her he repeated steadily you dressed that poor damn woman in that dress so you could blame that wretched policeman how did you find the woman who was she some maid youd dismissed and still knew where to find loretta stared at him dumbly it was the truth and it was painted on her face too clearly to be worth denying and dulcie he went on you pushed her out of the window why what did she knowor see dont you know she started to laugh hysterically oh dear garrarddont you know tears streamed down her face her voice getting wilder and higher every moment jack stood up and moved towards her asherson he said sharply in a daze felix rose and came to help between them they half lifted her from her chair and took her from the room vespasia stood also stiffly her face pale i am going to telephone the police superintendent ballarat i believe it is and the home secretary she looked round the table at them i apologize for such anan unfortunate dinner party but you see thomas pitt is a friend of mine i cannot sit by and see him hanged for a murder he did not commit please excuse me head high back like a ramrod she swept out of the room to exert all her influence to call on old friendships and have pitt released now tonight in the silence behind her no one moved but it was not over there was still cerise the real cerise and who had murdered robert york and why had that also been loretta charlotte believed not on shaking legs she rose too ladies i think we should retire i cannot imagine anyone feels like eating anymore i certainly dont obediently they pushed back their chairs and straggled through to the withdrawing room adeline and harriet went together leaning a little on each other as though physical proximity could give them strength sonia asherson hugged her hurt to herself tightlipped lastly charlotte followed at veronicas elbow in the hallway she drew her aside into the library veronica looked round startled as though the booklined shelves unnerved her charlotte stood against the door blocking it theres still cerise she said quietly the real cerise the woman garrard loved thats you isnt it me veronicas eyes widened me oh god how wrong you are but why why do you care why have you done all this who are you charlotte pitt charlottepitt you meanyou mean that policeman is your my husband and im not going to let him hang for murdering that woman he wont veronica said harshly loretta did it we all heard her say so you dont have to worry it isnt finished charlotte turned the key in the lock theres still the real cerise and whoever murdered your husband i dont think that was loretta i think it was you and loretta knew it she protected you because of her own blackmailing of garrard even though you killed her son thats why you hated each other and yet neither of you could afford to betray the other howi veronica shook her head slowly incredulous theres no purpose in denying it charlotte could not afford pity now this was cerise she might not be a spy after all but she was a ruthless passionate woman and a murderess was it to marry julian did you get tired of robert and murder him so you could marry julian no veronica was so ashen charlotte was half afraid she was going to faint and yet she was cerisecerise with the flair the panache the courage im sorry but i cannot believe you i am not cerise veronica put her hands over her face and turned away crumpling in a heap onto the sofa oh god i suppose id better tell you the truth it isnt what you think at all charlotte sat carefully on the edge of a chair waiting i loved robert youll never believe how much not now but when we were married i thought i had everything a woman could want he washe was so handsome so charming and sensitive he seemed to understand me he was a companion more than any other man id ever known ii loved him so much she closed her eyes but the tears seeped through and she gulped in spite of herself charlotte was filled with pity she knew what it was to love so much your whole world was filled with it she too had suffered loneliness go on she said softly what about cerise veronica made an intense effort her body shaking her voice husky as if the words cut her robert grewcool towards me i she swallowed and her voice sank to a whisper he becameuninterested in thethe marriage bed at first i thought it was me that i didnt please him i did everything i could but nothing she took a moment to control herself then struggled on it was then i began to think there might be someone else she stopped the pain of memory too strong for her charlotte waited instinct made her want to rush forward put her arms round veronica and hold her enfold the pain and ease it touch her so she was not alone but she knew she must not not yet at last veronica mastered herself i thought there must be another woman i found a kerchief in the library it was a bright cerise color vivid vibrant i knew it wasnt mine or lorettas then a week later i found a ribbon then a silk roseall that dreadful color robert spent a lot of time away from home i thought it had to do with his career i could accept that we all have to women i mean you found her charlotte said very quietly veronica drew a deep breath and let it out with a shuddering sigh yes ii saw her very brieflyright here in my own home just the back of her as she left through the front door she was soso graceful i saw her a second time at a theater i shouldnt have been at i only saw her at a distance across the balcony when i got there she was gone she stopped again charlotte believed the story in spite of herself the wound was too real to be painted the memory still hurt veronica with a raw and twisting pain go on charlotte prompted this time more gently did you find her i found one of her stockings veronicas voice was thick with the agony of reliving it in roberts bedroom it was so i wept all that night i thought i should never feel worse in my life she gave a little choking sound half laugh half sob thats what i thought then until the night i knew cerise was in the house something woke me it was after midnight and i heard a footstep on the landing i got up and saw her come out of roberts bedroom and go downstairs i followed her she must have heard me and slipped into the library i she stopped again her voice died away thick with tears i went in too i faced her she managed after a time she wasbeautiful i swear she was she turned and looked up at charlotte her face smudged blurred with misery and defeat she was so elegant i faced her accused her of having an affair with robert she started to laugh she stood there in the library in the middle of the night and laughed at me as if she would never stop i was so furious i picked up the bronze horse from the desk and threw it at her it hit her on the side of the head and she fell i stood still for a moment then i went over to her but she didnt move i waited a moment and still she lay there i felt for her pulse listened for her breathnothing she was dead then i looked at her more closely her face was ashen charlotte had never seen anyone look so exhausted her voice was so low it was barely audible i touched her hairand it came away in my hand it was a wig it wasnt till that moment that i realized who it was it was robert himselfdressed as a woman robert was cerise she closed her eyes and pressed her hands to them that was why loretta blackmailed garrard he was in love with robert and he knew all the time who he was thats why she protected me she hated me for it but she couldnt bear to have the world know her beloved son was a transvestite after i knew he was dead i went upstairs i think i was too shocked then even to weep that came later i went to loretta and told her and she came down with me i didnt even think of lying then we stood there in the study she and i and stared at robert lying on the floor in that terrible dress and the wig beside him there was rouge on his face and powder he was beautiful that was the most obscene thing about it weeping overtook her and without thinking this time charlotte knelt beside her and put her arms round the thin aching shoulders and you and loretta changed his clothes dressed him in his own nightshirt and robe and destroyed the cerise dress and wig and then broke the library window she concluded she knew this was what must have taken place where are the things that were supposed to be stolen but veronica was sobbing too deeply to tell her three years of fear and pain had broken at last and she needed to weep till she had no strength left no emotion charlotte held her and waited it hardly mattered where those few objects were probably in the attics they had not been sold that much pitt had made sure of the rest of the house must be busy with private tragedies piers with loretta and the police poor man whatever disillusion he had suffered in the years since the first bloom of his marriage no loneliness of closed doors of the heart could have prepared him for this felix would be smarting from the newly opened wound of his love for harriet it was quite hopeless divorce would ruin all of them and no happiness could lie that way and now sonia had been forced to see it understand it and know that others saw it also she could no longer hide her pain behind pretended blindness or perhaps it had been realmaybe she had known nothing and aunt adeline would grieve for them all julian would be far too busy with his own familys despair to disturb charlotte and veronica now he would be only too grateful to leave miss barnaby to comfort his fiancee in what he supposed was no more than shock minutes went by stretching in the silent room charlotte had no idea how long it was until veronica finally exhausted herself and sat up her face a travesty of its former loveliness charlotte had only a meager handkerchief to offer i suppose they will hang me veronica said very quietly her voice quite steady now i hope it is quick to her amazement charlotte answered immediately and without a quiver i dont see why they should i cant think of any reason why they need to know about it you only meant to hurt him it was a hideous mischance that the blow hit his temple and killed him veronica stared wont you tell them nono i dont think theres any point i used to think i was a very civilized person but since thomas has been in prison and might have been hanged i discover that i have a savagery in me that doesnt think first when i must fight for those i lovelove more than i can understand or control i dont know if its right but i think i know how you might have felt what about julian wont hewont he hate me anyway because he thinks im cerise and that i drove garrard to then tell him the truth veronica looked down she was too exhausted to weep anymore hell leave me anyway i killed robert and lied for three years to hide it i didnt know about loretta and garrard but i dont suppose he would believe all of that charlotte took her hands if he leaves you then he doesnt love you as you want to be loved and you must learn to live without him perhaps in time there will be someone else losing robert was not any fault of yours nothing was lacking in your love no woman could have held him but julian is different if he really loves you then he will still love you even when he knows believe me we all have something to be forgiven love that expects perfectionno past with mistakes pain learningis only hunger no one grows to maturity without acts to be ashamed of in accepting that we love not only the strengths but also the weaknesses and real bonds grow between us tell him if hes worth it hell accept your pastif not immediately then in a little while for the first time veronica lifted her chin her eyes widened and there was a stillness in her the violence inside calmed and her fear slipped away i will she said very softly i will tell him there was a knock on the doorgentle requesting permission charlotte stood up and went to turn the key come in the door swung wide and aunt vespasia stood there with a tiny smile on her face she stood aside behind her stood emily still in her maids dress but without the apron and jack with his arms round her beside them was pitt filthy his face hollow shadowed round the eyes and marked with bruises but it was radiant with a smile of joy so intense he looked positively beautiful
