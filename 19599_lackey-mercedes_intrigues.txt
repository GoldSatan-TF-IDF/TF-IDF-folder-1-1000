chapter mags slapped the palm of his hand against the bluepainted wood of the stable door and it banged open whacking into the frame as mags hurried through it the noise echoed through the stable startling the companions that were huddled together in the aisle nearest the door into backing up a pace or two brick walls didnt do much to deaden sound the chill wind that followed him through chased down his neck as the last icy grasp of winter clawed at him behind him a few stubborn patches of granular snow lingered at the bases of trees and under bushes but most of the ground was bare which was a welcome relief after a winter season that seemed as if it would never end the huge blizzard that had virtually closed down haven palace and all had been followed by snowfall after snowfall until mags began to wonder if spring was ever coming then finally the snow stopped and began to melt and now the weather was changing but winter was definitely not going quietly occasionally a frigid wind showed that it wasnt quite done yet mags pushed the door closed leaning into it as the wind whistled around the edges before the spring latch dropped into place with a snick he took a long deep breath of the comforting smell of the companions stable clean straw clean horse a hint of damp wool another hint of woodsmoke if home had a scent this was it all of the pristine white horses in the building looked in his direction for a moment before going back to whatever it was they had been doing for a moment mags was the focus of a sea of blue eyes the largest stallion in the building who had presumably been chatting with two other companions in the middle of the aisle between the stalls gave him a long look down his aristocratic nose that mags read as disapproving bad manners to interrupt just not done besides you let the cold wind in also not done hmph it wasnt in mindspeech but it might just as well have been the stallions ears were slightly laid back and he swished his tail in irritation sorry rolan mags said quickly ducking his head as the kings own companion continued to give him the stern look of the elder he strolled under the watchful gaze down to the end stall near the door to his own small room and came face to face with his own companion dallen horsesor companionscouldnt grin but he sensed more than a little amusement from his bondmate dont worry about rolan he likes to think that he stands in one place and the universe revolves around him dallen said dallens blue eyes shone with amusement and while one ear twitched in mags direction the other pointed back toward rolan a snort from the other side of the stable told mags that dallen hadnt bothered to keep that little comment quiet rather than mindspeaking directly to mags dallen had communicated it openly so that every companion in the stable could hear it mags grinned there were times when dallens cheekiness didnt just border on impudence it jumped right into the middle of impudence and splashed it all around rolans just being prickly people have been banging through that door all day and of course they let the freezing cold draft in every single time it starts to get a little warmer dallen reached over his shoulder and tugged his blueandwhite blanket a little higher on his shoulders with his teeth this is why i am sporting my natty little rug here of course some people dont want to wear their blankets because they cant show off their muscles so when a draft roars in they are the first to complain there were whickers from all over the stable at that one and another louder snort mags smothered a giggle with both hands thank you for your amusing observations dallen came a very loud ringing mindvoice one that was probably heard all the way down to the edge of haven ill be sure to recommend you for court jester now there were whickers from virtually every stall including from dallan who had no problem poking fun at himself dallen tossed his head and somehow managed for just a moment to cross his ankles and his eyes inducing more giggles from mags until this weather breaks when i dont need to be out with you im staying right here in my stall hugging the hayit shields me a little from the blast of cold air each time someone comes in dallen continued complacently as kings own companion rolan went back to whatever important thing he had been discussing but i am well known as a lazy lout not lazy mags replied getting a brush to get whatever invisible bits of dirt and hay might be caught up in his companions shining mane and tail just practical if i didn have to go back and forth t classes id hole up in m room an not move till it got truewarm he sighed a little been so long since i seen a warm sun im beginnin t disbelieve in it don wonder that rolans tetchy dallen nodded vigorously oh i heartily agree with you all those days of dark cloud and endless snow made people depressed and edgy and now i think maybe some of us are losing our patience as well its hard to be cooped up in here knowing that spring is taking its time in getting here properly the stallion stretched arcing his neck so that mags could get at all the itchy spots with the brush as he did so im not the only one wanting a nice walk out on a lazy hot day with the sun blazing down too bad that wont happen for at least a couple of moons yet and when i think about how it feels to have a good roll in long grass and a gallop on a warm summer nightbah i start to feel out of sorts too especially when i think about those gallops on summer nights because i do look so splendid by moonlight mags had to smile at that and his mood lifted he leaned into dallens neck and continued to brush letting the motion soothe them both it had been another slightly edgy day for him and maybe dallen was right about people being out of sorts because they were cooped up he couldnt understand whywell he couldnt until he thought about it from the point of view of the other trainees most of them thought being forced to stay warm and indoors was a trial and not a hitherto unimaginable luxury actually he was probably the only one who felt that every day was spent in luxury eh not quite theres a couple from sheepcountry an a couple farmers an that gal whose da is a blacksmith still he was the only trainee who came from whatto the otherswas unimaginable poverty the vast majority of the trainees came from the highborn families or at the very least the prosperous even the poorest shepherd was appalled when he heard about the conditions mags and the other younglings with him had endured people were always complaining about somethingthe food the work the beds the uniforms didnt fit their rooms were too hot or too cold or soandso was too hard a teacher sometimes he wondered if they just made things up to complain about whereas he was grateful to wake up in any kind of bed at all doubly grateful that it was a warm bed in a warm room a clean warm bed on top of all of that for most of his life his bed had been filthy straw in a hole under the barn floor and a blanket more holes than cloth a bed he shared with a dozen other slavechildren it had never been warm even in the heat of summer it had never been clean he had never been clean not even when they were all given the rare good meal and apparent good treatment on the occasion of a show visit to satisfy those who were supposed to ensure their wellbeing baths never heard of them the only time dirt got washed off was by accident as he worked the sluices washing the gravel from the mine for tiny bits of gemstone having a warm soft bedthat was obvious of course anyone would like that but following his rescue and subsequent civilizing he had quickly discovered he liked being clean and after that first bath it had just gotten better although initially the experience had terrified him to put on clean clothing that wasnt rags eat good food that filled you upit was by the standards he had grown up with the stuff of which dreams were made no not even dreams when hed been a slave he hadnt even known that such things were possible so how could he have dreamed about them dallen was the reason all this had happened to him dallen had chosen him dallen had come for him and when the companion couldnt get him away from the man that had kept him and the others in terrible slavery dallen had fetched help in the form of another heraldjakyr of course at the time mags had been as terrified of the herald as he was of his master though in a way that had been good because his fear had kept him too paralyzed to move or run until dallen got him sorted out then oh how his life had changed becoming a trainee had changed his life so dramatically that he sometimes thought he had become an entirely different person take the food no more thin cabbage soup and bread that was mostly chaff or even sawdust no more digging into garbage pits and the pigslop for food that was too spoiled for the people living in the big house as a mineslavey his highest ambition had been to hit a richer vein of sparklies to earn himself one more tiny piece of bread than anyone else had and the living conditions no more sleeping in a pit on rotting straw in a heap of other dirty children or trying to keep warm with only a thin blanket and the body heat of the rest or wrapping his feet in straw and rags because you hadnt ever put a pair of shoes on your feet no more chilblains the trainees here at least so far didnt even know what a chilblain was and no more spending virtually every waking hour on his belly in a mine shaft chipping out gemstones by hand penalized by having some of his food withheld when the take wasnt good enoughas if he had any control over what the rock yielded to him that was the biggest change of all at least on the inside of him now he was using his head for thinking and learning all the time his world had gone from the confines of the mine and yard towella whole world his days were spent doing things that were difficult but rewarding and there was no punishment meted out if he wasnt good at them instead of punishment he got help unbelievable no the others had no idea how good they had things here and to be honest he didnt want them to know the way he knew no one should have to live like that but the differences between his life and theirs still made the adjustment hard for him in ways he suspected no one really understood he didnt even understand it except that he was always in a state of vague discomfort except when he was alone with dallen he felt like a kitten being raised by chickens it was obvious that no one here reacted the way he did to things and everyone here knew from their own experience how people were supposed to treat each other he hadnt been raised like a human being hed been raised likeno worse thanan animal he knew how to read and write because it was the law and the owners of the mine hed worked at grudgingly made sure the children learned that much but he didnt really know how to conduct himself among people who had what he now knew were normal lives he stumbled and fell in so many situations that required an understanding of how people were supposed to be that got him in troubleor at least garnered him odd looksso many times in a day that he didnt bother to keep track he was never quite sure of exactly what it was he had done or said when he violated some code or guideline for behavior that others just took for granted at least not until after the fact when dallen would explain it to him and no matter what he did how much he learned about behaving like other people did simply because he was so grateful for the smallest of thingsand so completely unused to themhe often had the feeling he was never going to fit in hed been a trainee for months now and he still felt as if he was running in a race in which he would never catch up that no matter how hard he tried everyone else was always going to be smarter faster stronger than he ever would be it went without saying that everyone from the lowest servant to the highest in the land was used to simply having more things than he did the most that one of the mine children could claim was a ragged scrap of a blanket and then only if someone bigger didnt take it the idea that he actually owned things was sometimes preposterous to him under it all was a fear he could never quite shake that someone would find him out and it would all be taken away from him that fear had faded over the months but it was still there an undercurrent to everything you know all i can do is to keep telling you is that you do belong here i chose correctly and no one is ever going to send you away dallen said breathing warm hayscented breath into his hair affectionately eventually ill wear all that away like water wearing away a rock mags sighed and patted dallens neck even dallen didnt quite understand it he couldnt help it this was the way he had lived forever and ever and maybe the rock was just too hard to wear away and then there was well his position here most of the people around him his fellow trainees in particular were used to a lot of deference from those of lesser rank and of course most folk outside the collegium were of lesser rank they were selfassured they expected that people would speak to them respectfully he was in the habit of expecting as many blows as words and no one ever had spoken to him with respect until he had put on grays the trainees were used to treating each other with a casualness that came hard to him while he had to battle to keep from giving them the same deference the servants gave them that of course was viewed as sucking up and last of all he truly admired the heralds and many of the older trainees he really wanted them to know that they had earned his admiration hellfires the heralds had saved him and all the younglings at that mine life was short there at the best of times at the worst well accidents had happened to the youngsters who got the least little bit rebellious there were always more unwanted orphans to replace them manners deference knowing how to act around other people all these things were absolutely alien to your thinking when you had grown up fighting over kitchen scraps and sucking up was a way to keep from getting beaten there had been plenty of times at the mine when he would happily have done almost any degrading thing in order to get just a little more food or a blanket that was a tiny bit larger anything so how could he relate to people who thought he was trying to curry favor when he was only thinking how much he appreciated being here but there was one thing he could always count on somehow dallen always managed to make him feel better no matter what happened no matter what faux pas he managed to commit and the moments when he was sure he would never ever go into whites were getting fewer most of the time he thought he was actually getting close to acting like everyone else even if he didnt actually feel like everyone else just keep on acting pretend long enough that you belong and eventually even you will believe it dallan nudged him with his nose you might also think about that spot right under my chin he grinned a little and gently ran the bristles of the brush along his companions chin having dallen as a comforting and persistent presence in the back of his mind kept him steady it was only when the invisible pressure got too much that he needed to physically come to dallen for relief just now the trigger that had sent him here had been a brush of a resentful thought that he was somehow trying to become the teachers pet when in fact all he was doing was trying to stay even with everyone else in class he couldnt help it he was grateful to the teacher for taking the extra time to explain why was saying so wrong you allus make me feel good he murmured to dallens shoulder i dunno why you don get tired of me ill forgive you if you actually hand over that apple pie that you promised said dallen nosing at mags pocket urgently you know pocket pies are far and away best when still warm and you said youd bring an extra from lunch happy to have something to take him away from thoughts that were always uncomfortable mags reached into his pocket and pulled out the two small rectangular pastriesa special treat for the colder day from the kitchen staff they were a handy way to take the dessert out of the dining hall and eat it later they kept your hands warm and the students always appreciated them it took a little more effort to make the individual pies but then again the dining hall tended to clear that much faster if the food was taken out that meant the dishes could be worked on faster tables wiped floor mopped and the whole job done that much sooner everyone benefited the door banged open again showing that mags wasnt the only graywearer that had thought to take the chance of a few stolen moments with his or her companion possibly with an extra pie to share as well companions did have a sweet tooth he didnt bother to see who it was if they wanted to talk to him theyd already know he was here and if they wanted privacy he wasnt going to invade it mags watched the pie vanish as dallen practically inhaled it i got no idea why you like em so much he said considerin that you couldnt possibly taste it id be surprised if it een touched yer tongue mags took a bite out of his own pie it was delicious it tasted as if the apples had been picked today which was remarkable considering it was probably made from dried apples from last year the head cook did pride himself on making food for well over a hundred people still taste as though it was made for a small family meal he almost always succeeded luncheon today for instance mags licked his lips thinking about it thick bean soup with bacon in it winter greens cooked with ham hocks lots of bread so fresh from the oven it burned your hands a little as you cut open the rolls and spread them with butter good plain food and plenty of it is what these younglings need was what hed overheard the man saying and if the highborn are too good for it they can go and eat elsewhere well if this was good plain food he really didnt want to eat with the highborn his head would probably explode and of course after this luncheon there had been the pocket pies waiting to be taken away at the door instead of regular pies on the table there were always pies the cook reckoned pie was a good way to share out fruit now that it was winter and make it last another undreamedof luxury at the mine the only time he ever tasted anything sweet was chewing the ends of cloverblossoms stealing honey from a wildbee nest or grubbing something sweet and burned out of the pigfood i taste my pie just fine thank you so do you feel that you are getting on in classes now asked dallen his enormous tongue licking teeth and lips and curling up around his nose in an effort to retrieve every crumb and speck of sugar honey and spices sometimes its hard to separate your general air of anxiety from things you and i genuinely need to address not doing too badly responded the boy in kind thinking as he took another bite from the pastry how he was glad to be able to use mindspeech it allowed him to talk and eat at the same time i think im gettin better at the history an i like figurin but today they started givin us this stuff they call geometry an it just makes my head spin lenas not as much help there as she is with history i cant imagine why we need anythin past sums and all i aint going to be an artificer the thought of the morning maths class made him sweat a little angles and unknowns and calculations and nothing as straightforward as adding or subtracting no you arent but you still need to have a grasp of such things when you go out to the villages its not just artificers that need geometry its part of a heralds duty to reset boundary markers after a flood or some other disaster and to check them when there is a dispute over land dallen nodded thoughtfully and mags got one of those mental glimpses of a heraldas usual someone he didnt knowlaboring over calculations then going out to reset boundary stones while two farmers watched him waiting for the slightest hint of favoritism all too often especially well away from haven a herald is the closest thing to an expert that some villager may have to depend upon for help thats why for example you take quite a lot of woundtending and basic healing classes nobody expects you to be a healerbut there might be times when someone is hurt and youre all theyve got try as he might he couldnt picture himself in that position of authority it still made his brow knit and sometimes his head hurt to think that some day someone would be depending on listening to him impossible who would ever believe in him i believe in you and anyway its not whether people believe in you personally when you turn up on circuit they wont know you and they dont have to they believe in the uniform and what the uniform represents they dont care who is inside that uniform as long as he makes good decisions because the uniform is what they trust mags chewed thoughtfully and swallowed there was one thing he could imagine himself doing he could easily see himself standing between danger and people who couldnt defend themselves after all hed already done that hadnt he hed put himself in danger to save bear and before that hed given all the information that the heralds needed to shut down the mine and save the rest of the slaveys he shuddered involuntarily when he thought of the revenge his old master might take if ever he discovered who had betrayed him and said with forced levity i reckon i might one day need th healin stuff for mself i heerd wha th real heralds call th whites oh shoot me now oh yes being a herald was dangerous sometimes he was glad of that it was rather like an i have good news and bad news scenario the good news is that you are going to be respected and all your needs and wants will be taken care of forever the bad news is that your new name is target sometimes he was relieved because he just could not bring himself to believe in this life unless there was a steep cost attached and sometimes he was terrified so despite his casual words there was a little chill down his neck when he thought about using the healing skills he was getting on himself it had gotten dreadfully close to that when hed helped save bear dallen gave mags a piercing look i wont pretend its not possible but it will be a good long time before you ever need to worry about being in that position you have years of learning ahead of you and who knows you might end up being stationed in haven or some other city and never go out on circuit at all all right dallens mindvoice had an undertone of anxiety mags smiled and rubbed his cheek against his companions neck im not gonna worrit bout it justsppose tis a good reason t keep payin more attention in harder classes belike specially if they involve bandages he laughed a little i got a long ways t go afore im catched up wi evone else anyway by time i get whites ill prolly be whitehaired t match he worked on dallen until the companions thick winter coat was as soft and clean as the down from a new pillow and his mane and tail as shiny as silk he carefully saved away all the long mane and tail hairs for later braiding now that he knew just how much people valued the little trinkets dallen had taught him to make with companion and horsehair he even had a little netbag hung up on a nail in the stall to collect the hair in hed wind what he collected into a little circle and carefully stick it into the bag as he did now with dallen clean and under his blanket again mags looked out of the stall tween you and me when i come in like that rolan looked as though id spoilt his best chatup lines was he on bout businessor pleasure behind him dallen made a noise that closely resembled a snicker it wouldnt surprise me in the least if you did interrupt him flirting you know not that he would ever come off his dignity to admit it im pretty sure that most of the mares have a crush on him mags turned and cocked his head reckon hes poachin in yer woods dallen he grinned again the stallion snickered ill have you know that pure resplendent perfection that i am im in no danger of losing a lightolove even to rolan its not as if im languishing away in this this box waiting for you to visit he managed to curvette and prance in place like a showy parade horse mags had to laugh though i must admit that it does help that you are so attentive with the grooming it puts the polish on what is already exquisite dallen curved his neck and struck a pose an modest too mags chuckled but of course it is part of what makes me so lovable dallen batted his enormous blue eyes at mags he had to chuckle even more i swear yer worsen onea them court fellers next thing yell be wantin me t find ye a silknvelvet blanket cause wool just dont show off yer coat good nough hmm you think dallen paused just long enough for mags to begin to wonder if his companion was serious then whickered his laughter i shall recommend one to rolan hell need it to compete with me rolans gonna pull yer tail off one a these days mags shook his head i dunno why he aint yet because no matter how miffed he pretends to be with me he likes my tweaking his vanity and i like to let him get all huffy with me its how we muddle along that was a word that was unfamiliar he shook his head muddle along whassat mean muddling along is an art form dear boy its the great secret to life you cant plan for everything so you take the good and the bad and cope as they happen and even though life gets muddled you somehow manage to get by mags thought about that it was true that he mostly lived in the moment without thinking about good or bad times at least not on purpose but that was because when he thought about such things then although the times were good there was always somewhere under everything a feeling of certainty that they couldnt go on being good all his experience had taught him that so was that just thinking about today and not worrying too much about tomorrow what dallen meant by muddling along not exactly the companion corrected you get hope in the bad times that there are better ahead and there are you temper the good times with plans for the future because you know there will be bad ones and sadly there will always be bad times its in the nature of things well he could certainly agree with that dallen nudged him the rule is that most things dont matter as much as you might think so long as you keep that firmly in mind then neither foe nor loving but misguided friend can hurt youat least not so badly that you cant recover mags regarded him dubiously were none of us quite so sure of our place in the world that we cant be rocked off our feet by bad times its the getting back up again that counts not that you fall but getting back up again counts for more in the long run mags snorted you ought to set up shop in the mindhealers area and charge a penny a customer with all that dallen raised his head and looked regal you can mock but answer me one important question if you will mags nodded dallen lowered his head and looked his young trainee hard in the eye are you actually going to eat that other half of your pie he queried pointedly because if youre not mags sighed then laughed and gave it to him chapter when mags left the stables he hadnt so much as a hint of a crumb anywhere about his person dallen had even made big eyes at him until he turned all his pockets out proving there wasnt even a fragment of crust left as he pulled the door closed against the wind he caught a glimpse of someone approaching out of the corner of his eye he turned and saw an older man a full herald in pristine whites walking toward the stable door he was holding a halfeaten pocket pie in one hand mags grinned at him i see yer had the same idea i had he announced dont let my companiondallensee ye have that or ye might lose it and fingers too the herald blinked in surprise and then let out a rich mellow laugh ah youre dallens chosen that would make you mags yes his cultured accent showed that he was highborn but he seemed quite relaxed and utterly friendly most of the time when mags saw a full herald unless it was a teacher it was usually someone in a tearing hurry mags nodded and smiled back noticing that the man had curiously colored eyes a very light gray silver he would have said if hed been asked to put a name to it they looked very odd and striking with his dark hair mags wondered if he could be newly assigned as a teacheror perhaps just in from circuit there were new heralds coming and going all the time weve been hearing very good things about you trainee mags the herald nodded as if to emphasize that he agreed with the assessment im glad i had the chance to run into you you came to the collegium with no expectations and no memory of how we used to teach trainees are your classes going well under the new system is there anything about them that you think is giving you and your fellow trainees trouble mags gave a surprised chuckle of his own given how many heralds were still against the new system he was pleased to find one that seemingly wasnt more than that he was pleased to find one that was actually interested in improving the system rather than just criticizing it well im not as good at figurin past sums as i oughtta be i think but im catchin up with folks n doing pretty good wi history i reckon if i was t say though i reckon some on us like me yah but some others too needs extree help an not all on us is brass nuff t go find it them highborns they kin go to ma or pa an say get me a tutor eh but we caint we caint pay fer em an mostly we kinda shy off askin teachers he pondered a moment longer so mebbe jest find summuns willin t give the help an hev em say bout it in class no hevin t ask fer help nor tryin t find summun willin t give it cause some on us is shy bout askin or shamed t admit it jest hev summun awaitin ina room after classes an them as needs the help jest shews up an teachers there t get em over the rough spots the older herald nodded looking oddly pleased mags had a nagging feeling of familiarity he was sure hed seen this man before somewhere unfortunately he realized he was at that awkward point in the conversation where stopping to ask a name seemed a little odd he groaned inwardly proper manners were very hard would it be wrong to ask now his hesitation cost him his chance the older herald smiled well said and a fine idea ill have a word with the right people i am even more pleased now to have run into you mags flushed a little eh i jest say things don mean im right jest say things cause im too dumb t know i shouldn the herald laughed and there is a very wise saying that only the young are unsophisticated enough to see past the mask to the truth and brave enough to speak it aloud im sure well be seeing each other soon with that he opened the door and went into the stable leaving mags staring after him still trying to pin down why he was so familiar then he shook his head and pelted for the collegium at a dead run vaulting the fence around companions field rather than taking the time to open the gate and scrambling up the path with his bookrucksack banging on his shoulders fortunately his next class was at the nearer end of the building he wasnt the last person to dash in through the door though he was the last to fling himself behind his desk still mags managed to arrive without being late getting into place mere moments before the teacher entered the classroom the class itself took all of his concentration and managed to drive all thought of the odd encounter right out of his mind it was one of those maths classes the ones where he was supposed to figure out angles and the like it made his head hurt he was concentrating so hard and feeling altogether like the stupidest person in the class sums were so easy but this there were so many things he had to keep track of thank goodness the next class was history he was always ahead on history it waswell not logical exactly because history was people and people werent always logical but it was like stories there was a beginning a middle and an end but as he was going into the door for his last class he was approached by a page boy and handed a piece of paper it was a note from herald caelen the head of the collegium asking him if hed come by after classes were over for the day his first thought immediately was what did i do wrong his second was to think back to that encounter at the stable with the herald what if the herald had been offended at his forwardness what if hed insulted the herald by not addressing him by name what if the herald was one of those who didnt approve of the new system what if he did but was offended by mags implied criticism his head spun and he felt that alltoofamiliar old reaction back in his old life the only reason someone in authority would want to see him would be because he was in trouble or that someone was looking for a scapegoat to punish he reminded himself that he wasnt in his old life hed never had that sort of thing happen to him here but it was hard to break his old ways of thought he could all too easily imagine a hundred things he would have done or said wrong as he worried them all through the class dragged along he tried to reason with himself maybe caelen wanted to see him for a good reason rather than a bad one probably caelen wanted to see him for a good reason maybe that herald had told caelen he had a good idea and caelen wanted to ask him about it finally he managed to convince himself that this was the most probablea sign that at least if he had not overcome his instinctive reactions he could finally reason his way past them regardless everything about the impending meeting kept him distracted during a lesson that was not one of his best subjects this was the language class and language with all of its rules about grammar and spellingmade no sense to him nothing about it was logical and just when he thought hed gotten a rule straight in his head it all went out with some exception or other and as for his spelling well it was creative this generally made for a long lesson at the best of times and being preoccupied made it longer at last the teacher dismissed them though unfortunately with a writing assignment just what he needed with his head all of a muddle mags wondered if lena would help him put it together and then wondered if he was going to be too busy trying to make up for what hed done wrong to ask her once again his mood dropped and he had convinced himself that he was in trouble he pulled his books together into his shoulder bag suddenly wishing the lesson had been even longer what could caelen want as he walked along the corridor feeling as if he was under a dark cloud and wondering if he should pretend he never gotten the note he felt a familiar presence in the back of his head its probably not bad you know his companion assured him i would have warned you if id seen you doing anything that was that bad but you arent going to find out unless you go there was an amused chuckle no matter what youll muddle through besides how do you know caelen isnt going to thank you for coming up with a good idea that was enough to lift his mood at least a little and give him enough courage to head for caelens office and knock tentatively on the door come in called caelen through the door mags pushed it open the blocklike herald was as usual rather buried in things on his desk there were sheafs of papers stacked precariously around him and it was impossible to tell which were things he was done with and which he had yet to work on mags blinked owlishly at the piles how did caelen ever get through all the work that was piled on him every time he thought that he was piled high with work he would get a glimpse of what caelen faced and know that the work of a trainee was nothing caelen looked up and gave mags a warm smile and then followed his gaze and made a wry face budgeting he sighed he waved vaguely at the piles i have to account for every penny spent in heralds collegium and my procrastination has come back to bite me again he stabbed a finger at the paper in front of me it doesnt help that i have no idea sometimes what im signing for here it says we ordered a bale of dried marrow root he rolled his eyes i have no idea what marrow root is or since this order is missing half of its information where it came from and yet i have to sign to say its justified and if someone comes to ask me what in heavens name i was thinking when i signed for it i will be sitting here looking like a fool mags peered at the paper bear would probly know he suggested trying to be helpful caelen laughed well since hes the one that put in the request for it i sincerely hope so i gather it is something that he feels would do you lot good in the winter he put aside the piece of paper and looked mags over youre growing he noted nodding approvingly its good to see you filling out considering the size you were when you arrived i wont say you were the smallest trainee we have ever had but you were certainly the thinnest and certainly the shortest for your age mags looked down at himself can really help it he said shrugging sorta happens all by itself the herald rubbed his greying temples i suppose it does he replied with a nod well that brings me to the reason i brought you up here i was reminded today that you are in a room that is usually used for the grooms that care for the companions and i thought now our building work was getting closer to completion that you might like one of the newly built rooms that are free it would get you out of the stables and in with the other trainees mags was shocked and his jaw dropped move away from dallen he asked aghast caelen gave a chuckle i can see if you put it like that that it would be a wrench but it would stop you from standing out as he gave a wry smile the trainee that we stuck off in the stable hows that bad mags asked adding as an afterthought sir not like it bothers me youll recall that bit of an altercation over you being there in the first place caellen said with a grimace you know already that there are many of the adults who would be certain any boy out in a room alone far from adult supervision is certainly up to no good trainee or not well of all the things hed heard here that took the prize for making no sense but i got dult supervision mags protested companions bunches on em if i was t get t jiggerypokery ye know theyd be callin in t their chosen he could just imagine it too say purloining a couple of bottles of wine to try out what being drunk was like hed not get two cups into the first bottle before half the collegium including all the teachers would be at his door and he didnt even want to think about what would happen if he was up to anything worse than that and what dallen would say to himhed rather be whipped caelen shrugged you have a very good point about the supervision well if that is how you really feel i wont make you move i thought a boy your age would be a little worried about how the others might think of him it might be thought a little odd to be down there all alone people are very likely to wonder why you are there if there is something that makes you antisocial or ifoh say for example your mindspeech is less than controlled and we are keeping you apart from the others to prevent problems from it or as if you are some sort of pariah and we want to keep you away from the others to keep you from contaminating them mags shook his head ifn i can stay i want to he stated firmly it aint like im in the way its the warm end o the stables n i think the companions like me being there if somethin was t happen id be right there fore even someuns chosen could or onea the grooms cause the chosen d haveta run down from collegium an dallend wake me afore a groom knew there was aught wrong i dun mind bein alone id druther actually its quiet easy t study easy t sleep aint no one larkin about an makin noise i never had no privacy afore an an i like bein where no one kin bother me an i definitly like being next t dallen well i suppose if you feel that strongly about it caelen sighed i suppose it cant hurt to have someone in the stable as we come toward foaling season anyway the companions usually keep everyone aware of when foaling is likely but once in a while its a surprise he cocked his head and looked mags over i reckon youll be able to keep a level head in an emergencyand of course the companions will help even though dallen is a jokester hes solid in a crisis i understand mags grinned with reliefand a little at hearing dallen described as a jokester evidently his tweaking of rolans tail had gotten around aye sir that i reckon e is caelan blinked you knowyou are a little young for this but something just occurred to me ive something id like you to consider adding to your lessons its a good thought actually and something that will get you working with some of the other trainees a good bit more he means he thinks you need to be socialized dallen said wryly he thinks you ought to be running about with a herd thats all right he means well and perhaps whatever it is he just thought of will be fun you have been sorely missing out on fun caelan carried on oblivious to dallens comments well after all he couldnt hear them companions rarely mindspoke to anyone but their chosen it was unusual that rolan had let mags hear his sarcastic remarks to dallen you and dallen have an exceptionally close bondim told your mindspeech is remarkably strong according to your records you and dallen are also two of the leaders in the riding lessons those two things would make you a pair of ideal candidates for what i have in mind the older herald grinned like a young boy think youd be up to being part of a kirball team mags frowned kirball hed heard the term bandied about mostly during meals but hadnt really gotten any notion of what it meant besides that it was some sort of game a brand new game one that several of the heralds themselves were devising for the traineesbut mags had no idea what was involved well other than the fact that judging by the exuberant handgestures and pantomime it was probably going to be very exciting for those who were in it its a new game that the heralds are trying on the students this year they are rebuilding the obstacle course out in the field and running it over that its part goal scoring part capturetheflag and part team building caelen was oblivious to the fact that none of this meant anything to mags fortunately dallen quickly provided his chosen with images of what caelen meant we think it will be a good learning exercise for the trainees i believe it originally got its name since herald kiri came up with it shes always one for inventing crazy ways to test the trainees but this one has definitely become popular the name seems to have stuck it doesnt hurt that one could say it was meant to honor king kiril as well something nagged at the back of mags mind but he couldnt quite put his finger on it and the thought ran away as dallen rang in loud and clear oh i would like that just think youll get to compete on the fastest companion in the city came an eager comment showing mags that dallen was still listening in well be fantastic at this the herald continued leaning forward and becoming animated as he did so heres the basic idea now weve done a lot of games on companionback in the past but what is new about this is that the students form teams from all three collegia some will be on companions of course but some will be on horses and then some afoot its a twelveperson team and the way we have planned to run it is that competition can be two teams against each other a threeway three goal arrangement or even four teams all in though for now while we work play and rules out it will just be two teams against each other itll be chaos on the field and if i understand kiris companion correctly thats sort of the idea its supposed to show how well you deal with a fight and get you used to something like a battle without actually being in one its wargames by any other name noted dallen that said it should also be a lot of fun mags frowned wargames he repeated aloud caelen winced visibly well thats part of it i cant pretend it isnt but its a combination of riding skill teamwork communication and how well you use your gifts in a pinch there will be people on each team that dont have gifts dont have mindspeech dont have companionswhich is just like a battlefield this will test and train your abilities to put together an effective small force of all sorts of folk setting things up so that each uses his strengths that said i think its going to be fun and its going to be something for all the students to get involved in mags thoughtful frown deepened gifts are allowed he asked pondering how that would work caelen nodded vigorously within reason i think we might have issues with someone using firestarting to burn someone since we dont want actual combat as such but i should think most gifts will be useful i suspect the people with the fetching gift are particularly going to be in demand for this and those that dont plan on a counter to it are going to find flag and ball scored against them without the other team even moving mags furrowed his brow huh i think i see thats gonna to take some thinkin about actually it looked as if the amount of planning was going to equal the amount of playing well as long as it wasnt him having to do the planning yes it certainly is anyway the riding instructors are going to be pushing people onto the teams as i permit we dont want people getting onto teams that arent fit for a bit of roughhousing after all caelen raised an eyebrow at him m pretty tough sir mags said since he could sense dallens excitement in the back of his mind and didnt want his poor companion to explode reckon thisd make me a mite tougher too an that aint bad caelen nodded once this gets well underway i suspect that your weapon instruction might be more focused on defending yourself from the back of a companion as opposed to merely on foot this year and if what i hear about the way you ride is correct youre going to be a popular pick for one of the two heraldic positions on a team ordinarily id eliminate a firstyear trainee just on the basis of lack of skill and experience but you have more than enough skill to make up for any other lack that startled him the idea of being popular and wanted for something was quite unexpected he had never really thought of himself as excelling in anything other than riding which was face it a rather solitary occupation oh he was good enough with weapons the hand to hand ones but he wasnt brilliant and the riding well that was mostly dallens doing and he had figured everyone knew that he didnt quite know what to say in response caelen looked pleased at his reaction didnt think you were any good eh still worrying about not measuring up he gave a soft chuckle and tousled mags hair dont worry about it and dont stand there gawping like a fish gasping for air go now off with you and if you change your mind about rooming up here in the main building you let me know all right mags closed his mouth still blinking and tried to exit the room gracefully he leaned against the wall outside feeling a little breathless dallen was amused of course youre a good rider youre on me who wouldnt be brilliant on the fastest sleekest most handsome companion in all of valdemar that broke his shocked mood of course and made him laugh still laughing he headed on toward the dining hall he clattered down the stairs to the main hall and joined the thin stream heading in the direction of food savory scents were already filling the hallway making everyone hurry on the way amidst a gaggle of other students he spotted the dark curly hair and rustcolored uniform of his best friend lena herself a bardic trainee he called her name and she waved and weaved her way through the crowd toward him mags she greeted him im sorry ive been so busy you betterve been eatin he chided her i aint seen ye fer two days she ducked her head guiltily im sorry i got caught up in a special project its a fourperson performing group and yes we were eating our teacher had food brought in so we could eat while we worked did that history paper go over well he grinned at her relieved as she tucked her hand into his arm and they breasted the crowd together aye it did and thankee kindly miss teacher king tyrdel and the war of the harvests and how after e died his daughter elspeth made peace and expanded the borders wi treaties and a marriage he patted her hand i reckon a bard coulda tole the tale better though she smiled back well it sort of is our job to be historians mags bardic talent goes hand in hand with a love of stories and it doesnt matter if we make them up ourselves nor if they are modern or from deep in history at least so my tutors keep telling me he cocked his head to the side huh i caint magine why anyoned haveta keep tellin you anythin you never seem t ever stop workin oh they tell me plenty she replied making a face like i need to quit trying to write pieces with arpeggio if im no good at doing it myself but i like arpeggio he squeezed her hand as they got within sight of the door of the dining hall so whas the answer she sighed practice i spose as usual practice seems to be the answer to everything the crowd in the entrance thinned as students filed into the dining hall and took seats for the meal lena started to pull mags along whats the hurry he asked its roast beef tonight and beans with bacon therell be nothing left if we dont get in there she said honestly some people are just like locusts she was exaggerating of course and mags had no fear of that it hadnt happened yet and he didnt think it was likely to in a hurry on the other hand she was right about some people being like locusts it was entirely possible that the choicer portions would have been snapped up if they didnt get to a seat quickly he increased his pace to match hers a figure in a full bards outfit stepped in front of them from one of the staircases that led to the upper stories a tall and very handsome man with dark hair that was greying at the temples held out his hand imperiously forcing them to a halt ah trainees excellent i need one of you to take this note to the kings own herald i shall be performing for an entertainment for the king this evening and he needs to discuss with me which pieces would be best for the audience he held out a folded piece of paper mags expected lena to take it since she was the bardic trainee and this was definitely one of her expected duties he glanced at her and was surprised to find her whitefaced and unmoving he reached forward and took the paper from the man and nodded i know herald nikolas sir ill take it the bard nodded and turned on his heel without a further word mags turned to lena that was rude he muttered e coulda said please at least lena was staring openmouthed at the retreating figure mags looked from her to the man curiously dyou know him or summat he said doesnt look like he knows you too lena blinked slowly and shook her head he ought to have recognized me she said in a strained tone of voice hes my father mags stared at the note in his hand and looked at the retreating bard nonplussed and then back at lena but was all he managed looking at the shaking girl he just couldnt think of anything to say she made it easier for himin the sense that she abandoned any pretense of conversation when she turned and hurried back down the hallway the way they had come without saying another word to him he went after her but when she broke into a sprint that made it quite clear that she didnt want him around or knowing lena anyone around she dashed around a corner and was gone before he reached it he slowed to a halt and caught his breath looking down the corridor but she must have run out the door probably heading back to bardic and her room if she was determined to be alone he was going to have to give her that even though he really doubted that she should be alone right now he gave a frustrated growl and stared back the way he had come her father but the man hadnt recognized her surely lenas father couldnt have failed to recognize his own daughter he glanced back at the vacated corridor ruefully lena certainly seemed to believe he could be capable of that her shock had been real but there hadnt been any surprise just bitter unhappiness he thumped the wall frustrated here he was stuck between two duties torn between going after his friend and taking the note in his hand to herald nikolas or a rebellious part of him said hang the note and go have dinner and take the note when youre done bards be damned he sighed at that thought but this was supposed to be about something for the king and if he didnt deliver it in a timely manner that just would show that he was too stupid to be trusted with more important matters definitely more trouble than he needed to have hounding him with a second sigh to match the first he turned away from lenas direction and considered where herald nikolas could be found he eyed the entrance to the dining hall listened to his stomach growl at the wonderful smells coming from it and then almost kicked himself for missing the obvious dallen could yer fin out from rolan where nikolas is and then a moment later for politeness sake he added please a wry chuckle came back and bother his high and mightiness since he seems to be just fine with talking to you as well why dont you just ask him yourself hmm mags was rapidly feeling irritated enough by this entire mess to do just that but he mentally counted to three and tried again dallen i can do games reet now i got a note from a bard t take an lena says yon bards her pa an he didnt recognize er an shes mortal upset an ran off an its beef night so you know thats upset ah in that case there was a pause hes coming to you stay where you are well that was easy enough mags relaxed a little perhaps nikolas would be able to explain what was going on at any rate it meant he wasnt going to have to run all over half the palace and collegia to try and find the man the kings own herald appeared at the end of the hallway shortly recognizable by his silvertrimmed whites and mags trotted down the long polished expanse to meet him holding out the note there was a look of faint annoyance on nikolas face and once again mags felt himself shrinking back in guilt ah bother i went an interrupted him in something an now wretched bards nikolas muttered taking the note think that they stand in one place and the sun rises and sets just to illuminate them properly thank you mags you should never have been bothered with this he read it quickly after flashing mags a hint of an apologetic smile and as he read his brow furrowed again with exasperation just as i thought there is nothing here that i needed to be bothered about he could just as welland more appropriatelyhave gone to the steward with this nonsense nikolas looked as if he very much wanted to crumple up the note and throw it away he wasnt angry at least not that mags could see but he was clearly very much annoyed i dun understand sir mags said humbly nikolas shook his head and grimaced its a kind of status game marchand plays every time he turns up at court he just wants an excuse to make the kings own jump through his ornamental hoops conceited popinjay that he ishe wouldnt get away with this kind of behavior if he were less gifted i can tell you that mags was still puzzled does havin a lotta gifts make that much on a difference in how folksre treated he asked it shouldnt but it does nikolas rolled up the note with exaggerated care and slid it back and forth between his fingers then there is the artistic temperament that bards are supposed to have that marchand milks like a prize heifer and which has thus far spared him from censure lita has been much too indulgent with him and i am strongly considering seeing to it that steps are taken to give him a reprimand e aint gifted nough to tell when his own younglings standin in front of him mags replied feeling much relieved that nikolas wasnt annoyed at him e looked at lena like she was a stranger didnt een notice how upset she was of course he didnt notice hed have to remove some of his attention from himself for a moment nikolas replied crossly never mind ill get this dealt with and i will make sure it is the last time marchand does anything like this again one way or another mags you properly did exactly what you were told to do now i want you to get some dinner then go to the kitchen on my authority and have someone make up a dinner basket for lena you take it to her room if she wont let you in and she might not find the proctor for her floor and tell her what happened and leave it with her meanwhile ill send a servant with a message for lita and shell deal with bard tobias marchand and lena too mags sighed with relief good he wasnt in trouble and lena was going to get sorted out and he was going to get some dinner after all and maybe a chance to get into that new book hed found if lena was still too upset to come out of her room she probably would be over the course of the past several moons there was one thing he had noticed though girls at the mine had mostly been indistinguishable from the boys so far as how they behaved was concerned girls here had a whole different set of behaviors from boys one of them was to go lock themselves in their rooms for candlemarks or even days when sufficiently upset when they did that only other girls could get near them nikolas wasnt done though also when youre done with lena i want you to come up to my rooms i have a little task for you well so much for the book oh well whatever it was it wouldnt be trivial strange as it seemed mags was the kings owns private information source and even sometimes a sort of spy books could wait yessir he said and waited to see if there was anything else nikolas wanted him for well dont dawdle or you wont get anything but the crusty ends of the beef nikolas said tapping him on the top of the head with the rolledup message get the kitchen was buzzing with gossip when he went to get the dinner basket from the sound of things the arrival of bard marchand was going to be a nine days wonder everyone was agog at his presence back in haven and all that anyone could talk about was how brilliant and how handsome he was mags sat on a stool out of the way and waited for one of the undercooks to put that meal basket together and listened notice no ones talkin bout how nice he is mags thought sourly to his right serving maids helped collect the leftovers and sort them into what was going back into the larder and what was going out to charity nothing was wasted in the kings kitchens do ye think well get a chance t hear him like one of the serving maids sighed her eyes all dreamysparkly as she deftly combined the remains of three pies into one pan one of the undercooks rapped her on the top of the head with a spoon hes not for the likes of you guurl she growled so you can pull that little thought right out of your head the most you be like to hear is a snatch of song while you be servin the wine an if you go all moony and spill the wine itll be the pots an pans for you for the rest of the year well put una the head cook rumbled from where he was supervising the making of porridge for breakfast on the morrow and he cast a dark look around the kitchen that goes for all of you if i hear of one incident that happened because you were gawking at the bard the gawker will find herself demoted to scullery maid if shes lucky that didnt stop the gossip but at least it went to whispers behind hands as the head cook shoved the finished dinner basket at mags so across the lawns and gardens he wentthe gardens still slumbering under their layers of carefully raked leaves and compost like heralds collegium bardic had separate sections for the girls and boys rooms but the moment he turned up at the door to the girls rooms at bardic collegium and asked to see lena he was told to wait right there he sat down on a bench in the little entryway thinking that it was a very good thing that there was an extra hot plate in the bottom of the basket keeping everything warm he had been here before now and again people were allowed to have other people in their rooms he knew that the dean of the collegium had her office quite nearby and shrewdly reckoned it was to keep any mischief from happening in the girls section bards were not known for keeping regular hours and the head of bardic was no exception to this rule if you didnt know for sure whether or not the dean was in her office you would probably think twice about getting up to something and that was when he heard it master bard lita darvalis dean of bardic collegium and head of the bardic circle sounding off in full voice and she was not singing oh no i am appalled appalled tobias if you were a trainee youd be in the kitchen peeling roots at this very moment with an assignment to analyze all three hundred verses of maddy graves to follow how dare you order trainees about as if they were your personal pages not even bardic but a herald trainee over whom you have precisely no authority there was a moment of silence which mags his ears burning assumed wasnt silence at all but the bard attempting to answer well if you are going to act the fool in the middle of a crowded hallway at dinnertime you had better anticipate that the gossip is going to be all over all three collegia before the pie is served mags let out his breath oh good he wasnt going to be the one bard marchand was going to blame for being hauled before bard lita and above all else how dare you try and turn the kings own into your personal flunky i have children in this collegium that were raised in barns and fostered by sheep that have better manners than you displayedin public no less and you a master bard there was another moment of silence whatever it was that marchand said it only made lita angrier you are a disgrace tobias dear gods above and below did every single bit of what you learned in courtly graces fly out of your head the moment you left the collegium no one no one sends the kings own a note about a performance unless its about a suspected assassin in the audience if i could do it i swear i would break you down to journeyman at this very moment what in the name of the seven hells were you thinking lita didnt give him a chance to reply this time never mind i would rather assume that you werent actually thinking at all its far preferable to knowing that this was some twisted little trick of yours to prove your inherent superiority to mere heralds mags was very very glad that he was sitting politely in the entryway and right where he was supposed to be because he really did not want anyone to think he had placed himself deliberately where he could overhear this mind nikolas would probably be interested to know exactly what had been said then again the entire collegium was probably hearing this lita was making no effort at all to keep her voice down now that he thought about it she might well be projecting it on purpose you are damned lucky that the king specifically requested your presence tonight or by all that is unholy i would send in a trained dog to take your place and tell kiril that i had found a better performer and you are damned lucky that nikolas is not the sort to react in kind to such a piece of petty behavior or this little incident would be all over the palace by tonight and what do you think that would that do to your fine reputation hmm how many of your noble patrons would welcome you if they thought theyd be treated to a display of such insolence in their own homes if the bard replied to this as before it was inaudible and mags was saved further discomfort by the proctor of lenas floor arriving to come take the basket from him it was a girl he knew vaguely a hearty blond who seemed concerned enough lenas upset but ill see that she eats the girl told him in a not unkindly tone thankee he replied and quickly made his escape before he could overhear anything else it had been uncomfortable enough to overhear a grown man being dressed down like a misbehaving youngling and he just didnt want to hear any more at this point it could have been a trick of acoustics something that made what was said in litas office clearly audible in that entryway and nowhere else it could have been but he doubted it lita was a master bard and he would be very much surprised if she wasnt aware of the acoustic properties of every inch of bardic collegium no she wanted people to hear what she was saying and he was justaccidentallythe only nonbard to do so of course she wants them to overhear said dallen as he made his escape down a path swiftly darkening in the twilight marchands behavior really was appallingly rude with even the best possible interpretation with the worst interpretationwell you heard nikolas bards are supposed to be examples of deportment and they are supposed to be extremely good at protocol lita wants everyone in bardic collegium to know that not even being extraordinarily gifted nor extremely famous and popular is going to save you if you act badly because your bad behavior will reflect on the bardic circle as a whole by the way i was passing all that on to rolan directly i thought that would be more discreet ah another relief mags hadnt been looking forward to a questionandanswer session that was likely to be as embarrassing for nikolas as it would be for him he shook his head as he ducked into the closest door a chill breeze chasing him inside well then is he stupid or what i mean he had to know this was gonna get round and he was gonna get told on well its not stupidity dallen replied ruefully as mags paused long enough to take off his cloak and drape it over his arm if i were going to guessand it has to be a guess because i dont know his thoughtshes been out of haven for quite a long time and hes been very much made the pet of by several houses of the highborn they are flattered that he comes to their homes they fawn over him and quite frankly he has gotten used to being treated as if he was practically royalty so much so that now he thinks he is the equivalent of the kings own you know i think i have even heard of him being called the king of bards so perhaps in his own mind he is a sort of king ye kin paint a crow white but that aint gonna make it a dove mags replied shrewdly nodding at one of the other trainees as they passed each other in the hall i must remember that one well there is a bit more to it than that besides his gifts and talents it is true that he has projective empathy and he has used it in several crisis situations making him something of a hero at the time huh mags said still indeed still he did stop riots three times and he did manage to save an innocent man from a mob and he did hold an entire troupe of brigands spellbound until help could come twice but the thing about projective empathy is that it is a very good tool to ensure that the wielder is safe dallens mindvoice was more than a bit sarcastic if things start to go badly you can just narrow your focus down to convincing your opponents that you are their new best friend so it aint like throwin yerself inta harms way then mags could feel dallens snort the average guardsman sees more danger in a single incident than marchand did in all six of his encounters together oh i am not going to say he wasnt brave but it is easier to be brave when you know you have a gigantic shield to hide behind if you have to mags plodded down the hallway and pushed open the door at the end that led into the palace proper so people think hes a big damn hero an hes an amazin bard with a lotta gifts an he reckons now hes back at the palace twere time evbody realizes hes the second comin of stefan an acts like tis a privilege t breathe th same air as him in a nutshell and again i must be fair part of this is a desire to see bardic collegium regarded with the same respect and value as heralds and healers dallen said reluctantly youve heard lita on that subject it was mags turn to snort but most on it is there aint nough space for him an his ego t be in th same room at th same time there was an astonished pause then a flood of mental laughter oh my oh my im relaying that to the others mags every once in a while you do have a way with words tell that tme language teacher he replied ruefully then he was at the door of herald nikolas small suite and there was no time for chat chapter mags was a little nonplussed although he had known he was going to escape a sort of interrogation about what he had heard he had fully expected nikolas to say something about the bard if only to assure his protege that marchand was not going to come looking for mags in reprisal and he had been morally certain that nikolas was going to ask for mags own thoughts on the matter and correct them if mags had come to the wrong conclusion but aside from asking how lena was nikolas appeared to have dismissed bard marchand from his mind entirely it was odd it seemed as if the bard was obsessed with proving he was every bit the kings owns equal but the herald was utterly indifferent to the supposed rivalry back at the mine rivalries like this generally ended badly when they werent dealt with firmly by a superior authority take the pieters siblings just as an example the boys all seemed to have been born quarreling with each other and jockeying for position they were always at each others throats trying to gain ascendancy in their fathers eyes and it was only the knowledge that their father would have the hide of anyone who interfered in what made the mine profitable that kept them confined to informing on each other or trying to make sure that the blame for anything that went wrong fell squarely on shoulders other than their own well things were different here and he was always reminding himself of that maybeprobablythe bard would confine himself to petty annoyances that nikolas could just shrug off i will say this much that man does not deserve to have a child nikolas said darkly it is heinous enough that he clearly spends so little time with his family that he cannot even recognize his own daughter on sightbut the fact that she is one of the more promising trainees and he isnt even aware of it is just nikolas shook his head i have no words mags nodded nikolas actually had a daughter of his own a bit older than lena amily was one of mags few friends and mags knew how much the two cherished each other i dunno he replied i aint exactly real good at knowin what families supposed to be like nikolas coughed apologetically well the reason i asked you here tonight is because i would like you to take some of your training outside the collegia and do a bit of outright spying for me you remember what i said about people ignoring a young lad like yourself mags nodded yessir this was sounding very interesting indeed he hadnt had any sort of overt assignment from nikolas since the disappearance of the foreign envoys granted he and bear had spent some time recovering from nearly being killed but they really hadnt needed more than a fortnight for that the lessons had resumed in nikolas quarters after that respite but they hadnt taken place quite as often and truth to tell mags had been a little disappointed these had been lessons in how to be unobtrusive and in how to observe interestingly enough the lessons in how to be unobtrusive were not always about being quiet nikolas had shown him how to gauge the mood of people around him what the kings own had called reading the room hed learned to tell when being somewhat boisterous would be more useful than being quiet and how to counterfeit looking careless and utterly oblivious to what was going on around him or rather he had just begun those sorts of lessons he knew very well that he was a long long way from mastering them on the other hand these were things he could practice on his own and really should he couldnt expect the kings own herald who was after all the very literal righthand man of the king himself to spend hours tutoring him through simple practice that would be as rude asas what bard marchand had done but there were a lot of times when he wondered if nikolas had decided he wasnt worth wasting any more effort on ive been watching you and youre coming along well well enough i think that for something simple like this you can handle it on your own nikolas smiled a little as mags sat straight up eagerly im counting on your youth your appearance and the fact that our quarry is the sort of man who regards servants as furniture mags grinned a little theres a mort o them sir true enough well here is the situation councilor chamjey is up to something and i should like to find out what it is he has gotten a virtual flood of messages lately far more than is normal for him at this time of year he has missed several council meetings and been late or left early for others nikolas coughed chamjey is not exactly subtle or he wouldnt have made such a series of fundamental mistakes mags tilted his head to one side that dont seem all that suspiciouslike tme beggin yer pardon sir i mean could be anythin from plannin a party t surprise is lady t jest making a really good deal he don want anyone t know bout i mean hes a merchanter right nikolas nodded thats correct and all of that would be in keeping with a merchant working some sort of shrewd bargain the problem is twofold the first is that chamjey is probably the one person least suited to being a councilor on the council most of the others will at least make an attempt at altruism and at thinking for the greater good of valdemar chamjey has never let the greater good get in the way of his own personal interests in all of the time i have known him the second part of the problem is that chamjey has a habit of boasting about deals he has in the making to some of his colleagues usually in the form of oblique hints there has been nothing this time although soren says he has been incredibly smug of late so both soren and i are concerned we want to know what hes up to it might be nothing but if there is anything going on that is counter to the interest of the kingdom as a whole not only do we want to know what it is we can use that to dismiss chamjey or demand his resignation and have someone more honest put in his place mags nodded am i gonna need t get leave t skip some classes he both hoped for and dreaded the idea hoped for because he would certainly not be at all averse to missing a complex maths class or two and definitely not averse to missing a language class dreaded because if he did miss the classes he would only have to make them up ugh perhaps i dont know yet but ill take care of the arrangements for you in the meantime nikolas handed him a slip of paper this is his address if you care to scout it out perhaps it will give you some ideas for following him without being observed mags took it and smiled the address was not far from councilor sorens home and the councilorand more especially the councilors niece lydia and her friendswere acquaintances of his no one would think twice about seeing him ride past and he was overdue for a visit now he just had to somehow squeeze time in for that visit from somewhere and make sure lena was all right and help find some way to make her feel better if she wasnt and then there was that kirball thing that caelen wanted him to look into he sighed things were just never simple yessir ill hev a look soons i kin chamjey lydia said with curiosity why dont you ask uncle about him instead of me cause yer uncled tell me what he was i wanna know what he does mags grinned at her it was pure luck finding her alone like this and hed snatched it up yer servants all talk to ye so i wanta know what they tol ye they prolly wouldn tell me cause i aint family he was paying for his information by serving as a yarnholder while lydia wound skeins of extremely fine soft yarn into tight little balls for the lace shawl she was planning on knitting lydia and soren had an unusual relationship with their servantsunusual by the standards of the wealthy that is they knew all of them by name about their lives and treated them as people rather than furniture if there was anything more to chamjeys mysterious comings and goings than nikolas already knew the servants would certainly have told lydia what he does well hmm she said thoughtfully ana was telling me the other day that some of the servants think he is having an affair or keeping a mistress but she doesnt think so huh that would be a bit of a laugh on nikolas if a clandestine affair was the cause of chamjeys behavior why not lydia smirked they were sitting in her solar with lovely sunlight pouring through real glass windows down onto both of them and with a crackling fire on her hearth it was almost as warm as summer lydia had pulled back her tumble of red curls with a green ribbon and was wearing a deceptively plain green wool dress to match but mags knew thanks to lydias own expert ongoing tutelage in such matters that appearances were indeed deceptive the wool was the finest of chirra underfur the gown was expertly tailored of a design that would not fall much out of fashion ever and green was a very very hard color to dye only red was harder lydias plain gown probably cost more than some of the velvet and satin outfits that the highborn paraded around in at court this was the sort of thing that was passed down through generations as an heirloom for it was easy enough to put it in fashion with a new collar belt trim undergown or overgown lydia had even explained to him why it was that red green and white had been chosen respectively for the bards healers and heralds all three colors were expensive and difficult to dyeor in the case of heralds whites to bleach and keep pristine white all three were as a consequence immediately recognizable at a distance and all three would be very very hard to counterfeit properly in no small part because they were expensive people who were trying to pull scams generally spent as little as possible to do so it wouldnt be impossible for someone to try but it would be unlikely even lydias gown was not the brilliant green of healers robes but a much more muted darker color she set the ball of wooldyed to match in the same batch as her dress she had told himdown in the basket at her side put another skein on his outstretched hands and began winding again well the first thing is according to my maid chamjey isnt going out at an hour when his wife wouldnt miss him when he goes hes dressed very quietly not his usual style she made a face which told mags that the usual style was probably flamboyant and ostentatious a man going to see a new mistress would dress up to impress her he doesnt bring any presents either which a man with a new mistress does but the big thing is that chamjeys wife is sporting some very expensive new presents herself and she is looking uncommonly satisfied about them now that might mean that chamjey has a new mistress and his wife is getting expensive gifts in an attempt to mollify her but that only works if the wife is perfectly happy with her husband going off with another woman thats not true of mira chamjey she is very jealous and if she knew about a mistress she would scalp him and skin the woman so he is bribing her but its not to let him have his fun mags nodded now very glad that he had come to lydia before he had scouted the ground himself so he prompted i think its a business deal and i think its one thats underhanded and i think hes trying to work it through a third party lydia nodded decisively the ball of wool growing in her fingers as if by magic the fact that he is trying to do it through a third party makes me fairly certain he thinks he would be in trouble if he got caught at it see now thas where yer losin me mags admitted i dun see how a sharp deal could get a man in trouble wi crown it depends on what kind of a sharp deal it is lydia replied supposejust supposesomeone had had an absolutely accurate idea of when that blizzard that caused us so much trouble this winter was going to strike how long it would last and how badly food and wood supplies would be hurt until everyone dug out first of all it would be his duty to report that so that all of haven could have gotten prepared but lets just suppose that he didnt lets suppose that instead he got several warehouses and filled them up with staple foods and firewood and didnt sell them until just before the blizzard was going to hit and then he opened them up and began selling things at twice their normal value and once the blizzard hit then sold them at three times their normal value that would be a sharp deal but it would also get him in a lot of trouble mags nodded that made sense there are other things too thats just one example so have you got any ideas she asked think mebbe reckon id better be right careful bout how i follow im itll be hard t do it the usual way this street aint crowded so id stand out no matter what i looked like he scratched his head round here ev servant has house uniform an ye caint jest wander about less ye got the right uniform or ye look like ye belong here lydia tilted her head to the side if thats all thats stopping you then she paused no that wouldnt work would it if chamjey is doing something underhanded seeing someone in uncles livery following him mags chuckled whichs why i aint asked ye he replied ill leave it to the expert then she said with a grin he made a face at her aint no expert more like prentice prentice bein set his first task t do on his own he laughed selfdeprecatingly so i reckon this aint anythin likereally important more like t see ifn i kin find out anythin on mown lydia blinked solemnly at him i think youre probably underestimating yourself but she shrugged well maybe not maybe youre right so how is poor lena he refrained from rolling his eyes i dun know why shes so upset werent like she ever saw her pa or he saw her lydia wound up the last of the wool deftly id say ask amily she has a father thats just as famous so maybe she can explain it with his hands now freed he could scratch his head reckon i will he said and thankee lydia she grinned at him you made a very good winding spool and a much more entertaining one than my usual good luck with this job and i hope you impress herald nikolas he laughed and took himself off to the stables where dallen was waiting so what dye think he asked as he saddled his companion im thinkin that followin this feller aint gonna be too easy leastwise not up here i tend to agree we need to do something other than the usual move the blanket a little higher on my withers please mags got the distinct impression that dallen was waiting for him to come up with something something creative something that wasnt usual he sensed sorens head groom approaching from behind and reached back without thinking about it for dallens bitless bridle thenkee roben he said and that was when it struck him he always knew where someone was if he knew that person was that some aspect of his mindspeaking gift yes it is dallen said promptly you dont have to know what someone is saying to recognize his voice he could be in another room and all you need to hear is the cadence to know its him its the same with mindspeech you dont have to know what they are thinking to know its them so if he knew someone he would know what they sounded like so he swung himself up into dallens saddle so itd be all right if i followed chamjey by that so long as i didnt actually listen in on what hes athinkin dallen tossed his head in the way that told mags he was pleased exactly so so so i reckon id better find a reason t lurk around im and get t know im they headed up the road to the palace and collegia how convenient that youll get your chance today dallen told him with a hint of amusement there is a council meeting going on right now and it is going to go long according to rolan chamjey is showing no signs of wanting to slip away and i expect if you were to put on a pages uniform and go serve wine for a candlemark or so no one would object mags groaned as if he didnt already have enough to do oh well best get it over with evidently there had been a great deal of silent communication among nikolas rolan and dallen because when he arrived back at the collegium there was a page waiting with an impudent grin and a spare set of pages livery in approximately his size he then spent the most boring pair of candlemarks in his life standing with the other two pages while the circle of old men droned on and on aboutwell it involved a lot of maths trade things it seemed fortunately he was not there to understand what was going on he was there to get himself familiar with the feel of chamjeys mind chamjey himself would have been utterly ordinary if it hadnt been for the flamboyance of his dress and that was the oddest thing because judging by that feel chamjey was using that very flamboyance as a kind of mask no a distraction he was using it to make the other councilors underestimate him not that he was brilliant by any means but he was shrewd he knew exactly what he was doing the outside was a plainish man average in height weight and facial features with thinning hair and a bit of a belly who appeared to be desperately trying to make himself look more important attractive and wealthy with his rather too elaborate clothing the inside was a shrewd calculator who never did anything without studying it from as many angles as possible if chamjey had been an animal he would have been a crow not highly intelligent but clever very clever and very much on the lookout for himself and no one else when the set of pages that mags was with was relieved of duty by another trio he wandered off to his room to try and make up for missing two candlemarks worth of study time wondering if he had somehow stumbled onto something not even the kings own was aware of strange whats strange dallen asked mags leaned idly against the side of a building and waited while his quarry all unaware approached him this was a relatively busy corner where young men with nothing better to door who hoped to pick up an odd easy job or twoloitered in the shadow of an inn he was wearing the same set of mismatched castoffs from various guardsmen that he had arrived at the collegium wearingalthough now that he had a bit more weight and height they fit him a great deal better clothes funny how they make ye feel yon fancy stuff i have tha i wore t midwinter feel like theres allus someone watchin me an i gotta be extra careful and quiet like sos i dont make mistakes like if i open mmouth ill get found out an kicked out even when it was just master soren what invited me in the first place i can see that dallen replied reglar trainee uniform i feel like i gotta just try hard all the time not waste a drip of a candlemark better measure up no slackin no slouchin like like i gotta live up t the grays belike this he chuckled to himself this yknow i dun feel like theres all that pressure an amusing observation is that why your posture is so poor dallen wassomewhere somewhere that chamjey wouldnt see him from the street at any rate and somewhere that a companion alone would not excite much interest nowhere near mags probably waiting in an innyard somewhere nearby one where heralds or trainees might leave a companion while they went on an errand companions were not exactly unobtrusive after allhorsesized horseshaped brilliantly white with silver hooves and blue eyesyou couldnt mistake them for anything else and their white coats literally would not take dyes so having a companion visible on this street when he was already nervous would immediately put chamjey on alert but one more lounging youth leaning against a wall and watching several other wastrels at a game of dice wouldnt alert him to anything except perhaps an irritated observation about wastrel youth and wasting time nay just blendin in mags had picked this spot very deliberately it was the first place where chamjey would be able to choose a direction once he came down off the street that led to his manor so mags was going to wait here see what direction it was that chanjey chose then ride forward on dallen getting ahead of him to the next spot where the same choice was likely to happen chamjey would never see anyone following him because no one would be following him it was all about staying within range of that faint feel of the man as long as he did that he would know exactly where chamjey went and in this case as he leaned over the game intently chamjey reached the intersection and went west without even a glance at mags and the gamers after he was gone mags sauntered off looking as if he was going nowhere in particular but he met dallen in the alley behind the building making sure no one had seen either of them he hopped up into the saddle and off they went it was a very good thing that companions were a common sight here in haven and an even better thing that he had brought the cloak that went with his grays to conceal the very nonuniform clothing he was wearing no one gave him more than a cursory glance the most that happened was that traffic parted a little to let them pass with perhaps a smile or a wave it became apparent that chamjey was headed in the direction of the trade roadand probably was going to one of several extremely large and busy inns on the outskirts of the city all situated on either side of the trade road and all devoted to merchanttravelers these inns catered to everyone from the simple peddler with a donkey to merchants specializing in gems and other small and extremely valuable items if you were going to have a clandestine meeting with someone you had a choice after allyou could slip away in the dead of night try and find a secluded spot and hope no one had followed you or you could hide in the sort of place you had every right to frequent and do it at the busiest time of day chamjey had picked the latter which was very shrewd of him now that we know where hes going dallen said suggestively mags knew exactly what dallen was going to suggest aye mights well cut straight there then you disappear whilst i lurk and figger out how i kin get close nough to listen dallen moved into a canter at this point the best thing that they could do would be to get far ahead of chamjey and minimize his chances of spotting them when they arrived at the spot it was the busiest time of the day it wasnt going to be hard to hide amid all the noise and bustle of the innyards the inns swarmed with people travelers arriving travelers leaving local merchants turning up for a meeting or merely a meal and as for the animals there were horses donkeys even a chirra or twosmall carts and enormous show wagons where the side could be let down to form a stagethere were so many draft animals and vehicles that moving them in and out was a science the practitioners of that science were grooms and servants and in at least two of the innyards a blacksmith mags had no idea how anyone kept anything straight but amid the chaos no one was going to notice one slightly undersized slightly shabby young man especially one that walked as if he had somewhere to go and a purpose you didnt want to loiter in a place like this that made you look suspicious and you might be thought a potential thief mags even had taken the precaution of bringing a messenger bag with him a flat satchel that went over one shoulder and was used by paid runners in the city to convey documents and small objects that all by itself would insure his invisibility with dallen safely tucked away in one of the outoftheway stalls reserved for companionsfor yes heralds came here toomags walked the innyards looking like a young man with an errand bag prominently on his hip the air was thick with the scent of horse and hay sweat dust and the occasional whiff of something good from the kitchens there were boys with shovels and buckets scampering about just to get droppings from the animals before they got stepped onthe last thing you wanted was for your inn patrons to come into your common room with manure from something theyd trodden on in your yard and the noiseyou had to shout to be heard over it hooves clattering wheels rolling music and laughter from the inns themselves and people in the yard talking or yelling at one another he sensed chamjey coming closer and closer and finally positioned himself at the crucial moment right where he could get a good view of the road as a result mags caught sight of the man himself going into one of the inns that catered to the prosperous but not wealthy but that might be a ruse chamjey had proven himself quite clever at such things already so mags moved around through the crowd at that inn making sure that chamjey was indeed in there to stay then he retired to the back of the stable and the relatively quiet alley to think how to get close to the man server dallen suggested too risky he mightnt order nothin an hell spook if somethin he didnt expect turns up well you dont need to get in the same room hes in you only need to get near enough to overhear servers still too risky someun might catch me lurkin an i aint had a chance t talk t the keeper an get permission reckon id be taken fer a thief and you need to be doing something that will keep you in one place for a good long while as you listen dallen pondered this i wonder can you just nip in and look at the fireplace in the common room mags was baffled by the request but dallen obviously had a reason for it so he did as he was asked the common room was full but not so crowded he couldnt get next to the fire he glanced into it it looked like a fireplace but dallen looking through his eyes obviously saw something else something he had been hoping for aha the ashes havent been collected good come on out were going to pay a quick visit to a soapmaker now mags was even more baffled but from the feel of chamjey the person he was waiting for had not yet arrived so there was no reason to balk at dallens orders why a soapmaker he asked getting himself up into the saddle again because soapmakers need ashes and inns produce a lot of ash they dont need most households save their ashesthey make their own soap they use the ash on their back gardens or they use it to polish metal like silver and brass with inns dont so soapmakers go around to collect it here we are dallen stopped at the front of a little shop that had a workshop in the back go in and ask which soapmaker has the concession for the ashes at the splendid table be friendly and casual mags walked into the shop which was a little like walking into a wall of scent there was a counter just inside the door behind the counter were shelves full of soap cut neatly into wrapped bars or stacked in great multicolored chunks the pretty young blond girl about his age behind the counter dressed in a light blue gown with an embroidered apron stared wideeyed at him she knew what a companion was of course every child old enough to walk in haven knew what a companion was but it wasnt often that you saw someone not in whites or grays riding one evenin missus mags said wunner if ye kin tell me who has concession fer the ashes from splendid table oh the girl got two very pink spots in her cheeks and her voice went up in a squeak that would be usis something wrong without waiting for an answer she darted through a curtain into the back of the shop and returned with a woman that was an older version of herself in tow im mella amise herald the woman said wiping her hand carefully on her apron before offering it to him you wanted to know about the ash concession trainee missus said mags clasping her hand briefly but firmly and aye ask her if shes due to collect are ye due to collect he repeated overdue by a day or two the woman said with a sigh ive been right busy sending our boy out with deliveries ask her if you can but before mags could repeat what dallen had told him to say the woman cocked her head at him with a shrewd look in her eye reckon you want an excuse to be in there she offered he hesitated she looked out the door straight at dallen this isnt some prank is it she asked dallen directly dallen shook his head vigorously and gave her a long and penetrating look something hes doinghe needs to be in the inn she stopped something a herald knows about this dallen nodded just as hard she seemed satisfied i wont ask herald business and im more than willing to help she eyed mags a moment aye those clothes will do i expect thats why youre in them and not proper grays tellie go get the ashcollector kit the girl went behind the curtain again and returned with a dusty heavy canvas apron a covered bucket a dustpan and a small handbroom the woman helped mags don the apron now its easy enough tellie will have the barrow out front for you just sweep the ashes into the pan dump them into the bucket when its full take it downstairs to where youve left the barrow and dump the bucket in the barrow no one will look twice at you when youve got what you came for just come straight back the boy can do the rest of the job tomorrow mags nodded feeling a little astonished that this was going so smoothly shes a lawabiding citizen of haven you silly boy my presence and my confirmation tells her you have the authority to ask what you want from her for help dallens mindvoice was amused my presence and the fact that i told her a herald knows about this also assures her that what you want wont be anything wrong because i would kick you into the next city if you did abuse your authority all right then off you go you look like youre no stranger to hard work so you should be able to pass as one of my boys she made little shooing motions with her hands your companion can stay here if you like thatd be good missus thankee mags managed to say dallen whickered he carried the implements outside and there as promised a handbarrow was waiting but not one like he had ever seen before this one just like the bucket had a cover in fact it looked less like a barrow and more like a crude chest with barrow handles and a wheel in front he put his burden down inside picked up the handles and returned to the inn he was intercepted by one of the grooms who sent him around to a side door where he could leave the barrow he made certain of chamjeys location and headed inside he hoped that the meeting hadnt gone on too long he hoped he could find a place where he could hear it luck was still with him he found a vacant room that shared the same chimney with the one chamjey was in almost immediately it was one of a long line of what looked to be private parlors getting down on his hands and knees he removed the screen the firedogs the andirons and the rest and slowly began sweeping listening as hard as he could the chimney proved to be an excellent carrier of sound and mags spared a moment to be grateful to dallen for thinking of this and it gets better for us that last late blizzard did for about half the lambs it caught the shepherds right in the middle of lambing season someone was saying we havent even gotten into the rains and those always take a toll as well right now all the herders are thinking about is to wonder how theyre going to survive without lamb to sell for meat until shearing time comes and then what with that wetlung plague this past fall theyve all lost about ten percent of the adult flocks and the fleeces are going to be a bit dodgy this year since a sick sheep makes a weak fleece so theyve been jumping at the chance to sell their wool as a futurespeculation while its still on the sheeps back and to sell lambs still trotting about and bleating there was glee in the mans voice buying up the fleece and lambs before theyre harvested so to speak is brilliant chamjey the herders think we are risking our money paying for lambs that might die and fleece that is going to be poor they dont know how widespread the problem is and that weve rounded up the whole market and put it in our pocket well be the ones setting the prices no matter what and you made sure nothing can be traced back to us chamjey asked anxiously not a chance the man assured him ive used so many intermediaries sometimes it makes my head spin by the end of the fortnight well have completely wrapped up this years mutton lamb and wool market and well be able to demand whatever we want brilliant said chamjey with deep satisfaction ill see about imported wool i think i can get a high tariff put on it in the name of protecting our shepherds from cheap outside wool theres just not that much imported right now that i think anyone will even blink as he swept up every single mote of ash mags was justastonished somehow chamjeyor perhaps this unknown personhad discovered the misfortune that had befallen not just a few flocks but evidently the flocks acrosswhat most of valdemar and now he was somehow going to make a lot of profit off it i think weve heard enough dallen said ive already relayed all this to rolan lets return this stuff to the soapmaker and get back up the hill chamjey and the other person were deep in a conversation about wool which mags didnt think was going to interest nikolas right sooner i get out less chance i get caught he put the fire things back where they belongedbecause not doing so would look very suspicious and because he didnt want to make any extra work for the inn servantsand took his bucket of ashes outside once there he got his barrow and headed back the soapmaker greeted him with a nod as if she had expected he would not take long she took back her apron and thrust it at a rather grimy boy who took it cheerfully enough when the boy was gone taking the barrow back to the inn presumably she turned to mags i hope you got what you were looking for trainee she said and im glad we could help you som i missus he replied with a little bow of thanks ye saved me a mort otrouble well good then she grinned and you might think of sending here if you need soap he dusted himself off with the help of the girl who brushed him down with a broom with a bit too much enthusiasm and went to get dallen out of their yard dallen was looking altogether pleased with himself and mags felt he had every reason to be so whats nikolas say he asked as they made their way up the hill well the long and the short of it isyou know that example lydia gave you it was uncannily spoton while we were aware that the blizzards were causing some hardship and we knew there was a plague of something that was affecting the flocks in the south we didnt know just how bad both were somehow chamjey found out and rather than alerting the crown via the council he decided that he was going to secure all the available wool and meat for this year to himself so that he can command whatever price he wants dallen strangely was not angry he was not even annoyed perhaps because chamjey had been found out would that matter all that much mags wondered aloud for the meat and leather probably not one could use goat coweven wild animals for meat and leather but the wool is a lifeanddeath matter for the spinners dyers and weavers soren is going to be purple over this well we proved we kin do what nikolas asks us to eh he replied still not sure why this mattered all that much but believing that it was that important to nikolas and master soren more than that rolan and nikolas really didnt think chamjey was up to anything more than a minor peccadillooh it would be worthy of getting him to resign from the council in embarrassment but nothing more instead we caught him in a major scandal now dallen sounded pleased again this is good this is very good the only thing that would have been better would have been if you had recognized who it was that was meeting with him ohhellfires should we go back mags swung around in the saddle to look back down the road no need this is important enough that they are about to be intercepted well find out soon enough who it is chapter mags made it back to the collegium in time to make his last two classesor rather one class and one exercise sadly the class was the languages one happily the exercise was riding he didnt even have to think about riding anymore and even though the wind was strong and bitter enough to cut right through his clothing he and dallen just romped over the entire course staying warm enough through pure exertion riding just felt right in a heartdeep way he knew what dallen was going to do before the companion actually did it dallen knew what he wanted the moment he decided on a direction the two of them were physically melded so close together that they might just have been a single entity it was glorious even though they made a few mistakesmissing two jumps by knocking down the bars and having to go around a scramble losing timeit was still glorious if this had been all they had to do life would have been perfect of course it wasnt but at least for that slice of time it was as close to perfect as mags could get or had ever gotten he washed up at the collegium where there was all the hot water he could want and tubs for soaking in when he had the time the washing facilities at the stable were about the same as at the mine the only difference being that the water came from a pump rather than the stream or the sluice once clean and feeling more civilized he then went in to supper bear was there but not lena who was still not talking to her friends its only been three days dallen reminded him three days is a long time to sulk he said out loud and bear looked at him oddly lena he said finally mags flushed aye sorry talkin t dallen bear shoved a bit of meat pie into his mouth and chewed thoughtfully she wants to impress her da he said after swallowing i mean really impress him make him sit up and take notice been working at that all year hardly ever does anything but work on being a bard and then he shows up and doesnt even know who she is which when shes thinking hes at least seeing the reports on her and maybe seeing shes living up to him mags blinked finally understanding what lita meant trust bear to put it into simple language even a dunderhead like him could understand oh he replied so likely she thinks she hasnt done enough or hasnt done the right things or you know shes done all the right stuff but shes just not good enough to impress him bear gulped his tea a glum look on his face that aint fair mags said slowly it isnt fair and it isnt true but thats what she thinks bear put his mug down i guess i know something about not being able to impress your folks he added bitterly belatedly mags remembered that bear came from a family of healers of which he was the only member that did not have a healing gift he licked his lips awkwardly well shes here not at home and maybe the bards can sort her out bear concluded probably i mean after half bardic collegium listened to her pa getting the skin pulled off him maybe shell figure out that not everybody is as impressed with him as he is with himself mags decided that a little duplicity was in order bard marchand getting the skin pulled off him what bear cheered up a little and proceeded to describe in detail the dressingdown that lenas father had gotten it was a lot more accurate than mags had expectedbut then bards were supposed to be able to memorize things that happened on the spot so they could repeat them back accurately in song or story form later so maybe that wasnt altogether shocking that was cheering too it meant that really marchand had no one to blame but himself for the tale getting around mind you with someone like him hed probably look for any scapegoat rather than accept responsibility for his own stupid behavior well at least this meant that bard marchand would not be looking for a single heraldic trainee to blame for word of this getting out more like trainees in his very own collegium i hope that cheers er up mags said when bear was done bear just shrugged you never know what people are going to think when something like this happens to kin sometimes theres this serves you right im glad you got what was coming to you feeling sometimes theres this glad it was you and not me and sometimes theres this how dare they say that about my pa thing just no telling doesnt change that he didnt know her either no mags sighed wish she wasnt so easy t hurt thats bards i reckon at least at the beginning bear shoved away from the table but they need to get a thick skin before they get into scarlets or theyre gonna spend all their time maundering about feeling hurt by people what dont like their work or bards that are bettern they are or how their family dont understand em and not getting the job done mags couldnt have put it better himself he nodded well i hope she stops feelin so poorly i miss er me too bear said shortly see you later mags sat there wondering what had made bear so out of sorts maybe the same notquitespring crankiness that seemed to be affecting so many of the others he stared at the remains of his pie and wondered if he ought to try and get to lena and talk her around to a good humor in the end though the thought of the mound of study waiting for him back in his room decided him he couldnt make anything better for lena than he already had sending her somewhat misspelled notes affirming that he and dallen would like to take her out for a ride or a walk or just have a game of draughts or something not saying anything about needing her help with classes because that would seem as if he only valued her for that help what else was there to do bah but when he got back to his quarters there was a piece of folded paper waiting on the top of his books that he had not left there he hoped it was from lena but it was from herald nikolas please come to my quarters after dinner i need you to report what you overheard chamjey saying for the kings ears nikolas wanted him to report to the king to the king he was flooded with panic no no nohow kin ii caintth kingi nivver suddenly in the middle of the muddle he felt dallen in his head coming in and firmly just squashing all that panic down for a moment as if the companion had actually sat on it physically hes just another herald but hes the king mags said aloud his voice breaking at the end only in the throne room that is why nikolas asked you to come to his rooms there kiril will just be another herald but i dunno how to talk t him you just talk to him with respect but thats all now hurry up hes probably already there and you dont want to keep the king waiting that sent another spurt of panic over him but it was panic that got him moving hastily he made sure he was clean and hadnt accidentally dropped any food or sauce on himself at dinner snatched up his cloak and ran all the way back up to the collegium he arrived at nikolas door all out of breath and before he could tap on it nikolas himself opened it ah good mags you got my note nikolas put one hand in the center of his back and firmly propelled him into the room the herald had three rooms so far as mags was aware one was amilys bedroom although his daughter was apt to sleep overnight at the home of one friend or another including master sorens niece one was his own bedroom and one was a public sort of room with comfortable seating and a desk as well as a fireplace this was where mags occasionally met with him although usually the kings own came down to mags rooms at the stable today there was a stranger sitting in the chair nearest the hearth feet propped up to the fire sprawled actually rather than sitting and looking just a little untidy this is mags kiril said nikolas continuing to propel mags into the room since mags own legs seemed to have lost the ability to take steps forward on their own the man turned and mags blinked and did his best not to gawk he knew this man this was the herald he had encountered three days ago at the stable no wonder he had looked familiar that profile was on at least half of the coins that mags had handled since he arrived here the king grinned at mags you were right dallen did try to take my fingers did not um said mags intelligently nikolas got him seated across from the king by the simple expedient of positioning him in front of a chair and pushing down on his shoulders he plopped down gracelessly then leapt to his feet and started to kneel nikolas grabbed the back of his collar and hauled him back into the chair the king was laughing so hard he was bent over mags mags please he choked out around laughter no kneeling no bowing just the two of us having a conversation mags gulped and sat gingerly on the edge of the chair yessir yer majesty highness sir he gabbled calm down said the king making soothing motions with his hands now i want you to put your mind back to this afternoon when you first found where chamjey was going what did you do tried t figger out how t get where i could hear im yer greatness mags said dallen he said t get inside an lookit thfireplace twas fulla ash dallen he tookit us t the nearest soapmaker t find out who got th ash from thet inn happen it was that soapmaker dallen said ask if theyd collected she said no dallen said askit if i could she he stopped and thought for a moment she askit me an dallen if this was prankin we said no t wasnt she askit dallen if there was a herald knew what we was about an dallen he nodded aye sos she give me th apron an all an tol me how t collect an i went back t inn nikolas and the king exchanged a significant glance theyre starting to ask companions questions the king said thats no bad thing nikolas replied intelligent questions not just hey boy want an apple then what the king asked mags closed his eyes the better to remember and slowly recited everything that he had heard with dallen prompting him when he was done he opened his eyes to see the king nodding thoughtfully weve got a quandary nikolas said to the king and mags suddenly felt as if he was not even there the two of them were concentrating so hard on each other the king nodded two actually what chamjey is doing is not technically illegal just immoral but we dont regulate moralsor at least not that sort of morality it aint ethical your majestic mags put in timidly dont we got laws bout ethics two pairs of eyes suddenly made him the target of the same intense stare and mags felt utterly unnerved we do the king said finally and members of the council swear an oath when they accept a seat on it that they will behave with the interests of the kingdom as a whole superseding their own at the very least chamjey has violated that oath nikolas drummed his fingers on the wooden arm of his chair as the fire crackled in the fireplace chamjey is shrewd and we dont have any actual proof of all of this we have one trainee who listened in on a conversation but could not actually see the speakers ah but we can get corroborating evidence the king replied after a moment we can canvass the herders find out who invested in their wool and meatsheep and follow those leads up the line it will take time soons ye get t the fust guilty man hell get all nervouslike said mags thinking of how that sort of thing had gone back at the mine th other feller he said they went through lotsa people t do this but an ye get the fust feller t talk itll go up chain pretty quick i bet they both nodded and the king sighed i wanted to get this settled quickly but i suppose i shall have to resign myself to getting it settled thoroughly he stood up mags im getting some tutors arranged for you trainees there are a number of intelligent young people in haven that are being interviewed fine scholars but poor who would certainly benefit from this idea in fact the only reason we havent got some tutors yet is because we are making sure that they are good at teaching mags felt his eyes widening twas a good idear then he said very much so and i am looking forward to seeing you and dallen trying for a kirball team id like to see if dallen can run with the same eagerness that he eats pocket pies the kings face split with a grin hey mags smothered a laugh now ive taken up enough of your time the king hesitated mags supplied what he thought the king was looking for eh i wuz never here never talked t yer royalness bout nothin an i don know nothin bout sheepses and wool herald nikolas he jest wanted t ast me bout what bard marchand said xactly when he sent me on that there errand he shouldnt of the king nodded exactly so good night mags it was good to meet you formally so to speak mags got to his feet managing to control his knees which still felt a bit weak bowed and let himself out as he left he sensed that the king and the kings own had only begun an evening of intense conversation and decisionmaking he was very very glad that he was never going to be in nikolass shoes and between you and me i am just as glad not to be rolan now come on back and lets talk about this kirball business ive made some inquiries bear and lena seemed to have forgotten the project that had taken them all into the guard archives this past winterbut mags had not although his opportunities to go back and search had gotten a lot rarer he still presented himself at the door of the archives from time to time for a candlemark or two of research and the next day gave him one of those rare opportunities as he finished an exam unexpectedly early and was dismissed with a smile he headed for the guard archives at a trot feeling as if he was getting very close to what he was looking for the last time he had been through the reports there had been mention of an unusually large bandit group one that the guard felt probably had a substantial encampment it would not be difficult here the guard captain had written there are many caves and abandoned mines and it would be possible to hide as many as fifty or sixty fighting men and their hangerson in some of them the raids we are seeing are growing bolder and more pernicious and suggest that these miscreants have organized under a clever leader that sounded like what he was looking for and mags had already had enough disappointments that by now he was well over the dread of finding out who his parents had been he just wanted some answers any kind of answers besides if anything had shown him lately that just because your parents were something it didnt follow that you were the same it would have been encountering bard marchand there could not possibly be a person less arrogant and selfassured than poor lena and there could not be a person more arrogant and selfcentered than her father so if his parents had been banditswell so what maybe he would at least find out why they had become bandits lena had spun all sorts of fanciful tales for him his mother had fallen in love with one of them who was noble at heart and had followed him to the encampment his mother had been a captive who had lost her heart to one of the bandits his mother had been an unwilling captive his mother had been the bandit and his father a poor shepherd she had seduced he thought it was a lot simpler than that likely that his parents had beensomethingshepherds farmers even tradersand had a bad run of luck turned to robbing and fell in with the bigger group it was a common enough story and he was living proof that youd do almost anything when you were starving he nodded at the archivist at the front desk who knew him so well by now that the man just waved him inside and he went up the three stairs into the archives themselves it was a huge barn of a building not just a room with floortoceiling shelves packed very closely together there were ladders at intervals along the shelves for there was no other way to reach the upper shelves on the shelves were identical wooden boxes shelf upon shelf row upon row up and down the entire room there was nowhere to sit and study since the archives were rarely visited by more than one person instead there was a single table with several chairs around it at the door end of the room the place was heated the same way that bears indoor herbarium was heated from beneath the floor the room was a little stuffy very warm and very dry and the air was scented with the smell of old paper but not of dust now he knew this was because one of the duties of the archivists was to keep everything dust free the lighting was good too thanks to the narrow windows up near the roof all the way around windows with real glass in them he went to the shelf where the boxes of records he had last gotten into were stored and took down the one with his ribbon marker on it he was three reports further along when he began to feel a sense of excitement and anticipation this was definitely looking like the right year there was no doubt in the guard captains mindor in his reportsthat he had a substantial and wellorganized brigand group on his hands they knew what they were doing they werent raiding randomly they hit wealthy traders but ignored caravans of items that were bulky and hard to find a market for they overran entire farms and looted the places but only at intervals that suggested that these were resupply raids he asked for help his little guardpost didnt have the manpower to take down a group that big he got the help he requested in the form of an entire guard troop mounted and foot and then there it was in the middle of the reports a fatter packet lists lots of them the roster of the guard company that had come to augment his troops the list of the townsfolk that had volunteered loot captured casualties the list of the dead on both sides and the allimportant afteraction report mags hands shook a little as he opened the folder and read the first page from the beginning we made our real plans in secret the fourteenth did not make a camp they entered the town singly and in pairs and were quartered among the townsfolk their scouts scoured the hills for a full moon looking for the signs of the passage of men they were clever as i knew they werethe scouts found nothing which told me that the hiding place was probably deep in the caves finally i sent out the sacrificial caravan one with the rich prize of weapons and wine and one i knew that the brigands could not resist of course these were flawed the swords weakened to break at the quillons axes with handles drilled bows that would snap at the first draw arrows with heads that would shatter on armor i was not minded that we give them that which they could turn against us furthermore the wine was triple strength but sweetened with honey so that the taste would not betray the strength as i expected the brigands appeared and the scouts followed them back to their lair now we had them and after a few candlemarks had passed the fourteenth assembled all men at the ready and with the volunteer townsfolk making a rearguard of pikemen we marched on the caves the scouts found and silenced their outer guards but given how cunning they had been i did not expect to catch all of them surprised and drunk and as i anticipated an alarm was raised before we got to the entrance there was fierce fighting first at the fortified entrance and then as we made our way through the ratswarren of tunnels until all the brigands were dead or fled the chief made his last stand at what we took to be the central cavern there we found what was left of his loot the stores he was putting up against the winter what looked to be a surprisingly orderly camp there was a handful of campfollowers some of whom fought the guard with the same fierceness as the bandits some of whom cowered in fear and could scarcely be gotten sense of one of them however was a captive from an earlier caravan and she led us to a hidden chamber that held other captives being held for ransom there were but three of these living and two dead the woman gave us to know that when the fighting began one of the brigands was dispatched to the chamber to slay the captives but the captives rallied and fell upon him in the scuffle two were slain before the brigand himself fell beneath a rain of blows and kicks the two dead were a woman and a man in foreign garb the woman told us that no one could understand their speech and they communicated mostly by signs their clothing was rich presumably because of this the brigands hoped to puzzle out whence they came and demand a ransom with them was their child a small boy of perhaps two or three years of age there was nothing else of value that could be pointed to as theirs except their clothing lacking any other clue i placed the child with the townsfolk to be dealt with as an orphan without resources we buried the captives within the chamber that had been their prison i then apportioned the loot as follows mags stopped reading the pages falling from his hands so there it was his parents hadnt been bandits themselves theyd been captives there was nothing whatsoever wrong with his blood the dread he had been feeling fell away leaving behind a succession of emotions a flash of rage that the guard captain should have so callously disposed of a helpless child a strange grief for his parents who had come so close to being rescued frustration that he still knew so little he quickly looked through the rest of the report but there were no more details about his parents not even a crude sketch of their foreign clothing there was nothing to say what land they were from nothing that had been found in the loot nothing any of the captured brigands or the captives that had been imprisoned with them had said nothing at all he banged his fist down on the table and swore silently so littleso little their clothing was richbut what did that actually mean how rich was richand was it rich by their own standards or by the standards of a provincial guard captain if someone lived where sables were abundant and easy to trap a sable coat could be the possession of almost anyone but here in valdemar it would be an item only the wealthiest of highborn could afford so in a sense he was back at the beginning again he knew only now that he was foreign and not a bandit brat i dont see that it matters dallen observed you are still the same person you were before you learned all this logically it shouldnt matter to him but it did he wanted to know well he had come to a dead end at this point anyone who might have known anything about him was either dead or had long ago forgotten about the nameless child he wasnt about to try and find the cave and unearth what might have been left of the bodies just to see if there was a shred of a clue in their garments even assuming there was anything left but bones which was not likely he put the report back in the box and the box back on the shelf on his way out he turned over to the archivist all of the little ribbons that hed been given to mark where he was doing research hmm the man said one eyebrow raised find what you needed then nossir mags replied with resignation but i found all im goin to both eyebrows rose that has all the sound of a tragic ballad in the making im sorry your excavations into the archives were not as fruitful as you would have liked mags managed a wan smile well at least i know i aint some bandit brat trouble is thats bout all i know perhaps you can elaborate on that the archivist prompted looking interested mags shrugged mparents musta been caught by bandits they was dressed good guess they was bein held fer ransom but nobody understood em and they was dressed foreign and they was killed when the guard came after the bandits an thats what i know actually i can tell you a little more than that the archivist responded they cannot have been rethewellan hardornen nor karsite guard captains have a smattering of all three languages and the fashions of those places are either distinct or very like valdmaran i would also suspect they were not hawkbrothers nor shinain since the clans are not inclined to leave their own in captivity and they have ways of knowing where their kinfolk are vanyel more or less closed the passage to the north so that leaves you with beyond rethwellan as the likeliest mags blinked thatsfar and it begs the question of why your parents who must have been traveling alone came this far what could possibly have driven them to come to a country where they didnt even know the language and evidently had neither friends nor contacts because you may rest assured if foreigners who did have friends or contacts went missing in valdemar the heralds the guard and ultimately the crown would know about it and be looking for them mags felt that dread creeping back over him the only reason he could think of was that they were running from something so mebbe i still am some kinda bad blood he said slowly but the archivist only snorted actually i can think of a much better reason for running into a strange land if one was young and foolish as i presume both of them were what d that be sir he held his breath hoping for a sort of reprieve the old man shook his head one of the oldest stories there is of course they were in love and their parents disapproved and their parents were wealthy or powerful enough that only by fleeing far past the borders of their own land could they escape the long reach of parental authority mags blinked you think he ventured the old man shrugged i have known many young lovers and most were fools he replied with more than a touch of cynicism make of that what you will i am sorry that you did not find all that you were looking for trainee and i thank you for your courteous treatment of the archival records well that was a dismissal if ever he had heard one mags nodded and trudged out the door and back to the collegium buildings and his room at the stables both bear and lena were outat classes for the latter probably and off tending someone for the formerso he left them brief notes outlining what he had found look on the bright side said dallen now you wont have to spend time going through those boxes anymore i suppose he said aloud well now that you know maybe this will unearth some sort of memory for you maybe a word or two in your parents language or a memory of what they looked like that dont seem likely ida thought ida remembered somethin like that afore this maybe not memory is a funny thing you know smell tends to trigger it but if i caint remember what mparents smelled like i caint exactly trigger one can i he objected not what they smelled like the caves huh now that dallen mentioned it he did seem to get nightmares more back at the mine when the sleeping hole got mucked out and the smell was more of damp cold earth than it was of rotting straw and filthy children ill see if i kin member one of mold nightmares he said finally don think i wanta bring em on me again useta wake up screamin an i reckon none of the companionsd thank me fer screamin mlungs out in middle of the night hmm you are probably right so what are you going to do right now actuallyhe kind of wanted to take his mind off all of this and let it rest for a moment and he had a good idea what would do that right nowi think ima gonna find out about this kirball chapter herald setham dallen said instantly and with tremendous excitement in his mindvoice you want herald setham wait a moment mags waited patiently shivering a little in the cold wind was the wind never going to stop blowing there wasnt even a hint of spring on it yet dallen was probably speaking to sethams companion that always took time of course it would have been possible for dallen to allow him to hear dallens side of the conversation but that would have ended up being confusing it was also possible for him to listen to both sides but that would have meant taking down shields and getting permission companions were notoriously reluctant to let anyone but their own chosen listen to them archer says setham will meet you at the new kirball field dallen told him finally its where theyve been putting in all those new obstacles aye i know it mags confirmed he changed direction to head for the field which actually had been part of companions field before it had been partitioned off why aint they using the old course not big enough by now it was late afternoon the sun was making long shadows with the collegium buildings and his stomach growled he hoped that either the explanation wouldnt take long or that herald setham would be just as hungry as he was and willing to continue any discussion over food it wouldnt be long now until the dinner bell why aint the old course big enough because they will have to fit two dozen or more people on it at the same time theyve finalized the rules so were in luck whatever setham tells us is exactly how things are going to go now he saw the heraldand his companionwaiting for them beside the new rail fence that marked the boundary of this ball ground he had expected setham to be young it had seemed to him that anyone who was getting into something like this was going to have to be young he thought that his expectations were confirmed when from a distance the herald seemed to be shorter than even he was he was surprised to see as he got nearer that while setham was indeed a lot shorter than mags he was also well past middle age he wasnt a dwarf but he was certainly not much taller than twelve or fourteen hands the top of his head barely came up to dallens shoulders setham was wiry and he kept his brown hair hair cut quite short so that the gray at the temples was quite evident he had a thin face and intelligent brown eyes and a mouth that looked as if it smiled often mags smiled back at him tentatively ive been hoping youd be one of the people to join us in kirball mags said setham without any preamble sticking out his hand for mags to shake ive been hearing a lot about how well you and dallen work together i think youll be a cornerstone of my team your team sir mags said surprised i thought i heerd this was all trainees an mebbe guard so it is but teams need coaches and that would be me setham grinned i was a jockey before i was a herald i rode steeplechases and now that i am a herald i am one of the scouts and crosscountry specialists archer and i are pretty well known for our ability to scramble over under or through just about anything the other companion nodded and whinnied on closer inspection yet setham was very short indeed definitely no taller than twelve hands and his companion archer was so compact and cobby he was almost ponysized we call himarcher that isthe cat he never seems to put a foot wrong dallen confirmed i may be faster across the straight but even i cant move across bad terrain the way he can and if you can believe it setham has never been thrown or pulled from archers saddle so the first thing i want you to do is cast your eye over the playing field setham continued get a good impression of it we chose the roughest part of companions field for this obediently mags did as he had been directed and the first thing he noticed was that this was even more challenging than the obstacle course instead of the usual rail jumps this hadwellterrain was the only way he could think to describe it gullies a major ravine little hills with abrupt dropoffs stone fences as well as rail fences culverts bridges even a stream he hadnt known existed that led into the river there were no big hills but there were bits of very steep slope enough to make even the most surefooted companion pause no effort had been spared to create this thingthere were even lines where turf had been laid over what must have been raw earth after hills had been made and gullies created but unlike the obstacle course there was no pattern no obvious path you were supposed to take around this something that the obstacle course did not have was two identical little stone buildings with ramps up to the tops of them one on either end of the field what do you think of it asked setham not sure what t think sir mags confessed he scratched his head looks risky actually it didnt so much look risky as insane he could scarcely imagine trying to ride over this thing at speed i like it its a real challenge there is a lot of risk there i wont deny it setham replied only the best riders will be able to take this course full out you and dallen will take falls i am sure people are going to get hurt but we have a big influx of trainees right now historically that means that we are going to need those trainees when they become heralds and that means valdemar is going to be facing some trouble down the road better some bruises and breaks now than dead heralds later mags turned to see if he could read sethams expression this was the first time he had ever heard a herald being quite thatblunt setham looked deadly serious im not the first herald in my family setham said im fourth generation in fact my great grandfather was in the middle of the karsite conflicts and my grandfather knew vanyel now maybe the reason were getting all you trainees is because valdemar is about to get a lot bigger i wont deny thats possibleall sorts of little dukedoms and tiny kingdoms are looking at us and thinking they might want to throw in with us were all hoping this is why we have so many new chosen coming in so many new foals being born but we arent going to count on that were going to count on finding ourselves neck deep in war and needing lots of heralds and if the other happens well just be glad and feel lucky mags scratched his head no way t tell he ventured setham shook his head but then he relaxed however we also know whatever happens will be years away and no rule says we cant make this training fun as well as risky he continued sothats why we are doing it this way yessir mags said i kin see that but ye said ony the best so what bout the rest aint they gonna need the trainin too oh theyll get it setham replied they will certainly get it the difference is that we want the best for the first teams to get everyone excited and motivated then in the regular riding classes well teach the kirball technique and strategy instead of the old riding lessons and i hope that will stimulate some more excitement mags wrinkled his nose not sure what yer aimin fer with all this excitement stuff sir setham leaned against the fence so did his companion it struck mags that he had never seen a herald and companion who looked quite so alike before look you seem like a serious young fellow setham said slowly i tell you that the circle is looking at the current conditions and anticipating trouble in a few years and you understand that i can see it in the way you react to what i just told youyou squared up your shoulders you looked a little resigned but determined to meet the challenge am i right mags flushed a little with embarrassment but nodded but youve got to have seen how some of the trainees just dontseem to take things nearly as seriously as you do setham continued knowing your background your reaction is logical knowing theirs well so is theirs they arent what you would call grown up yet theyre still thinking about things the way someone who has never had to face hardship thinks about them even that lot that helped you rescue your friend bearwithin a fortnight or so the fear of the rescue had faded and it became just a fantastic adventure in their memories whereas you mags shivered he still had the occasional bad dream where he saw those mad eyes and knew that he could very easily be dead in a few moments exactly setham nodded you actually know in your heart that you could be killed or worse they still think in their hearts that they are immortal theyll learn better but they dont know that now so that d be why they dont take some of the trainin seriouslike this was somewhat unreal to mags he had seen death often enough that he could not remember a time when he hadnt known emphatically that if he wasnt smart and careful and clever all the time the next corpse could be him still he had seen for himself how some of the others were they talked they acted as if death simply didnt exist for them it was just one more way in which he simply did not fit in for a moment it made him feel his isolation all the more then again setham was not like that setham understood he fumbled his way in the direction setham was trying to go reasoning out loud so since they aint takin the trainin serious enough an maybe not puttin nough effort inta it ye reckon t give himwhats it called motivation somethin thatll make it worth it to em t fling thesselves inta it setham grinned exactly nothing gets interest going like a game where going over and over the obstacle course gets boring kirball is going to be exciting some people will do very well at it those people are going to find their reputations going up and they are going to become popular other people will want to have some of that popularity and so they will strive more for it its just human nature we like to have heroes mags blinked at him iyou aint thinkin i dont know for certain mags if youll become wildly popular because of this you tend to be solitary and that will work against popularity setham looked at him shrewdly but you already have something of a good reputation because of helping to rescue your friend i think you should prepare for the fact that others will want to associate with you if you become a star player of kirball mags shook his head that dont seem right i mean be a hero for a game fer doin summat important mebbe but not fer a game setham shrugged it is what it is people become popular for lots of reasons even when they arent very pleasant people to be around like certain master bards i wont name it wont only be the trainees that will be following kirball it will be virtually everyone here at court so be prepared for that and you and dallen should discuss how you want to deal with notoriety setham smiled crookedly as i told you i was a jockey and i was a good one now there is something that makes no sensebeing made much of because you happen to be able to stick on the back of a fast horse and bring the best out of him ridiculous nevertheless being taken by surprise by success can be as hazardous as being taken by surprise by failure now back to the game so youve seen the field now let me tell you the rules he pointed at the two stone towers those are the goals there will be three ways to score the first is to lob a kirball through the windows or the door of the opposing teams tower thats one point the second is to occupy the tower and hold it for a quarter candlemark thats ten points and its going to be difficult to do that and i very much doubt anyone is going to try it lobbing balls is going to be a lot faster and easier the third is to steal the opponents flag and get it back to your tower thats fifty points and pretty much gameending because you have to get the flag back to your home base mags nodded each team will be of twelve players on the playing field setham continued four herald trainees four players afoot and four mounted players who can come from anything the footplayers are supposed to guard the goal but they are going to be allowed to move around the field so who knows the mounted players can do whatever the team captain wants them to do as can the herald trainees if someone gets hurt or tired you can substitute a new player but only if the one retiring from the field can get to the edge of the field and tag in the new player setham grinned we cant make this easy on you after all nossir said mags though privately he wished that for once someone would it would be very nice to encounter something easy for a change what the mounted players and the heralds do is entirely up to the team captain setham continued you can lob balls you can go for the flag or attempt to drive the opposing team off and occupy their goal its all up to you youll have to coordinate among yourselves somehow which will be easier for the herald trainees and a lot harder for those without mindspeech lets just pick one strategy as an examplean obvious ploy might be to pick someone with fetching gift and try to snatch the flag without getting near the goal aye well somethin tells me anythin obvious aint gonna work too well mags said with a sigh his stomach growled lets go back to the collegium and we can discuss this over dinner setham offered just as he said that the bell rang calling them all to the meal that was rare good timing sir mags said with a chuckle aye that suits me i was hopin yed say as much setham did not go to the common dining room instead he led mags around to a hatch that mags had not even known existed he rapped on it and the hatch slid up it looked right into the kitchen two of whatever is going setham said casually then with a glance at mags added and extra pie the kitchen boy nodded and darted away mags watched him make up the same sort of food basket that hed gotten for lena and a moment later came back with it and handed it to setham i would just as soon not be surrounded by three dozen trainees all asking questions once they find out i am one of the kirball coaches setham said with a crooked grin there are going to be four of us to start and well each pick our own teams my preference is for outstanding riders the others will probably have preferences of their own he passed the basket over to mags who took it without a word now i am going to be running trials just to make sure of the general skill level of my players but i am fairly certain you are going to pass those handily mags he said as he led the way into the heralds wing i dont however think you are going to be team captain i am inclined to think it will either be an older trainee or one of the guards i wasn expectin such sir mags exclaimed shocked as setham opened the door to his quarters setham waved him inside what proved to be very spare rooms indeed and just two of them plain wooden floors bare walls a simple desk with a lamp two more chairs with leather seats and a bookcase the single window was covered with a shutter and considering how it rattled that was probably a good thing this room must face the direction of the wind through a half open door mags could just glimpse an equally plain bedroom in fact the place looked very much like his own room in the stable and he felt immediately at home while they ate setham described more of how the game was likely to proceed he already had two of his foot playerstwo young guard recruits who were secondgeneration guardsmen but not quite old enough to formally join the guard itself as was often the case with youngsters like this they were acting as aides to the captain of a guard troop that did not include their parents or older siblings he also had one of his mounted players the son of one of the council members he didnt say who it was but from what mags already knew he recognized the person as jeffers the son of the head of the printers guild while not a member of amilys immediate circle of friends mags knew the young man to have been among the visitors to sorens house over midwinter hed been quite affable there and after identifying him mags had encountered him now and again up here at the collegium where he was taking a few classes setham must know enough about him to trust him on the team so that was good i have my eye on a couple other trainees older than you to round out the heralds setham continued im thinking one of them will be the captain you dont have any objections to a girl captain do you mags shook his head wouldn dare he replied theyd prolly smack me inna nose setham laughed all right then the four coaches are holding the trials for their teams over the next four days i have tomorrow afternoon someone else has tomorrow morning turn up at the kirball field instead of your riding and weapons lessons youll have leave in advance if i cant firm up the team tomorrow ill hold an open trial but you wont need to turn up for that one unless you want to and youre free cant have you missing too many lessons after all yessir mags nodded nossir right then off to your classwork with you kirball will be no excuse for doing poorly in class and leave the dishes he added as mags made to gather them up someone will be along for them later mags decided on impulse to go see if bear was aboutand maybe lena too he wanted to tell them about kirball and see what they thought of it had they heard the rumors perhaps he left the heralds wing and headed toward healers and saw to his pleasure that there were lights burning in the glasswalled conservatory that bear called home now if bear was just there and not out on some errand or other as he got closer he saw that both his friends were there deep in a conversationand so was his friend he had met through master soren amily the daughter of kings own nikolas his spirits rose at that he told all of lydias friends about bear and lena of course so amily knew all about them he hadnt any idea that amily wanted to meet bear and lena but to see her with them made him irrationally happy hed wanted to introduce them some time ago but just hadnt gotten the chance to if shed decided on her own to come introduce herself that was marvelous he tapped lightly on the door to the outside and saw all three heads turn quickly to the sound he poked his head around to one of the windows and waved at them bear jumped up to let him in as always bears pair of groundglass lenses were perched on his nose and he looked more like his usual self than he had of late instead of looking strained and cross he looked like a sleepy affable bear with a round face untidy short brown hair small but friendly eyes a pug nose and a generous mouth that was finally smiling again he stood at the door peering down at mags with a little bit of a stoop hope i aint innerruptin anythin he said suddenly wondering if actually he was but to his relief bear shook his head come on in got your friend amily here the healer trainee said moving aside so mags could come in the door as usual thanks to the heating under the floor the conservatory was as warm as a summer day the air smelled of clean damp soil with a hint of green and the faint confused aroma of many many herbs just now rosemary was predominant mags amily said waving him over to a stool at the table i missed you the other day at lydias id been hearing rumors about how bard marchand got a right royal dressingdown and i asked her about it she told me all about your friend lena and how rude bard marchand had been id heard so much about lena and bear already that i thought it was just time for me to come around and introduce myself amily was normally one of the most peaceful people to be around that mags knew but today she seemed even more so she tended to wear soft browns which with her brown hair and quiet face made her seem almost invisible at times and yet she made her presence felt in the pool of serenity that was around her mags took a glance at lena and knew immediately that whatever had prompted amily to come and talk to his friends it had done lena a world of good bear too probably this visit wasnt just an impulsive gesture on amilys part either amily couldnt do anything impulsively one of her legs was badly lame and that made it difficult for her to move about he knew now that it had been ruined in the same accident that had taken her mothers life that she had been treated by the farmers that found her and that by the time decent healers had gotten to it it had already set all wrong she must have decided that lena needed to be brought out of her unhappy sulks and the best way to do it would be to make her feel that if she rejected the invitation to join amily and bear she would be doing something unpardonably rude mags wanted to hug her for her generosity he settled for beaming at her she seemed to understand his meaning and smiled back at him well its a good thing that she came down here bear said happily she and lena are getting on like anything an ive come up with some concoctions for that bad leg stuff to help her sleep better stuff to make it ache less he gave amily a mockstern glance you should have come see me before youve never been seen by a good healer that had something other than a gift you have a gift bear amily chided it just doesnt happen to involve a personal power anyone with half an eye to see knows that your understanding of herbs and surgery is a gift and a profound one bear flushed and looked pleased and bear thinks that we ought to try rebreaking and setting it amily added they said they wanted to do that once before but she shuddered i didnt even want to think about the pain but bear thinks he can keep me asleep while they break it give me something to make sure i can sleep at night while it is mending and he says there is a new healer here that can do something about the pain when i am awake if i can get healing sessions so that the bones mend faster it should all be done in a moon or less im feeling quite optimistic now it isnt going to be perfect bear warned theres only so much we can do while its mending youll need help to do anything once its mended itll still be some crooked youll still limp maybe need a cane its going to be shorter than your good leg but at least ill be able to move easier amily countered and completely on my own she didnt have to say anything more mags knew very well how much being able to get about without help would mean to her lena patted amilys hand in a consoling manner mags could tell that the two girls had made instant friends this was excellent lena didnt make friends easily when she was performing she was wrapped up in the music and never noticed her audience but when she was just being herself she was astonishingly shy he beamed at both of them he couldnt have asked for anything better amily would have a friend up here and wouldnt have to try and get to lydias for company and lena would have a friend that was a girl and could presumably understand hersomeone who was not in bardic collegium and not a potential rival they even looked a little alike since both of them were small thin and dark haired lena was darker and smaller than amily but they could easily have been siblings neither actually had sisters mags wondered if they would start to feel as if they had found a sister in each other that would be good too at least as he understood these things families were supposed to make you happy although lenas father didnt seem very good at making her happy when dye think this businessll happen with yer leg he asked to avoid such uncomfortable thoughts amily shook her head we have only started talking about it bear needs to discuss it with the senior healers after all hes only a trainee still and i need to talk to father ifn ye caint get er done this summer put it off till next mags advised people aint as sick in summer so th healersll hev more time for ye things allus heal better in summer an anyway ye don wanta be kempt up in bed over winter what if there was another blizzard what if we had one o them mortal cold streaks an there aint as much good healin food in winter as in summer trust you to think of food mags lena teased but bear nodded no hes right you will need every advantage for this and winter would be a bad time to take such an enormous risk even with healers working on you and speeding the bonemending mags is right that there are fewer people who are ill in summer as well and fewer accidents youll be weaker more likely to get some disease or other and we shouldnt expose you to more than we have to bear sucked on his lower lip best thing for it then is to start discussions right away a moment of silence ensued which amily broke by saying well to change the subject entirely i am going to kidnap lena off to lydias the next afternoon that she is free it would be marvelous to have a friend that can sing and play for us once in a while and i want her to meet some of the others she smiled i promise we wont ask much of you none of us are likely to treat you as our private entertainer unless you want to be aye to that mags said and added an take bear too an ye kin pry im away from here pah i havent the time to spare bear objected but he looked pleased that mags suggested it and amily nodded well maybe a little but not often maybe im only a trainee but people here need me poor mags it used to be you that was coming down to sorens house youre going to feel quite neglected amily teased he grinned for this was the perfect opening nay ill be busy practicin tis you thatll be missin me mebbe seems dallen an me got somethin new t do yon herald setham wants me fer his kirball team bear gaped at him amily clapped her hands with delight and lena bounced up and down in her chair youre going to be on a kirball team lena exclaimed really why thats all anybody can talk about its true amily agreed there is speculation all over the court about it everyone wants to be able to watch although i must say there are not too many people wanting to be players except for heralds though if it is going to be as dangerous as ive heard that is just as well pleased mags told them all about it from herald caelan suggesting he should look into playing to the interview in sethams room i dunno bear said looking worried it seems pretty dangerous to me real easy to get hurt i looked over that field and i wouldnt want to ride over it much less play a game on it well its kinda supposed to be dangerous mags pointed out and repeated what setham had said about the huge influx of trainees there kinda aint a point to it if it aint dangerous its spposed t wake the grays up a bit make em figger out they aint immortal still dammit i dont want to be dealing with your broken head or broken neck mags bear said looking a little desperate if this is supposed to just be training it shouldnt be so dangerous that people come out of it seriously hurt bruises and maybe a break or two is one thing but not a broken neck i don think dallend let me break mneck mags pointed out id be more worrit about them as is on foot or reglar horses point said amily and smiled i think its wonderful that the two of you were asked in the first place are there going to be trials i had heard there were aye an im t be in em fer forms sake he told them and added shyly an id take it kindly if any of ye could get away t watch unless its too mortal bad weather he added and sighed knowin my luck twill be pourin cold rain the morning of mags trial day threatened rain but it never actually happened by noon the sullen clouds were reluctantly moving off without actually producing so much as a drop mags turned up at the kirball field though prepared for the worst prepared in more ways than one as well although nothing had actually been said about armor mags had brought an openfaced helmet a neckbrace a stiff leather kidneybelt shinguards armguards and a chest protector having worn all of these in weapons practice he was reasonably sure that he could move and ride well enough in them to satisfy setham the others had made no such preparations setham looked astonished at his rigout then pleased i hadnt even gotten into discussions with the other coaches about protection he said but it looks as if you have anticipated a great deal of what we might need well done mags one of the older traineesthe girlraised a hand permission to go raid the practice armory and bring things back here for the tryouts sir setham looked pleased all over again permission granted gennie take halleck with you the two sped off setham surveyed the rest you footers and cavalry he said after a moment youll be at a disadvantage against heralds even the ones that dont have strong mindspeech will still have their companions talking to each other and relaying so i want you to sort yourselves into groups of four talk among yourselves and work out a quick way to deal with that when youve done that ill put you out there in your group to defend the goal four at a time and put two herald trainees against you now divide up there were about two dozen people trying out for both the foot and horse groups one of them was jeffers who looked excited and a little sick maybe sick with excitement he was on a cobby little bay that dallen looked at with approval thats good stock and look how he sits how easy his hands are lets just go over there and calm him down a bit shall we mags was a trifle surprised why hes pretty much gonna get on th team aye yes but he doesnt know that he could still make a bad showing out of nerves look at it this way if this was before a battle youd be going about calming people down right i would mags blinked at that he rather thought he was more likely to be the one needing calming you would its part of what a herald does so go practice on jeffers dallen ambled over to jeffers side giving mags no real choice in the matter heyla mags said i seen ye at master sorens aye im mags what jeffers started a little then smiled weakly oh yes probably i mean i dont know lydia really well but we shared some tutors back when we both took classes at bardic and were more or less in the same circles belatedly he stuck out a hand which was a little cold mags removed his gauntlet and shook it solemnly this kirball seems people are takin it important aye he offered now jeffers blue eyes lit up well they should i mean its not just a game you know this is going to be training in case well you know combat training i could never have gotten my father to agree to combat training with the guard but this he thinks this is just a hearty manly sort of game and he thinks my playing it is a fine idea im not about to tell him its more than that aha dallen seemed pleased keep talking to him ask him why his father doesnt approve of combat training so whys yer pa not want ye fightin mags asked jeffers sighed hes a pacifist and thats fine for him he really is quite good at negotiating settlements with people and because of that he thinks everything can be negotiated and no civilized person should ever have to pick up a weapon if he was forced to choose between grabbing a weapon and hurting an attacker or being hurt himself and negotiation didnt work hed choose to be hurt rather than inflict harm the young man knuckled the side of his head a little and i admire that i really do he absolutely has the courage of his convictions but i cant live like that mags nodded although he couldnt understand someone not being willing to defend himself at all well he said after a moment of thought when ye get on team reckon you an me could meet up at salle afore or after practicin an i could give ye a bit uv trainin like don reckon weaponsmasterd mind ye jest tell yer pa ye was practicin extree wi me and not what at wont be a lie then well done mags jeffers jaw dropped a little and his eyes widened youdyoud do that for me dunno why not mags grinned a little happen i kin get some on lydias friends t come by too so if i got stuff to do we kin start like then they kin take over so ye know wont be a lie jeffers seized mags hand and shook it fervently mags thank you thank you you dont know what this means to me eh well mags flushed a little in embarrassment its not like i caint use extree practice mself he was saved from trying to think of anything else to say by the arrival of gennie and halleck who had brought back enough miscellaneous armor to fit out all the riders jeffers attached himself to a group of three horsemen one of whom looked to be quite highborn indeed if the quality of his tack and clothing was any indication it wasnt flashy in fact it was the opposite but among many other things being around lydia had taught mags how to assess what someone wore the fellow made no fuss at all about strapping on the worn and grungy armor though so he didnt seem to have any airs about him then again these people had all been invited directly by herald setham so whoever they were and whatever their backgrounds they had passed his muster it was gennie and a third trainee pip whom setham set off against the first group of footplayers mags very quickly saw why setham was considering her for team captain she and pip moved together in a way that mags recognized had to be due to mindspeech although the footplayers managed to keep them from lobbing the ball through the goalwindows for a while eventually a clever feint on the part of gennie caused them to concentrate on her long enough for her to flip the ball to pip and pip to peg it through an unguarded window then it was the turn of jeffers and four of the riders against gennie and mags hullo mags came the cheerful mindvoice as soon as he and dallen replaced pip on the field setham says you and dallen are something special when it comes to riding uh he replied the same way dallen thinks he is tells me alla time she grinned while her companion snorted i heard that you was meant to all right i had something in mind for these fellows so lets see if we can pull it off theyre already concentrating on me which is good now pip and i play insaddle ball games all the time for fun so were used to ball passing i dont expect you to have that sort of coordination yet you will but not yet so what i want to do is this keep them concentrating on me while you and dallen run interference and well see if i can get a ball in if i cant then on one of those interference passes well brush by each other and i will pass you the ball and while they still think i have it you try lobbing it in we kin do that mags agreed enthusiastically right then here we go what followed was barelycontrolled chaos mags and dallen shouldered into the riderscarefully timing and gauging their bullrushes so as to not actually put the poor horses in danger of a bad fall they were only horses after all meanwhile gennie made runs at the goal but the riders were good and they had somehow in the short time they had been consulting with each other worked out a strategy for communicating not as good as mindspeech but effective enough to keep gennie away from the goal dallen rushed jeffers horse and at the last minute feinted left went right and shouldered him into a little rise the hard smack of the impact of dallens shoulder into the horses haunches shuddered through both of them and the poor horse stumbled but didnt fall gennie shot past just behind dallen and made a run for the goal but jeffers shouted four and one of the others managed to intercept her dallen whirled on his hind hooves put his head down and went straight for the rider take off your blinkers he said with glee and hit him shoulder to shoulder the taller horse skidded and slipped to the right one two yelled the rider and the remaining two closed up to keep gennie off the goal and force her to gallop off that patch to the left under the hillock with the low stone wall on it is like a bog try not to go there gennie cautioned its slippery where i jest was left of goal mags replied knowing both companions would hear him though it wasnt likely he would hear gennies companion good place to shove them into she returned as she and mags milled confusingly together and the four riders lined up again there was a crowd at the fences now and it made the four riders a little nervous if not their horses it made mags a little nervous too even though he knew that he was one of the first picks for the team out therewell who knew who was out there people who didnt like him and didnt feel he belonged hoping to see him fail friends who maybe hoped too much bear who didnt want to see him hurt you in first gennie said and feinted with the ball mags made as if to take it and then dallen dashed at the line two of the riders charged straight at him without waiting to see if he actually had the ball and dallen compacted himself and braced for impact three four yelled the third rider only now seeing that gennie was the one with the ball too late for the two heading for dallen to change course mags closed his eyes and made himself as tight and small as he could there was another smack a bruising impact on his left leg and dallens whole body shuddered while the righthand horse was forced right down on his own haunches and the left went staggering away the breath knocked out of him ninetynine trainees out of a hundred would have sat there for a moment but not dallen and mags without a word being exchanged the moment that dallen felt mags weight shift he was off again rocketing straight for gennie the ball mags said as dallen aimed for one of the two riders that had hemmed gennie in then they hit and dallen sent the offrider stumbling into that bit of bog and under the confusion as they passed gennie shoved the ball into mags hands then dallen put his head down and ran for the fences gennie right at his heels and all four of the riders streaming out behind them in a tail chase ill make for the goal on high right gennie called looking back over her shoulder to be sure that she was still being followed and the riders thought she had the ball she peeled away taking three of the four with her only jeffers was still on mags dallen reversed himself suddenly pivoting on one hoof and slammed into the chest of jeffers mount the poor horse went staggering off and sat down suddenly dogfashion to avoid falling dallen ricocheted off the beasts chest and bolted for the goal scrum yelled jeffers but too late the others pulled off of gennie but were miles behind and jeffers horse was too shaken for the moment to get up with horses coming at him as fast as their wellbred legs could carry them but a clear goal ahead mags and dallen kept their heads down and their wits about them and drove for the open door and windows as they passed mags pitched the ball in the doorway as the biggest opening and heard the cheers of the crowd just as the horses caught up with them and surrounded him goal shouted setham well done mags gennie you are in you too jeffers a rush of elation filled him as the crowd cheered he and dallen went out twice more each time solo against foot groups that was hardly fair the best they could do was try and blockade the doors and windows with their bodies and they couldnt be everywhere the goal had been planned and built that way mags scored goals each time but at least one of the groups of four made it hard enough on them that dallen was lathered by the time they made their point when all four herald trainees were weary and their companions lathered setham sent horse against horse horse against foot and foot against foot and sent the trainees back to the stables at this point mags didnt care he knew he was on the team and that was the important thing physically he was as bruised and battered as he had ever been since leaving cole pieters mine but he didnt care about that either he felt good a good tired and dallen felt the same way they went back to the stable walking slowly so dallen had a chance to cool down actually all four of them did more or less together gennie glanced over at him after a while good job out there she said he bobbed his head thenkee he said awkwardly i mean it you slotted right into teamwork without hesitation theres a big difference between a good team and a team of good playersor good fighters she raked her short brown hair out of her eyes with grimy fingers and glanced over at halleck who flushed youve got to stop thinking of just what you can do and think in terms of what we can do thats why jeffers lot was good hadnt even been working together more than half a candlemark and were thinking about each others strong and weak points mags nodded keeping quiet but he was impressed with gennies observations she was going to make a good captain when they reached the stable they were all starting to chill mags hustled dallen inside and rubbed him down within an inch of his life getting both of them warm again once he was clean and dry mags threw his blanket over him and buckled the chest and belly straps loosely i must say i am glad that they walled this place in with brick a few years ago dallen said blinking sleepily drafts are bad enough with people coming in and out of the doors all the time and what with the windows only having shutters and no glass but when our stable was wood it was horrible next yell want wood floors mags said with a smile or maybe ony marblell suit ye you have wood why shouldnt i mags laughed same as th reason why im goin t get me a hot bath an you get a rubdown he gave dallans ears a quick scratch and went off to his quarters to get a clean uniform he was going to claim a bathtub and not leave it until the water was cool and his skin looked like a withered apples chapter for days all that anyone could talk about were the kirball teamswho was on who was going to get on what the games were going to look like this was especially true during the trials and during them mags tried to keep himself as much out of the public eye as possible he was a little surprised to discover that herald nikolas was heartily in favor of his being on one of the kirball teams the kings own made one of those stealthy visits to him the evening after the trial right after setham had confirmed that he had been selected mags immediately started to apologize for getting involved in yet another timeconsuming activity nikolas laughed and silenced him with a gesture no no mags this is a very good thing im quite pleased mags blinked buti thought th ideer was fer me to mostly be not noticed not exactly nikolas steepled his fingers together the idea is for you to appear innocuous someone that can be safely ignored he explained further at mags bewildered look now no one ever anticipates great intelligence out of a games player or a fine warrior this is just how things gopeople assume that anyone who is quite physical does not have as much going on in his mind this is good for us we can use this to our advantage then i should stop tryin so hard in classes he asked bewildered all over again now no no nikolas laughed his eyes crinkling up in the corners no one but your teachers will know how well or poorly you are doing in class so just act as you have been people will hear you talk and assume that you are not very bright let them continue to think that way in that way you become someone it is safe to ignore well this was all a little confusing but mags was willing to accept it meanwhile the teams were taking shape he wasnt sure about the others but their team got organized within a day as setham had suggested gennie was quickly made team captain she set about ruthlessly finding out the weaknesses of her teammates and structuring her strategy to minimize them it was a sound approach and one setham approved of their coach did not say what the other teams were doing but mags got the definite impression that at least one of the other teams was taking the opposite approach the hardest part was coordinating things with the footplayers and riders or rather it would have been hard exceptfor the second reason mags was on the team his mindspeech was powerful enough that he could be heard and understood by the ungifted that meant gennie could give him orders and he could tell them instantly to the rest of the team no one would have to think of codes for movements or shout them across the playing field as captain gennie was going to stay where she could see everything and prepare to dash in at need or so the plan was mags had the notion that once games started gennie was going to be dashing in a lot it was too bad that without him reading the minds of his teammates he couldnt tell gennie what they were going to do that was just out of the question this was hardly any sort of emergency situation this was a game and not a skirmish in a war and it would be entirely unethical for him to violate the privacy of their thoughts this way although if he could train them tomore or lessmentally shout what they were doing that didnt count as reading so maybe he would suggest that once things settled into place more setham and the other coaches had decided that the teams needed names and that the most innocuous would be the four cardinal directions although they debated everything from colors to mythical creatures gennie had been very taken with the idea of calling their team gennies gryphons once the other three captains had gotten wind of that idea there were almost fights breaking out over the best names dragons of any color firebirds and so on were very popular the coaches put their collective feet down over the ruckus and that was the end of that first of all we are not having anyones personal name being part of the team name as if you were all some sort of mercenary company setham had told them all quite sternly the team will i hope last long past when gennie is in her whites and out on circuit secondly there is too much concentration on the name and its emblem and not on actually building the team itself your name is going to be one of the four directions your team color will be the one usually associated with that direction and there will be no totemic mascot now lets not hear any more about this so mags was on the south team and the color was red and it was all settled even if from time to time he could hear gennie muttering under her breath theyre still gennies gryphons somehow he was managing to stay relatively in the shadow of his other teammates it did help that gennie was outspoken gregarious and popular she managed to eclipse anyone that did not have as powerful a personality as she did and mags was grateful for that he basically portrayed himself as the quiet gamesplayer he carefully filtered all his ideas through gennie and if she thought that was odd she said nothing about it maybe she thought he was shy or had no self confidence if so that was fine too the trials were over pretty quickly and the teams set with one or two exceptionsmostly when two of the coaches had tried to recruit the same personpeople passed the trials and there were enough players and alternates that a second round wasnt needed once the trials were done with some of the excitement drained away and life went relatively back to normalexcept of course that mags now had team practice every day along with everything else with four teams using the same practice ground some creative juggling of trainee classes had to be done because not everyone was free when his or her team was scheduled for practice and there were some transfers especially among the grays mags found himself to his profound relief in a language class that was composed mostly of the youngest of the trainees from all three collegia and which as a consequence was not nearly so demanding as the one he had been taking after some consultation and a session in which he sweated over a stack of maths problems it was deemed that he was proficient enough in geometry to get by and excelled in everything else so he was permitted to stop that class he got switched to a different history class as well one that was covering an entirely different time period than the one hed been in but that was all right he knew he would catch up pretty quickly and that freed his early afternoon his afternoons were going to be exhausting though all of his weaponry classes were held in late afternoon which meant he would be going from kirball practice to weapons work well if this was a wartime situation it wasnt as if he would be able to take a break from the fighting besides as he told himself so far nothing he had done had been as physically demanding as a day of mining on too little food there was one little problem however the first full day of team practice he learned that the south team would have their session right after the noon meal which was not such a good thing on a full stomach after thinking about it he decided that what he would do would be to get himself a packet of things that would keep eat very lightly then have a second meal after the practice dividing his lunch into two small meals so for the first day of practice he sat down and warmed himself with a quite small bowl of soup which he ate slowly with a bit of bread he was halfway through it intently thinking over what gennie might demand of them today and what setham might want them to do when a tap on his back startled him old habits died very hard so when startled he froze rather than yelping or jumping while he sat there bear sat down on the bench next to him and eyed his lunch critically i wouldnt say you needed to lose weight mags grinned a little and shrugged kirball fer mteam is right after noon ah bear nodded back in that case youre doing the right thing you could get really sick if you ate like you usually do then went out to practice i dont think youd impress anyone by losing your lunch suddenly mags shrugged happen ye learn a mite or two bout eatin when ye aint got a lot t eat he turned his attention fully on bear for something about his friend did not seem quite right happen i aint been payin much heed t friends lately bear ye seem a bit fashet ye been frettin bout somethin bear looked uncomfortable and actually squirmed a little in his seat its nothing he said starting to stuff a huge bite of cooked greens into his mouth mags kept looking at him steadily bear shoveled three more bites in pretending to ignore the stare but then he stopped and put the fork down and sighed youve got no idea how lucky you are to be an orphan mags froze with the spoon halfway into his mouth it felt like his mind was stuck in mud for a moment because he could not imagine why bear would have said anything like that finally he ate the soup then put the spoon in the bowl ye got any notion how crazy that sounds he asked bear grimaced very but lenas not the only one with parents that mags waited when bear didnt finish the sentence he prodded what i know theyre all healers be they pretendin ye dont exist cause ye got no gift he snorted the more fools them bear looked sick its worse than that we got into it over the holidayor rather they all sat and lectured me one at a time and then all together they think i dont belong here taking up a space that a real healing trainee could use they think if i were to leave here someone from the provinces would get an open place they wont understand that it doesnt work that way anymore that anyone who can come here and be spared at home is free to come they just refuse to believe that they want me to pack up and come home and marry some he made a flailing gesture with his hands some neighbor girl i supposedly used to play with that i dont even remember so that i can maybe breed some children that will have the gift mags felt his jaw dropping wherewhat he got control of himself again but he felt a little as if bear had suddenly announced he was going to become an artificer the dean of healers is stalling them i mean they cant exactly come up here and pull me out of the collegium by the hair theyd have to have my consent to come home but now bear looked even sicker heres the thing im not sure theyre wrong mags felt his jaw unhinge now you are th one sayin crazy stuff no but lookmost of what i do is with herbs they generally wont let someone without a gift do any cutting because someone without a gift cant see what theyre doing and where theyre going so i probably wont be learning surgery i can set bones sure but someone with a gift can do it better so that leaves just the herbs and what good is that here bears face was bleak i can help a little and i can take care of people who for one reason or another refuse to let a real healer touch them or the few people that healing mindmagic doesnt work on thats all i can do and im not sure im not wasting space maybe id be better going home and treating animals nobody would mind if i did surgery on them and there just arent many animal healers didn you even lissen t amily he asked aghast she said ye had a gift an dont ye think shes right of course she would say that bear said bitterly shes the ungifted crippled daughter of the kings own who has never been chosen she has to believe that people without gifts are just as effective as those with them or her own life would be unbearable mags had never heard bear talk like this before and he was somewhat at a loss for what to say he felt a little sick and a little like crying bear was so clever and so kind that to see him in this state made him want to jump up and do something right now and of course there was nothing that he could do well i got a gift an a companion an i say ye got a gift he replied after a while and laid his hand cautiously on bears shoulder whats more i bet ifn ye ask the senior healers over there theyd be tellin ye the same bear smiled wanly thanks mags he stirred his cooling greens gazing broodingly down at them oh what was in that note you left me the other night i havent had a chance to talk to lena and i spilled a decoction all over it and its illegible glad to change the subject mags told him what he had uncovered in the archives so all i know now is im a furriner he hadnt made any effort to keep his voice down although it wasnt as if he had any great secret to hide but suddenly he noticed that he was getting odd glances from everyone within range of the sound of his voice and bears expression changed again this time to wary he hunched his shoulders and glanced furtively from side to side aw hellfires mags did you have to say that out loud he whispered uh mags blinked there a prollem bear groaned dont you ever listen to any gossip its all over the collegia and the court too mags shook his head aint like i ever talk t too many people he pointed out an i been pretty busy past few days why bear carefully removed his lenses and polished them with his sleeve because this morning a lot of the foreseers got visions they saw the king covered in blood a shadowy figure next to him and the sense that someone had tried to kill the king and the feeling that the shadowy figure was foreign born which you are and the feeling is that only someone known to the king or otherwise vouched for could get that close to him its not as if hes ever unguarded and hes a damn fine fighter on his own merits so theres been a lot of speculation about who could be foreignborn and be able to get to him and theres not a lot of people around that match those two things mags blinked and felt something very odd resentment and some anger but he didnt often feel resentment well that dont make no sense he said indignantly they got somethin bad the king in danger an someun furriner an they know xactly that an nothin else aint nobody got no brains round here mebbe the furriners there cause he came t help maybe the furriners there by accident mebbe nobody knows this feller is a furriner yet aint nough in that vision t make any kinda good guess bout whats gonna happen cept that the kings prolly got an enemy an when aint he got an enemy bear waved his hands at mags deprecatingly hey i wasnt the one leaping to conclusions all right but you know how some people are mags thought back to the herald that had leapt to the conclusion that because he lived in the stable he was out there up to no good presumably with girls or liquor or both or worse things aye he growled well id sooner cut off me own hand an bleed t death than harm the king an theres an end to it ifn ye caint trust summun thats been chosen then ye might as well take way the whites and turn all th heralds out right he looked around defiantly at the people who were giving him sideways glances and most of them looked away flushing with guilt a couple gave him nods of sympathybut a couple of them gazed back at him with clenched jaws great just fantastic there have always been people like that here chosen idiots who cant even accept the judgment of a companion including some heralds who really should know better dallens mindvoice was soothing we just have to deal with them as we always have mags only reply was a wordless growl of frustration bad enough that he already felt deep down that he didnt really belong here but to have to deal with other people who felt the same unfair then again when was life fair ever itd be nice if some peopled think wi their heads stead uv some other parts he muttered if they did the healers would get a lot less work bear replied with a tentative smile aye tthat mags sighed well reckon i gotta muddle long an i got practice hope we kin keep from brainin each other bear pulled a long face so do i mags left his packet of food in his room he reckoned he might just as well go down to the kirball field armored up again the worst that would happen would be that setham would tell him to take it off so with dallen saddled with his working saddle he hoisted himself and his added burden up into place and they trotted down to the playing field with bears unwelcome news shoved firmly into the back of his mind and certainly when he got there it didnt appear that anyone else had heard the storiesor if they had they certainly didnt seem to care foremost in their minds seemed to be the number of bumps and knocks they had taken yesterday for they were arrayed in as motley an assortment of makeshift armoring as mags had ever imagined corwin you look like you robbed your mothers kitchen said one of the footplayers laughing very near did said the aforementioned corwin who was all but invisible behind all the stuff he had strapped to himself half of thiss stovepipe tother halfs old bits of carpet thought of taking a pot for me head but found a helm i could bang the dents out of great kernos excleaimed setham as he approached with someone in tow you all have been creative thats being generous sir gennie laughed well this is all rather interesting because besides our first practice i was going to get your help in designing what will be our specialized armor setham nodded at the solemnfaced young man that was with him my friend here will draw it up for me ill consult with the other coaches who are doing the same and well have the armor made up before the first match he peered at corwins helm that miserable excuse for a helmis that karsite aye sir i think tis corwin replied found it at a stall in the market well get one from the armory those karsite buckets are notorious a baby could dent it and a good hard blow will crack your skull right through it by this point a cart had lumbered up laden with what looked like the castoffs and discards from the guard armory at least it was all in dark blue and flaking silver if you havent ferreted out your own or want to replace something rummage through that setham said waving a hand at it we can wait corwin was first at the wagon probably being very eager to replace his bits of stovepipe with something less makeshift when everyone was suited up setham went over the rules for the game again now obviously since you footplayers are less mobile youll be guarding the goal both the flag and the castle setham said but dont think you will be confined to that by the rules if there is a way for one of you to get a ball in the other castle or steal the flag then your captain will suggest it and you should try it we decided to make the only rules of this game about safety so no pulling a rider out of the saddle for nowalthough as you get better that actually will be allowed riders no running the footplayers down that will never be allowed because we cant trust the ordinary horses to do it safely they all nodded of course nobody follows no rules in a battle mags thought an thiss battletrainin the rest of the practice session was confined to some very simple exercises with an end toward making them a team and getting them used to working with each other setham seemed satisfied there was a lot of ball passing gray to gray gray to rider gray to foot rider to rider rider to foot foot to foot there was a lot of goal blocking first by just the foot then by the riders then by the grays mags was kept busy shouting gennies directions into the heads of the ungifted though he quickly discovered that everyone reacted faster when he showed them a picture than when he used words useful that it was faster for gennie to send a picture to him and easier for him to send a picture out when they were dismissed however mags was not done with the team he approached young jeffers still on dallen before the latter could ride back into haven reckon ye still wanta learn weaponry he asked diffidently i made some rrangements if ye do jeffers eyes lit up and his tired horse even raised his head as if sensing his riders excitement mags held up a cautioning hand got t warn ye gonna be tedious fer a goodly while but i got t thinkin and i asked weaponsmaster if he could be workin out exercises ye kin pass off as kirball stuff thatll strengthen ye up i the right way for weapons an e showed me some thiss all stuff ye kin set up t do when yere at home so een though ye aint actually practicin with sword or whatnot yell be practicin fer em at home he scratched his head happen ye kin practice ahorse too which aint a bad thing yon cob of yourn is steady nough in kirball so far hell be steady nough right off in this stuff now jeffers lit up even more his eyes shone with happiness and he grinned for the first time since mags had met him mags i cant even begin to thank you enough no wonder amily and lydia think you are clever mags just shook his head aint clever jest used t gettin round rules and sneakin ye ken i mean gettin done whatcha need t do wiout lyin or getting caught at it that aint clever jest a way of thinkin that ye got to learn when he broke it off jeffers didnt need his story or jeffers might already know it in either case telling him wouldnt serve any good or useful purpose anyway i jest got figgerin out how to get somethin thet i want bad kinda ground inter me he shrugged an i don see no harm in you learnin this an neither does weaponsmaster so come on an well get ye started hellfires prolly do ye good in kirball too top of evthing else i cant stay too much longer jeffers warned my parents andthey dont know anyone in the foot or anyone in the riders to ask butthey might in the heralds mags nodded lemme check he said dallen kin ye make sure nobody rats on jeffers covers fer him like if theres an mergency an someone comes up here fer im or sends fer im dallen engaged in that long silence that meant he was speaking to all of the companions within reach as the two of them headed up toward the salle its sorted dallen replied finally some of the heralds dont like it but we reminded them that some of their parents werent too happy about them being chosen we also reminded them that it isnt as if the young man is doing anything wrongand that he is very respectful of his parents choice so they should be respectful of his no one true way after all it seems to have worked dallen sez yer covered mags reported just as they got to the salle itself he listened to what dallen had to say and repeated it verbatim he sez if someun comes up here lookin fer ye heralds an graysll say yer at salle getting some tips on hittin an aimin from weaponsmaster weaponsmasterll say same aint a lie neither an afore anyone gets there theyll be warnin so ye kin get rid of weapon an itll look like ye was jest talkin jeffers dismounted grinning ruefully and you say you arent clever hey twasnt me he protested that twas weaponsmasters ideer now ye go long t him ill rub down yer cob an walk im cool mags jeffers was at a loss for words you are a star mags knew he wouldnt be long not like his own practicesjeffers parents probably wouldnt quibble up to a candlemark for extra practice but they certainly would say something about more than that he got jeffers horse and dallen rubbed down and in good condition and dallen took the cobs reins in his teeth to lead him off to the horse stables then mags and the weaponsmaster showed the young man the exercise they had worked out to simulate sword play normally this sort of thing was done by striking with a wooden bladeoften weightedat a padded pole called a pells obviously that wasnt realistic for jeffers to set up in a yard since everyone knew what a pells looked like so what the weaponsmaster had decided on was for jeffers to take swings with a weighted wooden club at a ball about the size of a melon suspended at various heights to represent the various target areas on a human he could tell them it was kirball he wouldnt even be exactly lying since one of the defensive moves they had all planned for was to smack the ball away from the goal with a much broader sort of club more like a paddle and the kirball was about the same size if he was ever challenged he could say that working with a club instead of the paddle was to make his aim better because it was harder when jeffers had to leave he took a club and a leather ball and its marked string with him nearly falling over himself with gratitude but life continued to slide downhill into the mud aside from the kirball practices in which no one acted as if he was any different than he had been before all those ridiculous visions that session with jeffers was the last completely comfortable happy moment mags knew gossip about the foreseers vision reached into every nook and cranny of the three collegia as did mags own revelation that he was foreignborn he found himself the focus of far too many speculative glances laden with suspicion granted most of them did not come from trainees or heraldsbut some did and the most suspicious were from the bards and especially the bardic trainees who had far far too much imagination for their own good he even started to hear wild tales about black heralds and black companions who could somehow pass as the real thing but inside were evil incarnate was that even possible no dallen said emphatically theyre just making things up so they can frighten each other what an incredibly stupid idea its too stupid even to make me laugh still the stories persisted because the surest way to make some people believe almost anything was to deny it completely can you prove that the doubters would demand and of course no one could prove that what had never happened before never could happen after all there had been trainees who had been repudiated and everyone pointed to tylendel as the primary example so why not bad companions as well the companions werent infallible so went the socalled reasoning of course no one actually said anything to him they just whispered it behind their hands around him and their minds shouted it so loudly that it got past his shields then there were the ones that turned up their noses in contempt at the wilder stories but still thought what if it isnt him but someone he knows or what if he somehow brings old trouble from his past into the grounds and the king gets caught in it what could he say to people like that after all he couldnt refute what hadnt happened yet he couldnt even say anything because they werent saying anything to him it was aggravating it was more than aggravating it was sickening he went around with his stomach in a knot most of the time now feeling eyes on his back as people watched him hoping to catch him showing his true colors he even got into a shouting match with some of the highborn youngsters and some of the bardic trainees it all started overof all stupid thingsthe fact that he was eating soup and a little bread instead of the regular hearty luncheon not that he had much appetite anymore is that what they eat where you come from foreigner sneered one of the bardic trainees as he passed mags table or are you too good to enjoy honest valdemaran food mags gave him a stony stare nah i come from an honest valdemaran mine where we was worked worsen donkeys he said mine soup was mostly water an a couple cabbage leaves be good change for them as needs t be able t fit their uniforms though cause ye sure wouldn get fat ont he knew he shouldnt have said that all right the fellow was packing on a good several pounds more than he should and his tunic was straining at the seams and yes he did seem to have half a pie and a cream cake on his plate but it was a cruel thing to say and he immediately regretted it too late though because before he could apologize the trainee rounded on him furiously you need to learn some proper manners foreigner he snarled or better yet just go back where you came from we dont need your kind here what kindd that be mags shouted back cause i reckon ifn yer talking bout kind ye be talkin bout evone in grays or whites and how do we know you didnt somehow bewitch that companion into thinking he chose you one of the others said viciously because jan you incredible dunce the other companions would certainly have noticed lena ducked into the group and stood next to mags defiantly her hands on her hips her normally shy demeanor completely gone with her anger and because mags cant even be as old as you since not even the most experienced karsite priests who were four times mags age could manage to bewitch one companion much less the entire herd i think youd better give over that stupid idea i wouldnt even accept that in a storysong she gave him a withering glance no wonder youre failing composition id fail you too if that is all you can come up with maybe hes bewitched you too lena the fat fellow put in furiously turning beet red with rage bear shoved his way in to stand on the other side of mags slowly he looked the overweight trainee up and down and then spent a long and pointed time staring at the laden plate still in his hands ferd lekson i just got this to say to you you insult a fellow out of nowhere then get mad because he gives you back what you gave him and even madder because he tells you to your face what your socalled friends wont which is if you dont quit stuffing your face five times a day there wont be a trainee uniform in all of bardic that will fit you now i got to say mags was rude but you were just as rude and you started it and youre making it worse for your side with all your dumb accusations he put one hand on mags shoulder mags is chosen that should be the end of it but he also saved my life last winter and a couple of other peoples and you seem to have forgotten all of that mags was astonished he had never heard bear talk like that before now you and your friends just take your dinner somewhere else because one more word out of you and im gonna have to decide you need to get treated for your own good and make sure youre on the special meals list ferd went white at that mags knew what the special meals list wasit was for people who had troubles with some sorts of foods there werent more than a handful of people who were on it and most of them were glad to beit meant that the cook made absolutely certain that the foods that made them ill never got anywhere near the plates that were destined for them but if bear put ferd on itmags would bet nearly everything that ferd would find himself restricted both in quantity and the kind of food hed be allowed and the only way hed get anywhere near a piece of pie or cake would be if someone slipped it to him you cant do that ferd spluttered bear got grimfaced and his eyes behind his lenses grew cold as steel try me maybe im only a trainee but when it comes to things like that even the senior healers listen to me and i can have a list of twenty reasons why you need to be on it without even thinking hard muttering to his friends ferd backed down and the lot of them slunk away bear sat down lena beside him with a sigh thiss jest the beginnin ye know mags said glumly staring down into the soup he no longer had an appetite for they aint done i know lena said looking after the lot of them with a worried face and whats worse is nobody else here said anything to defend you youd think some of the grays would bear said loud enough for those nearby to hear him after all its mags todaybut whos to say it wont be one of them getting accused of ridiculous things tomorrow anything that can be used against him could be said about any other chosen it was very quiet people kept their eyes on their meals though no one seemed to be in the mood to eat reckon ill go down t practice early mags said abruptly and shoved what was left of his meal away thanks bear thanks lena least i know i got two friends dallen said nothing as he stalked out of the dining hall resolving not to eat another meal there until all of this was sorted but he had to wonderwhy on earth was he here when so many people didnt want him mostly cause i got nowhere to go that was the shame of it there was no way he could just run away from here not so much for himself as for dallen the companion ate a lot and needed decent stabling and all that cost money what did he know besides how to mine nothing if bear were in this position he could just pack up and leave and set himself up as an animal healer just about anywhere even lena could go on the road as a wandering musician even if she couldnt claim to be a bard both of them had obvious talents and gifts or gifts that would make them welcome anywhere they went he hadexactly nothing except mining and where was he likely to get a place doing that even if cole pieters mine was in better hands now it was a sure bet that there were miners enough already he didnt know any other sort of mining beg on th street mebbe do odd jobs he smiled mirthlessly as he trudged through the cold wind down to the kirball field get job as a ashboy mebbe i should that nice merchant with the soapshop had taken care of dallen maybe shed be willing to keep on doing so i never thought you were a coward mags dallen said sternly but mags just rubbed his forehead he reached the stillempty field and went and sat down with his back against the goalcastle mebbe ye don know me as well as ye think ye do he replied mebbe theyre all right an yere wrong and maybe the sun will rise in the west tomorrow dallen retorted i cant prove it wont but i think that is more likely than that i am wrong about you all mags could do was sigh chapter where are you going dallen asked as he went past dallens stallwearing not grays but the palace page uniform hed gotten through nikolas and why are you wearing that instead of your uniform dallens head was up and his ears pinned back mags turned and looked his companion in the eye goin t get breakfast i aint eatin in hall till this gets sorted an i don wanta get snubbed by kitchen staff neither figgered if i wear this they wont look past th livery gonna say im fetchin food for herald jakyr get the stuff an bring it back t me room dallen went very still for a long moment mags shrugged and moved on past he was tired of knotted stomach and ruined meals at least this way he could eat in peace but before he got to the door one of the other companions intercepted him and shouldered him aside then planted her ample hindquarters right in front of it and stood looking down her long nose at him he recognized her as pips litri she didnt have to mindspeak him it was plain she was not going to let him pass you get back in your room and put on proper grays dallen said firmly what did nikolas say about not making yourself conspicuous this isnt going to solve anything people are watching you now if you stop showing up for meals youll only make people more suspicious of you he stared at both companions i caint eat wi em starin me down alla time he exclaimed in despair mguts all inna knot afore i even get in th door litri snorted at him as if to say she still wasnt moving dallen was not going to give in either just do what i told you we have a plan shoulders hunched mags obeyed his companion he went back to his room changed and shuffled unhappily up the path to the collegium with heavy reluctance he pulled open the door and went in although he would much rather have been slouching his way to the worst languages class ever than have to go eat under a sea of he stopped in the middle of the corridor in midthought there were half a dozen people waiting there for him bear lena gennie pip halleck and the alternate gray team member of the south meled if it hadnt been friends hed have turned and bolted for the door but since it was he just stood there for a moment baffled before he could say or do anything they surrounded him gennie took one arm pip the other and the lot of them bustled into the dining hall as a group as a group they took up an entire table gennie and pip pushed him down on a seat between them with bear and lena across from him and as a groupbear and lena includedthey started chattering about kirball immediately doing absolutely nothing to keep their voices down need a name for those clubs before we use them neck brace i think but it ought to be flexible maybe a padded leather collar think we ought to all get together at lunch every lunch from now on because we are going to need all the time we can get for planning for goal tending someone with fetching gift could take the flag someone with fetching gift could lob the balls in and wed never know it lena loaded a plate and passed it to him he got so wrapped up in the kirball discussion he only noticed when it was under his nose for once even though he was still getting hostile thoughts from some of the others in the room his stomach wasnt in a knot he was in the middle of friends no one was going to bother him or harass him at least not right at this moment the presence of the others pretty much guaranteed that wonderful smells came up from the plate hotcakes and bacon hot porridge his stomach growled and he dug in the food went down easily and quickly and he was hungry for the first time since all this began pip and halleck got into a passionate discussion about the finer points of intercepting a ballsomething that they hadnt even begun to work out in practice bear waded in manfully pointing out that a ball going as fast as this one might when hit with a stick would likely break bones if it struck you that triggered a discussion of more padding under cover of this gennie leaned over and caught mags eyes her mindvoice rang out clearly in his head if wed known you were getting harassed wed have done this before she said firmly im sorry mags as your captain and as a trainee senior to you i should have been looking out for you from now on we get meals as a team all twelve of us plus your friends lena and bear if they can at lunch at least those of us that live up here at breakfast and supper youll never come into the dining hall with less than six people around you nobody will want to lock horns with a group this big were kirball players which is starting to count for something and seeing us four sticking by you just quelled any doubts the other grays had he was so astonished that he could only blink at her he could scarcely believe she was going to all this trouble she snorted quietly at the expression on his face what were a team and im almost as strong a mindspeaker as you with a lot more practice and training you might be able to hold things back from me but i would know you were even if i didnt know what they were youre good mags but i have to tell you you cant keep me out if i want in and all these stories coming out of the foreseers makes it ethical for me to rummage around in your head because of the danger to the king if i were so inclined so did ye he asked solemnly she shook her head no because i trust and i know you id ask first if not you then the dean and i wouldnt do it in secret but others know that i am strong and trained and they know ive had plenty of opportunity and if they choose to assume i have had a walk around in your thoughts well thats good all the way around because they see me here and now and that is just one more shot in the heart of these stupid suspicions well he hesitated because he really didnt want anyone in his head but dallen but if that was what it was going to take you kin rummage aroun in there all ye like she shook her head thanks but no thanks youve got nightmares in there id rather not see joy says dallen told her so but the mere fact that you offered either means you are the sneakiest and most underhanded and clever person in the kingdom or perfectly honest and since youre chosen you cant be sneaky and underhanded so you must be perfectly honest her perfect trust in the companions and their choices shone through her thoughts warming parts of him that had gone cold with rejection i bin sneaky an underhanded wi jeffers he said weakly oh jeffers that doesnt count she said dismissively in some parts of valdemar hed be married and with his own family by now hes capable of deciding for himself what he wants to do its honorable and honest and all you are doing is helping him get it all right then i gotta thenkee a flash of irritation its what we all should have been doing but if the others wont man up and do it your teammates will so there he found himself smiling wanly and went back to the conversation which had moved on to finding ways of disrupting gifts during the game while he talked he let his gift drift over all the projected thoughts out there it was soon clear that gennies ploy had worked no more hostile thoughts from anyone wearing grays or whites in this roomthough he was getting plenty of curiosity and puzzlement well they caint be any more puzzled nor me there were still hostile surface thoughts the most worrying were the ones from the guards who after all were supposed to protect the king he had to wonder if they would decide that it was easier to prevent him from being involved in this future calamity by well force if necessary he didnt think theyd harm him butthey could find a nice dark prison cell to throw him in or they could drag him off and dump him on the other side of the border it was the same problem over and over how was he to prove that he was not the one that was the cause of a future crime i spose i could ask fer guard t be there evtime i meet w th king or nikolas or summun else thats good as a guard yes but look at how he had just run into the king by chance at the stables how could he ever stop that sort of thing from happening well the companions could coordinate he supposed but there was no accounting for accidents or a situation where they had to be in the same place at the same time it was just so frustrating and frightening really because even though he knew he knew he would sooner die than harm so much as a hair of the kings head what if it was the result of an accident something terrible that just happened when he was in the vicinity what if the king was attacked while mags was there and he wasnt going to act quickly enough to save him what if what if there were just too many uncertainties and in a way he even felt some sympathy for those poor foreseers who were only seeing a corner of whatever it was that was going to happen it must have been driving them mad i wisht i knew what in hellfire it was they saw xactly might be able t pick summat out but right now it was a lot more likely that karsites would welcome heralds and companions with fruit baskets and flower wreaths than it was that any foreseers would be willing to talk to him ask your friends lydia amily marc and all theyll know whats been seen ask them well that was certainly an idea he had been acting as their spy why shouldnt they return the favor well he didnt exactly have the time to go down to sorens house at the moment but marc was up here at the royal kennels and it wouldnt take too long to nip down there he even had time before his first class they all finished their breakfasts wrapped up the conversation waited for mags to finish his and left as a group are you going to be all right until luncheon gennie asked as the others headed in several directions for classes he nodded got a errand first but its t see a friend nobodys bothered me tween classes or in classes yet he pushed the thought down all right then well meet you here before lunch joy will set it up with dallen gennie headed off and mags scooted out the door and aimed for the royal kennels marc was feeding the gazehounds and turned toward him with a worried frown when the dogs alerted on the stranger and he spotted that it was mags in the building mags i know i know he replied hastily thet is t say i know thingsr bein said bout me but nobodyll tell me xactly what it is marc i gotter know what them foreseers saw xactly what they saw iffn theres any detail mebbe i kin figger out if i got any real connection wi it marc nodded a lock of his red hair falling over his forehead all right i can talk to lydia and she can find out easily enough amily probably can too and shes up here with her father ill talk to both and have amily get hold of you to tell you what she found no point in passing things through too many hands or having too many of us all asking the same questions it all gets muddled it does that he said his head hurt trying to puzzle through all of this marc sucked on his lower lip amily can make out as if shes asking on behalf of her father and that will get her the stuff straight from the foreseers mags nodded still wishing he could talk to them himself there were supposed to be foreseers among the heralds werent there it wasnt a common gift but surely there should be one bugger he said aloud all this and he still had classes to deal with and kirball he felt like a juggler with only one arm his unofficial bodyguard turned up at lunch just as gennie said they would and universally declared that his habit of eating a very little before practice was a wise one gennie sent pip off to the kitchens to explain what they needed and shortly pip came back with a heavy basket for afters there were pocket pies in there dallen was going to be thrilled the people in the dining hall who were not in grays or whites outnumbered those that were and this time despite the presence of the others around mags there was a lot of buzz of sullen conversation around them and a lot of narrowed eyes and black looks finally halleck seemed to tire of it all he stood up mags had no idea that he was going to do anything other than well leave when his voice suddenly roared out like an angry boarhound all of you shut up shocked silence descended the attention of every person in the dining hall was riveted on the trainee and halleck was not a small young man he was at least as tall if not a little taller than any other trainee and he had a truly impressive set of shoulders halleck looked around belligerently you people are like a bunch of nastyminded old village gossips you know that like a bunch of vipers hiss hiss hiss and all that happens is you stir each other up over nothing the foreseers saw this the foreseers saw that well for one thing the foreseers have been too damn chatty about this and they should bloody well know better you dont go flinging dung around and act surprised when it hits innocent people for another my gift is foresight and you know what i saw he waited silence nothing thats right nothing i havent seen a damn thing since then either and it is not for lack of trying ive done everything i can to get a glimpse nothing now dont you think me actually knowing mags and all that if he had anything at all for us to be worried about i would have seen something more silence sometimes we see really detailed stuff mostly we dont the farther off it is the more confused and unclear it gets and the more we see things that are more like symbols of whats going to happen than the actual event now will you people stop acting like a crowd of hateful vicious old gossips with too much time on their hands and too much venom on their tongues and start acting like responsible trainees people your circles can be proud of instead of wincing every time your names are mentioned yes no he waited for an answer mags could still sense hostility and plenty of it bah remind me never to rely on any of you for anything that actually requires thinking halleck spat and sat down again well done gennie said warmly he grinned at both of them then he turned to mags ill tell you the truth mags foreseersespecially all the ones attached to temples and the like which is so far as i know all the ones who saw anything about the king and a foreignerlike to make out that they know more than they do halleck rubbed one eye ruefully i guess it kind of comes with the whole priestly thing direct information from the gods and all that most of the ones that i know of are honest enough not to actually make stuff up but then you get other people jumping to whatever conclusions they care to i suppose it could all be construed as a kind of test of peoples character mags nodded halleck shrugged apologetically mostly what we get is glimpses and those glimpses are exactly like glimpses you yourself would get if you were rushed past an event fast a little confused and not all that clear that is hard enough but once a little time has passedthe visions become memories and memories get mixed up blurred changed by what other people tell us mags nodded pip piped up thats why they tell us to get witnesses to give statements as detailed as possible right away the problem with memory is that its often mistaken eyewitnesses tend to see what they expect to see too halleck reminded them now foreseers do get special training so that we try and concentrate when we get a vision and more or less turn off the thinking parts of our minds but who knows what it was that gave those others the feeling that the person with the king was a foreigner enough of all this we have practicing to do said gennie and i want to find out how many of the others can join us at meals if we put enough teammates between mags and the idiots at least theyll be smart enough not to gossip in front of us and we can all eat in relative peace mags sighed relative was the operable word here he thought about hiding in the guard archives to study because he was all too aware when other grays and heralds came into the stable some of them didnt know or had forgotten that he lived out therebut most of them knew it and it made them uneasy but then he thought better of the idea according to tam and liam the two notquiteguardsmen there was plenty of speculation going on among their fellows about what should be done about that trainee mags he really didnt want to find himself cornered by guardsmen who had decided that what should be done about him was to be locked up or sent out of haven altogether on the theory that if he wasnt in haven then what had been foreseen wouldnt happen nice theory anyway because after all the foreseers couldnt tell where their vision had taken place so he had heard he could be sent out of haven only to encounter the king by another accident it reminded him of a kind of morbid song lena sang to him and bear once about a man who had his fortune told and it was that he would meet death in the village square the next day so he flung himself on a horse and rode like the wind until at a few drips short of the appointed hour and he dismounted in front of an inn in another city thinking he had escaped he turned and ran right into death who said in surprise oh thank you you saved me a trip and took him but at any rate it sounded like the guard archives though quiet and warm would not be a good place to hide out nor would the collegium library but the heralds had archives not as big as the ones for the guards not even as big as the bardic ones but they had archives and almost no one ever went there actually dallen said after a moment thats a good idea you didnt look there for information about your parents because you didnt know the exact dates or place where the bandits camp was now you do and there might be something in the heralds reports more detail about your parents clothingperhaps even if you look backward a bit youll find someone who ran into them on circuit maybe in a town maybe on the road heralds are supposed to report on foreigners they encounter in all of the unhappiness mags had quite forgotten why he had uncovered that information in the first place he gave that some thought huh he thought a bit more well i got studyin mebbe i kin look after im done wi studyin the heralds archives were in the top floor of the heralds wing exactly where the library was in the collegium wing unlike the guard archives or the collegium library this enormous room was dark and chilly like the guard archives there were rows and rows of floor to ceiling shelves on either side of a passage through the middle of the room unlike the guard archives it was rather untidy with boxes left open on the floor and books in piles there were only a few lamps up here and only half of them were lit making perhaps four pools of light in the darkness including one all the way at the end of the room this was why it was very obvious when someone moved a little at the end of the room the shadow cast under the lamp there was quite long and the movement did more than catch mags eye it practically made him jump bugger someones here already he thought but this was the most private place he was going to find so he continued to move into the room whoever this was maybe mags could avoid him which was of course right when his shin hit a chair he couldnt see and knocked it over whos there cried out a startled voice one he knew amily he called back incredulous mags oh good the relief and the welcome in that voice made him flush a little im so glad youre here you couldnt have picked a better time please come here we found out what you wanted to know being more careful this time he hurried across an expanse of floor made treacherous by the piles of books boxes of papers and scattered chairs whatever else they were the heralds certainly were nothing like as tidy about their recordkeeping as the guard he found amily curled up in what looked like her own private little nest in a corner that was surprisingly warm and cozy a good oil lamp was fastened up on what looked likeand proved to be when he touched itthe back of a substantial brick chimney it radiated warmth into this space exactly as the one in his room did there was a heavily padded halflounge here a couple of padded chairs two little tables within easy reach and books and a teapot and cup on them amily smiled up at him her eyes twinkling i love my father dearly but sometimes i just want to be somewhere that hes not she said and no matter how polite he is about it we live in three small rooms and there is never more than a single door between us its not hard for me to get up here and no one minds my being here she patted the lounge and he sat down gingerly beside her flushing a little but enough about all that i was actually just putting the last of the reports into order for you reports he said feeling thick and stupid she didnt know about his search for his parents so how could about what the foreseers saw she explained theres a protocol for such things and a good thing too considering how wild some of the rumors have gotten all foreseers are trained to either make notes on what they saw immediately when the vision or dream is over or dictate to someone and i have copies of many of them right here she patted a folder on her lap i can sum them up for you if you want though since they are all nearly identical mags nodded not trusting his voice every vision was of the same thing and every vision lasted about the same length of timequite quite short they have the impression that this is the end of a fight they first see the king who is standing but with a look of horror on his face covered in blood his hands also covered in blood they then see what looks like a small slight man quite ragged also covered in blood with a knife in his hands they get the impression that he is foreignborn they get the impression that someone is dying and someone is badly wounded and that is all mags blinked thats it evthink else is just what summon made up she nodded exactly they dont see the other mans face thats all they dont know which of the two is dying or wounded they dont even know if there is someone else dying or wounded that they cant see or even if there is an entire crowd there mags didnt know quite how to feel on this slender thread was hanging all that hostility all that angerfor what i think i wanta hurt someone he said finally amily nodded with sympathy i dont blame you the damage is done and its rather late to get things set straight he sighed and buried his face in his hands after a while he felt her slender arm around his shoulders and she hugged him a little im sorry mags i wish there was something i could do but at leastor well so i heargennie is doing what can be done for now eh shes a good sort he mumbled whole team is akchully i caint go back t these people an point out whats in the reports cause thatll only make things worse but i got to know he steeled himself because he knew this was only going to make more pain for himself amily kin you an lydia an marc an all do me a favor anything she promised still keeping her arm around his shoulders and it felt awfully good that arm not like lena though lena was a good friend and could be quite comforting no this was something else there was something about the warmth and pressure that made him feel odd and a little light and well tingly he found himself wondering how long he could keep his head in his hands like this as an excuse to keep her arm around him wouldja all tell me xactly what yer hearin bout me he begged i mean evthing im mortal tired of seein people whisperin behind their hands i wanta know the worst oh mags she sounded as if she was going to cry its going to be nasty i am sure of it and i dont want to hurt you i don wanna be hurt but truths bettern not knowin she sighed deeply all right if thats what you want he echoed her sigh aint what i want tis what i need all right she repeated and finally took her arm away feeling vaguely disappointed he sat straight up reckon i better go he said reluctantly probably a good idea you certainly are not going to get any studying done around amily hush you i suppose you had better she replied wistfully then brightened a little just remember you can always come up here and share my nook with me i thought ye said ye came here t be alone he replied that odd tingly feeling teasing at him again i said i came up here to get away from father she corrected alonenot necessarily she smiled at him and he felt all lightheaded then she reached out and gave him a little kiss on the cheek and he forgot to breathe he didnt actually remember saying goodnight though he was sure he had she kissed him and the next thing he knew he was halfway to the stables well youre certainly not shaych dallen said amused uh what never mind come do your studying and go to bed before you float away and thats how you make an anklewrap that actually works bear said finishing off the wrapping with a flourish mags shook his headand so did lena i couldnt make head or tail of the diagram in the book said lena and yet it all seems so obvious when you do it bear laughed and shoved his lenses further up on his nose thats because the diagram is wrong he said and pointed to one picture in the middle see that one there dunno what the engraver was thinking but thats not part of the sequence i knewd we was right t come talk t ye mags said gratefully uh he hesitated then went on they still scratchin at ye t come home an get shackled bear lost his good humor and his lips thinned aye but i figured out how to stall them some more how lena demanded eagerly so they havent got near enough healers right not anywhere they both nodded bear raised his head in triumph so where there are no healers if ive put together a standard medical pack that will treat just about anything something every herald can take on circuitthey can still get good treatment until help comes it might not be as good as a good healer but itll be as good as a weak one and a damn sight better than nothing at all i can put together a really big kit foroh say temples and things and all the instructions youd need oh bear thats brilliant lena enthused looking happier how are you finding all the medicines you need thats where i become indispensible bear said smugly maybe theres herbhealers that know more than me out there somewhere but they dont have my resources and most importantly they arent here i know all the ways to treat things without a gift and i can write them down properly not all wrong like in that textbook you two brought me i can make simpler clearer diagrams there are artists here that can draw them properly for me the project has already been approved and im formulating the medicines and figuring out how to pack them to give them the longest life he hesitated then added a little awkwardly the head of healers says that when the standard pack is finished and its been tested if everyone is happy with it theyll give me my greens they say this will be the equivalent of riding circuit for me then my family can gofind someone else to marry that girl ill be a full healer and i will be the one who says where i go and what i do i figure i can stay here and teach people like me find more medicines personally i think we ought to be training more healers that dont have healing gift there are a lot out there midwives and that sort of thing but they dont think to come here for training or else they cant manage to get the means to get here then he drooped again i got to get it done though could take a year maybe more thats the thing i got to show plenty of progress and some of this stuff ishard coming up with medicines i know are going to be consistent all the time writing out the directions all that and keep at my classes and and keep at my classes an do whatever im sent off t do by nikolas an kirball practice mags interrupted and try and figure out what will make father proud and memorize my ballad cycle and get ready for the solo and ensemble trials put in lena with a sigh they looked at each other aint we pitiful said mags he shook his head complainin like that whine whine whine like we was spoilt or somethin well lena said finally it just doesnt seem fair that we work so hard and then we dont get rewarded for it ifn i had all the sparklies i pulled outa that mine in mlife id prolly have mown weight in sparklies mags said sourly an thet goes fer the other kiddies too life aint fair an thats that bears mind was heavily guarded but lenas surface thoughts were so strong he couldnt help but know what she was thinking her father now knew she was here and he hadnt done anything at all about it not an apology not a visit not even a brief note she could probably draw attention to herself by doing stupid things showing off or challenging other students to music contests but all that would do would be to disrupt other peoples lives and concentration and if her father actually took notice of it she was pretty certain the reaction would be negative and that was not what she wanted she just wanted him to look at her once and say well done lena shed never tell mags that though and not just because she was shy but because mags would never have his father look at him and tell him he had done well mags started to reach out to pat her handthen he realized that bear was awkwardly doing the same thing he quickly pulled his own hand back and let bear complete the motion well make it through bear said and rested his hand on hers aye cause we gotta mags said and stood up an thenkee bear but i got to get they nodded he let himself out and looked back through the glass they were still where he had left them with bears hand still on lenas chapter the heraldic archives proved to be the best place for mags to go to get away from suspicious glances for more reasons than one as he had already known almost no one came up there the archive room was above the heralds wing and no matter what their feelings were heralds had very disciplined minds and tended to not leak any surface thoughts that made any place around the heralds wing a very peaceful venue for someone like him proximity was everything when it came to what he picked up the closer someone was physically the easier it was for him to hear them and third well third was amily it seemed that amily did not spend her time up in the archives merely to get some privacy amily was helping to put the archives in order when mags left bear and lena he decided that hed take advantage of amilys little warm corner and get some more studying done but when he opened the door on the archives instead of finding them deserted he found all the lamps lit and a very young fellow in royal livery shelving several volumes under amilys direction over there she was saying as he carried what looked just like one of the boxes that the guard reports were kept in third shelf from the rear south side youll see the one right before it up on the shelf where you put it two days ago she made a little note hullo he called startling both of them amilys eyes lit up mags she said and waved him over mags this is underarchivist jonson hes on loan to me from the royal library the young man was very young on closer inspection he couldnt have been much older than fourteen he was however extraordinarily tall more like a jumpedup page the lad said im good for reaching the top shelves but i want to be an archivist and ill shelve stuff forever if that is what it takes amily smiled very good at it you are jonson she spread her hands and this is what i do everyone needs a job after all and since im a heralds daughter im probably the best one to know how to organize things here i kin see thet mags nodded ansay why dont i give ye a hand i don have heaps of time but what i got ye kin hev would you amily asked her face transformed by a smile course jest tell me whatcha want what she needed it appeared was for him to sort through piles of reports that had gotten muddled either because they had been put back wrong or because someone had just tossed all the records in a box and shoved them up on the shelf that had happened a lot amily wanted things to be as organized and tidy as they were in the guard or royal archives so mags would give the reports a cursory skim and determine who had written them and sort them by author then hed go back and sort each author pile by date then he would actually identify the major events in each sorted pile mark those on the outside of the box along with the author and the start and end date and major area of the circuit and that was how they would be filed first by the geographic location of the circuit then by date within that location and last of all by the name of the herald or heralds because often as not it was the herald and one or more of the heralds trainees this was the old way the way that was supposed to work so well just skimming the reports mags found out that it didnt work all that well it looked like the heralds had to come to the rescue of their trainees a great deal things that would have been minor problems here at the collegium turned into much bigger problems when they were out there with well with no one to help usually the situation wasnt really hazardous usually nine times out of ten it was something stupid something they made a mistake about and mucked up whatever it was that they were supposed to be fixing and nine times out of ten the herald would sort things out but it took time it delayed things and to be honest it made the heralds look it makes us look bad aye it do makes ye look like ye caint even keep yerselves sorted so how kin ye sort out th problems yer supposed to oh yes you might want to keep that thought for the next time that someone tries to claim how much better the old system was already thunk of that he pondered that a moment more and turned his attention back to helping amily already she had made a lot of headway and he found himself feeling ridiculously proud of her the chaos wasnt going to get resolved quicklyand it was going to need some serious tending to given that there was no one to keep a stern eye on things all the time the way that the guard archivists did but by the time he had to go off for class he and amily had made up another box and young jonson had shelved two rows of books again the kirball practices were going well at least for the south team theyd progressed to the stage of not only catching and throwing the ball but hitting it with their paddles those who were supposed to try and catch it now had heavily padded gloves to spare their hands only one of the other teams had someone with fetching gift on it and they had decided that the easiest way to deal with a fetcher was to have mags shout at him with mindspeech breaking his concentration for the rest it was all coordination they practiced patterns riding and afoot throwing the ball to each other and then as one or another split off to gallop downfield someone standing in the stirrups to give the thing an enormous thwack and when the ball reached that far off player he or she would catch it or bat it into the goal they practiced sending the ball shooting across the ground leaning down of their saddles to smack it with their paddles all this was conducted in relative silence as mags relayed their orders the only other sounds being of the ball being hit and the drumming of hooves on sod meanwhile it was also lenas turn to face the first big challenge of her collegium all bardic students had to compete in a twiceyearly contest there was no excuse that would get you out of it other than being very ill indeed on the day of the competition and lena was a nervous wreck she didnt have to say why they all knew she wasnt sure whether she was more overwrought about her father showing up or him not showing up she agonized about her competition piecewas it too short too long was it too simple so complicated it looked as if she was trying to show off should she perform something original do you have anything of yours that is fit to sing for an audience bear asked as she sat on the floor of the conservatory surrounded by a half a dozen music manuscripts yes no i dont know she wailed then sing something that aint yers mags advised it aint as if ye aint gonna have more of these things t perform at so go easy fer the first one eh but she exclaimed but never got past the word instead she picked up and put down each of the songs in turn finally mags got weary of it come out of there he ordered giving her his hand leave them things on floor well settle this for ye bewildered she took his hand and got up he handed her off to bear who walked her over to a chair and made her sit down he looked around and finally picked up a bit of broken pot closing his eyes he tossed it straight up to the ceiling it landed on the floor with a clatter then bounced about and ended up on one of the music manuscripts he picked the manuscript up and handed it to lena there he said firmly thas it thas what yell do but seriously lena they are all good pieces and you do all of them well any of them will do and it might as well be that one bear said with just an edge of exasperation showing in his voice lena sighed all right youre right it might as well hey mags offered look at it thisa way nobodys gonna be lobbin balls at yer head i wish they would she said so mournfully that both he and bear laughed and then they had to fall all over themselves apologizing for her hurt feelings they were still apologizing when amily arrived hobbling along on her bad leg with her crutch to assist her now what have you two done she asked looking from their faces to lenas mags held the door open for her oh never mind listen i just learned something you all need to know mags helped her to a chair and they all gathered around her given the mix of excitement and alarm in her voice the importance of what she was going to say probably transcended any hurt feelings you know that fuss that was raised late this afternoon she asked bear and lena nodded mags only shook his head practice he pointed out an then i come straight here after dinner well it was trade envoys from seejay arriving amily said breathlessly all of them frowned since that was where the troublemakers of the winter had and they were shocked to hear that there had been trade envoys from seejay here this winter she continued especially since those envoys didnt come with a royal charter mags sucked on his lower lip well wed already reckoned they wasnt what they said they was he pointed out so what was they amily shook her head the new envoys didnt know lady adethas daughteryou know the one thats so good at drawing and paintingwas even called to bring the sketches shed made of them while they were here and the envoys didnt recognize them not at all and their clothing was nothing like what these new envoys are wearing by tomorrow this is going to be all over the place mags and people are going to be asking questions all over again of course they are mags sighed because there was one big question that no one had been able to answer why had that crazed assassin taken one look at him and exclaimed you arent supposed to be here sure enough first thing in the morning even before breakfast a page from the palace was tapping on his door hed been expecting it of course rolan had warned dallen who had gotten him up early hed put on his best set of ordinary grays and followed the page up to the palace in a state of dread and resignation he was ushered into a small room crowded with people there was a throne there and the king was on it he was surrounded by guardsmen bristling with weapons and resentment and besides the guardsmen nikolas and the entire council were there and so was a group of dignified looking men and one woman all in long robelike garments that at first glance were very unimpressive until you realized at second glance that the subdued colors of their garments were woven in patterns so intricate that mags had never seen anything like them in his life and the threads that composed the fabric could not possibly have been thicker than a human hair one thing was certain their costumes looked nothing at all like those of the arrogant merchant princes who had so abused the crowns hospitality they all studied him as he stood there awkwardly everyone studied him the guards studied him in a way that suggested that some of them hoped he might try and bolt so that they could bring him down well my lords the king said when the uncomfortable silence had stretched on for far far too long is beink chust ordinary boy highness one of the envoys said with a shrug is lookink nossink like anyone ve know uff not like some notorious assassin infamous thief mags almost cast a sharp glance at the king for even if his councilors didnt detect the edge of sarcasm to his words mags certainly did he is not beink look effen like native of our land nor those around it the envoy said firmly he is beink little and dark and ve are beink large and golden well that was certainly true he is not beink look like shinain either the woman observed they are beink dark but tall werry tall the king spread his hands and turned to his councilors there you see this only proves that the real envoys from seejay dont recognize this trainee as looking like anyone they know majesty said the seneschal with reluctance and we still do not know where the false envoys came from and i prefer to believe that poor mags is the victim of that old saw that everyone has a double somewhere nikolas put in the king laughed the most likely explanation that comes to my mind is that we dont actually know what the assassin thought he saw the man was mad and he might have been hallucinating for all we know he looked at mags and saw his brother his mother or his worst enemy and how likely is that the seneschal asked pulling on his beard a little very likely the head of the healers circle had been mostly hidden by the others until he spoke hallucinations of this sort are a common component of a deep level of insanity there are even cases of people murdering beloved members of their families convinced that the people trying to help them are mortal enemies or demonic entities i have known of sufficiently mad women who murdered their own infants certain that the children had been taken away and demons left in the cradle im satisfied the king said you can go trainee mags thank you for coming mags bowed himself out hastily so far as he was concerned he couldnt get out of that room fast enough the team was waiting for him in the corridor though not looking particularly anxious well that was the advantage of being grays your companions kept you abreast of what was going on thank goodness pip punched him lightly on the arm and gennie threw him a smile but nobody said anything until they all got inside and were seated so asked bear he told them what had happened or more precisely what had not happened gennie raised her eyebrows well thats interesting but it doesnt prove or disprove anything except that those men were lying and we already knew that mags noddedthen thought of something mebbe one thing they didn seem ter recognize me nor think i looked like summun else true true said pip hmm well put this in a logic tree pip began tracing an invisible diagram on the table with his finger the real envoys didnt recognize mags the fakes didnt recognize mags but they did know him after being here a while the assassin who was working with the fakes did why could be weve been looking at this all backwards halleck said slowly well theres three possibilities the first is what the healer said he was out of his head thats the likeliest and he could have thought mags was anybody i mean youre not supposed to be here that sound more like what someone says when he sees someone who really isnt supposed to be there that its impossible for the person he thinks he sees to be there all right and the other two pip prompted as mags listened intently it could be the killer was from somewhere else and actually recognized mags as looking like someone he knew but then you have to wonder why he was working for the fakes and how they found him so the next likeliest is that the fakes told him about mags the killer went and had a look at him did everything he could to keep mags from finding bear and when he did anyway had that reaction thats even more likely if he was expecting the fakes to get rid of mags after all bear is mags best friend if there was anyone likely to fight like a wildcat to save him it would be mags so obviously you wouldnt want mags to find him pip nodded and theres nothing mysterious or sinister about that why would the fakes wanta get rid a me mags askedthen answered his own question because i shamed em theyre bullies and fellers like that likes t get even exactly pip spread his hands easy explanation and you know what they say the simplest answer is generally the right one he grabbed a plate of bacon and began shoveling it onto the plates of the others so lets eat im starving well let the nags discuss it among themselves then pass it off to their chosen nag i heard that it was as if the gods were trying to muck up his life as badly as possible the timing for this could not possibly have been worse but hed promised and he wasnt going to go back on a promise especially not now as always the team was waiting for him to escort him into lunch he approached them with his head hunched down they werent going to like this wheres lena and bear asked gennie craning her neck to see if they were somewhere in the corridor behind him mags took a deep breath lena got bumped on her contest shes comin up right now an bear got called away that councilor chamjey is spposed t be answerin charges an he took sick reglar healers cant make heads nor tails of it an they called bear so hes down in city we both promised lena wed be watchin her contest he trailed off just as herald setham approached their table mags dallen said you needed to speak with me mags blurted it all out a second time soi know tis practice he said desperately but hang all that lenas our friend too said gennie her eyes flashing herald setham well make up the practice after supper permission for the team to support trainee lena setham snorted youd be damn poor friends if you hadnt asked for it of course mags heart leaptgennie slapped him on the back and the group of them surged down the hall and out the door if anyone had been taking notes how they surged might have given them pause for they moved as a unit without anyone getting in anyone elses way they really were a team more and more as time went on they arrived at the assembly hall where the contest was taking place mags was the first one in and he knew immediately that lena was in trouble the hall was absolutely silent and lena stood whitefaced on the stage clutching a lapharp with all eyes turned to her expectantly and it was clear she couldnt move she was terrified and she had forgotten the words of what she was supposed to sing and mags saw why at a single glace right in front sitting at the judges table was her father bard tobias marchand looking unutterably bored as if there was anywhere in the world he would rather be than there which was probably the case oh bloody hell he didnt even think he just acted gathered his mind and shouted at her lena she jumped a little unfroze and her eyes darted frantically around the room until he caught and held her gaze deep breath he said close yer eyes convulsively she did both were here th whole teams here were bhind ye nowles make out like ye meant t start this way deep breath she gulped in another he didnt say a thing about her father the last thing he wanted to do was make her freeze up again now quiet real quiet make em strain t hear ye when rose the polestar bright she knew the song of course it was the midwinter song everyone knew the song shed probably have points deducted for choosing so common a song but that was better than failing because she froze her voice whispered out over the crowd sweet a little melancholy soft sweet enough that though it was scarcely more than a whisper people leaned forward to hear her with each verse as each of the birds in the song added its voice to the midwinter call her voice strengthened and finally with her eyes still closed she added the fingering of the harp to the song as she came to the final verse her voice soaring in triumphant rejoicing over the notes that fell like drops of melting ice in the warmth of the newly risen sun from the rear the team broke out in wild applause joined a heartbeat afterwards by the rest of the room now she opened her eyes caught mags gaze and mouthed the words thank you then she flushed and ran off the stage before the judges could dismiss her all right setham said as the applause subsided thats over with and there is still plenty of time for practice move out team south quick time to the field lets see those heels of yours yes sir they all said and hustled out of the room before he decreed any penalty for the last one on the field it was a particularly spirited practice and one in which mags was moving too fast to even think about lena or bear the rest of the team played with exceptional energy and exuberance and it was clear that they all were taking credit for lenas performance damn right they should he swelled with pride over it she had seen them and he knew it had made a difference to her shed been able to forget her father for a moment when she realized the entire team was there for her not just him and beareven herald setham she wasnt going to get great marks for this he was pretty sure about that she wouldnt have fooled any of the judges about her stagefright and she hadnt managed to unfreeze enough to play the harp until the end the song itself was simple and didnt show off much of anything except her lovely voice no she wasnt going to come in at the top of the contest but she wouldnt be at the bottom either when practice finished they discovered that herald setham sent up the hill for food to replace the luncheon none of them had eaten swigging flasks of sweet cold tea and munching on sausage rolls they headed back up to the collegium for their next classes or duties all of them looking forward to seeing lena at supper mags was a little delayed by a note from amily asking him to meet her in the heraldic archives and by the time he got to the dining hall the team had surrounded lena though bear was nowhere in sight i cant believe you came out in the middle pip was exclaiming indignantly you were so much better than that bard that sang at my sisters wedding well its a really common song lena said shyly and went on to explain everything that mags had already figuredgiven how often she had told over the scoring method to him and bear i still dont think they scored you fairly pip grumbled and spotted mags heyla lets get in there those sausage rolls are wearing thin and its beef night the room was full of bardic trainees all of them ravenous mags had a feeling that lena was not the only one whod had an uncertain stomach before the contest several of them still looked a bit green some looked triumphant or smug some looked depressed lena excused herself for a moment and went over to console several of the depressed ones who had tucked themselves together around an outoftheway table after a moment gennie joined her and soon had them laughing when they both returned and the group took the usual table mags gave the girls a look that invited explanation gennie grinned broadly you lot remember that incident with the presentation to the king she asked pip rolled his eyes i thought you ordered us never to talk about that again he replied mockingly i ordered you never to talk about it again she said thumping him lightly on the top of the head and if you do there will be a reckoning well thats a double standard if ever i heard one pip grumbled gennie turned to mags its pretty simple i was supposed to present a cup of wine to the king when i was a first year at a thing where he was supposed to be giving out prizes for students with poor parents that had been sponsored up here by people like councilor soren i got all tonguetied then my feet followed my tongue i tripped and spilled it all over his whites red wine of course pip smothered a laugh she reached out without looking and thumped him again gor that must a bin mags shook his head he could just imagine it ida gotten sick on is boots t cap it off i nearly did and that is why the king never drinks anything but water and white wine in public even though he loathes white wine she said ruefully and now here you are the captain of the team south kirball players said halleck well yes she shrugged you muddle through somehow well i wish someone would help me muddle through said bear coming wearily up to the table i hope one of you saved me some beef theres nothing left on the table but burnt ends wordlessly mags pushed over the heaping plate hed reserved for bear it was cold but bear didnt seem to care he just slapped it between two breadends smothered it in hotroot sauce and tucked in what happened lena asked bear groaned around a bite i am mortal sorry i missed your contest but i got called away midmorning and ive been at excouncilor chamjeys house since he was supposed to answer to the council about those charges what charges asked gennie looking surprised ma began bear and cut off as mags kicked him under the table fortunately pip was more caught up on court doings than gennie was he was profiteering or trying to because of a bad season and a sheep disease pip replied looking a little smug that he knew something gennie didnt he basically cornered the market on mutton lamb and especially wool the way he had it if youd wanted wool this year youd have been buying it from him or not at all at his prices he resigned but when the council looked into things and discovered just how much he was going to profit and how much it was going to hurt some of the other guilds they decided to bring him up on charges huh gennie shook her head now thats something i dont understand cause no one would have faulted him for finding all this stuff out and making a reasonable profit but no he had to get greedy whats the point so what happened pip asked bear who washed down an enormous bite with sweetened tea before replying well he got sick they brought in a good healer who couldnt find anything other than that he wasnt faking he was bad sick too so they finally brought me in i dosed him good with all kinds of things finally got him more or less cleaned out and resting and i used a lot of those medicines ive been making up for that medicine chest i was talking about but he looked like a beaten rug and i still hadnt found anything because he didnt have a fever or any other sign of a sickness well bear must have realized how raptly they were all listening to him because he stopped talking and deliberately took another bite and another and another well asked pip lena and halleck at the same time well looked to me like hed been poisoned he had all the same symptoms of someone thats gotten something like waspbitten by the time i saw him he was starting to swell up first thing i thought of was maybe something stung him but there werent any bites on him i asked the servants they swore he hadnt eaten nor drunk anything he didnt always have finally i went down to the kitchen and i got hold of his tray there wasnt anything poisonous on it theyd tested everything on a mouse on the first healers orders but thank goodness they had the wit not to wash stuff after thatthe cook told me she wasnt going to wash anything without direct orders he paused again for another couple of bites mags got the feeling he was really enjoying this and mags didnt blame him in the least by this point the tables on either side of them were full of people leaning their way to eavesdrop so said pip gennie and someone else at the next table so i asked the cook if there was anything she was supposed to keep away from chamjey oh kernos love you duckie she said just the hint of chamomile makes him go all over green and hes on the chamberpot for a day so i checked the teacup and the teapot he grinned plain old mint in the teapotbut just a scraping of chamomile in the cup along with the mint might look like just leaves to anyone else but not to me bugger tried to poison himself to get out of trouble i went up told the healer in charge who told the guards who searched the room and chamjey and found bits of chamomile flowers in his pocket bear gennie exclaimed that is excellent ferreting work a herald couldnt have done it better bear blushed and grinned he blushed even harder when lena beamed wordlessly at him im mortal sorry i missed yer contest lena he concluded apologetically it took me a whole lot longer to do all that stuff than to tell about it im glad you missed it she exclaimed her eyes bright im glad because you just proved you can do things nobody else here can do youre a hero uh bear said blushing and tonguetied mags just hid a smile chapter i cant blieve its finally spring mags sighed as the sun baked his shoulders with gentle warmth i thought itd be winter ferever even though he was down in haven in the street there were still hints of growing things in the breeze and flowersellers on the street everyone seemed just a little bit more cheerful too and a bit less impatient for a while there so did i dallen replied mags got a mental glimpse of dallen blissfully prone in a bed of young clover basking in the sun enjoy this while you can spring is a treacherous creature tomorrow it could be pouring down rain that is near ice or we could be graced with a blizzard or well who knows we might end up witn a threeday flood dont i jest know it he said ruefully such reversals of weather were all too familiar to the mine workers and he never trusted the smiling face of a spring day until summer was within reach he had spent far too many days working the sluices in rain that was just barely above freezing or worse in one of those unexpected snowstorms those were times when the only advantage to wearing nothing but a few rags for clothing was that they dried on your body faster when you got out of the wet ah but todaytoday was the closest he had been to contented since the foreseers began spreading their tales six days of the week there were classes but not the seventh there was no kirball practice eithernot that he would have objected to practicing but herald setham wanted a day off as well so that meant that like most of the trainees the seventh day was one that was all his to spend as he liked lately that had been holed up in his room studying however today herald nikolas had a long round of discreet errands that needed to be run down in havenmostly messages to be handdelivered but a few items to be fetched from shopsand he had asked mags to run them that had sounded just fine to mags a day like this one begged to be enjoyed and the best way for him to enjoy something was to get as far away from people who recognized him as possible the errands took mags out of the grounds of the collegia and away from all those people who were still thinking daggers at him there were a disheartening number who still were despite everything that his kirball teammates and even the king had said and done down here in the city no one knew who he washe would have been just another trainee if he had chosen to wear grays which he hadnt actually nikolas wanted him to be mostlyinvisible and that had meant not dressing in his grays hed left dallen behind and dressed in a set of clothing hed gotten a couple weeks ago as a handmedown from marc very good quality clothing though a bit worn nothing to be ashamed of nothing that marked him as out of the ordinary all in various shades of brown he blended in so perfectly with the folk in the street that he was practically impossible to pick out from the rest of the crowd exactly the way he and nikolas wanted it nikolas had not given him a timeframe for these errands which meant that he was free to spend the entire day in the city if he chose he was running some errands for amily as well which gave him even more of an excuse to stay down here among minds that were not wishing him elsewhere for the better part of the day later he could catch up with bear and lena maybe assuming bear and lena were not together that was another reason for running the errands he could take a hint even when they thought nobody knew how much they liked each other but they themselves well it was pretty obvious to everyone else today would be a perfect day for a picnic and before they could hem and haw about whether or not to invite him he had disinvited himself and nearly gave the game away by laughing at the guilty relief on both of their faces that was another small bright spot he was very very glad that they were getting on so well he had spent the morning on the errands that required he pick up things for nikolas this meant getting a number of small mysterious wrapped packages at various merchants around the city im here for master whites parcel he would say having practiced the phrase over and over and carefully enunciating each word so as not to give himself away with his crude way of speaking and his dreadful accent instead he sounded a bit slow which was quite all right there was nothing wrong with being a bit slow when it came to impersonating a servant a parcel would be produced he would put it in his carrybag and go on to the next item to be picked up hed more or less mapped all of these things out in advance interspersing amilys requests with those of her father that way if against all odds someone actually was watching him the pattern of errands would make no sense amilys errands were much more straightforward and not at all mysterious he picked up more wool for her knitting brought a bit of wool to match and stood by while the shopowner and her two assistants combed over all the skeins to find the closest he got some scented candles at a chandler she specified a quire of paper a pot of a particular sort of black ink and another of red bookbinding glue and a cone of spiced nuts only found at one particular confectioner in the entire city that last had amused him now he would know what to get her if he wanted to buy her a little present andshe wanted soap she didnt specify where or what so the first thing he thought was the soapmaker who had been so helpful in the matter of listening in on councilor chamjey it was a long walk and a good bit out of the way of the other errandsbut that didnt matter in the least not for amily he was not exactly an expert on soap but he had liked the scents there the shop had looked very good and the soapmaker had asked he remember her up to the collegia which argued that she thought her goods were of high enough standard besides he wanted to see if he could be really inconspicuous without dallen would the soapmaker recognize him he was considerably less ragged than the last time she had seen him then he had been dressed in a suitable fashion for an ashboy now he was dressed in a suitable fashion for a middleclass fellow running errands for a sister or for the servant of someone really well off he considered what sort of soap he should get as he made his way through the increasingly crowded streetsfor everyone else seemed to want to be out in the fine weather as well today if he were a servant or a brother he would surely have been sent with exact orders on what to buy he eeled his way between two carts that were blocking a lane and decided to go the easiest route dallen what sorta soap does amily want rolan would probably know or maybe dallen could tell somehow without asking rolan she always smells of lily the answer came back promptly and nikolas seems to favor juniper since she didnt say whether to get soap for her or her father i would say get soap for both trust his companions sharp nose and it was true she hadnt said whom she wanted the soap for if he got it for both of them that would make him look quite considerate that was no bad thing since well he rather wanted to get on with amily himself he made his way in a leisurely fashion to the soapmaker drifting with the crowd rather than trying to push through it and absorbing the sights sounds and smells you could easily tell where you were in haven by your nose it wasnt just places like the tanners and dyers which had very strong smells indeed you could tell where sausages and smoked meats were made or sold where laundries were where inns were and what kind and class of inn it happened to be you could tell a lot of things if you paid attention his soapmaker was in the middle of a number of small shops that mostly dealt in household goods it was on a side street and since the doors and windows were open the mingled scents of the soap drifted to the end of the block spring meant cleaning which meant scrubbing floors and a lot of laundry in the form of hangings and curtains which meant that the soapmaker was very crowded indeed she was mostly selling plain brown unscented laundry soap of the lowest quality harsh stuff full of lye that made your hands dry out and the skin crack if you kept you hands in the water for too long mags remembered that very well spring at the mine had meant the little housemaids going about with sore and bleeding hands since master cole was not minded to waste lotions and salves on the servants and slaveys but this was the stuff that bleached the best and so it was in great demand even in the best households the queue of shoppers stretched right out the door which argued that this soapmaker was quite good indeed he stood in line with the rest of those waiting to be served and when his turn came asked carefully and quietly for a half a pound each of juniper and lily the woman gave him an odd look as if she almost recognized him but the press of customers was far more urgent than her need to chase down that nagging memory as it happened lily and juniper were not so common that she was sold out of soap already cut and wrapped and she fetched two cakes from the appropriate niches in the wall behind her he paid her she gave him the soap in neatly wrapped packages and he made way for the next customer without any further flashes of recognition there were two more little packages to get for nikolas and then the fetching part of his errandround was over one he got at a blacksmith the other at a maker of extremely delicate carving tools strange very strange he couldnt imagine what it was that nikolas would need at either of those places but if nikolas had wanted him to know what he was getting he would have been told are you still basking he asked dallen the only answer he got was a sort of drowsy murmur which pretty much told him that the answer was yes with a laugh he began the long trudge back up to the palace on foot don ferget im gonna need you to get i the gates right dallen woke up enough to come for him just as he got within eyesight of the palace walls which was a good thing since dallens presence said he belongs here without having to produce any sort of verification the guards didnt even look at him twice on the first pleasant free day since winter descended trainees were riding into and out of the grounds all day and not necessarily in their grays so he blended in just fine he left the satchel of packages in nikolas quarters and thought about stopping for luncheon at the dining hall rather than spend one of his rare coins down in the city then thought better of the idea he wouldnt have his team with him today they had scattered to the four winds which meant there were good odds of unfriendly faces and minds in the halland seeing him without his group around him theyd probably take advantage of the situation no getting something from a streetcart seemed like a better idea today are you going to need me dallen asked as he came out of the building that housed the heralds wing didja wanta come with me or lollygag round the field some more he countered dallen snorted lollygag me i merely want to chase fillies gotcha he chortled at the indignant look on dallens face you jest stay here i figger on takin mtime bout this the errands that nikolas had him running nowdropping off a series of sealed messagescould not possibly take more than two or three candlemarks he had the entire afternoon to himself already he felt his shoulders loosening his spine uncoiling from that hunchedover posture hed been assuming without really thinking about it he knew that posture for it had been the posture he had held for years the posture that meant he was waiting for the blow to fall the inevitable inescapable blow back at the mine that meant the cuff to the back of the head the strike of a stick to the shoulders for nothing more than catching someones eye here at the collegium the blows might not have been physical but they certainly had been felt over the past moon eh well i kin enjoy tday an try an figger out what them foreseers really are seein or mebbe theyll see somethin more an ill be outa it since nikolas had entrusted him and not someone else with the delivery of these messages he assumed that the kings own was probably concerned at least a little that a royal page might be followed so just to err on the side of caution he deliberately began to wander he had done so merely by fact of interspersing amilys errands with those of her father earlier now he actually put some effort into it he began up among the mansions of the noble and wealthy some of them got messages but he stopped at others to flirt with kitchen maids admire a garden open for viewing or discuss the points of a horse with a groom when he got down into the city he got himself a sausage roll in one place a pint of cider in another a slice of cheese at a cheeseshop he shopped a little picking up dried apple slices dusted with spice for dallen a neat little ink blotter for amily and a strap of pretty woven stuff that lena could use on her gittern from a streetpeddler he went in no particular direction reversing himself often until by the time he had delivered the last message he had doubled back on himself so many times that he was surprised he hadnt met himself on the way at that point he relaxed further and simply sauntered along stopping to look at whatever caught his eye once it was a clever little dog who had figured out how to steal from dried fish vendors by sneaking under the ample skirts of some of the shoppers and getting within toothrange of the fish that way once it was a juggler who had set up on the corner and would literally juggle anything you threw at him and when mags threw him an apple he not only juggled it he ate it while he juggled which earned him a great deal of laughter and applause then suddenly something else caught his eye he stiffened involuntarily not sure he had seen who he had thoughtbut a second glimpse through the crowd cemented the identification he would know that profile anywhere it was one of the bodyguards who had been with the fake envoys here everyone assumed that when the lot of them had escaped the palace they had left valdemar but what if they hadnt what if they hadnt even left haven now here he was quite by accident encountering the man and most importantly the man hadnt spotted him dallen sensed his alarm before he actually said anything mags came the urgent call whats wrong in answer mags let the companion see through his eyes and caught dallens recognition tell rolan t tell nikolas he said urgently im gonna foller im ill stay outer sight but we caint chance losin em again a moment later dallen answered nikolas agrees be careful heh like ima gonna rush up t the man an ask im ever so politelike why e had bear kidnapped aye that there is a fantastic notion the difference between following this fellow and following chamjey was that mags knew the feel of chamjeys mind this mans mindwell without actually reading his thoughts and getting inside it was like the mind of pretty much anyone in the streets here that had a sword and knew how to use it there was a lot of arrogance and restrained aggression mags hadnt had enough time yet to discern what made it unique and with having to concentrate on keeping close yet out of sight he wasnt going to get the leisure to do so he had to fight his instincts in order to do as nikolas had taught him his instincts told him that as soon as the man turned toward him he should duck out of sight he didnt do that the man was a trained fighter and would alert on that sort of movement no when the man turned to check his rear he had to be doing something perfectly natural watching a busker reading an inn sign drifting off at a slight angle to the mans current direction as if he intended to visit a shop or take a side street then when the man turned away again mags did something to change his own appearance a little he bought a drab scarf at a stall and when the mans attention was elsewhere he switched how he was wearing it putting it around his neck tying up his hair making a headband out of it even a sling all these things seemed to be working the man only gave cursory glances behind him and his eyes never lingered on mags they were heading to the part of the city where beastdrovers and small traders of the sort with a single cart went it was crowded there the more so because it was getting on to supper time and people unfamiliar with havenor who were simply frugalwere going from inn to inn hunting for bargains for their evening meal every inn had a different specialsometimes it was because they had made too much of something that day sometimes because they got a good deal on some foodstuff or other the smart traveler sought these out to save a few pennies mags felt as if every nerve was stretched as thin and tight as one of lenas harpstrings the closer they came to this inndistrict he felt sure that the man was staying here somewhereand maybe there were more of the foreigners than just the one mags tried to vary his posture as well as his appearanceeven his gait although in the crush that was less than successful but when the scarf was on his head he slouched as if discouraged when it was a sling he limped when it was around his neck he swaggered the bawling of animals in enclosures the cursing of the drovers people being shoved out of the way and cursing backyou would have to shout at the top of your lungs to be heard in this din it was all a nightmare of noise and heat and dust and smell dung and sweat stink mingled with food and beer odors making him feel a little sick it was very hard to keep up with the man without shoving and making himself conspicuous he had to take advantage of his small size and duck through every available gap and still keep track of the man the man definitely had a goal in mind thoughhis movements were purposeful and a bit impatient mags was more and more certain by the moment that he was staying somewhere in this district this part of haven was absolutely full of people who were strangers to the city and to each other innkeepers didnt bother to keep track of anyone so long as the reckonings got paid and you werent crowding more people into a room than you had paid for he realized that this was exactly what the foreigners needed incurious landlords and a steady stream of strangers coming and going even in the dead of winter this district had a fair amount of traffic haven was a big city and there were a lot of mouths to feed more than could be fed purely by the effort of the local farms maybeprobablytheyd found a place to hide until things in haven got back to normal after the blizzard there were plenty of places in haven that would have sheltered them plenty of people as well and not necessarily criminals either they could have posed as stranded travelers and stayed at a temple hostel for instance or they might have thought far enough ahead and arranged for a bolthole down in the city when they had first arrived they could even have done so through an intermediary who probably wouldnt have cared what nationality they were as long as their gold was sound the inns here would have been better though for people not used to waiting on themselves nor taking care of their own daytoday needs like finding food and cleaning their own clothing all they gotta do is move from inn t inn regular an theyre pretty much not gonna get noticed inns would do virtually anything you wanted for a price presumably they had the price he hung back a little it was actually easier to keep track of the man now because he was pushing his way through the crowd creating a little area of disturbancesomething else nikolas had taught mags to watch for he followed that area until he actually saw the man mount the steps of an enormous drovers innthe silver bullock he gave the fellow some time to get away from the door and sauntered inside himself he almost had his heart stop when he realized the man he had been following was still in the common room but he steeled himself to show nothing instead peering around the room as if to try and find something then fixing an aha look on his face when he spotted the bar he went up to it ordered a pint and then ostensibly looked around for a place to sit there were several within earshot of the man he had been following the best was a single stool against the wall he wound his way toward it and sat himself down fixing his gaze on a sturdy serving wench and sipping the potent beer clearly it was spring beer from the bottom of the barrel it tasted strong enough to use for brasspolish as such things went though it was decent the commonroom here was clean and wellrun and the food smelled all right he kept his eyes on the rest of the patrons of the inn and his face in a faintly pleasant expression meanwhile he strained his ears as hard as he could to overhear the conversationit was in valdemaran and the man that the foreigner was talking to seemed to be local the two of them were making no effort to hold their voices down so obviously they didnt care if they were overheard need more help than i can get from pothecaries with the crazy one the native valdemaran was saying the honest ones wont sell me what youre asking me to get and the others he shrugged you take your chances maybe theyll sell you what you want maybe theyll sell you poison or dried grass maybe theyll tell the guard youve been asking for those herbs theres just no telling the foreigner muttered something that sounded like a curse there must be something you can tie him up and gag him when you arent feeding him you can keep him dead drunk and hope that doesnt kill him you can just let him rave so it sounded as if the fellow that bear was treating was still with them they were probably trying to get hold of the same herbs that bear had been using nikolas has alerted some of the guard were on the way are there any heralds or trainees nearer to me down ere he really didnt like the nakedfeeling of being in this inn with no one else nearby were alerting them maybe needing someone to treat the lunatic was why they had kidnapped bear and maybe the reason they had kept him in the archive was because they had no place else to put him and they needed things to clear out after the blizzard before they could escape it would have been very hard to move a prisoner and their raving lunatic quietly until the snow cleared off maybe they had been hoping no one would bother coming to the archive maybe they had figured on drugging bear and smuggling him out with their baggage maybe a sudden shout of unknown words made him glance to the side with alarm and there not more than the length of a horse and wagon away from him was another of the bodyguards one of the ones who he had humiliated and who was not likely to have forgotten his face the man shouted again and pointed at him as the one he had been following shoved the valdemaran aside and reached for a knife oh hell run mags he didnt have to be told twice in fact he didnt have to be told at all he was already on his feet and heading for a door he expected led to the kitchen it did with at least one of the two men practically on his heels mags ducked between two serving girls rolled under a table on a floor littered with vegetable peelings scrambled to his feet and was out the door on the other side of the room before one of the two girls had finished her shriek of outrage and alarm the door led to a narrow hallway with two more doors in it he gambled and wrenched open the farthest he found himself standing on a set of steps above a brickwalled space used for storing things for the kitchen that werent wanted yet and could stand weather and for buckets of garbage the place stank and was full of flies there was a wooden gate opposite him with a lock on it hell he made a running leap for the gate his fingers just caught the top and he hauled himself over it as the door behind him banged open again he tumbled down into the alley on the other side and looked wildly in either direction and realized he had no idea of where he was he picked a direction and ran he was in the middle of a ratwarren of walls and outbuildings and alleys going off in every direction with huge walls and the sides of buildings on either side of him the alleys were too narrow to allow anything better than the tiniest of donkeycarts to go by and he could feel his pursuers right behind him there was no time to think no time to do anything other than react he dodged down every promising escape route he could find only to discover he was still in the maze he felt dallen trying frantically to get to him but it was a long way down from the collegium and the streets were packed he made another turn his sides burning and found himself in a culdesac of windowless walls going up two stories on either side of him at the back there was a brickedup privyaperture right above him he turned but it was too late there was a man blocking the entrance the same man that had recognized mags and shouted he was one of the bodyguards very big strong and trained and armed which mags wasnt mags rushed the man anyway maybe if he took the bodyguard by surprise he dropped and rolled when he was almost on top of the man hoping to knock his feet out from under them but the foreigner must have been ready for that the man dodged and out of nowhere there was a tremendous thwack to mags head and he saw stars then felt himself hauled to his feet by the collar and pinned to the wall by his shoulders the look in the mans eyes absolutely terrified him because it was both furious and utterly impersonal you horseboy spat the bodyguard what are you doing here how did you find us who sent you i don know nothin mags began and the man delivered a blow to his gut that doubled him over and a second to his face that opened up a painful gash along his cheek the pain that went through his body and skull drove all thought right out of his head who sent you the man repeated i don this time the blow to his gut was followed by a slam into the wall that rammed his head against it he saw stars again and his vision grayed out he could hardly breathe tell me the bodyguard spat and slammed his head into the wall again he couldnt even think well enough to defend himself you will tell me a blow to the jaw loosened his teeth as well and his mouth filled with blood the trumpeting of an enraged stallion interrupted the interrogation and the man whirled dropping mags who slid down the wall and slumped to the dirt of the alley dazed dallens bulk filled the end of the alley the companion shrieked with rage dancing in place but unable to wedge himself into the narrow space the man spat a curse and wrestled his sword out banging it against the walls on either side of him he plunged at dallen in a fury dallen lashed out at him with forehooves but had to give way the man must have practiced fighting against a warhorse if not a companion because he kept dodging the lethal hooves and getting in closer and closer with his blows and it was clear he was aiming to slash open one of the big arteries or veins of the legs mags fought off the dizziness the dazzle in front of his eyes and the nausea and pain of the beating trying to get his breath again trying to get up and fight back after all this wasnt the first time someone had tried to beat him to deathand dallen needed him he fumbled for and found his knife as he had been taught he weighed it carefully in his hand for a precious moment squinting until the double images resolved into one he flung the little blade at the mans back the man howled and cursed in pain the knife lodged for a moment in his shoulderblade then clattered to the ground in a fury he looked from mags to dallen and back again and evidently realized that where there was one companion there soon would be more he turned back to dallen but this time the whirlwind strikes of his sword were meant to drive dallen back not to kill him the moment that dallens bulk was clear of the culdesac entrance he darted away mags dropped to his knees then doubled over again unable to decide what part of himself to hold since so much hurt he wished he could pass out unconsciousness would be very welcome right now unfortunately his body refused to cooperate mags the frantic call rang through his skull and made more stars explode behind his eyes donthink shard he gasped mentally hurts slowly he managed to get to his feet again with one hand on the wall and the other on his gut he stumbled to the entrance and fell against dallens neck dallen immediately knelt in the filth of the alley to let him drag himself over the companions back he put both his arms around dallens neck hanging on as best he could balanced on the broad white surface like a sack of roots dallen lurched to his feet without unbalancing mags then others will chase him came a whisper of thought i am getting you back up to the healers now and without another thought dallen sped grimly back up to the collegium with mags clinging dizzily to his neck sallright he managed as they were about halfway there been beat this bad aforewhas goin on the others are converging on the inn right now with the guard dallen said theyll try and catch the bastards shouldn we no we are doing nothing you have done enough you are in no shape to assist in any way at all dallen rushed through the gates passing guards that were nothing more than blue blurs to mags and into the collegia grounds im taking you to healers collegium dallen said when they didnt stop at either the stable or at heralds collegium finally dallen stopped they were met at the door by a single healer and by gennie and the flash of outrage in dallens mind that there was not a herd of healers waiting for them was enough to set stars dancing in front of mags vision again sorry dallen said and damped down the connection between them so that less was getting through but it was very clear that he was still enraged calm down the healer ordered wincing as gennie helped mags down off of dallens back hes one single trainee whos been beaten up hes neither bleeding to death inside nor has any broken bones i can tell you that much stop acting as if he was going to die at any moment you big fool dallen snorted and whinnied angrily as gennie held mags up so the healer could peel back his eyelids and peer into his eyes he has a mild concussion his insides are badly bruised but quite intact im sure he hurts all over stop fussing the healer snapped tol imbeen beat this bad afore mags managed and you shut up companion go to your stable trainee you are going straight to a bed give him a hand trainee gennie and both of you follow me with gennie keeping him from falling over mags followed the healer into a part of the collegium he had never been beforea big room with a great many beds in it most of them empty gennie helped him down onto the nearest one then when the healer started to strip mags clothing off of him flushed crimson and beat a hasty retreat the healer peeled everything off him but his boots singlet and hose tossing the clothing aside that companion of yours could stand to have better manners he grumbled its not as if youre the only sick or injured person here right now mags thought about saying something but his jaw hurt too much to move in fact everything hurt more and more the longer he sat here he winced as the healers hands moved over his body probing the places where the blows had fallen then he sighed with relief as the hands rested on those spots as warmth poured from the hands and the relief from pain followed the warmth your assailant has done this before the man said laconically he was quite methodical about inflicting the most pain while doing the least damage s thet good mags asked as the room started to spin in circles around him uh i dunnofim gonna be sick the mans hands rested on his head a moment and some of the dizziness cleared away and with it the nausea well it isnt bad for you the healer said it means most of this is soft tissue damage and i can tend it myself without help one decent night and a day of rest and youll be fit to go right out and kirball to your hearts content yes yes i know you are on one of the kirball teams and i am very much aware that your captain wants you ready for the first game and you will be but not until you get that day and night so a hand to the middle of his chest shoved mags down onto the bed he wasnt expecting it and fell right over you need time for that concussion to clear up and a number of medicines and some more healing you can talk to whosoever you want but you stay there until tomorrow afternoon maybe even until the next morning if i decide i have the time to continue treating you and you need it mags blinked up at the man owlishly at least there was only one of him now not two dinner he said hopefully for now that the nausea had begun to ebb his stomach was growling the healer lost that irritated look and chuckled youre a resilient rascal i think that can be managed he tucked blankets in around mags and left him with a pitcher of water and a cup on a little table beside him drink as much of that as you canwhat i do tends to release a lot of nasty things that need to be purged out of you the privy is right on the other side of this wall someone will come around with food for you in a bit someone else will be checking on you all night several someones probably dont get up except to visit the privy youll find you are still dizzy if you do and i dont want you undoing what i did by falling with that the healer left i was listening are you sure you are going to be all right dallen asked anxiously if that healer is neglecting youif you are really hurt im fine mags reassured him lying back and closing his eyes because the room still had an unsettling tendency to move a little es right dallen i didn get hurt that bad thanks to you whas goin on down i city they ketch em mags unspoken prayer that the heralds and guards had caught the phony envoys was answered in the negative no dallen replied sounding deflated no they ran they left behind their insane fellow but theres no sense to be gotten out of him mags sighed and cursed a little so they were back to where they had begun with nothing to show for it maybe bear can get something out of him dallen suggested or a really good mindspeaker and look on the bright side they are foreign maybe this is what the foreseers were on about mebbe hope so mags sighed hate t go through this jest t end up wi evone still angry at me fer something i aint done yet is it safe to come in asked gennie from a little distance away reckon mags said shortly because his jaw still hurt kin we talk like this surely that healer is the most terrifying man i have ever met in my life he heard gennie come in and felt her sit down on the side of the bed are you really going to be all right what happened was runnin errands down in city saw onea them phony envoybodyguards follered im had dallen tell nikolas acourse and nikolas said t keep follerin oho so thats why people went boiling down to the city gennie said i guess you got caught aye ran fer it got lost an got trapped reckon i was driven nowif ida been in their shoes ida learnt th alleys round where they was like i could run em blind cornered me in a place dallen couldnt fit you were lucky dont i know it he sighed least i kin say i was follerin orders proper his stomach growled and gennie patted his hand ill go get you some food something you can eat with a sore jaw thanks she came back shortly with soup mashed roots and a custard he managed to get his swollen and bruised eyes open enough to see to eat and about the time he finished the healer turned up again ah good this isnt the thing to take on an empty stomach unless you want it even emptier he handed mags a mug mags knew very well it was medicine it was probably going to taste nasty and that he might as well get it down in a hurry it wasnt as nasty as he thought in fact the healer had very considerately sweetened it with honey thenkee sor he managed the healer just grunted and sat down on the bed hold still im going to do something about those eyes and that jaw before i leave once again warmth spread out from the healers touch and drove the pain away mags sighed with relief and relaxed and the next thing he knew it was morning chapter morning was absolutely lovely his room in the stables didnt have glass panes only parchment and shutters and as cold as this winter had been he hadnt opened the shutters once every window in this big room had glass in it and he was right under an eastwardfacing one he woke with warmth soothing his battered face and just lay there enjoying it for a while slowly he managed to get his eyes open they werent as swollen as he thought they would be but he still couldnt get them open more than a slit still it was nice with sunlight pouring in the open window and now warming his bed as well as his face mags was feeling remarkably comfortable considering that his chest and belly were so black and blue it looked like hed had ink poured all over him and he didnt want to think about what his face looked like hed gotten off easy and he knew it only the fact that the foreigner had wanted to know who had sent him and what mags knew had kept the man from just taking out a sword or a knife and killing him on the spot he could have gotten away with it too before dallen got there strangely that realization didnt make mags feel frightened just grateful there were birds outside the window just ordinary creatures chirping cheerfully but caught up in the lassitude of this morning mags found it very pleasant to listen to whatever had been in that medicine that the healer had given him last night had left him still feeling pleasantly numbed and just sleepy enough to enjoy lying abed aside from the bruises of course he made a conscious effort not to move because moving still hurt quite a lot not moving was nice he even closed his eyes and dozed a little and woke up a second time only when a voice roused him usually when i see someone with two black eyes they tell me the other fellow looks even worse said bear making him open those blackened eyes and squint at him the young healertrainee was standing at the foot of his bed and peering at him somewhat anxiously through those thick lenses he looked as if he had been awake for several candlemarks already nope i barely nicked im mags admitted he wiggled his jaw a little it hurt but not nearly as much as last night least i kin talk this mornin bastard bout broke mjaw and tried t knock out teeth bear came close and peered at his face moving his head from side to side most of the swelling is gone from around your eyes or i doubt youd be able to open them he observed or at least so i surmise youll look like a ferret for a while but thats just looks and i am pretty sure we can do something about the bruising so you dont look like gennie beat you at the kirball game mags grunted m not xactly anybodys sweetheart reckon that bruisin won keep the girls away anymoren they already are i wouldnt count on that bear grinned youre something of a minor hero you spotted the bad fellow you had the courage to follow him and you moved in close to try and learn what you could plenty of people would have figured telling the other heralds was doing your duty enough following him to the right inn was going above that and going right inside isnt something i would have tried mind you dallen is a bigger hero e should be why thank you yer right there e saved mlife e came at that bugger een though the bastard was hackin at im right smart mags put up a hand to touch his puffy face and winced me all i did was get mface in th way of is fist the healer from last night came in behind bear and theatrically clutched at his chest dear gods no boasting i have a herald trainee in my care who isnt boasting about how bad his assailant looks mags got a better look at him now that there werent two of him medium height a sort of pleasantlyplain face brown hair brown eyes nothing very distinguishing about him other than an expression of sour weariness that looked as if it was habitual im sure his mother loves him said dallen sarcastically hush you i believe my heart will stop from the shock of such behavior modesty and good sense i dont believe i have ever had a patient like you before the healer concluded hello trainee bear you are just the person i was hoping to see have you any suggestions for me to help my patient look less like he landed face first in a vat of blackberries bear pursed his lips and looked just a little surprised aye a few leeches wont hurt draw off some of that blood thats in the bruises the healer nodded leeches it is if you want to run the treatment you have my permission i highly approve of things that dont require the gift me too mags said fervently like what f sommun was brought in so bad hurt e was tore up inside an yed wasted a mort a healin on me the healer looked surprised and gratified tell that to your companion would you the healer replied if he doesnt stop ambushing me whenever i step outside the collegium i am going to put in a strong recommendation that he be volunteered to haul firewood until youre on your feet and out of here i heard that ye been pretty rude he wasnt taking your condition seriously thats on account of it aint serious yessir mags said politely though the only reason he didnt laugh was because he knew it would hurt too much ill do the leeching sir bear said ive done it a lot then ill put in an order for the leeches thank you bear your breakfast is on the way trainee oh something you should know i think besides mindspeech you either have or are developing a bit of empathy as strong as your mindspeech is it probably wont be much but it might be useful to you to know you have it if your shields arent already handling it come see one of us about it uhm yessir said mags what else was he to say after all and bear whatever you care to give him i endorse the healers faintly sour expression had faded replaced by faint good humor yessir healer juran sir bear said and the healer bustled off stopping to check someone in a bed at the far end of the room before leaving through the door on that end off on some other urgent task mags gazed after him thoughtfully this was the first time hed actually been treated by a healer but hed watched a few and to tell the truth the mans straightforward sarcasm appealed to him i like im mags said e dont mess about i don like people what wont tell ye the truth i don mind him bein a bit sharp reckon heralds don make th best patients i like him too but theres plenty that dont bear replied like me came the sulky comment haul wood indeed hes good enough that i have the feeling he talks like that in order to keep troublesome patients away you know the ones that make out as if a bit of gout is going to kill them bear pulled back the covers to look at the bruises on mags belly how bad are you hurting bear continued cause between you and me i think you should sleep some more specially when i get the leeches they really make some people feel sick to look at i could sleep mags admitted idruther eat first though an i aint worrit bout leeches had worsen leeches where we all bedded down at th mine i reckon all manner of bugs and creepies rats runnin over ye in the middle of the night bear shuddered aye thats worse all right ill go make you a dose you can have it after you eat one of the healers collegium servants came in at that moment with a tray loaded down with soft foodsoatmeal soft eggs mashed apples and tea mags tucked into it while bear went off somewhere and came back with one of those mugs that always seemed to hold medicine and a pair of jars drink this and if you really want to watch ill start now bear said bear had not sweetened the stuff mags managed not to choke sure i wanta watch he said with some interest mebbe i kin use this sorta thing if i gotta out in the field so tell me whys ye do this bear fished a leech out of the jar and applied it carefully to a badly bruised and swollen part of mags belly the muscle gets all crushed blood goes in but cant get out that keeps things from healing as fast as they could the leech pulls it out watch mags watched as the ugly little bit of black slime swelled up to a fat little pod of black slime sated it detached itself bear caught it before it could fall into the blankets and dropped it in another jar it works really well where people have had fingers or toes crushed instead of brokenor well lots of things any time blood doesnt seem to be actually flowing sowhats it do now its full well go put them where they can go make babies now theyre fed bear said we try and breed our own so we know they come from clean water and dont have anything nasty about them look at where he was sure enough the area was less swollen and not as blue bear applied a few more mags watched them fascinated this is why some people call a healer especially one that doesnt have a gift a leech bear went on animal healers use leeches too huh there was actually something rather appealing about the idea that this ugly little thing could help a person heal without a gift you gonna put those on mface too aye if you dont mind he yawned i don mind but im feelin like i oughta get flat thatll help the leeches too bear said catching one that was full and dropping it in the jar giving it an oddly fond look huzzah leeches good fer ye mags said muzzily waiting until bear had taken the last one off his belly and chest and scooting down in the bed go make lotsa liddle leeches bear laughed and he closed his eyes he didnt actually sleep more like drowsed as bear worked he definitely felt bear put the leeches on his skin they were cool when they first were put on but quickly warmed up to his temperature there was a kind of pinpicking sensation he wouldnt even have noticed against the general ache of his bruises if he hadnt been concentrating on seeing what it felt like then there was a numbing feeling and no more pinprick sensations he thought about it and decided that the leeches were probably doing the numbing themselves after all it was in their interest to make you not feel it when they were biting you and sucking your blood all done bear said at last rousing him out a lethargic dreamy state you still awake you look a lot better kinda he mumbled he opened his eyes with an effort it felt as if he could open them more now he blinked at bear who smiled at him so ye know what happen down i haven thet crazy feller they found him tied down to a bed in that inn when they broke into the rooms the men had been renting the guards brought him up here and hes worse than before bear replied shaking his head i dont know what his socalled friends were dosing him with but it wasnt doing him any good hes down to skin and bones and raving just as badly as ever besides that hes suffering from not having whatever drug they were giving him and the mindspeakers dont want to come within a furlong of him maybe a really really powerful mindhealer could mend him but we dont have one strong enough so they gave him over to me wellthets good right he blinked again trying to focus on bears lenses nother reason why yer family caint drag ye home it is bear acknowledged but looked unhappy the thing is i just wish i had more options for dealing with him right now all i can do is get him a little healthier and see if some of my remedies can help him out i dont like not being able to do something for a patient and yes i know no one else can either but well i really really want to break him out of this if lena is right and hes seeing vrondi maybe i can find something some medicine in the old records that blocks magic or at least blocks mindmagic if he doesnt sense them watching him maybe we can get through to him all i was able to do before was towell dose him so that he didnt feel threatened by them watching him if that makes any sense i dont know even if no one wanted me to try and help this fellow i would do it mags pondered this drowsily and closed his eyes i get it bear ye wouldn be fightin t be a healer ifn ye didn feel thet way healers a healer bone deep gift or no he paused am i a fool fer feelin sorry fer im no i do too he never did anything to either of us that i know of and it was his socalled friends that kidnapped me not him besides i get the feeling he was forced to come hereand i am pretty damn sure he was forced to stay the chair scraped against the floor as bear got up to leave i need to take these little fellows back where they belong i expect youll be getting more visitors mebbe an if not i kin sleep he couldnt imagine who besides lena would be all that anxious to see him pretty soon everyone would realize just what balderdash that hero business was so long as everybody figured out that he wasnt the foreigner in those visions hed count himself a happy fellow bear chuckled all right then sleep itll be good for you he did just that soothed by the stuff in bears tea until a servant woke him for lunch which was more soft foodpease porridge flavored with ham but without any ham in it mashed pears mashed turnips it was good the cook had taken extra care with it all he could tell he winced a bit even so as he ate he supposed he was lucky none of his teeth had actually been knocked out of his jaw half the collegium wants to visit you dallen reported mags laughed reckon ye kin take that on yerself he asked i think it oughta be you what gets all th attention oh i might dallen temporized gennie and the team are on the way with a couple of your books anyway healer juran told them you wont be down long enough to need all of your studies brought in it hurt to smile but he did anyway the servant who had come to take his dishes smiled back at him then ill tell em what kinda big damn hero ye are an let em spread it round he chuckled at dallens astonished reaction juran is right you really are ridiculously modest or mebbe i jest don like fussin an i know you eat it up jest think bout all those people tryin t bring ye pocket pies just then he heard the sounds of a lot of boots in the corridor outside and turned his attention to the door it wasnt the entire team but it was a fair crowd it included halleck pip gennie and jeffers as well as the young protoguards from the foot and he had to shush them more than once to keep them from disturbing the other people in the room there were three other patients though he couldnt see who or even what they wereonly that they mostly hunched themselves up in their blankets and turned their backs on the fuss dear gods you look like a bad dyeing accident pip observed cheerfully try not to heal too fast well get lots of sympathy for our side at the first kirball game gennie pretended to smack him on the back of the head they all settled around the bed tell demanded gennie or ill leave pip with you after he got done telling his part of the storyand being true to his word minimizing his role and making sure dallen got all the credit he deserved for trying to take on a skilled and armed fighter in a space where the companion couldnt even movehe finally got to ask some questions of his own anyone sayin wha appened down in haven he asked everyone looked to barrett who nodded no ones making any sort of secret about it barrett replied your man managed to bolt before the heralds and guards got there and vanished there were at least five more besides the crazy one staying at the inn according to the innkeeper he had given them a couple of rooms over the stable that he was rarely able to rent out because of how noisy and smelly they could get when the inn was fullhed done that because their crazy friend was given to fits of raving and that kept him from disturbing anyone else theyd only been there a fortnight or so huh wonder where else theyd been stayin til then mags said thoughtfully they had t be somewhere wherever it was the crazy one hadnt been screaming his head off or the other innkeepers would have remembered it barrett said anyway they stole horses out of the stable left the crazy one behind and disappeared the inn was in an uproar when the heralds got there over the stolen horses by now theyre long gone pip said in disgust i wish i could get my hands on the one that beat up mags his eyes glittered dangerously and mags was a bit taken aback this was a side of pip he had not seen before either theyre really gone from haven or they stole the horses to make it look like they did gennie put in huh mags blinked at her ye think thets likely he couldnt imagine why they would stay but the mere thought made his stomach feel odd theyd had a grudge against him before he caught them out now theyd probably want his hide tacked up on a wall gennie shrugged it doesnt matter what i think thats what older and wiser heads than mine are thinking they say that given that we thought they were gone the first time from what i heard equal weight is being put on both possibilities so whyd they stay i the first place mags wondered there were puzzled glances and shrugs all around the group i suppose they didnt get something done that they needed to do gennie said at last and theres nothing they left behind telling us what that wasunless it was to kill the king this sure matches up with that foreseeing halleck said speaking up for the first time foreign bloodand an assassin lets hope you put an end to that mags eh mags shrugged was more accident than anythin else well what i want to know is will you be ready for the kirball match gennie demanded mags chuckled he had been waiting for her to say something healer says so says ill be all greennpurple but i be good gennie sighed with relief well in that case im happy supper came and went and lena followed it with another dose from bear and a request well not so much a request as an i plan to do this and of course im sure you wont mind no said mags but lena said making big eyes at him nuuh no songs mags said firmly i aint done nothin t make a song bout but i need a subject for this weeks assignment she protested its perfect i mean i know you and i know the story and its topical which is important because it proves it isnt something ive been working on all along on the side besides its mostly just about keeping your eyes open all the time and she stopped abruptly and shut her mouth but not before mags realized what she had just said he stared at her accusingly ye already wrote it didn ye she dropped her gaze to the hands clasped in her lap yees she said reluctantly ye din sing it fer anyone um he groaned ye did hown hell did ye git a song wrote i lessn a day i needed a song for an assignment and i couldnt think of a subject she replied pleadingly it was one of those make up a song in three days assignments bards are supposed to be able to make things up on the spot and this is supposed to train us in doing that it was perfect my class liked it yer class he groaned an entire class of bardic trainees had heard the song and liked it which meant an entire class of bardic trainees had probably memorized it by now its very short she said in a small voice itd haveta be if his face hadnt been so tender he would have buried it in his hands an since its short they all learnt it already cause thets what bards do um sort of she whispered sort of which meant shed taught them even better wonnerful well there was no helping it he had a song about him now the best thing he could do would be to see if she could bury it with a better one well then lena marchand you owes me an i am gonna collect he fastened her with a stern gaze which was altogether ineffective since she was staring at her hands yer gonna write nother song bout dallen an yer gonna make it bettern the one bout me now she looked up with a slightly panicked look on her face i cant promise it will be better she protested he didnt relent are ye a bard or no he countered bards write t demand all th time ye jest said so well i be yer first customer ye mights well start learnin how t please the customer now an be done wi it she sighed heavily and dropped her gaze to her lap again all right she replied unhappily ill try he could hardly believe it hed only been tucked up in healers collegium for a little more than a day and already this had happened well the best way to deal with it was to act as if it wasnt importantand neither was he but this was certainly nothing like what herald nikolas wanted him to do his thoughts were interrupted by lena speaking in what was almost a whisper dont you want to hear it she asked even a little he almost snapped out no when he got a good look at her face oh how could he make her even more unhappy than she already was that would just be the height of cruelty all right he said trying not to show his reluctance it was damn nice on ye lena s jest i don wanna fuss about me an i thought ye knew that i didn like the bad fuss an i don like a good fuss about the same jest don like any fuss ye ken she nodded he reached out and patted her hand bet its real good though so les hear it she lit up with a smile and reached down for the little gittern next to her chair and mags got to listen for the next half candlemark all about what a brave hero he was when in fact he was dead certain he was nothing of the sort youre sure you can see all right gennie asked anxiously from inside the helmet mags nodded the helm following the motions of his head and turning them into something ponderous so did all the rest of them all right you lot remember play with your heads as well as your hands and feet she said to the team that had gathered around her listen for mags in your heads but if you see something that opens up in front of you think it as hard as you can they stood in a circle with the horses and companions on the outside reins held loosely in their riders hands they could all hear the murmur of the crowd huddled up against the fence surrounding the field a lot of people had turned up today it was a gorgeous sunny warm day perfect for just about anything one enterprising fellow was peddling apples pip had taken a look at the crowd and remarked that before long they were going to need stands for the spectators mags had thought he was joking but now he wasnt so sure they were all unmounted for the moment the horses stirring uneasily at the ends of their bridles sandwiched in between companions to keep them out of mischief the horses were mostly wellschooled and wellbehaved but they were horses and one perceived nip or bump might start something wasting energy that they would need for the game riders weve got a disadvantage the riders on north are all well monied and they have a horse for every quarter we dont they all nodded of them all only jeffers had three horses the other riders had a pair apiece that meant theyd be alternating one to ride one to rest the second quarter each horse played was going to be hard on themand even jeffers was going to have to go with a barelyrested horse for the fourth quarter so ride smart let your beasts rest as much as possible and see to it that theirs dont get a chance to just remember this though your horses are all tough and scrappy theirs are highbred and all nerve and nose chances are we can make them or the riders lose their tempers and if we do that we win the game provided you can keep yours she turned to the foot you lot have our secret but remember to wait until we tell you to use it because once we do it wont be a secret anymore and everyone will use the trick we have to plan this and plan it well right one of the guard boys saluted no one found that funny gennie nodded right then check the saddles bits and boots for your mounts check your paddlestraps check your armor lets play the game the south team lined up in the middle of the field after a moment the north did the same opposite them mags noticed something immediately the north riders have whips in their hands he projected to all of them they wont be able to manage reins whip and paddle he saw gennie nod slightly and narrow her eyes tell them this again from me play together play with your heads and follow the ball if north gets it drive the ball to the riders and let them fumble it keep it away from the trainees the ball a curiously soft thing about the size of a babys head lay on the ground between the two teams it could be kicked by the companions or by the foot it could be snatched up and carried thrown or hit with the paddles anything was fair all eyes were on it ho shouted the referee and the trainees from both sides dove for the ball but jeffers on a pony barely big enough to be a mount for him dove in under the nose of one of the north trainees leaning down out of his saddle and scooped up the ball the indignant companion pulled up with a whinny as he hauled himself back up he threw the ball toward his side gennie snagged it out of the air and she and her companion scrambled for the north goal no onewell perhaps no one except the south teamhad expected anyone to get his hands on the ball that fast the north was caught unprepared and pelted after her but their foot were already moving to intercept her pip she called out and feinted toward the goal while throwing the ball in a fast shallow arc toward her teammate it came at him like a comet but he knew this maneuver of old and he stood up in his stirrups and smacked it with his paddle with both hands as hard as he possibly could the ball flew high and true and in through the open door of the north goal the crowd of spectatorsfor there was a crowdwent insane weve made em mad mags warned catching some black looks from the north team good now we tire them out with some football gennie replied and so they did north got the ball this time but as gennie had told them to do the team crowded the ball handler and kept the trainees tied up so that the ball went to a riderand then south riders and trainees pressed the riders hard keeping them away from the north trainees and from each other they ran the north riders all over the field took them on scrambles over the rises made them leap the little fences and tear down into the gullies taking them over every thumblength of ground the horses lost their heads over this they hated being run in this way and as a consequence they became handfuls fighting the bits and their riders forcing the riders to use those whips in their hands which meant the riders couldnt use the paddles and finally the ballcarrier fumbled and pip nipped the ball out of the air in midfall just as the whistle blew for the end of the quarter now that was what i call some play dallen said with satisfaction but mags was looking at the poor horses who were absolutely exhausted and the foot who were the same they had run all over the field trying to stay between the riders and the goal ready to fall on the ball pound it out of the air or use the long poles they had in stands at the side to pull a rider or trainee out of the saddle in a battle it would be someone with a polearm doing that and the result could be the death of the formerly mounted fighter there were two minds about the poles which had padded hooks on the ends some of the senior heralds didnt want them used in the game some who had seen combat were adamant about their use the few rules were still in flux they all huddled up again weve made them angry too soon said gennie with a glance over her shoulder at the other teams huddle mags nodded theyll probably try to rush us to keep us off the ball so they can get it first and we wont manage the same trick to nip in under their noses theyre smart well never be able to play the same trick twice on them i wouldnt doubt they have more than a few tricks up their sleeves put in pip three of em are my yearmates never forget my team that the people on all four teams are the best of the best the only differences among us are the way our coaches are strategizing the game and the talents they picked for their teams never forget to play like a team gennie reminded them there is a difference between a team and a group of the best and a team will win every time stay loose and keep alert dont go for the ball this time go for keeping them away from it keep on top of it and just dont let them have it they lined up for the second quarter all eyes were on the ball and sure enough one of the trainees on north rushed the ball coming in with a clever scoop that might have taken it if the south hadnt followed gennies orders it was companions and trainees this time the scrum was nothing but white coats and tails south didnt even try to get at the ball they just moved in right on top of it and kept it in play among the companions legs wheres the ball mags asked dallen under hacks tail or at least thats where north thinks it is north kept pushing and pushing at hallecks companion hack thinking he had the ball well where is it really bywhoops the north had found it at last and a smart kick from one of their companions sent it soaring up the pitch toward the south goal but the south riders had been waiting for that staying well out of the scrum and now that the ball was heading their way they made for it dont snag it keep them off the ball mags shouted into their minds as the north companions four abreast rushed the field trying to block the south companions from getting to the north riders but momentum carried them all across the field and what happened was that all of them converged on the ball at once one of the north trainees was swinging down out of his saddle and almost not today thanks shouted jeffers as his horse shouldered into the companion forcing him sideways enough so that the trainee missed his grab pip was right after jeffers and made the scoop but the north was determined not to let them near the goal and so they were rushed up the field and down again the north brought their riders into playand at the change their riders had gone for big heavy horses they could shove the south all over the field if they chose they looked big enough to eat the whole team and want dessert in fact those riders are too confident of their horses weights gennie said to mags who passed it on tell pip to send the ball at the goal anyhow well race them and see what we can do pip and his companion got a good smart kick at the ball that sent it skittering away across the field toward the north goal at a time when the north trainees were scrummed up with the south trainees mags knew it when the ball went flying a breath before the north team knew and he and dallen went careening after it a north rider on a big black charger went for the ball at the same time the black was hot and angryyou could see it in his eyes and in the flag of his tail they were heading for a collision if neither of them wavered dallen was cool calculating and as jeffers came streaking up behind them dallen applied his weight to the side of the north horse with science mags felt the impact all through him and if it hadnt been for the armor on his leg it would have been bruised from ankle to thigh the blow was tremendous dallen sat down and slid on his tail as mags hung on for dear life but when mags looked around the black was down and on his side with all his breath knocked out of him and his rider was picking himself up out of the dirt neither were hurt more than bruises but both were out of the game for a little at least ha said dallen and scrambled to his feet following after jeffers who had nipped the ball up right under the nose of the north foot but the north foot were ready for him and he couldnt get the ball in to save his life nor could he get the chance to rush them and steal the flag time was called and that was the end of that quarter theyll bring out fast horses for their riders next said gennie in the huddle what have we got weve got nothing fast jeffers told her just sound theyll probably make a goal on us then gennie replied it will be up to us to make that goal back right after when they least expect it or make a try for the flag i dunno said mags who had been up and down the line of the norths foot several times in the melee i don see em givin us an openin t try then we play what we can get gennie said firmly remember that fast horses wont like football and maybe we can tie them up again if we cant well well do what we can off they all went to the line and the horses that the north riders were on looked very fast indeed and the riders did not want football they wanted a game and they had the speed to get it they plunged down on the ball like falcons on a pigeon the trainees hung back and let them and they got the ball too arriving a good stride or two before the south did the south tied up the rider with the ball but he gave a great heave and sent it flying toward one of the north trainees on the chance that might happen gennie had pulled back and put herself between him and them and as she saw the ball hurtling toward her far too fast to catch safely she copied the move earlier in the game she stood in her stirrups got the paddle in both hands and thwacked at the ball in passing not aiming just deflecting so the ball met her paddle and sped off her paddle at an angle with the speed of her hit and the northern riders tremendous throw and went screaming off to the sidelines paddles broke im out gennie called and went careening to their side to get a new one the entire northern field went after the ball mags caught movement out of the corner of his eye and alerted hack halleck the flag he warned for those two were the closest and he and dallen made a straight run for their own goal foot he projected as hard as he could the flag theyre usin our trick sure enough the north had stolen the souths secret move which was to send one of the foot sneaking under cover across the field to steal the flag when no one was watching it and if they hadnt trained themselves for that they might not have noticed until it was too late the northern foot had the flag in his hands as hack nearly ran him down halleck snatching it away as they passed their own foot chased him back to the safety of his own lines furious that they had been distracted enough to let him get that close they shouldnt have theyd known this could happen and had planned for it to be them that did it cool down mags advised to them all aint no thing we caught er in time ware goal halleck rammed the pole of the flag back in place and rejoined the game just as gennie pounded back from the sidelines toward the rider with the ball with a grim look on her face just how grim she was was clear by the fact that the north was dangerously close to the south goal taking advantage of the distraction of their foots attempt on the flag she went at the rider with the ball fullout shouldered into his companion and bringing her fist up between his hands bunted the ball right out of them it popped up high in the air and fell back among the hooves and there it stayed for the south was not going to let them get it back again football football mags shouted and football they got the fast horses of the riders got hot and lathered as the souths companions kept the ball among their feet not daring to kick it away lest it be intercepted compliments were exchanged among the riders and trainees horses kicked and bit and companions put their heads down and would not be moved and finally time was called and it was the end of the third quarter this will be the worst gennie said pulling off her helmet and mopping at her face and neck theyve got fresh horses for the riders and we dont they want two goals they need one she looked hard at mags at all of them nows for it if you see it take chances we wont have another quarter to make up what we lose mags nodded they all did they knew what that meant so did dallen who tossed up his head to show he was still in the game football my lads football they have fresh horses theyll drive us in toward our goal theyll try to get close enough to score but we can win this one just the same if we keep our heads they all nodded then it was into the saddle and onto the line and the first thing the fresh riders did was get the ball right under hallecks nose but he was atop them and copying gennies move in reverse drove his fist down on the ball knocking it among the hooves again the northern trainees had learned by watching and now it was their companions who were playing as much football as the south the time for compliments and kicks was over both sides scrummed grimly over the ball hocks were kicked and dust rose above the melee and the northern foot came up to join the fray this was new they had left their poles behind the foot circled the outside of the scrum dancing back and forth watching watching mags could scarcely believe it but it looked as if they intended to dash right in there and snatch the ball up from among the flying hooves if they got a chance and then it hit him he glanced at the northern goal there was only a single foot there to guard it dallen didnt need prompting he responded the instant mags eyes took in that fact this was what he lived for a straight hard run across rotten ground as fast as he could put hoof to turf mags was halfway to the goal before the lone foot realized he was coming the man leapt to intercept them but instead of taking one of the ramps dallen gathered himself like a rabbit and made an enormous jump that got his forehooves on the top of the base he scrambled for a desperate moment with his rear as mags threw his weight over dallens neck saved himself and pivoted mags snatched at the flag just as a roar from the other end of the ground told him that the north had scored run they had the flagbut they had to keep it and now the entire field had realized what he had done and were heading toward him he hunched down over dallens neck dallen leapt off the top of the goalstructure aiming not for their own goal but the side of the field where the very worst of the ground was the boulders and hillocks and a hundred treacherous things he scrambled among them like a rabbit jigging and dancing from side to side as fifteen riders and trainees avalanched toward them at a speed that was insane one of the riders on a beast built like a greyhound came up on them first but dallen feinted to the fence and the horse shied from it the horses didnt like the fencethey didnt like the shouting people climbing on it and they didnt like the fence itself the north horses could not come at his right hand side and so the north companions moved to get in ahead of him and stop him the south riders and companions werent going to give them a chance not if they could help it and this was bad ground very bad and dallen couldnt move in a straight line across it the entire scrum piled onto him threatening to trap him turn them into the fence mags cried and they did crowding the horses whose nerves stretched and snapped and crowding their fellow companions while mags and dallen ran slid between them still heading for their goal and that was when mags saw it the ball in the riders hand forgotten pip the ball he yelled as dallen gave a leap and a wiggle and nipped under a northern companions bridle and then they were clear dallen got a surge of energy from somewhere and put on a burst of speed as behind him and from the crowd mags heard a roar he ignored it they had their job a northern foot popped up out of nowhere right in their path the man made a vicious swing at mags with his hook mags and dallen both ducked and the hook grazed the back of his helmet and his headand dallen hopped up like a rabbit to prevent his feet from being pulled out from under him by the return sweep of the hook and then they were past and then they were pounding up the top of the ramp and mags stabbed down with the pole of the flag planting it next to their own just as a roar came up from the other end of the fieldmatched by the roar from the spectators at this end when they saw him safely in and the flag in capture and the trumpets blatted marking the game over one goal up and the flag in capture crowed pip for the hundredth time oh that was a game they were playing it over move for move at the celebratory dinner tonight there was no time limit on how long they could all occupy the dining hall and even the cooks kept turning up with more to drink and tasty snacks to hear about the game mags and pip who made the final goal were the great heroes of the hour now that the game was over everyone was friends again and although they were all too young to be allowed to drink very much they did toast each other again and again in the small beer cider and weak wine they were permitted my eye said halleck with satisfaction this is something like i wish my family was here well now this was just the first game so dont go thinking well let you get away with this when we meet up again said the captain of the north with a laugh and east and west were watching so those clever tricks you used wont work a second time nothing ever does my lad halleck countered waggling his eyebrows you just be on your mettle for well have new tricks for you the second time around mags kept very quiet and off to one side but he was full of silent contentment again tomorrow something else might crop up to make his life a misery again but for now for now life was good chapter im glad you had time for this today amily said happily as she passed mags another random pile of heralds reports i didnt think you would what with kirball practice and all the little nook in the library felt as warm and welcoming as his own room now and today was even better since he and amily were alone up here well yer pas left me alone fer a bit so thet gives me some time mags replied though his brow furrowed with worry i dunno though im a bit afeared i mighta got too watched what wi the game an findin them foreigners mebbe i aint no use t him now an thets why he aint got nothing fer me t do the prospect made him unhappy for reasons he couldnt quite define maybe because he had gotten used to being needed and wanted doing things that were important even if only nikolas knew that he was doing so only until the east and west game and only until people forget about the foreigners amily replied giving him a pat on the back of his hand it will be fine father is patient in fact hes probably figuring out ways to use this to his advantageperhaps to get you to play up that you are very physical rather than intelligent people who are good at fighting or games are rarely expected to be clever if you play into that people will underestimate you and he knows that eventually you and pip wont be the only star kirball players people will all have their favorites its the way that games work out at his quizzical expression she elaborated people will pick a team to support with their enthusiasm and they will have favorite players on the team itself if you stay quiet and uninteresting they will turn their attention to someone who is outgoing and very vocal someone who relishes the attention but not in a bad way didnt you know that he shook his head never seen no games like this afore he replied more that a bit surprised at her words oh amily was a little taken aback i keep forgetting that you didnt she stopped before finishing her sentence thet i didn hev a normal kinda growin up he finished for her well thets good cause i kinda wont fit in th way yer pa wants me to if people are noticin thet alla time if you ferget it means im getting better at that fittin in stuff he smiled shyly at her and was rewarded by another pat on his hand she eyed him carefully so you have no idea what gennie really means when she talks about giving the other team football do you he shook his head well i jest thought it was keepin th ball mongst the companions feet kinda explains itself thas not it amily giggled a little no its an actual game fancy a girl is going to have to explain football to a boy she found this very funny although he didnt see why people play football all over valdemar its very popular i know enough about it to explain it so she did evidently this was a kicking game with a ball one that was a little bigger than a kirball it was played by two teamson a flat rectangular field with a goal at either end the field was much smaller than the one for kirball and was generally grassed over you were allowed to kick or hit the ball you just werent allowed to pick it up and run with it why mags said finally when she got done explaining how villages would compete with each other and how there were many teams down in haven composed of players from various guilds and professionsand many more that were just friends getting together why go t all that fuss an work t do somethin like that i mean f i had a day free from hard work i sure wouldn wanta spend it kickin at a ball he shook his head at the mine all we wanted t do when we wasnt workin was t hunt fer food an sleep its fun amily said slowly its fun for the people playing it its fun to watch its fun to support one team or another well at least it is for people who arent as desperate as the people in your mine were when you arent starving or exhausted people do all sorts of odd things for fun didnt you have fun out there playing kirball it looked as if you did he thought about it reckon i did he said after a moment feeling surprised i mean i got on cause caellan y know dean of collegium wanted me to an yer pa seemed t want me to so i did an it was kinda like another class fer me but aye now ye say i reckon it was fun he thought about it some more yknow i think id play it even if it wasnt like a class well thats why and when the east and west meet youll see its fun to watch too she nodded decisively and would have said more except that they heard the door to the archives open and footsteps coming toward them across the wooden floor two sets of footsteps they both looked up to see lena and a handsome man in bardic scarlet approaching them from out of the shadows at the door end of the archives mags knew that face all too well bard marchand lenas father now that mags had leisure to study him he couldnt say he liked the man any better the bard had a classically chiseled face of the sort you would expect to see on a heroic statue he wore his dark hair a little long and there was gray at both temples his eyes were a common enough brown with disconcertingly long lashes but despite the long lashes there was nothing effeminate about him he moved with the confidence of someone who expects everyone else to get out of his way and he carried himself as if he expected to be the center of attention he wasnt as heavily muscled as a herald or a fighter of some sort would be but he was lean and fit lena had a sort of tremulously hopeful look on her face but the expression on bard marchands was a bit more difficult to read it looked a little like avidity which was a strange expression considering the circumstances mags this is my father bard marchand he wanted to meet and talk to you lena said and her anxious thoughts were so strong they spilled past mags shields please be nice to him he finally noticed me mags blinked a little to realize that there was something else going on with her as well as the healer had said he got an inkling of the emotions that were driving her as well certainly not enough to be uncomfortable or intrusive for him and he was sure he could shield them out if he wished to but he knew very well how anxious she was even without reading her expression father she said with a touch of desperation this is trainee mags they both ignored amily which was uncharacteristically rude on lenas part mags would cheerfully have snubbed the manwho clearly had no idea that this was the same trainee hed sent on a servants errand to make another servant of the kings own mere weeks ago but he couldnt spoil this for lena on the other hand he didnt exactly have to be himself for the bard either this was an excellent opportunity for some misdirection good idea mags dallen was irritated whatever he wants make him work for it pleased t meetcher bard marchand he said and immediately put on his thickest accent and an amiablebutstupid expression he thrust out his hand bard marchand took it with a bit of hesitation he pumped the bards hand with great enthusiasm and exactly as if he was working a pump handle before letting go of it pleased to meet you at last trainee mags said the bard flexing his fingers gingerly although he didnt make a great show of doing so that was a little odd it couldnt have been because mags had crushed his hand with a hard grip mags knew better than to pull that kind of game with a bard someone who needed his fingers intact even if he didnt like the man no he got the flash of an impression that marchand was keeping himself from pulling out a handkerchief and wiping his hand off only by force of will as if he expected that mags would be dirty or something nice he thought sourly this here purty fillys amily he said since marchand was still ignoring the other person in the room as utterly unimportant time to display the fact that he at least had some manners she be herald nikolas daughter a flicker of recognition passed across the bards face and a flicker of chagrin as he must have realized that amily was too important a personage to continue to ignore especially after that dressingdown hed gotten from master bard lita ah the bard said turning toward her and beaming the full force of his personality at her as he scooped up her hand and kissed the fingertips enchanted i had no idea my old friend nikolas had such a lovely daughter it was easy to see how the bard charmed his admirers although this wasnt quitethe application of his gift the bard had a full measure of charisma and clearly was used to employing it with great precision amily flushed but only mags knew it was not with pleasure i prefer to stay quietly out of the public eye bard marchand she said with an edge to her voice under the sweetness ive no taste for court maneuverings and i suppose you would say i am something of a bookworm father indulges my taste for solitude what kin we be adoin fer ye bard marchand mags said letting his voice take on tones of faintly servile admiration the man lived on flattery it seemed so give him what he wanted and see what came of it m jest a trainee caint think what brung ye up here less ye wanta know stuffs in archives oh i was wondering if you would be so kind as to give me your view of the events of this winter and the discovery of those vile miscreants in haven a few days ago trainee marchand continued turning back to mags with a coaxing manner i understand you had a firsthand view of them during their stay at the palace and were instrumental in discovering that they were still in haven he smiled its all fodder for work of course and while i am sure that you have already told others of my calling all about those events a bard is doing less than his duty if he fails to get the tale directly from those who lived it the dean of your collegium himself advised that i speak directly to you when i enquired of the matter for a moment mags wondered if that last was a lie he wouldnt put anything past marchand if marchand wanted something badly enough including lying about whether herald caelan had actually sent him but no probably not he might be self centered but he wasnt stupid and it would be ridiculously easy for mags to catch him in a lie even if mags was as dull as he was pretending to be it was very likely hed be caught out in fact mags would certainly say something about it to caelan the next time he saw the dean after all bard marchand was wildly popular and wildly famous and it would be natural for mags to be flattered that he had been singled out and just as natural to thank the dean for the opportunity to meet the bard well natural in marchands eyes anyway humph indeed he thinks the world is always watching him id like t be watching th back of him as he leaves right now the fastest way to be rid of him would be to tell him the bare unvarnished truth in as few words as possible use that veneer of stupid stolidity to mags advantage someone as dense as mags wanted to seem would have little or no imagination and might be so overwhelmed by the honor of marchands attention that he could only manage to get out simple sentences so that was what mags did keeping the tale spare staring without comprehension when marchand asked him things like but what did you think of that or but how did you feel dont rightly know bard would usually be his reply as he would let a puzzled expression creep across his face this set him down in marchands mind as a singularly unimaginative stolid country bumpkin which suited mags perfectly but it was painfully clear as the questioning continued that marchand also considered him to be if not an actual hero certainly a protohero and one with a great deal of potential precisely what mags did not want him to think marchand kept dropping flattering little comments about how brave he was for one so young and how he surely had a bright future ahead of him there was no doubt in mags mind that marchand was not going to be satisfied with this single encounter he was trying to cultivate mags and mags kept saying things like eh twas all dallen and i didn git a chance t think belike and it didnt seem to help ill say this for him his instincts are very good when it comes to spotting those who are likely to make good songfodder dallen admitted reluctantly and even better for spotting those who can help him enlarge his own fame and when the conversation shifted to the new game of kirball it was obvious that marchands interest was not feignedthough he seemed less interested in the game itself than in the players mags was a kirball champion at least for now which also made him a desirableacquaintance no dallen said sourly acquisition marchand acquires people people he thinks other people will want to know i am afraid he has decided that you are a very desirable target probably more for kirball than for the business with the foreigners the latter could have been due to mere happenstance you being in the right place at exactly the right time then acting like a herald should the former is something that is going to be popular and if marchand knows nothing else he is superb at riding waves of popularity watch out or hell invite you to i am going to stage a small concert for just a few friends the bard said smoothly im sure youd like to attend and i am equally sure my friends would enjoy discussing this new game with you im going to hold it tomorrow night after the court dinner mags was about to open his mouth to come up with some excuse why he couldnt attend when the bards next words stopped him dead lena is going to sing as well arent you my dear the bard said as lena nodded its so important for a young bardic student to get early exposure to audiences other than their friends and teachers good training for what is to come there is nothing so important to a bard as being able to gauge his audience within a few moments ascertain what their mood is and at need what direction to steer that mood lena looked so thrilled that she was going to be performing in the same venue as her father that mags could not bear to mar that happiness in any way and marchand surely knew that he might not know that mags had helped to steady lena during her first contest but he absolutely knew that mags was one of lenas best friends and steadfast supporters and that mags would never abandon her to face a room full of strangers on her own well be glad to come amily an me mags said then deciding that if he was going to be blackmailed into this he was going to make marchand pay for it another way snub amily ye smug peacock i dare ye amily missed lenas contest shell be a mort glad t hear er sing now marchand was clearly taken aback but there was no way now that he could just come out and say but i only invited you without looking unforgivably rude good then he replied plastering a smile on his face ill be looking forward to seeing both of you right after court dinner it will be one of the rooms off the great hall lena can come and fetch you so you dont get lost in the palace nice treat lena like a servant like ye treated me giving lena no preparation time for her performance commented dallen cept we know her an we know shell hev prepped herself all day mags replied he really dont know her at all does he not in the least thank you dear for bringing me here and introducing me to your friend marchand continued now i must be off and you must go on to your classes and i see that i was interrupting some work here so i am sure i shouldnt continue to do so until tomorrow night he turned with a flourish and made an exit with lena pattering along beside and a little behind him just like an obedient devoted spaniel amily bent her head over the papers for a moment and it was clear she was furious finally she said something oh that man it was more restrained than he expected i don like im not one bit mags said e makes me skin crawl well he is clear proof that talent and a gift dont make you a wonderful person amily said sourly it makes me wish that there was a better way of selecting bards than just judging what they can do someone like that should she paused and then said unexpectedly do you know why he tries to humiliate my father every chance he gets did father tell you mags shook his head oh this could be interesting he felt dallen settle back waiting for the revelation yer a worse gossip than a old woman its only gossip if you repeat it until then its gathering information because many years ago when they were both trainees my father was party to something that marchand would really rather no one else knew her lips tightened and i shouldnt tell you this and i wouldnt except that you are in fathers confidence what happened was that he was in the same room when marchand was getting a dressingdown from the dean of bardic for some incredibly selfish thing he had done father never told me what it was but given marchand he probably used his gift to get something he wanted to the detriment of someone else like usin it t hev his way wi a servant or somethin mags hazarded he could easily imagine that anything from getting the servant to do something he wasnt supposed to or finagling a girl into his bed amily nodded probably wenching she said confirming mags guess they were both about sixteen at the time my father was the witness to it so the dean had him in the office to confirm the accusation whatever it was isnt important whats important is that he did something that was in violation of bardic ethics it couldn have been huge mags pointed out then hesitated could it well thats the question i mean not lifethreatening huge but i would say very serious the thing is that the dean really lost his temper with marchand and told marchand with father there she paused and closed her eyes as if making sure of the memory the only reason we allow you to continue here is because with a gift as strong as yours we dare not let you off our leash you are like a dangerous animal trainee but you are one of us by virtue of that gift and the bardic circle will not abandon their responsibilities in the matter of how you use that gift we will control you marchand if you do not learn to control yourself and abide by the rule of ethics and law mags felt his jaw dropping open with shock well that explained a lot anyone else know this he gasped the dean whos dead now father me the king marchand himself and now you amily said gravely father told me and the king i very much doubt the dean told anyone marchand knows that as long as he stays just on the edge of the line so to speak my father wont ever say or do anything about what he knows so he doesnt actually use his gift to get things he wants directly he just uses it to charm people into wanting to give him what he wants she paused i dont think hes actually evil just incredibly selfish i dont think anyone matters to him except as a means to getting what he wants gah mags felt sick so thets why he aint in the ruling circle een though hes a master bard amily nodded exactly he will never be on the council or in the ruling circle the king will always veto him i dont know if anyone has ever guessed why for certain but most of the high ranking bards feel about him the way you do and the plain fact is they all know he is far too selfish to ever be allowed real political power because he wouldnt actually abuse it as such but he would never use it for anything other than what suited his own ends his friends are mostly what i would call patrons and admirers in fact i dont know that he actually has what i would call a real friend mags pursed his lips thoughtfully this really explained a lot he knew that lenas family was very well off and it wasnt from any income that marchand might bring in lenas mama he asked tentatively she one of those patrons like thet why e married er lenas mother has piles of money amily confirmed he charmed all of the family married her fathered lena and now only has to appear home for a few days a year to keep them all dazzled or so father says i dont see any reason to disagree with that mags shook his head gotta say what wi lenas pa an bears folks mebbe i aint so bad off not hevin a fambily amily only sighed then there is master soren and my father she pointed out and marcs family pips family and genniesmore good than bad not all families are trouble but i will admit it does make me appreciate my own the east and west teams had played their first kirball match yesterday and the dining hall was still full of the babble of people talking the match over and comparing it to the north and south match you could tell who was discussing the gamewhich was almost everyoneby the flailing arms and hand gestures everyone had an opinion bardic trainees were clearly trying to figure out how to write songs about this mags overheard some comparisons between how he and dallen had taken the north flag to how east foot kaven lockertie had stolen the west flag so far the fetching gift hadnt even come into play which didnt much surprise mags youd have to be really really good to make fetching work in the middle of the scrum and as for standing off on the side the moment anyone spotted a herald trainee doing that they would be on him in a heartbeat mags had found that he had indeed enjoyed watchingperhaps even more than he had enjoyed playing but the second full day of nonstop babble about it was beginning to pall for there were only so many ways that you could replay the match in theory he wasnt comfortable speculating about what the other teams could and could not do he certainly wasnt comfortable with talking about his own abilities or lack of them and he was very glad that bear was talking about something else bears herbal medicine kit was coming along the healers in general were satisfied with his progress and he was happy mags didnt understand more than half of what he was saying about it all but it was obvious that things were going well so he listened and contributed where he could now the idea had expanded to placing one in every village that didnt have a healer nearly every village had a midwife or something of the sort so that would be who would have the responsibility for keeping the kit safe and doling out the medicines id worrit bout thet kit makin people think they didn need a healer he offered y know jest tryin one medicine after nother till it was too late they do that now without the kit around bear replied shrugging mostly the medicines and remedies they try are ineffective ones but youre right to think that the healers circle debated it for almost a day before deciding it was going to do more good than harm at least this way the medicines theyll try are known to be effective and known to be of standard strength and not something like dead beetles and bats blood pounded with the dung of a pregnant goat mags stared at him fascinated and appalled yer jokin no thets sposed t be a medicine bear grimaced not only that but one with a lot of people that swear by it thank the gods its only supposed to be for going bald and you are supposed to rub it in your scalp not eat it i dont want to think about how youd stink when you were using it or what it would do to a scalp wound id be more like t swear at it then swear by it mags shuddered an here i thought yer messes was foul bear shrugged right now im trying to work out how to dry that bread mold that works on wounds so that you can get it to sprout again and how to describe exactly what it looks like so people know whether or not the right stuff sprouted as it stands the only way we have to get the stuff out is to take a live batch out by hand and cosset it the whole way mags shook his head i dunno yarbs an things ye kin prolly get people t believe ony the stuff i th kit works right but ye start sendin out mold an peoplell start thinkin mebbe you was wrong an them dried beetlesd work jest fine thats a good point bear slowly chewed and swallowed i have a favor to ask think you could come give me a hand with the lunatic mags blinked this wasunexpected aye buthow i aint a healer nor a mindhealer actually thats the point the mindhealers dont want to get near him i guess their shields arent as good as yours or else the way they have to work is completely without shields when he talks he doesnt speak valdemaran and thats a problem sometimes people whove gone mad actually make sense once you figure out what the meaning is behind what they are saying bear scratched his neck am i making any sense here mags nodded im follerin ye so far im hoping with all your shields you might be able to get stuff leaked over that i can use to try and understand whats going on in his head bear sighed ive got him calmer now at least and hes put on a little weight so were more or less back to the point where he was during the blizzard ill give er a go mags said but i aint promisin nothin he felt a little uneasy saying even that much but this was bear and he would do whatever he could to help out his friend he just wished he could have gotten hold of nikolas to ask him about keeping bear here he was pretty certain that if nikolas made the request things would be sorted in a hurry he followed bear back to healers collegium and into yet another part of the building hed never been before they entered by a different door than before one tucked out of sight once inside bear took him through a pair of double doors at what must have been the other end of the big sickroom this was a short section with a corridor that looked a lot like the one in the part of heralds collegium that held the student rooms except the corridor was much narrower he couldnt help but notice the very heavy doors to each room the thick walls as evidenced by the narrowness of the corridor and the odd atmosphere of the place it felt as if everything was slightly wrong somehow as if what he was seeing was not what anyone else saw that made no sense on the face of it but if the people kept here were all mad well maybe that was the literal truth what they saw was nothing like what he was seeing sounds were muffled and the air feltnot stale exactly but as if it never moved how many people ye got i here he asked in a whisper it felt as if he should whisper as if there were things here he didnt want to wake up around ten most of them arent as bad as lunatic most of them we can help said bear with a sigh not all of them got a woman who killed her babies thinking they were demonpossessed now she knows they werent so now she keeps trying to kill herself i dont know what theyre going do about her husband wants her sent home so that she can kill herself says its only fair that shed hang for murder now that she knows what she did so we might as well let her hang herself the healers dont want that to happen so they keep her here she just keeps getting worse mindhealers cant do anything with her now mags winced nothin good gonna come of that no matter what keep er turn er loose whatever even if she stops tryin t kill herself law might hang er i know makes me glad im not a mindhealer here we are they stopped in front of one of the doors and bear took out a key to unlock it not sure what you want to do but based on how the mindhealers reacted id be careful about dropping shields i can get them back up for you faster than you can for yourself said dallen dallen reckons he kin help mags reported good thats something the mindhealers didnt have bear swung the door open and they went inside the room was absolutely stark and bare although mags got the feeling that this was because of the occupant rather than some omission on the healers part the only furnishings were a bed a table and two chairs all were made of metal and bolted to the floor the table and chairs were under the window the bed pushed up against the wall the walls were utterly smooth and featurelessif nails had been used to put them up there was no sign of them no way to pry one out of the wall and use it as a weapon or to harm yourself nevertheless walls floor and ceiling were all a soft soothing roseocher color and someone had carefully painted wonderful designs on them in darker rose and cream the single window in the wall had a metal grate with small holes in it bolted over it protecting the thick glass panes from the occupant it looked out over a bit of garden the foreigner was on the bed at the head of it curled up in the corner against the wall his back was wedged into the corner his arms were wrapped around his legs and his chin was propped on his knees he regarded them with unfocused and uninterested eyes how are you doing today bear asked the man blinked once or twice and mumbled something mags couldnt make out it didnt sound valdemaran you really need to try and speak a language i can understand bear said gently i cant help you if i cant understand you the man muttered something else mags wasnt getting anything at all from him through full shields so cautiously he dropped the first one very faintly he began to sense something now the good thing about mindspeech was that it was always in a language you understoodwhich only made sense really since it was thought to thought and shouldnt need a translator and right away mags understood why the mindhealers hadnt wanted anything to do with this man if it was true that they had to drop all their shields in order to treat him first there was the dim sense of incredible fear then came the mans thoughts which were strangely enough completely organized and circular it was almost prayerlike as if the repeating loop kept whatever the man was afraid of away the problem was this was babble babble with an undertone of stark terror mags was getting that panicked fear even through very good shields and mindhealers tended to be empaths people who picked up emotions rather than thoughts it would have been torture for them to encounter that much sustained terror and then to have that babble running around in your headassuming they were also mindspeakerswell he would have thrown up his hands and walked off too and all the things that are not there they flock and fly and stare and stare and all their eyes are big and bright and burn away the dark of night and there is nowhere left to hide theyre everywhere they get inside and even though they are not there theyre watching watching everywhere and more and more come every day oh gods i wish theyd go away and all the things that are not there they flock and fly and stare and stare mags got the thoughts just like that as a kind of poem which maybe made sense since almost all the books the foreigners had left behind them had been of poetry hes babblin about things that aint there how they stare at im and wont go way how theyve even got inside im mags reported with confidence thas basically it same thing over an over i think he thinks th words keep th eyes outa his head es still seein things w eyes starin at im an more of em all the time es jest scared bout to death thats more than anyone else got from him bear said thoughtfully andyes unless i drug him to sleep hes always frightened his heart is always racing so hes still on about the eyes i dont think theres any doubt lena was right i am going to have to dig deeper in the archives fer what something that will shut offwell whatever it is that he has that is attracting these things bear said mags blinked at him ye mean ye think he aint seein things that aint there es seein things that are best explanation i can come up with bear replied ive tried just about everything else that would shut down a hallucination so whats left they arent hallucinations huh said mags they went out leaving the poor man to his horde of invisible tormentors chapter the moment mags woke up he knew by the sinking feeling in his chest that there was trouble and it was aimed at him again and once he knew that he could feel it all over again that pressure of unfriendly accusatory regard out there wha happened whiles i was asleep he asked dallen immediately he squeezed his eyes closed forcing down the nausea that this called up in him dear gods he hated hated this in a way it was worse than anything hed endured at the mine there at least no one had actually hated him the damned foreseers had more of their visions dallen replied with disgust still just as vague except that one of them said he saw you specifically with your hands covered in blood and nothing but you and it was someone whod come to see the kirball game and knows what you look like so we cant wonder if it is a case of mistaken identity so its all to do all over again mags tightened his jaw dammit he felt his spirits sinking lower felt that certainty that it just wasnt even worth getting out of bed anymore knew it couldn last maybe what he ought to do is just give in to the depression and curl up in bed and never get out again thats all right well weather this just do as you did before keep quiet and stick with the team they all know you better than anyone but me you can do this mags dont let these fools make you give up as long as your team is around you no one will do or probably even say anything if dallen was picking up on his despair the companion wasnt actually addressing it directly but theyll think it mags replied the nausea the ache all coming back an theyll talk about it behind m back he got the sense that dallen would like to help but had no idea how to it was the same old thing all over again with the difference that this time hed been seen with blood on his hands blood on his hands was it a metaphor if it was then in a sense every herald had or would have blood on his hands they were often responsible for life and death decisions their judgments condemned people what they uncovered condemned people messages they carried condemned people and of course they fought in battles alongside the guard that after all was what kirball was about preparation for war so all heralds would have blood on their hands eventually for that matter hed already been responsible for people dying there were the murdered mine kids he hadnt been able to prove were even dead and most of all there was that crazy killer that had kidnapped bear that man was dead literally at his hands who was to say that this socalled vision wasnt about the past rather than about the future it was so unfair for a long long time he contemplated the idea of just not bothering anymore of turning his face to the wall and telling the whole world to hang but dallen wouldnt let him and anyway if he just sank into depression and gave up what would that do to dallen that would pile being unfair to the one creature that had always been good to him on top of the general unfairness of the universe he dragged himself out of bed reluctantly and prepared to face the ordeal of breakfast it was not quite the ordeal it had been the first time all those wretched foreseers had spread their stories since the trainees of his team had already gotten wind of what was up and had filled in the others as they waited for mags but once again he was getting the suspicious looks and once again certain folk who were dubious of anything that was not valdemaran were allowing their prejudices free range how stupid was that why should where your parents came from have anything to do with whether you were a good or a bad person especially when you couldnt even remember them unfairness piled on top of unfairness he managed to get through the day unconsciously taking that hunchedover defensive hunted posture the whole time he didnt even realize what he was doing until he straightened up for kirball practice and felt his muscles unkink but that didnt stop his mind from sending his body right into that same posture again once practice was over over the next two days things remained the same with the same wakingtosleeping tension the only good thing was that the weather was warming up enough that when he wasnt in class or at practice he could study out of doors so that was where he took his books and stayed until there wasnt enough light to read by hidden in some little cluster of bushes in companions field that kept him out of his room in the stable where he would sense the thoughts of everyone who came near the stable it was very peaceful out there any sounds from the palace and collegia were muffled any spilledover thoughts too distant to bother him actually it was more than peacefuleven though it was a bit lonely still hed always been lonely and only during the past halfyear had he been anything but lonely you just didnt make friends at the mine even the kiddies hed sporadically helped hadnt been friends as he packed up his books to go back to his room and try to sleep he thought about that this time last year he was at the mine he remembered very well how he had welcomed the warmth after the killing cold and welcomed other things toobecause spring meant all sorts of things were edible that were not later and if you could get away into some of the forest around the mine and you knew what to look for you could find them strange how last spring he had been as close as he ever got at the mine to being happy but hed had a belly full of greens almost every night and back at the mine a full belly meant you were happy lionstooth was sweet when it first came up not bitter and it was one of the heartiest weeds there was so there was a lot of it cattail root was delicious but impossible to harvest in the winter unless you wanted your feet frozen solid and you had to be sure you were getting it and not water iris which was poisonous there were tiny wild onions too mushrooms though you had to be careful of those as well sorrel the tips of birch twigs brooklime clover cowpea mustard violets pigweed sowthistle jewelweed shepherds purse pokeberry plaintain knotweed and very young nettles there were other things you could eat if they were cooked but how could any of the mineslaves get a fire much less a pot so they had to confine themselves to what could be eaten raw with so many years of mine workers foraging nearby there were no berries within a reasonable distance of the mine and the most obviously edible things were also long ago grubbed up and eaten but if you knew what you were looking for and you were prepared to graze like a goose spring was the one season when you could actually go to sleep with a full belly if you could slip away for a while now this spring he could sleep with a full belly every nightif only his belly wasnt so knotted up with tension that it was hard to eat anything at all such irony as one day turned into another he found the field to be his new sanctuary safer even than his room or the heraldic archives as he would sit studying sometimes his attention would be taken by one of the things he would immediately have pounced on and devoured this time last year and he was reminded that no matter how uncomfortable things were they were so much better than they could have been he might not have survived this past winter even if he had right now he would have been half starved always tired always afraid but it was hard very hard to try to keep his spirits up the constant weight of unfriendly regard on him wore his spirit down it was harder still to have to come to meals and the occasional study session with bear and see poor lena lena had gone from bright and happyeven if her happiness had a false cause it was real happinessto crushed and bewildered that first little informal concert had been the last that mags had been invited to and he supposed the last that lena had been invited to participate in with the dark stories in the wind again bard marchand had pulled back from mags abruptly not even acknowledging that he knew the trainee if they happened to cross paths and that meant lena was no longer of any use to him she didnt say anything but mags could tell by the way she drooped and looked forlorn that her father had once again abandoned her as well as mags he actually felt worse for her than he did for himself he wouldnt have said anything to lena about it though but bear brought it up actually bear brought it up several times and finally one night wouldnt let go asking her whats wrong until she finally answered i never see father anymore she said unhappily i dont know why or what i did to offend him but i never see him at all now and he doesnt reply to my notes and again mags wouldnt have said anything but bear had evidently had enough of this he got that stubborn look on his face pushed his lenses up on his nose with one finger and leaned over the table he wont see you because mags is in peoples bad books again and therefore mags isnt on the list of people he looks good knowing bear said bluntly all he ever wanted was to meet up with mags and make it look as if mags was a friend of his you were nothing more than his way to get to mags easily he just doesnt care about you lena all he ever cared was that everyone would know that he knew the kirball star and the hero of the hour because he collects people like that just to get an advantage lena turned shocked eyes on him howwhy would you say such a thing she cried looking as if she was about to cry father neverfather wouldnthes a famous bard why would he do something like that mags sighed he couldnt leave bear to take this one alone hes sayin it cause its true he said nobody wanted t tell ye but thets what hes like lena looked from him to bear and back again stricken dumb lena what has he ever done for you for your family besides remind them once a year how lucky they are that he married into your house bear urged where does his money come from your family and whatever gifts he gets from his patrons does he ever send any of that back no who got you your first music lessons him no your ma who saw to it that a bard heard you play and sing so you could get sent here him youd think that would be natural wouldnt you once he found out you were a musician but no it wasnt him it was your grandpa you told us that yourself had he ever heard you sing and play before you got here no did e even recognize ye when e sent me off on that errant mags added softly not thet i noticed in fact you was pretty upset bout it at th time an fer a goodly while after i fact you was upset bout it right up till he started payin tention to ye aye bear took lena gently by the shoulders and shook her a little lena think think about it havent you felt him using the gift on you a little and using his personality on you a lot to get you to forget all that havent you felt him pressing you to worship him the way amily worships her pa he didnt let her answer he looked at mags instead tell her i have dallen said sadly of course that is unethical but he used his gift so little that he could always claim he didnt realize he was doing it because he wanted his daughters regard back and he would probably be believed dallen says he has mags told her cept of course amilys pa deserves thet sorta worship aye ye jest haveta see im with her how much he takes carea her how he makes sure shes all right afore he goes an does things mebbe he gotta thinka valdemar an th king first but he makes sure someone is lookin out fer amily like master soren an lydia yer pa he ever make sure ye got so much as a spare harpstring he aint done nothin t deserve nothin from ye if ye was t ask me he never done nothin t get ye here an aside of that one concert never done nothing for ye when ye got here never made sure you was all right never made sure there was someone t watch out fer ye you have the gift too lena bear urged use it shake off what he did to you and see him a hundred emotions all negative ones chased themselves across lenas faceand then her face crumpled she buried it in her hands and sobbed i thought he loved me she wept into her hands i thought he finally loved me both bear and mags made a move to hold her mags pulled back and gestured to bear to comfort her pushing his lenses up on his nose he pulled her into his shoulder and let her sob one day someone is going to not get charmed and beat the stuffing out of him bear said in a growl and the sooner that day comes the better but let me tell you something lena one day when people say bard marchand it will be you they are thinking about and not him and one day when someone says tobias marchand others will wrinkle their foreheads and say dont you mean lena and theyll have to be reminded that tobias happened to be the father of the really truly famous bard marchand mags nodded in silent agreement families bear added in tones that indicated that something more had shortened his temper than just having to work with difficult patients whas got ye riled mags asked bear sighed lena sobbed on oblivious to what they were saying well mags couldnt blame her this was a horrible blow to her here she thought her father had finally noticed her was impressed by her and had come to love her the fact that all these emotions had been created in her by her father in order to manipulate her was probably unbearable right now got a letter from my family he growled my brothers turning up head of the sweetwater house of healing if you please and hes going to demand that i do my duty to the family come home and get married on midsummer and start spawning babies they still havent given up on that lenas sobs were easing off she sniffed wetly and bear offered her a scrap of clean cloth she took it pulled away from him and he reluctantly let her go mmaybe you just ought to go along with that for a llittle she said with a faint stammer at least your family cares about you and if you just give them what they want for a moon or two you can come back here i dont want that girl bear snarled sounding startlingly like his namesake i dont love her i am not going to get shackled up to some girl i hardly know just so my parents can be grandparents and its not as if they arent already because they are if i marry anyone its going to be someone i love and would do anything for not someone my parents picked out because theyre neighbors someone like he paused never mind it just wont be her lena stared at him startled by his vehemence he looked down at his hands sorry that kind of just jumped out nothin t be sorry fer mags offered he shook his head sometimes it seems like we all oughta just run away from here anan thats when i run out cause i dunno what wed do t keep ourselves fed an housed up i could always be an animal healer bear said sourly at least animals are always grateful to you nobody thinks youre secondrate because you treat them with medicine instead of a gift animal healers are always in demand i could be a traveling minstrel lena answered wiping her eyes and blowing her nose im good enough for that right now maybe we should do that run away and do that show them all mags shrugged i got nothin all i knows mine work jest end up i the same situation jest wi a better master mebbe i misdoubt master cole was th ony mine owner t treat is miners thet way and lena sighed traveling minstrels starve a lot she said forlornly and my father still wouldnt notice or care well then bear said stolidly no running away they all sighed and looked at one another as mags made his way back to his room in the stable that night he resolved one thing he was going to at least ask kings own nikolas if he could help bear if of course he could ever see the man he decided to take the bull by the hornsor at least the heifer he was going to help amily that evening since nikolas hadnt shown up at his room or even given any indication that he was ever going to continue the lessons again so he would ask the one person who surely knew where her father was lissen he said before they got down to work gotta ast ye somethin she raised her eyes to look at him of course she replied i need t see yer pa nikolas he said looking her in the eyes she looked away but laughed though it wasnt exactly the laughter of someone who was hearing a joke we all need to see him she told him still not looking at him he has become a phantom i know hes still here in haven because dirty plates and filthy uniforms appear in our rooms and have to be taken away but i havent actually seen him personally in the last few days ever since th new set a visions mags thought bleakly aye that figgers bet he reckons its me after all an hes tryin t find a way t stop me well when ye do tell im i need t see im he pleaded its pretty important if i see him i will amily replied looking uneasy and maybe a little guilty but sometimes he does this and i dont see him forwell once it was for three moons well that would be a bit too late but it would be ungracious to act like a boor about it amily couldnt help what her father thought or did all right he replied thenkee now hand me my share aye she did so and he couldnt help but note that her hand was shaking a little as she did it bears place at lunch was empty for a moment mags had the crazy thought that bears brother had arrived and essentially kidnapped his siblingbut no that wouldnt be possible would it surely no one here would allow that dallen he asked first before voicing the question aloud no clue the companion replied let me ask some of the othersthough mind you we usually dont know whats going on up at healers collegium they have good shields and dont leak much anybody know where bear is he asked aloud his only response was headshakes well there was no point in worrying about it bear was often called away this was probably just another one of those times they were almost done with the meal when bear turned up finally looking bad ragged he dropped down into his seat and stared dully at his empty plate a plate which gennie and mags took filled with the leftovers and shoved in front of him eat said gennie hes dead bear said mechanically picking up a fork and getting a mouthful i dont understand it he just died he shouldnt have died i was crazycareful about dosages and combinations i tested everything on myself first he stopped as if he had said too much no one else seemed to notice the gaff they were all staring at him in puzzlement who died halleck asked lunatic bear said dully the crazy foreigner i just dont understand it i thought i had his fear and his heart rate under control he was fine last night i made sure he took everything the new stuff i gave him was working at least i think it was there were moments when he was even coming out of that fearfit he was in oh him halleck shrugged bear i know he was your patient and you have to feel bad about that and i know that the senior healers trusted him to you to treat but face it they only did that because they couldnt do anything with him theyd already given up on getting him sane and everyone else had given up on getting any information out of him so its not as if its a tragic loss halleck trailed off seeing that he wasnt getting through to bear mags knew why entirely apart from the fact that bear took the care of every patient he had very seriously there was the implication that his skills were nowhere near as sharp as he and everyone else had thought failure put him one step closer to being hauled home and his brother was due here any day and mags hadnt exactly done anything about getting nikolas to intercede for him of course that was because nikolas wasnt anywhere to be found but that was beside the point he hunched over a little with guilt and finished his lunch in a hurry m sorry bear he mumbled as he got up to leave i don think twas yer fault if thet means anythin bear didnt even look up mags heard the shouting long before he got to healers collegium one voice was bears the other was very like bears just deeper the accent was even the same which pretty much identified who it was bears brother was here and now you see what happens when you think you can muck around with midwife potions and try to do what only a skilled and gifted healer can shouted the deeper voice you are in way over your head bear we should never have allowed you to come here you let a few early successes go to your head and they made you think you could actually do what only a real healer can and now you see the result you managed to kill a valuable asset to the crown mags hesitated should he leave he had no right to listen to this but he couldnt seem to make his feet move i didnt bah dont tell me that i know you i can read you like a mindspeaker even you think you killed him there was steel in that voice the steel of someone who was absolutely certain he was in the right and no one was going to tell him any differently its time you stopped mucking about with potions and accepted your responsibility to the family you are coming home and getting married if you want to spend your time dosing animals when you get there fine but no more of this herbs can replace a healer idiocy good gods that medicine chest notionthat is appalling how many more people do you want to kill with that theyd die anyway bear shouted back at least this way they have a chance you dont know that in fact its far more likely that they wouldnt die without all those leaves and roots because they would be wise and send for a healer right away instead of mucking about with beans and flowers until its too late for a real healer to save them the circle the circle will see it my way after this the brother said scornfully killing a patient tends to make them wake up and take the blinkers off so you just resign yourself to doing what you are told for a change and start packing theres going to be a wedding at midsummer if i have to drag you to the altar tied up silence the slamming of a door then the sound of something breaking slowly carefully mags approached the door to bears conservatory he tapped gingerly on the window bear opened the door and glared at him i suppose you overheard all that he snapped the young healer trainee was disheveled and redfaced with anger his hair looked like a bird had made a nest in it i gotta think yer whole collegium overheard thet mags said tentatively bear snorted i mags hesitated i dunno what i kin do t help bear exploded well you should have thought of that when i first told you about it you should have gone to herald nikolas and gotten him to help me but no you selfish pig all you could think about was being a kirball hero and how persecuted you are and making everyone feel sorry for you that was so unjust it took mags breath away bear had clearly worked himself up into a towering temper its all about you isnt it its always all about you the incredible savage mineorphan who now gets invited to private bardic concerts and hobnobs with the kings own the big champion of some stupid game that somehow makes him a hero bears eyes were dark and furious and now here you are all so hurt and persecuted because a couple of idiots have a bad dream and a couple more idiots believe it and now everyone feels sorry for you and tries to make you feel better and they dont give a hang about whats happened to the rest of us while you mope around feeling so sorry for yourself mags could only stand there stunned his chest getting tight and his throat getting choked meanwhile people who are actually running themselves ragged doing things to try and help people are told theyre useless and fools and theyre going to kill people and they just have to come home and stop mucking about with mudpies and take care of sheep and goats because no one cares if a sheep or a goat dies mags opened his mouth but nothing came out his words felt cut off in his throat bear glared at him and the look in bears eyes was very like hatred the hell with you bear shouted you cant even be bothered to help a friend i hopei hopeoh bah he slammed the door in mags face mags blinked feeling a welter of emotion rising in him anger because nothing about that was true or justified indignation but mostly grief now even bear had abandoned him how alone did that make him he wanted to wrench the door open and give bear back as good as hed gottenbut he couldnt think of anything to counter what bear said you dont know what ive been trying to do for youwell yes but there was only his word for that and it was pretty clear that bear would just think he was lying i never wanted any attentionwell bear clearly didnt believe that now and saying so wouldnt change anything how long had this been festering inside his friend or not friend anymore he wanted to turn to dallen for comfort but what if bear was right it didnt feel to him like bear was right but how would he know and would dallen actually tell him or just make soothing noises amily wouldnt talk to him now except about commonplaces his teachers were avoiding anything but their subjects with him the team never talked about anything but kirball around him now bear and nikolas had nikolas really vanished or was he only invisible to mags he had to think the latter that meant the only real friend he had left apart from dallen was lena and now that lena knew her father had only used her to get to mags how could she ever want to stay friends with him worse still once bear told her that mags hadnt lifted a finger to help him stay why would she want to stay friends with him she wouldnt of course who would i would the depression in dallens mindvoice took him aback mags you are not a bad person i believe that there is a good explanation for what the foreseers saw i do not believe that you would ever harm the king or anyone that didnt try to hurt you or your friends first i believe that you have done all that was in your power to help lena and bear and all your friends i believe that youre bout the only one then mags couldnt help but respond there was a long pause unfortunately you may be right chapter there was no practice today and the members of the team had scattered to the four winds to enjoy their free day in picnics and trips to the market in haven and other enjoyable pursuits bear was not speaking to him at all last mags had heard the healers circle had not bent to the will of bears brother nearly as readily as that worthy had assumed they would but there were certainly some questions about bears dosages and skill with herbs and willingness to call in help and a thorough investigation was underway concerning the lunatics death of course none of this satisfied bear in the least or did anything to keep his brother from insisting that he was going back home amily was nowhere to be found she had not shown up in the archives for three days running and when mags had dared to try the quarters that she and her father shared the servants said she had been gone for that long she often went to stay with lydia when her father was absent so they told him but at this point he was not at all certain of any sort of welcome at master sorens house either so he didnt even try to find her there lena so the disapproving proctor said had closed herself in her room again and wasnt speaking to anyone mags couldnt tell if the proctor disapproved of him of lena closing herself off from everyone and halfstarving herself because she was unhappy or felt he was to blame for her behavior maybe all three right now less than a candlemark to sunset mags was standing on the stone bridge over the terilee river watching the water rush by beneath him and wondering despondently if drowning hurt very much drowned people looked peaceful well except for the staring eyes yes dallen said interrupting his morose thoughts yes it does very much he sighed caint find nothin quick or thet doesnt hurt them flyspeck shrooms hurt a lot too and so does water iris there aint no cliffs round here t toss myself off they closed up bell tower so ye caint throw yerself outa there ony th palace towersre tall nuff an no chance me getting inta onea them towers stop that dallen ordered desperately dont talk like that you arent going to drown yourself or throw yourself off a tower or eat poison you are my chosen and we have each other we will get through this right now he was so far from imagining how they would that not even dallen could persuade him ye heard theyre talkin bout black companions again an bout black heralds ev crazy idea they had afore they got goin now an peoplere startin t think bout takin em all serious someones even floatin the ideer that theres some kinda second soulr somethin in me an its hidin behind me an controllin me an you people are listenin an he couldnt go on and it wasnt as if dallen wasnt already aware of this what mags knew he knew and he probably knew a lot more than mags did in fact he was starting to spend an awful lot of time by himself in companions field as if even the other companions were starting to doubt him and his chosen yed be better off wout me he said dully go choose someone else aint nobodyd miss me and plentyd be happy t get rida a big problem an i know damn well ye kin choose agin specially if im so bad rotten its all right there i those archives an reports i been sortin through he felt his throat closing up hellfires im startin t believe all them stories dont be ridiculous you are not bad look at everything youve done it was all to help people reckon bear n lenad argue wi ye exercise dallen said desperately we need something to take our minds off this the kirball field will be empty lets take the fastest run we can over that a hard workout the sort of thing we cant do with the team mags was about to object then sighed he just didnt have the will to fight dallen on this it wouldnt help anything but it wouldnt hurt anything either and it might exhaust both of them enough so that their minds stopped spinning in the endless circle of we have to prove were innocent but it hasnt happened yet so how can we prove were innocent but we have to prove were innocent mags was irresistibly reminded of the poor lunatics mind and how it kept going round and round the same cycle of words aye an mebbe thas what makes me snap an kill the king that would be an irony of monumental proportionsthat the very suspicion and hostility that was being heaped on him was what would cause him to lose his mind and turn into some sort of insane killer so the people that were the ones convinced he would do this thing in defiance of all logic and past behavior would be the very ones to make him into the monster that would do it in the first place he thought about trying to put that to someone in authority but who nikolas had vanished the king certainly wouldnt see him herald caelan was only the head of the collegium not someone who had any sort of say in what went out outside it and anyone else would likely laugh at him or think that this was yet more evidence of his unstableor evilnature well being exhausted would not be bad and although there was no way he was going to go into the collegium and take a hot bath afterwards it was just warm enough to do the same thing in one of the field ponds without freezing to death plus if he put a hot brick in his bed to warm it up the combination of being chilled from the bath and the exhaustion and getting into a warm bed would put him right to sleep mind that would do nothing about the nightmares he hadnt had a night that was free of them since all this started and the last of bears nightmare potion was long gone even if anyone else at healers collegium had known how to make it the question was whether he was going to trust them enough to drink something theyd concocted bear was very popular among the healers and while they might have some qualms about his skills they had none about his personality and very little about his right to be here they probably all blamed him for not using his influence on nikolas too so would he trust something that had been made by someone who wanted to punish him prolly not theyd be as like t give me somethin that made the nightmares worse or jest somethin t give me a bellyache but hed heard worse ideas than dallens all right but its gettin on t twilight itll be hard for ye t see i don want ye to hurt yersel strain a tendon or summat thatd jest be the end teamd never forgive me dallens mindvoice was full of relief all the better to simulate oh a battle thats going long a sneak attack by the enemy on our camp oroh something else going wrong around twilight ill be able to see well enough besides we know that field like i know my stall we could probably run it in a night of moondark all right mags agreed reluctantly ill come saddle ye ifn thets what ye really want he left the bridge and trudged down to the stable and selected a saddle and bridle from among dallens neatlystored tack it should be neatly stored hed spent enough time cleaning mending and putting it away today he didnt actually saddle dallen so much as strap on a very light riding pad meant to keep companion and chosen from chafing each other and as close to riding bareback as you could come and as usual the special bitless bridle light and well worn and comfortable as bridle made of ribbon for him dallen was impatient and instead of walking they galloped down to the kirball field where already the setting sun was turning things a bright redgold there was no one there not even one of the groundskeepers this of course was exactly what mags wanted no one around he relaxed a very little not much but a little is there a particular route and obstacle set you want to take dallen asked dancing in place to loosen up his hocks and warm up his muscles yer choice mags replied settling himself in dallens saddle in the one place in which he still felt at home you were the one that wanted t do this so you figger out what ye wanta do im jest the baggage he hunched himself down low over dallens neck and rested part of his weight in the lightweight stirrups so that he could shift it at a moments notice the instant that dallen sensed he was ready he gathered himself and launched himself at one of the goals as if he had seen a starting flag go down mags shifted his weight smoothly as dallen dodged imaginary foes and headed for the goal at his top speed he didnt gallop up and down the ramp either he repeated the move that had won them the north flag making a huge straining leap for the top of the goal managing to scramble up it anyhow as mags shifted his weight practically over the companions neck whipping around on his hindquarters and leaping back down again from there it was a highspeed scramble over the hillocks of the bad side mags kept in tune with him shifting his weight to assist as they plunged toward the other goal dallen glanced to the side mags felt the turn coming dallen pivoted to the right jumped down into a gully and scrambled up the other side like a goat at the top he leapt into the air and did the sort of kickout that he would do if there were soldiers right behind them warhorses did this sort of thing too but they had to have the signal from their riders companions didnt need signals because they could think but they did need to be perfectly in tune with their chosen so that the human wouldnt fall off or otherwise botch the maneuver mags rode it out as easily as if he was sitting on a chair when dallen came down again he flung himself at top speed at the ramp galloping up to the top and back down again then wheeled and did it again wheeled and did it a third time coming to an abrupt halt on the top of the goal where the flag would be there he reared and hopped forward three steps flailing with his forehooves the entire timenasty strokes that would bash in the face and helm of anyone foolish enough to be in front of him mags clung to his back like a burr and with a mad leap they were off again this time it was a bit of steeplechase with dallen running neckornothing at every obstacle in the field and vaulting it cleanly no matter how wrongly he came at it they zigzagged over the field that way ending up back at their start where he leapt and releapt the highest hedge in the field a bit of brush that had been there long long before this section of the grounds had been made into the kirball field he was over and over it four times like a goat or a rabbit then wheeled as neat as you please and made for the boundaries this time it was a straight run along the fences so close that mags leg brushed the wood not that there were no obstacles hereno there were ditches and gullies to leap or scramble through those wretched hillocks to negotiate bits of fence and hedge to get around or over but this was good practice for war as well as kirball horses didnt like fences and running along one had the strong potential of making them spook or at least nervy the only things that there werent here on the kirball field things that you might find on a bad piece of ground were big boulders even the goals were made of stuff that looked like stone but wasnt this was because accidents happened and a horse or a companion running full tilt into rock would be dead and maybe rider or trainee with him there was turf there was dusty dirt and mud and soft sand but there was no rock anywhere in the field except for pebbles in the bottoms of the gullies and even those were softened by sand the full circuit of the boundary they went and dallen was just fully warm now with maybe half a candlemark or more of this in him mags was sweating but somewhere in the back of his mind he knew that dallen had been right that this was exactly what they needed to do to get their minds clear at least for a little bit the last light of the sun was gone and the blue dim of twilight on them mags felt dallen decide for a gully scramble taking the field as he had before but the low road rather than the high running through the ditches and gullies instead of leaping them dallen wheeled and made for the nearest which was barely big enough to fit them mags felt the walls of the ditch brush his legs and made himself even smaller on dallens back up and out of the ditch and then down into the next along it for three lengths until it ended and then up and down into a twisting bit of natural runoff gully with better sides but worse footing dallen gathered himself leapt and came down again in a third ditch scrambled along it and scrambled out again at the end he wheeled intending to execute an uphill leap and scramble taking an obstacle the opposite way from what was intended starting low and ending high it was a mad maneuver for a horse only slightly less mad for most companions but mags knew this of old and was ready for it and a blow to his mind knocked all sense and all preparation out of him it was a scream of incredible rage hate loathinga howl that was only mental but nevertheless it was like a dagger through the eyes mags mind had brushed up against something murderous so vicious it was like a swipe of razorsharp claws across his mind he cried out without meaning to and the thing was gone but the damage was done dallen had been caught and thrown off in midstride he came down wrong on his leap blundered and slipped felt himself toppling felt mags about to go headfirst into the ditch where he would surely break his neck mags felt the jump go wrong felt dallen falling out from under him knew he was not balanced at all could not get his balance and saw his own death coming at him too fast to stop then dallen somehow flung himself over sideways mags found a balancepoint instinctively kicked himself free of the stirrups and tumbled off to the side just as he heard the terrible double crack of both of dallens forelegs breaking and felt as well as heard dallens scream of agony he convulsed dallen thank the gods was paralyzed by the pain he screamed too mentally as well as physically dropping all his shields and shrieking a mindless call for help he scrambled on hands and knees to dallen and weeping sat on dallens shoulder so he wouldnt thrash clasping his hands around the breaks to make sure they didnt get worse he could feel the bones grating under his hands but they hadnt broken the skin and meanwhile he screamed for help again and again until his mind felt as raw as his throat dallen was voiceless now mentally as well as physically paralyzed by the pain his sides heaving and his breath wheezing through clenched teeth this was a killing injury for a horse any horse that had broken both legs like this unless he was extraordinary indeed would be put down theyd done that to one of the mine ponies once even though master cole was a man who would haveand didwork his ponies until their hooves were worn down to the frog and their hocks and knees were as swollen as ripe squash finally after what must only have been a few heartbeats but felt like an eternity rescuers swarmed the field a flood of lanterns poured down the hill from the collegia people shouting at one another to get this and bring that they leaped the fence and completely overran the two on the ground shoving mags carelessly off dallen he stood up and was further shoved off to the side and kicked when he didnt move fast enough healers were there first and in moments had shunted much of dallens pain away blocking the part of his mind that felt it when the pain had been eased they grabbed his forelegs in the light of the lanterns and the bones were quickly aligned properly and roughly splinted to keep everything in place mags shut down his shields hugged himself and shivered weeping without any shame all he could think about was dallen and how this surely was all his fault he should have been smart enough to see this was a bad idea his eyes poured hot tears he could scarcely breathe his chest hurt so much he would have given anything to take the last candlemark back more men came running bringing a huge pieces of wood and metal and more lights once they could see they assembled an enormous frame of beams and bars and pulleys while the healers continued to keep dallen eased some of the rescuers dug under dallens body to slip a sling under him then bit by painful bit he was hoisted up until there was no weight resting on his legs at all and he dangled from the frame like a trussed chicken in a market now two of the huge patient horses that hauled enormous carts were brought up they normally towered over dallen by a good four to six hands his sling was fastened to their harness so that they carried his weight he was let down off the frame so that they carried him between them like two men carrying an injured fellow between them on a stretcher they moved off mags followed speechless with grief and guilt behind them the men disassembled the frame as quickly as they had put it together the sound of hammers followed them up the hill they made their way step by painful step toward healers collegium it took another eternity and every step was as painful to mags as if he walked on knives as if it was his legs that were broken and not dallens he wished that they had been he wished with all his might that dallen had not saved him no came the gasping mindvoice feebly was worth it but this was all his fault he knew that going that hard and fast over the course was bad enough by day and yet he had agreed to it and it had been his mind that the other had brushed against he was too open it was his fault he must have let some shields down without realizing it it was all all his fault and he could never say he was sorry enough to make up for this limping bruised and bleeding heavily from a cut on his forehead mags followed ignored by everyone intent on getting dallen safely into his stall in a special small area at healers collegium a little stable especially for injured companions who were too badly hurt to be in their own stalls when after an agonizingly long time they finally reached the stable it was to find the waiting stall already prepared there was another sling arranged on the rafters above the stall one with a pulley so that dallen could be let down from time to time to sleep on his side but now he was transferred to this sling the big patient horses were led away heads nodding with each step they took healers swarmed over the companion properly setting his legs then encasing them in strips of cloth dipped in plaster wound around and around them so there was no way for the broken bones to move then a bottle was thrust between dallens teeth and he raised his head head and neck trembling so the contents poured down his throat then he set his chin down into a second sling so that his head didnt have to dangle and let the drugs take over and slowly for the first time since dallen had chosen him dallens mindpresence faded from mags mind leaving only a vague and undefined something in the back of his head mags curled up in a miserable heap on the straw in dallens stall crying silently dallen hung from the sling like a lifeless chunk of meat and only the slow heaving of his sides and the vague presence still like an echo in the back of his mind gave him any indication that dallen was even alive all he wanted to do was die how could even a companion survive something like this without being crippled for life if he hadnt been so so stupid so despondent dallen would never have suggested the reckless run if he hadnt been so careless as to let down his shields even though he didnt remember doing so this wouldnt have happened if only he had insisted on not doing this at all or insisted on stopping as soon as the last sun vanished it wouldnt have happened it was all his fault a heavy horrible silence hung over everything here a silence that was not even broken by his sobbing he had learned the hard way how to cry silently a long time ago so when lena came running into the stall his presence took them both by surprise he sat up at the sound of frantically running footsteps and turned toward the stall door and lenas shocked face stopped the breath in his body and the sobs in his throat da she began then registered his presence her face changed from anguished distress towell he couldnt read it mags what is wrong with you how could you have been so horrible you arent stupid you knew better than to run that course in the dark why did you do this to dallen burst out of her her voice shrill with accusation why did you hurt him well it looked as if he was not the only person to blame himself i didn do it he snapped without thinking lashing back defensively he went in an instant from anguished to angry it sounded as if she thought he had taken a crowbar to dallens legs it were a horrible accident we was runnin obstacles ansomething why were you running obstacles in the dark she retorted interrupting him before he could tell her about the murderous mind he had brushed up against her cheeks red with fury how stupid is that what were you thinking why did you make dallen do that i didn make him do anything mags shouted back then glanced guiltily at the poor hanging companion if he hadnt been so low would dallen ever have suggested such a thing e was the one that said we should do it did he want to or were you so drowning in feeling sorry for yourself that he would do anything no matter how stupid it was to get you out of it she shouted back bear was right you dont care about anything but yourself you wont even take responsibility for this youre horrible youre a horrible horrible person and you probably are going to try and kill the king because anyone that would do this to dallen would do anything he almost jumped up out of the straw and hit her he did jump to his feet and he had to fight with himself not to hit her or grab her by the shoulders and shake her until her teeth rattled or shove her to the ground his hands clenched and unclenched his chest heaved and hurt and his head spun in circles and the awful thought went through his mind then that if dallen died if dallen died he wouldnt care about anything he would go crazy if he could have to fight not to hurt lena right now there would be nothing holding him back if that happened hed just want everything else to hurt as much as he did and no matter who it was that was in front of him at that momentif they came at him the way lena was now there was no telling what he would do to them maybe that was it maybe that was what the foreseers had seen the moment when he snapped and did the unthinkable meanwhile words awful hurtful words poured out of his mouth and he could do nothing to stop them get out ye worthless bint he screamed back at her ye get in ere on the strength of yer pas reputation an ye caint even sing a simple song in front of people wiout sommun holdin yer hand an tellin ye wot ter do an ye dare tell me all thet stuff ye close yersel in yer room an sulk fer days evtime summat goes wrong ye make half yer collegium try and cosset ye back t actin like somethin other than a wee babby an ye tell me i am th one thet ony keers fer hisself ye tell me i am th selfish one aye the world circles round poor wee lena an aint nothin else matters not even though mbest friend broke both is legs savin me tis all bout you get out leave me alone her mouth hanging open she stared at him as if she couldnt believe what she had just heard then with a sob that wrenched its way out of her chest she whirled and ran for the door with an identical sob that felt as painful as it sounded he dropped back down to the straw sure that his cup of misery had overflowed hed said unforgivable things to her she wouldno one wouldever forgive him ever trust him again the moment amily found out what he had said she would hate him forever everyone would hate him and rightly he was destroying everything around him as surely as if he was running about the collegium with a knife slashing everything he cared about to ribbons maybe that awful thing that had brushed up against his mind wasnt from outside maybe it had been from inside him maybe that wild rumor was trueand there was something hateful malicious inside him maybe itthis thing that was the real magshad broken out for just a second and he had seen and felt what he really was inside blindly he ran for the door and just as blindly tore down the path to his room he stumbled and fell several times picked himself up without a thought and kept running he raced past the accusing eyes of the other companions and into his room and slammed the door behind himself locking it then he dropped to the floor arms wrapped around his chest sobbing silently again his eyes swelled and burned his chest ached his throat was so choked he could scarcely breathe all he could think about was what he had said to lenawhat she had said to him what he had done to dallen no matter that he had destroyed his own life hed also destroyed lenas and dallens he jumped as an angry pounding on his door startled him mags mags answer me answer me you right bastard it was bear come out of there you coward get out here so i can pound you im going to whip you like the mad dog you are of course it was bear who else what else are you going to ruin eh he shouted furiously pounding with what sounded like both fists on the door whos next who else are you going to betray youve already destroyed dallen dallens probably never going to walk again without pain much less ride a circuit what kind of companion cant ride a circuit and you sent lena into a state where all she can do is cry you couldnt even bother to lift a finger to save me from what my family is going to do to me you selfish bastard who else are you going to destroy gennie amily the king there it was bear believed it too and if bear believed itit had to be true you dont belong here bear screamed you dont deserve a companion you dont deserve to be a trainee why dont you go crawl back into your hole in the ground where you came from why indeed bear was right he didnt belong here he was a blight an infection an animal a mad dangerous animal he shouldnt be around decent folks the foreseers were right bear pounded and pounded on the door yelling but mags wasnt listening anymore he was kneeling on the floor his arms wrapped around his chest sobbing and rocking sobbing and rocking until bear finally gave up and went away mags mind ran around and around in circles like a mouse trapped in the bottom of a water jar the candle in his lantern burned down then out and he remained where he was on the floor still curled up around his pain there was nothing he could do there was no way to make any of this right again all he would continue to do would be to make things worse no wonder nikolas had disappeared he must have been the first to realize just what a bad lot mags was maybe his parents hadnt been bandits after all but everything else that master cole had said about him was right he was bad blood not worth anything the best thing he could do right now would be to die but no dallen was still bonded to him if he died in the condition that dallen was in now dallen would probably die along with him but dallen could rechoose he knew that was possible it didnt happen often and usually only when a herald died but it could happen tylendels companion had repudiated him and presumably had been intending to rechoose dallen could surely do the same and he mags could force the issue yes that would be the very best thing that he could do in fact it was the only honorable thing left for him to do and that was where his mind finally stopped frozen with the conviction that this was the only possible answer to what he had done and so he remained sleepless curled on the cold floor in the dark until at last the first light of dawn filtered in through the window chapter mags knew that if he hesitated if he said or did anything if he even gave a hint of what he was about to do someone would try and stop him stupid but there was always someone who thought that the unsalvageable could be saved right now he didnt want the temptation to change his mind or the effort it would take to fight the wellmeaning so he shielded himself completely dallen was in no condition to pick his thoughts up but others might not that the companions were likely to do anything about him they would probably be only too happy to see the last of him he wasnt going to leave more of a mess than he had already created however he would make it easy for the rest to erase him his presence his life from this place so he set to work putting all of his books and class supplies on the table packing his personal possessions in a basket then carefully folding all of the clothing he had been given and laying it on the bed until the only things left were the clothes he had arrived in he didnt feel bad about taking those after all they had been castoffs in the first place he dressed in the illfitting unmatching shirt and trews pulled on the muchpatched boots and peeked around the door to ensure that the companions were still drowsing his preparations hadnt taken long at all the stable was dark lit only by the two nightlanterns at either end making no noise he slipped out of the stable before anyone even the grooms that served this stable was awake he crept across the grounds as he had learned to creep and hide back at the mine when he was sneaking about looking for food the sun wasnt even up yet he scuttled from bit of cover to bit of cover and not even the dawnrising gardeners saw him leave the guards had a bad habit they watched and challenged people trying to get into the palace or the collegia but not the ones leaving so once he reached the gates where the lowest of the servants came and went he stopped skulking he went through the gates and just walked off the property in the wake of a delivery cart and they didnt give him a second glance but now dressed as shabbily as he was he quickly had to move to the back of all those fancy manors and nearpalaces that were up here he needed to get off the main road where he would be conspicuous and into the alleys and lanes behind them where people like he was belonged the first thing was he needed a job if he was going to stay alive at least until dallen decided to repudiate him and find someone else he needed to keep himself fed and sheltered and that wasnt as hard at he had made it out to be when he and bear and lena talked about running off if you didnt care how well you lived only that you stayed alive there were plenty of things he could do none of it was interesting or rewarding but why would that matter now all he cared about really was that it be hard enough work to keep him from thinking and let him fall into the same exhausted stupor he had when work at the mine was finished and certainly there was plenty of potential for being abused and mistreated but that didnt matter in the least to him right now he didnt really care how well or badly treated he was it came to him after a moment that hed actually welcome being punished since he certainly deserved it the way to find a job like that was to ask for it while there were places down in haven where those looking for work could be hired more often than not the sort of thing he was looking for came to a person that presented himself at the right time and in the right manner he was clean and neat which argued for being reliable and he was dressed perfectly for the sort of person that would be in the lowest ranks of the unskilled servants exactly the right sort of shabby no one would trust him with horses for instance not even in mucking out the stalls but theyd be happy to offload all the dirtiest nastiest kitchen jobs on someone like him scullery jobs that was the thing jobs that went even at the pieters mine to people who were paid in little more than food and a place to sleep on the floor one by one he went down the line of manor houses at each he presented himself at the kitchen door looking for work in late afternoon he found a place as one of the potscrubbers there was no one lower potscrubberswho also scrubbed the kitchen floor when the days work was done and hauled out the garbagefrequently deserted their posts so someone was always looking for replacements he didnt have to look as if he was eager stupidity was an asset in such a job no one cared if his eyes were swollen and red with weeping all they cared about was a sturdy body and just barely enough intelligence to do the work he tapped on the doorhe didnt even know whose house this was only that it was moderately sized and wasnt master sorens a frazzled kitchenmaid answered it her apron was splashed and stained with whatever she had just been working on and there was flour in her hair got work he asked dully mebbe stay here she replied and scuttled off she came back with a broad man in a white shirt and enveloping apron the redfaced balding cook eyed him frowning one of our boys ran off you gonna run off nossir he mumbled not looking at the cook since that would be insolence i spect hard work outa you you dont work you get beat you understand yessir he looked at his feet you get eats and a bed at the fire twice a year get a suit of clothes and three pennies understood yessir he bobbed his head thenkee sir the cook shoved him inside the door then to a place at a sink already full of hot water soap and pots get to work evidently the staff here was considered large enough to keep two potboys busy the other one was younger than mags but they were about the same size and the size of the stack they were to clean was daunting so the householdor the cookwas frugal when it came to staffing there was too much work for just two small boys unless one of them was mags who threw himself into the job in a way that made the cook grunt with surprise and satisfaction this at least was one thing he could do right with pumice stone and harsh soap he attacked each pot as if it was his life unlike his life he could clean this mess up the cook was not stingy about hot water and soap ordering them to change it whenever it got merely warm and not when it was as foul and cold as a sewer he did two pots for every one of the other boys which made the other boy glower at him when the cook shouted abuse at him for not keeping up mags didnt care it wasnt as if he was going to try and make friends ever again so he kept his head down and his shoulders hunched over and eventually the boy stopped bothering even to glare at him the other boy reminded him of the minekiddies with his sullen looks and grunts instead of speakingshoulders hunched much like mags and hair falling down over his face and into his eyes but he didnt look illfed and there werent a lot of bruises on him maybe the cook beat him for assumed shirking but it didnt look as if people in this kitchen were beaten for no reason other than that the cook wanted to beat someone all afternoon they scrubbed the luncheon pots which were snatched out of their hands as soon as they finished and pressed into service for dinner mags concentrated every bit of his mind on getting the pots so clean they were slick under his fingers when the last of the pile was clean he turned to look for more there werent any and the other boy scuttled across the kitchen a rapid sort of slinking walk that again was much as the minekiddies used to do he sidled over to a table in an alcove where the remains of the kitchen staff luncheon was after a moment mags trudged over there too it appeared that the kitchen staff was fed on what the masters of the house left over and right now after everyone else had picked the remains over what was left for him and the other boy looked like the aftermath of a plague of insects mostly what remained were odds and ends of bread the crusts from pies and some bits of vegetable some pickles a little fruit in terms of bulk they wouldnt go hungry the other boy pounced on anything that looked like it had gravy or sauce on it hunted for scraps of cheese or shreds of meat he gathered his finds greedily to him glaring at mags mags didnt even bother picking things over he just shoved whatever was nearest into his mouth not even tasting it just mechanically chewing and swallowing until his stomach told him he was full dully he noted the other kitchen staff looked all rightnot starved and they didnt cringe much it looked as if hed fallen into a situation where he was going to survive all right they werent given a moment of rest though and no time for the sort of banter and gossip hed seen in the collegium kitchenand others they were working every moment the head cook looming over them and lashing them with words if not his fists as mags watched he figured out what the pecking order was and who was best to steer clear of then the cook who had kept a fraction of his attention on them the whole time shouted at both of them get your lazy bums over here you two pots are piling up so it was back to the sink the kitchen was hot and noisy the cook shouting at his helpers the cooks helpers shouting at the kitchen maids and the maids shouting at each other pots and pans clanged and clattered people bustled about ran into each other and cursed people did things wrong and got yelled at or hit with a ladle or a hamlike handnot a beating but definitely a heavy cuff and he and the boy just scrubbed and scrubbed and scrubbed while the sweat poured down his face and back and the air filled with the smell of baking pie and cake and roasting meat and savories and complicated dishes involving cheese and spices the boy yearned piteously in the direction of the spits where big roasts were turning mags felt apart from it allhe could remember being someone like the boy for whom a taste of meat was the highest possible dream and he could remember another mags who had rejoiced over his good fortune in landing somewhere like the collegium with all its wondrous food but he was neither of those boys he was hollow and indifferent to his surroundings and all he wanted was for exhaustion to numb his mind and make it impossible to think he couldnt help observing and filing it all away but it dropped into an empty place in his head a place where things that had no use would go then the serving maids arrived and were laden with trays that in turn were loaded down with food the first course went outcoarse stuff for the servants that ate in hall the best things for the master and his table food went out to be served remains returned from the hall and were piled on the table in the corner atop the remains of the luncheon except for what came back untasted which went into the pantryprobably to reappear at breakfastand a few things that were set aside for the cooks private table the pots continued to pile up he continued to finish two for every single one of the boys and finally as clean pots were taken away and stored for tomorrow or set up to cook porridge and the like overnight the pile of stuff waiting to be scrubbed began to decrease people gathered at the leftover table squabbling over the best bits heaping what they wanted on crude wooden plates or the leftover breadtrenchers from the lower tables up in the dining hall the helpers ate first then the kitchen maids the helpers left after eating the maids stayed to clean this was no slatterns kitchen it was clear the cook here might be pennypinching but he knew his business every surface was scrubbed clean every dish put away clean only the floor was left to do the maids finished their cleaning and left probably for real beds somewhere the cook was still making his leisurely way through his own dinner one eye on his winecup and the other on the staff finally there were only two pots left and the boy scuttled to the table like a rat to scramble up onto a bench and stuff his face leaving them to mags mags scrubbed them clean without a word which evoked another grunt from the cook when he was done he trudged to the other side of the table and picked up and ate whatever was nearest he couldnt have said if anything was bad or good he was only interested in getting eating over with so he could go back to work he couldnt taste anything anyway the boy crammed food into his mouth with both hands and one eye on the cook the other on mags probably he was getting ready to grab anything mags uncovered that looked better than what he had but nothing turned up on mags side of the table the cook finished his dinner heaved himself up and evidently that was the signal for eating to stop clean up the cook said the boy scuttled off and came back with a big hessian bag greasestained and grubby on the outside he gestured to mags to help him and together they scraped everything off the table and into the bag which was put outside the door mags followed the boys lead without a word while the cook watched them both arms folded over his chest the boy kept glancing furtively at the cook as if he was expecting a cuff to the head the cook however kept most of his attention on mags next they scraped all the crumbs off the table theyd eaten from throwing them at the cooks direction into the fire and scrubbed down the table with soap and water and pumicestone so that would be why no one got sick from the leftovers on the table the boy got brooms for them both and they swept the floor throwing the sweepings out the back door then they got down on hands and knees with buckets of water and soap and big bristlebrushes and scrubbed it as the cook watched oddly the cook washed his own plates and cutlery but that might have been because he didnt trust them with it when they were done he grunted approval reached into a cupboard and pulled out two bundles of bedding these proved to be a couple of thick sacks made of multiple layers stitched together a patchwork of old worn blankets the cook tossed one to each of them mags caught the one thrown to him and watched the boy to see what he did with his the boy moved his sack to the best place by the fire pulled off his shoes stuck his legs into the opening and wriggled until he was all the way inside it with just his head sticking out mags copied him and the cook grunted with satisfaction again dont think to steal anything from the pantry boy he warned as he put the rushlights out so that the only light was from the dying fire ill beat both of you senseless if anything is missing or nibbled both of you so no use thinking you can nick something and get away with it by blaming the other then he left and the kitchen was quiet except for the sound of the fire and the other boy breathing mags became aware that his arms ached from scrubbing his back ached from bending over the sink and his legs and feet ached from standing on stone all that time he welcomed the pain even as his muscles began to stiffen and hurt more pain on the outside was easier to deal with than pain on the inside nevertheless black sorrow descended on him and with his arms pillowing his head he cried silently sobbing himself to sleep a kick in the side roused him he sat up in his cocoon of bedding with a groan and was rewarded with another kick he managed to squirm out of the bedding and it was snatched away from him by a maid and bundled into the top of the cupboard the room was full of sleepy people complaining ordering each other about he and the boy were put to fetching firewood from the pile outside and the roasting fires and the big ovens were set to burning hotly the bag of mealremains they had left outside last night was gone he remembered now that he thought about it that he had noticed chickens in a pen in one corner of the kitchengarden it probably went to feed them another evidence of frugality that they kept hens to have their own eggs and roasting birds last nights bread was shoveled out of the oven and laid out in order of quality to be served at breakfast huge pots of peaseporridge and oatporridge emerged from the ovens as well the staple breakfast food for the servants serving maids appeared caps a little askew and yawning sleepily they were swiftly burdened with great trays of bowls full of both or baskets of bread the servants would eat earliest of course and not with the masters who would lie abed and probably be served there as the porridge kettles emptied they came to mags and the boy who began their work the bowls and utensils from cooking the better foods came to them too and they labored to keep up new potboy asked one servingmaid of one of the cooks helpers aye thick as two short planks but does the work came the reply hasnt said a word since he was taken on yesterday thatll suit cookie then came the laconic reply itll suit cookie better if hes too thick to count to three said the helper cookiell give him two pennies and keep the third the maid snickered mags kept scrubbing concentrating with all his might the way he used to concentrate on chipping out a stone without fracturing it on getting every last fragment of food from every pot he was handed when he and the boy ran out of pots they were sent for more wood or to haul in bags or baskets of coarser foodstuffs from a root cellar or to carry the garbage from the cooking out to the chicken pen they emptied out the peelings and ends and bad spots the leaves and the burnt bits of bread into the pen and the hens fell on the bounty clucking and fighting over the best bits like the servants in the kitchen then back they went to scrubbing mags bent over the work always with an ache in his soul that felt as if someone was squeezing his heart in a vice at least he could do this and he could do it well he could do it without hurting anyone and when he started to weep he could put his head down over the basin let his hair fall to cover his face and no one would be the wiser so there it was this for now would be what remained of the wreckage of his life the days blurred one into another the days lengthened and the kitchen grew hotter by day because the weather outside was warmer he and the boy worked stripped to their trews the women in shifts and chemises he threw himself into the scrubbing and anything else that was given to him to doand seeing that the cook gave him every task that two hands and no mind to speak of could perform he was set to scrubbing the soot from all the walls and bleaching the stone floor with lye he did it all without complaint without a word he couldnt hear dallen at all he began to think that if dallen had not actually repudiated him yet it was only because dallen was not in any physical shape to as soon as dallen was as healed as he could get the companion probably would do exactly that and in the meanwhile the silence meant that dallen had decided that choosing mags had been a terrible mistake and this was the way to keep him isolated until the companion could be rid of him it hurt it hurt terribly but he had to acknowledge that everyone was better off without him and all he was waiting for now was for that ghostly silent presence in the back of his mind to one day become an echoingly empty place when that happened well then he would decide what to do and it occurred to him that once dallen left him there was one option he hadnt considereda painless easy way to put an end to everything one that now in retrospect he wished had happened last winter in that blizzard all he had to do was be patient and wait for winter whether or not a blizzard came there would be snow then all he needed to do would be to walk out into it until he started to feel sleepy he could ignore the cold he had done so before then when it was too hard to move too much effort to keep going he could sit down close his eyes and let the snow take him and his misery away forever chapter mags the voice in his mind echoed through the nightmare he always had nightmares worse than ever before far worse than hed had at the collegium the cocoonlike bedding at least kept him from thrashingnot that anything would wake up the boybut he had them every night the odd thing was even though they were horrible and even though he woke up from them with the top of his bedding soaked with tears and the rest damp with sweat he welcomed them he always woke exhausted which left his mind in a numb fog and a numb fog was preferable to thinking mags after days of working herehe still didnt know who he was working forhis body knew when to wake up had to be before cookie came in since he would kick them awake which oddly enough seemed kind of fair to magscookie didnt kick mags hard enough to break anything and he and the boy did have to clear away from in front of the hearth so that the fires could be built up again and the big water kettles swung into place on their cranes to heat cookie was a strange combination of brutal and fair he never meted out punishment to anyone who hadnt earned it but those who earned it got the receiving end of a beating just short of breaking bones cookie was exact in doling out precisely enough punishment that the recipient was still capable of working the boy had gotten two beatings since mags had been here both for shirking so far aside from morning kicks mags was unscathed he woke straight up out of the nightmare he was just in time to hear cookies heavy footsteps in the passage outside the kitchen the voice still echoed in his head as he struggled out of his cocoon and rolled it up into the bundle that cookie preferred shaking his head a little to clear it and knuckling his eyes to get the fog out of them it wasnt dallen of course dallen was surely only days away from withdrawing from mags completely maybe that was why he was hearing the memory of dallens mindvoice in his dreams the few dreams he had that werent nightmares the ones on going to sleep and again on waking bath said cookie when he saw mags waiting beside his bundle he gestured to the door and mags went out into the yard while cookie kicked the boy awake cookie set a great deal of store by cleanliness and every other day was a bath day for the potboys bath day in the sense that they went out into the yard stripped down to singlets doused themselves under the pump that stood out there washed with the same soap they used for the pots washed their clothing the same way put it on wet and came back to work small wonder theyd actually need a new suit of clothing every six moons mere cloth couldnt stand up to that sort of treatment every other day he was already clean by the time the boy came out to the yard with a bruise along one side of his face mags wondered what he had done to anger cookie this time it didnt seem that difficult to avoid a beating all you had to do was work hard not steal not be insolent or waste time just how stupid was the boy when he took his place obediently at his sink he noticed that cookies eyes were bloodshot and he held his head as if it hurt him last night had been some sort of feast and a lot of bottles had gone up to the dining hall from the locked cellar it appeared that cookie had helped himself to at least one well perhaps the boy hadnt been at fault this time better stay extra quiet today at least till cookie gets his head back it was one of those rare moments these days when he actually thought something a real thought instead of just letting fatigue keep his mind numb and as empty as possible mags his hands closed convulsively on the pot and pumicestone and powerful emotions he couldnt name washed over him and drowned him for a while meanwhile as he had schooled it to do his body kept mechanically on with his task no it wasnt possible dallen wasnt trying to speak to him nowait dallen was going to repudiate him that was ithed finally come to his senses and in order to repudiate mags it had to be that dallen had to actually say as much to him and although the deepest part of mags was screaming no most of him was bracing itself and acknowledging that it had to be done he cautiously opened himself to dallen a little just enough so that dallen could say what he had to and get it all over with dallen probably had a lot to say too now that he had spent so long in so much pain that was itdallen was only calling him so that the companion could tell him how worthless he was before casting him aside mags the mindvoice started to fade away with a sense that dallen was dropping off into a stupor again but the last words were clear mags come home if he had not long ago trained his body to keep doing whatever task it was he had been set while his mind either dropped into a stupor of its own or ran in frantic circles he would have earned a bruised face himself at that moment his thoughts reeled this wasnt possible dallen could not possibly want him back and even if somehow his companion was too insane too stupid or too softhearted to repudiate him the rest of the companions would properly never permit him to return to the collegium not ever he was a danger to every companion and chosen in valdemar and bear was right he just plain didnt deserve to be up there well there was only one thing for it if dallen would not do what he should mags would continue to force the issue on him someone had to do what was smart what was right he was on fire with the need to protect dallen from himself protect the collegia the heralds everyone up there on the hill from him as he scrubbed and rinsed he carefully painstakingly built up a wall in his mind layering it over what he already had in place closing dallen out completely normally he would not have had the energy for this but with all that welter of emotion behind him for the moment he could do just about anything let dallen wear himself out against that wall and give the other companions time to convince him what he must do to save himself whatever selfish poisonous thing was inside mags whether it was some parasitic strange other personality that had attached himself to him whether it was his real self and the mags he thought was himself was just a kind of mask or whether it was just because underneath it all he couldnt control the evil inside himself it must never be permitted inside the walls of the collegia again one disaster had been enough there was nothing about him that belonged up there that done he let the fires that all those emotions had ignited burn out let himself sink into apathetic despair let weariness of body and spirit take over and numb his mind into the state of notthinking again this was the right thing to do this felt right it was right this was the only thing that was right in all of his dreadfully wrong world he had to stick to it he couldnt be saved but at least he could save dallen the numb state lasted until the luncheon pots were done and he and the boy were feeding at the communal table as ever the boys hands scrabbled among the crusts and bread for anything good and he stuffed what he found into his face so fast that mags wondered why he never choked the boy seemed to live for food in a strange way that even the minekiddies had never matched he and the boy never left this table hungrythey might not be well fed but they were certainly full so why was it the boy tried to stuff himself as if he thought he would never eat again the boys behavior made no sense to mags the boy seemed to live for and obsess over food it was a mystery as ever mags methodically ate whatever was nearest without regard to its condition it was all so tasteless to him it might as well have been dead grass he ate to keep his stomach from complaining to get him through another day but there was no reason to be as fixated on food as the boy was mags he started and checked his mental wall as the boy looked at him curiously for a moment then fell back to eating the wall was still there there was no way that dallen could have breached it mags come home how was dallen talking to him never mind this needed to be put to a stop no he thought and no he shouted back imye need t stop this dallen ye need t cut me off there was no reply only the sense of stuporous slumber again mags shook his head he must have imagined it or else hed half fallen asleep sitting here and dreamed it or else he was going crazy this was not at all unlikely actually being insane would actually be something of a relief if he could blame the way he had hurt dallen and treated lena on insanity well it might ease his guilt a little mad bad and dangerous to know he thought up to his elbows in soapy hot water in a way the idea that he might be insane was oddly comforting insanity would explain why he had lashed out like that well he could be all three here and it wouldnt matter no one would care if he was mad or evil inside as long as he cleaned the pots he had no friends he had no access to weapons of any kind he was not in charge of anything dangerous he couldnt hurt anybody here he was never going to make a friend to be hurt again so the danger of knowing him was not an issue the afternoon was always the hardest part of the day the scents of the cooking and baking were enough to convince even a full belly that it wanted more the boy always slowed down knowing that this was the busiest part of cookies day and that cookie wouldnt see him shirking and today the kitchen got so warm it was hard not to fall asleep where he stood if he closed his eyes even for a moment he would find himself slowly tipping over toward the water and come to himself with a jerk and today was no exception he couldnt imagine how the others stayed awake maybe it was just that they all had more sleep than he ever did certainly the boy was as alert as a hungry rat watching the roasting meat hoping for a moment of distraction or inattention when he might be able to dash in with a bit of the bread hed stuffed into his pockets and sop up some of the juices collecting in the trays under the spits those were supposed to be reserved for sauces and gravy and cookie guarded them jealously but the boy never gave up hope of getting some hed actually succeeded probably more than once or he never would have kept trying but mags had seen him manage the trick once once when the rest of the kitchen had been busy and cookie had gone after something from one of the locked cellars or pantries where the expensive things like wine and meats were kept today the boy got the moment of distraction hed hoped for and more the door was open to let in what breeze there was and suddenly without warning one of the biggest wasps mags had ever seen soared lazily inside it was a huge black thing easily the size of a mans thumb perhaps it had been attracted by the scent of the fruit being made into pies or the jellies in their bowls one of the kitchen maids spotted it pointed and screamed then she made the mistake of flailing a towel at it without actually hitting it that made the insect angry and it dove aggressively down out of the air and attacked her darting in landing on her long enough to sting her on the neck she shrieked with pain while the other maids screamed and flapped their towels and aprons ineffectually at her missing the insect altogether and further enraging it it zigzagged around the room looking for more enemies to sting the whole kitchen erupted into a bedlam of screaming flapping towels people ducking out of the way while the enraged wasp tried to find itself another target mags abandoned the sink and ducked as low to the floor as he could get making himself less of a target as the boy saw his chance and made for the roasts cookie waded in at that point as the wasp landed on the back of one of the cooks helpers to sting him cookie smacked the victim and insect with his huge hand smashing the wasp and sending the hapless helper tumbling over into a cupboard the maids sure that the insect was still in the air flailed and screamed with their eyes closedor like mags ducked under the table unaware the danger of being stung was over mags glanced toward the fire the boy was stuffing his face not only with juicedipped bread but with strips of crisp skin and meat he tore off the roast with his bare hands if cookie turned right now shut up you lot shut your faces its dead cookie roared for silence whirled to glare at the hysterical mob of maids and caught the boy with both hands and his mouth full cookies face already red went purple with rage he strode across the kitchen and seized the boy by the collar hauling him to his feet and shaking him like a terrier with a rat thief he raged you little bastard of a thief oh youre for it now even the maid whod been stung stopped crying and watched with openmouthed fascination as cookie shook the boy until his eyes rolled up in his head the boy probably pissed himself with fear too but he and mags were so soaked with sweat and dishwater you couldnt have told mags had to look away then as cookie delivered one of his carefully calculated beatings the meaty sound of an open hand on flesh filled the kitchen as the rest of thes staff watched or turned away according to their natures it didnt go on for very long cookie knew that they were behind on preparations now and he wasnt going to waste any more time on the boy right now than he had to in order to maintain discipline the sounds of the flat of a hand on flesh didnt last as long as mags thought it would maybe because cookie was desperate to get things back on schedule as mags looked up again cookie dragged the boy back to the sink dropped him there blubbering now get back to work cookie roared whirling round ill give you another dose of whats coming to you when the work is done youve wasted enough of my time for now that goes for all of you mags got up off the floor and went straight back to work sniveling and sniffing so did the boy there was some harsher punishment coming for him probably more beating possibly something else mags was as sure of that as he was that the sun would rise but right now cookie wanted his pots clean before he wanted the boy punished and into the silence in his own head came that mindvoice mags hellfires how was he getting into mags head no he shouted back dallen no ye don want me theyre right i got this horrible thing i me ye felt it yerself itsi dunno how t get rid of it an it wants its not something in you dallen replied with difficulty through his haze of drugs we know others in haven have felt it mags almost stopped washing pots he actually froze for a moment and only a blubbering sob from the boy woke him enough to continue the work he scrubbed feverishly no longer sleepy whadya mean he demanded others felt it down in haven not up here on the hill a healer a temple foreseer and a priest with the gift not so strong as you did but felt it itshes the foreigner hes the one its not you they know that now mags come home dallen pleaded he shook his head as tempting as it was to believe that he had been exonerated he now had some real crimes on his own doorstep and those couldnt be rationalized away that doesn touch whut i done he replied trying not to cry himself as the boy blubbered and whinged next to him i hurt you i said orrible things ta lena an bear things with some truth in them dallen replied fighting against his drugs and they said horrible things to you but you are the one that took them to heart and ran away cause theyre true mags cringed contemplating that dark place inside himself i don deserve you an i don belong there that will be quite enough trainee magpie the sonorous mindvoice wiped out every thought everything he was going to say and made his head ring hed heard it once before in the stable when rolan chose to broadcast his thoughts hed never been the sole focus of that mindvoice before and it felt a little like having lightning strike at his feet everyone has darkness inside them heralds are no exception the difference between heralds and villains is that heralds overcome their darkness the difference between heralds and cowards is that heralds face their darkness and cowards run from it the difference between heralds and the cruel is that when heralds slip and allow their darkness to speak they are truly remorseful and make amends thus allowing the wounds they caused to heal instead of fester so trainee which are you mags waited to see if rolan was going to say anything else the inside of his skull reverberated like a bell but rolan said nothing else perhaps he was waiting for mags replyor perhaps he was on to more important things leaving mags to make up his own mind come home mags dallens weary mindvoice fell into the silence like a feather amily and lena are frantic with worry bear has told his brother that he will not leave until you are found mags bowed his head and tears fell into the dishwater as the grief at what he had done overcame him yet again but i hurt ye but i was an idiot galloping in the dark dallen countered rolan has spoken and you heard him he stands by you as i do the others have spoken to their chosen that evil creature whoever he is has been sensed by others everyone knows it is not you we need you i need you come home please he was afraid to believe and yet rolan had spoken if he couldnt believe in rolan what could he believe in with a sigh he gave in all right he said but not right now as he let down the walls he had built to keep dallen out he sensed dallens surprise and shock butwhy not because theres a kitchen fulla people waitin on clean pots an the ony other person t wash em is a beatup layabout he replied stubbornly if im gonna act like a trainee then i aint runnin out with a job half done ill leave after its all cleaned up not afore cookie had gone to bed early and the boys continued punishment for his theft of meat was to be beaten again then locked in the root cellar to sleep among the mice and rats and black beetles that crawled in the place this left mags alone in the kitchen absolutely unguarded since in the couple of weeks he had been here he had shown nothing like intelligence enough to get into any mischief he felt he had done his duty at this point hed done everything he had been asked to do and had been fed on scraps they had gotten more than they had paid for out of him and he owed them nothing the boy and one of the scullery maids would have to wash the pots tomorrow until someone else turned up at the door looking for work someone would someone always did once the entire place was asleep he checked the kitchen door as he assumed it was only locked from the inside and it was easy to slip out of course now if there had been anyone watching the place looking for an opportunity to steal they would have thought that it was their lucky night for he slipped out without locking the door behind him that wasnt very likely though and as he dropped his shields a little just to be sure he sensed no one within easy reach was awake much less preparing to steal something somehow even though he had thought that his mind was in a completely numb state he realized he had been observing everything about this house the entire time he had been working here nikolas training had proven too strong to overcome he knew exactly how to get out of the yard use the barrel where the chicken manure was deposited every dayit was quite valuable for the garden plantsto get onto the roof of the coop where the chickens slept locked up at night and from there make a leap to the top of the wall and tumble over that would put him down in the alley he had to be careful of course the barrel was none too stable and the roof was not meant to hold the weight of a man just to keep the weather off the chickens but being careful was what he had been taught on the personal obstacle courses moving slowly and testing your balance and the ability of the surface ahead of you to take your weight think every move through before you do it he eased himself up onto the barrel using his arms only as if he was about to try and do a headstand he noted as he did so that his arms were a lot stronger than they had beenbut also that his endurance wasnt quite as good as it had been well he could certainly recommend pot scrubbing as a way to build up arm strength but a diet of scrapsand those mostly bread and crustclearly didnt do much for the muscles as a whole moving at a glacial pace he got his feet on either side of the barrel rim so that he didnt go through the top he stood up then reached up to the roofline he felt along the roof edge found the support beams for the coop roof and slowly put his weight on them they held he eased himself up onto the roof spread his weight out over it by lying flat on it waited for a moment while his arms recovered after all it was not as if he had to do this in a hurry once his arms stopped aching he crawled to the side nearest the wall there was just enough moonlight to see by he found the beams on the other side of the roof by feeling under the roof edge and slowly stood up with his weight on the beams and not on the roof between he took three deep breaths and jumped hands outstretched his hands caught the top of the wall and he pulled himself up onto it not easily his arms protested a lot but he managed to get a leg over and after that it was a simple fall and tumble down the other side he got a little bruised doing so but on the whole it wasnt a bad fall he stood up brushing himself offthen stopped why bother he wasnt exactly clean to start with mags are you coming home now the drugsleepy voice in his mind was as comforting as salve on a raw wound he almost started crying again aye jest need ye t rouse sommun t get th guard t let me past th gate or i kin wait outside till mornin an ye kin ask sommun then reckon i kin find a place t hole up till it wasnt a brush this time as that terrible mind impinged on his it was more like a spear piercing his brain that mind that angry murderous mind actually hurt burned as it touched his so angry so hateful that his knees gave and he sat abruptly down in the alley it wasnt cushioned by anything and this time he knew this was not inside of him some hideous passenger in his head no this was a fully formed personality older than he was by a couple of decades and its anger and hate carried with them brief glimpses of memories of places and people and things that he had never seen much less dreamt of it was utterly unaware of him this mind either this was not someone with a gift for mindspeech or more likely it was not someone who was aware that such a thing existed or was trained in how to use it and mags had no idea why he could listen in on it there had to be some connection between him and the one who harbored such horrible thoughtsbut what he considered trying a probe but something held him back it wasnt ethics the man thinking these things was a clear danger to valdemar and a mental probe was exactly in order here it was something else some subtle sense of warning the man himself might not be aware of mindspeech but slowly mags became aware that there was a shadow there hovering behind the mind in question he thought perhaps it was something that had been put to guard him from outside that was what was making his actual thoughts so obscure and hard to read and that shadow there was definitely something about it that made the hair on the back of mags neck stand up the way it did when a large and dangerous dog growled danger definite danger there so he clung to the contact this time rather than trying to shut it out and tried to glean what he could from the fragments he picked up oh he wanted to shut it out the pain of being touched by it was as bad as anything he had ever knownbut this was important every fragment of information he could glean was more that could tell the heralds who it was and where he might be there were fleeting memories of the palaceand that suite that the fake envoys had been in so yes this was one of the foreigners he sensed dallen struggling to stay awake and take all this in but he couldnt spare anything to help at the moment as it was taking every bit of his concentration to absorb the bits and pieces he was getting and put them together into a coherent pattern oh the man was angry so angry mags could scarcely believe that anyone could be that angry and still be as under control as this man was it was as if his rage was the food he lived on the fuel for the furnace that forged him this was nothing like the mad mind of the assassin this rage was as cold as the mad ones had been hot calculating that was what it was he might be insanein fact mags could not imagine how anyone who was carrying around this much anger could not be insanebut he was as meticulously organized as a fine clockmaker this man did nothing without examining every possibility and figuring out where it could take him that was part of why it was so hard to read his thoughtshe actually thought these things through several of them at a time much faster than mags could follow just one brilliant he was blindingly brilliant and yet there was something about that mind that was very akin to the mad one it was not in the level of organization and not in the level of intelligence it wasnt the anger although the mad assassin had been very angry it felt almost as ifas if the two this man and the assassin had been related physically related in some way could there be in fact a kinship connection there might be he repressed the thought that perhaps the reason why he was so sensitive to these minds and no one else was was because there might be a kinship connection with himself that wasnt important right now and as dallen had stressed to him just because your parents had been bad it didnt follow that you would be what was important was figuring out where this man was and what it was he was going to do it was very like trying to ride the back of a wild and dangerous ravening beasta beast that had no idea mags was there all he could do was hold on for the ride and hope the beast didnt notice after several moments he still couldnt tell which of the foreigners this man was he only knew which one he wasnt because this mind was nothing like the mind of the man he had seen down in haven and followed to the travelers inn and there had been no kinship connection there either he closed his eyes tightly and concentrated with all his might but could not even get a sense of direction from that mind all he could say for sure was that it was down in haven somewhere he got flashes of what looked like a great many people eating and drinking together another inn but it could have been one of dozens even if mags had been able to recognize it there was no guarantee that the man would stay there for any length of time in fact given that they had been discovered now it was very unlikely that they would take any two meals in the same place there were layers to the mans anger there was a fundamental rage that drove him all the time waking and sleeping and there was a hatred for valdemar atop thatbut not the sort that he would expect to find in say a karsite who hated and feared everything that valdemar represented no this was a more generalized hatred he didnt want to be here he hated this place it wasnt home the people were soft and simple fools their heralds were unnatural and perverted creatures with a sick and twisted bond to their horses and he wanted to be gone as soon as possible but he couldnt leave he had a task to perform here frustratingly mags could not get a sense of what that task was only that there was a very important task to be accomplished and he had not been able to do it and atop that another level of anger and acute frustration that there was something he needed desperately needed in order to finish that task and it wasnt something that he could just buy or make or have made it was something personal and very specific he had thought he had it but he didnt he must have left it because it was missing and now he could get nothing done try as he might mags could not get a sense of where the man thought he had left this thing much less what it was right now getting that thing back whatever it wasthat was his primary goal he thought now he knew where it was he was working on several plans simultaneously to get it it was all those plans being thought through together that made it impossible to see what the object was and where it was oh now i understand dallens mindvoice was a whisper as if he too was afraid to disturb that mind understand what mags demanded later the mind buzzed with these plans to the point where mags couldnt follow any of the threads of thought at all plans branched off plans and the mind worked at all of them simultaneously until mags felt dizzy then suddenlythe mind was gone what happened he said alarmed did idid he i dontthink so dallen replied with difficulty i dont think he knew you were there i think i think there is just something that links you randomly it holds you together for a bit then he spins away and the connection breaks mags sensed a lot of pain physical pain in dallen whatre ye doin ye gurt fool he demanded alarmed ye aint tryin ter walk are ye no no i just let my pain drugs wear off so i can think and talk to you its worth it a little pain is not an issue with something this important in the offing there was a sense of a weak laugh i will muddle through mags wanted to throw his arms around dallens neck and beat him with a stick at one and the same time he was so glad that dallen had been able to follow all this so glad that dallen would be able to tell all the other companions immediately and he wanted to beat the big moron for hurting himself to do so and shrugging it all off i promise i will drink them very soon now i think there is something up here at the collegium that has been preventing you from making that connection quite so often dallen continued there are a lot of shields here and every gifted tends to naturally create a differently sized shield as well some dont even have a specific person that they are tied to and are probably the result of many heralds and healers being in the same place for a long time most of those shields dont extend much past the surface of ones own mind but some can extend to cover the collegia and palace as well those big ones arent strong and they are entirely subconscious but having several of them in place could have interfered with you making conscious contact with that mind before could thet be where mnightmaresre from oh yes in sleep you are more likely to get seepages and it was just our bad luck that we were on the kirball field outside those shields when whatever it is happened that allows you to link briefly with that madman he got a sense of dallen wincing as his poor legs complained to him gods he breathed heavily as if he had been running an if i go backno chance up there thet ill hook him again then no way i caint go back up there not if im gonna have any hope of findin him not when we have no idea how you link to him not when it seems to be triggered by something on his part and not when we dont know when that is going to happen dallen agreed unhappily oh magsi am sorry eh sallright he actually felt a little lightheaded giddy with the revelations of the past candlemark or so lena had clearly forgiven him amily had not abandoned him nor given up on him the heralds now knewor would soon when dallen reported to themthat he was not the foreigner although he was somehow involved that image of him with blood on his hands was troubling but there were so many interpretations of that even as a real vision and not something symbolic that it wasnt even remotely likely that one of them was mags kills the king though what evoked fear right now was the thought that it was a vision of mags interrupts the person that kills the king aye but foresight aint absolute ye kin change things people dot all th time and as dallen had confirmed those nightmares he had been plagued with had an explanation too the sleeping mind was a lot more susceptible to mental links and he could be linking to that madman every time he slept which was a scary thought but not nearly as scary as the idea that he had been creating those horrible dreams himself i caint come back he said slowly not if them shields aint somethin that kin be taken down i dont think most of them can be dallen said reluctantly there are some that are as old as the palace itself then i gotta stay here in th city i gotta wait fer th next time i get linked up i gotta either find this feller or figger out which one he is or figger out what hes gonna do the logic was inescapable or all three i agree dallen said mournfully hellfires he sighed all right lets make us a plan an fast sos ye kin tell rolan an the rest an they kin do what theyre gonna do an ye kin get drugged up he smiled to himself ye gurt fool chapter the first order of business was to find a place to wait until dawn or thereabouts when someone in authority could wake up and decide what to do about mags and up here would not do there were too many private guards and not nearly enough places to hide so mags made his way as swiftly as he could in the opposite direction to where he really wanted to go because right now the idea of being safe in his room again was so desirable it that it was all he could do to hold to his plan he went further down into haven to find a place where he could get a little sleep while he waited for dawn while he trotted down the alleysbecause anyone who was skulking and moving from shadow to shadow would attract suspicion and anyone who was moving without any attempt at stealth would be assumed to be here on some businesshe went at the problem logically he needed somewhere he wouldnt be disturbed and somewhere flat so he could sleep he needed sleep or hed be even more vulnerable than he already was it had to be somewhere he wouldnt be seen and out of the way of traffic at the collegium at the mine that had been easywriggle into cover under some bushes but this was a city and there was nothing like that to speak ofwhat little there was grew in parks and private gardens the weather was good though he just needed some place out of the way and flat enough that he could get some sleep then a glance at one of the great houses he passed to see how high the moon was gave him the answer out of the way and flat what could be better than a roof most roofs were not actually flat of course but he knew there were places where cornices joined and roofs butted together that would give him something he could wedge himself into and not worry about falling off so as he got down into the part of the city where the everyday folk lived he started looking for an innbecause an inn had people coming and going at all hours and a little activity around it would go unnoticed if he was careful it was not more than a candlemark later that he was wedging himself into exactly the sort of nook he had envisaged and even better it actually was flat a flat space behind a set of four chimney pots and as an added incentive the chimney pots were keeping it warm for the air was still cold at night especially up here where there was wind whipping around the rooftops now that he was up here secureit all hit him at once mostly what hit him was a relief so profound it felt as if all his muscles went limp at once he had already cried far far too much so he didnt begin sobbing now instead he found himself smiling for the first time inwellsince the second lot of visions began weeks anyway it didnt matter that he had a daunting task before him for right now this moment all that mattered was that he was a trainee again he would apologize to bear and lena and somehow make it up to them dallen was going to heal and if bear was right and he couldnt ride circuits well mags could serve in haven what mattered was it really had been an accident though they had both taken the foolish chances that contributed to the accident what mattered was that though there was a nasty part of him it wasnt a monster rolan was right he yawned hugely and curled into the warm chimney pot a little more his muscles feeling as if they were made of butter and the next thing he knew it was morning he watched the sun coming up over the rooftops and waited for dallen to rouse mmrph mornin i am glad you did not say good he got a sense of the ache in dallens legs and winced talk to anybody yet he asked not expecting an answer actually yes rolan and nikolas via rolan it will take some time to convince people outside of the heralds up here that you are not a great villain nikolas wants to know if you think you can survive without direct contact from up here for a while i think he has some concerns that our foreigners might not be working alone ye mean if it gets out thet i kin see this fellers mind i could be in trouble exactly nikolas wants to keep this information confined to the companions himself and the king for now he cant get away to help you and we certainly cant send the king down with a packet of money and clothing mags chuckled at that image and a companion trotting up with saddlebags for you would be just as conspicuous so can you manage on your own mags considered that dunno why not don think i should try getting nother job though i agree your job is hunting down our quarry you need to be mobile so i need somethin thatll let me lounge round streets an do nothing an not look suspicious he considered that for a moment blind beggar peoplell gimme money i kin sleep rough an i kin scrounge fer more food i aint picky bout what i eat dallen was silent i had thought about beggar blind didnt occur to me i kin drop a liddle shield an use other peoples eyes t watch crowdan the bandagell cover mface so if the furriners see me might not recognize me he thought some more i kin snitch some wax an seal meyes shut w it case summun snatches mbandage off the thought was the parent to the deed he was already making his way quietly off the roof and into the stable attached to the inn as he spoke and on his way out of the innyard he got his first stroke of good fortune a fellow in a hurry to leave discarded half a meat pie in the dust as he mounted his horse mags snatched it up dusted off the worst of the dirt and devoured it there was breakfast and he had certainly eaten worse he needed wax a rag and a staff the last would be easiest to get he managed to steal a rag from a ragandbonemans cart as the man made a collection that left the wax wax was valuable he considered using mud instead but he was afraid of getting something into his eyes that would infect them what to do turn right dallen said suddenly into his mind mags didnt argue he went down the first righthand street he came to and discovered himself in the chandlers streetbut in the alley not the street itself and although wax was valuable and candle ends would always be collected to be melted down and made into new candles he soon realized that tiny bits of it were not so valuable that here anyone bothered to pick them up out of the alley he prowled the expanse with his nose practically pressed to the hardpacked dirt picking up a drop there a drip here and pressing them together in his hands with patient gleaning by the time he got to the end of the alley he had a nice ball of wax about the size of his fist and it was a pleasingly unpleasant color as well close enough to fleshcolor to blend and mottled with threads of red blue and ocher if he made a flat sheet of it and pressed pieces over his eyes it would look at first glance as if he had had a horrible accident and his eyes were covered with scartissue it wouldnt pass a close muster but most people wouldnt look a second time and the staff was easy he just went through the alleys of the better homes again and found a place where the gardeners were doing tree trimming dashed in and nicked a piece when the gardeners were too busy to see him as an added bonus in the gardenmidden he found what had been an ornamental bowl for flowers which now had a chipped rim and a big crack in it that would do for his beggingbowl by midmorning he was established he settled himself just out of the way of foot traffic his eyes sealed with wax and bandaged his staff across his lap and the bowl which looked nicely forlorn and battered in front of him he dropped some of his shields ever so cautiously and let the thoughts and particularly the images of the people passing by seep into his mind uppermost for the most part were concerns about where they were going so he got lots of glimpses of the street and the people in it until the madman somehow connected with him again this was mags best hope of finding him looking for the foreigners through the eyes of other people now and again he heard the metallic sound of a small coin falling into his bowl when he did he murmured a quiet thank you groped convincingly for the token and stuffed it in his pocket dallen was a comforting presence in the back of his mind again even if the companion was mostly drugged and comatose there were a hundred questions he wanted to ask and unfortunately right now he couldnt foremost was the suspicion that at least part of the reason why nikolas wasnt giving him help was that the kings own was testing him again if that was so well he was actually all right with that he still felt as if he needed to be punishedor at least to atone in some way maybe someone else would have resented this but he was trying to be honest with himself and if he had been in nikolas shoes hed have done the same after all mags had run away from the collegium nikolas had to be sure that he could count on mags to do what he was asked to do so mags had to prove himself show he was still able to perform as he had been taught and do so without any outside support while he watched the passing crowd through the eyes of the crowd itself he pondered where it might be likeliest to find the foreigners now would they have tried to hide themselves in the slums dont think so one of the things that nikolas had taught him was that each block in the poorer sections of haven was like a village everyone knew everyone and they all knew each others business for a lot of foreigners to suddenly intrudewell they would stand out it would be obvious that they werent poor no matter how they tried to disguise themselves andhmm another question to ask dallen just how widespread were the stories about foreigners plotting the kings death if such tales were current all over haven there were plenty of people who would report their presence to the guard no matter how they themselves felt about the guard or whether or not they were lawbreakers because there was bound to be a reward tied to their capture and there is nothing like a reward to make the former lawbreaker turn lawabiding citizen so he could probably dismiss the slums on the other hand they had stolen horses now they didnt have to be in haven at all they could be anywhere within half a day of the city though it was likeliest that they were closer than that so if i was onea them what would i want right now the one he was linked to had clearly wanted something and it was an actual object mags had the impression that very recently he had decided he had left it behind somewhere there was no doubt it was important very important maybe that was why he was back in the city they must have stayed at a lot of inns in order to keep from arousing suspicion by staying too long in one the lost object would probably be in one of those inns now the inn mags had found them living at was not exactly a cheap onenot luxurious but not cheap he doubted that they would ever stay in a cheap place in a decent inn when you left something behind the innkeeper held it until you turned up again and asked for it it paid them to do such a simple service for it guaranteed repeat customers perhaps one way to go about this would be to consider just where in the city a foreigner could stay without causing comment in the middle of winter besides that row of inns on the trade road well time to consider what he had learned from master soren and at master sorens gatherings there were only a limited number of kinds of merchants that would need housing in the middle of winter if the foreigners were trying to avoid detection they would have to be careful about what they were trying to pass as one thing sprang instantly to mind at the midwinter festival he had overheard a conversation with a master goldsmith if he recalled this correctly the man had been recountingwith great pleasurethe long negotiation he was having with a particular gem trader who had decided to overwinter in haven purely to keep the bargaining going so gold and gem merchants would remain particularly if staying would get them a really good bargain they was sportin a morto sparklies he recalled huh i wunner if they was like t sell any on em if so the gems they were selling would lend verisimilitude to pretending to be gem traders and no one thought twice about gem traders being foreign in fact if he had been in their shoes and had not established an alternate safe house down in haven that would be exactly what he would do well unless he thought of something even safer well that gave him an outline for another course of action investigate the innsand there couldnt be manywhere the goldsmiths were that could be a bit difficult in his current disguise but not impossible do wool sellers overwinter it would be easy enough to find that out with a day or so of lingering in that part of the city horse and cattle tradersno there were horse fairs from midsummer on but they stopped at the first snow there was a cattle fair for weaned calves at midsummer then nothing until the fall but by the time the first snow fell cattle traders were safely back home no use looking there same for sheep and other livestock besides aside from exotic breeds of horses like shinain the sellers were all valdemaran spices dyes and medicines maybe hed have to lurk again grain no and anyway all sellers would again be valdemaran not foreign he wracked his brain a merchant that was foreign would have to be selling something exotic and very expensive and in order to overwinter he would either have planned to be here or got caught by surprise all right that narrowed things down quite a bit weapons no that would make them stand out which was something that they wouldnt want to do what about a reason for being in haven that had nothing to do with selling anything aha scholars virtually every temple had a library and archives now that might be the answer if they were pretending to be scholars they could move from inn to inn without causing comment and only needed to go out to study during the day to keep up the ruse no one thought twice about scholars being foreign peculiar or reclusive and that led to another sobering thought what if all those trips down into haven on the part of the bodyguards had not been to get drunk but to scout out potential places where they could all go should they need to abandon the court he hoped that nikolas had thought of that never mind concentrate on what he could do that was the important thing right now he picked up his begging bowl and held his staff out in front of him sweeping it back and forth in little arcs to feel his way which he wasnt actually doing of course he was using other peoples glimpses of him to figure out where he was going it could have been disorienting had he not gotten used to it while he sat in his corner this afternoon it was a bit difficult to do but not disorientinglike trying to thread a needle by looking at it in the mirror that only made him go slowly and with the appearance of fumbling a bit which was all to the good it added to the realism of his performance it amused him a little to think that all he needed now would be for some kindhearted soul to take his elbow and offer to lead him where he wanted to go he had made sure to get up and move only when the crowds had thinned out so as not to inconvenience folk too much no one appeared terribly irritated by him and most simply cleared out of his way with no fuss since the last place that his quarry had been was that section of inns on the trade road that was where he headed his first position hadnt been too far from there so that was all to the good it took him about a candlemark to slowly walk there find a reasonable place to set upvisible but out of trafficand settle in he thinned his mental shields a little more this time hoping to pick something up specifically about his quarry a few moments later he heard someone speakingto him what happened to you the tone sounded more suspicious than concerned he refocused on the nearer stray thoughts and got an image from people around him as well as the man himself ah the person in question was a city constable checking to be sure that he was an honest beggar he hadnt known that they checked on beggars good thing that he had made his preparations burnt sir he said softly and slipped his bandage a little it was dusk and what looked passable by daylight was hideously convincing by twilight accident he felt the mans involuntary recoil and had to suppress a smile of satisfaction he pulled the bandage back up im sorry for you lad you can set up here the man said and mags heard his footsteps going off once again mags set to listening in on unguarded errant thoughts it was a lot like working in the mine actually a lot of tedious chipping and sifting through things you couldnt use and didnt want hoping for a sparklie the constable returnedthis must have been a regular patrol for himand paused through the eyes of a curious passerby mags watched him lean down and felt something warm placed in his hand a chance thought from the constable himself told him what it wasa meat pie oh thankee sir he said his voice warm with very real gratitude it had been a very long time since that half pie this morning and this was what some of the inns called a drovers pie twice the size of the normal ones with meat in one half and apple in the other been a good bit since brekky eh inns on the row feed guards and constables free the man said with a trace of embarrassment they give us too much and i thought you could use it a kindness still be a kindness sir mags replied ye took thought aye many wouldnt thankee the man was pleased if still embarrassed and moved off on his rounds mags savored the aroma of the pie it was a good one he bit into it by purest chance getting the meat end and slowly chewed and swallowed it was a very good pie made all the better by the fact of the constables kindness damn dallen muttered sleepily what im not there to get the apple end mags almost laughed he stayed there until long after dark listening waiting patient a few more coins dropped into his bowl he got some tantalizing hints about his quarry when someone asked about the increased patrols and the inn servants talked about horde of guard and heralds that had descended on an inn further down the road dallen did th foreigners leave anythin behind when they scarpered off nothing but the lunatic dallen replied otherwise the place was scoured clean so whatever it was thatdamn it he had to give his quarry a name temper he decided for the man certainly was in a towering temper whatever it was that temper had left behind it hadnt been at the last inn and he learned that the constables and the guard had been to every inn on the row with descriptions of the foreigners asking if they had stayed there they had of course but again they had left nothing behind in fact they were careful not to leave so much as a stray hair or a nail paring behind which had struck the innkeeper whose thoughts mags was watching as being odd he got nothing more after thatwell nothing pertinent although he did learn that at astonishing number of married men brought clandestine lovers to these places as the night weathered on and the inn common rooms began to empty out he caught the thoughts of the constable again the man was approaching a bit reluctantly hmm mags wondered what he was about to say if you were to curl up farther back in that nook to sleep the constable said standing over him youd be out of the way and i wouldnt need to ask you to leave for the night mags chuckled thankee sir but i got a safer place time fer me t be gettin on then im afraid so the man said apologetically as mags got to his feet with the help of his staff and picked up his bowl were not supposed to allow people to sleep on the street rules are rules rulesre there fer a reason sir reckon it keeps them like me safe too be fair easy fer someone to decide he didnt care for the looka me an give me a kick or three goonight t ye and to you the constable replied relieved that mags had made no fuss and good luck mags made his way down the street a little hampered by the fact that there werent a lot of people about whose eyes he could use but as soon as he was well out of sight of the constable he ducked into a darkened doorway and with relief peeled the wax off his eyes with wax and bandage tucked away safe and his bowl and staff under his arm he made for the part of town where he had found his cozy sleeping spot at a quite brisk pace energized by the unexpected bonus of that pie on the way he had the good fortune of running into a street vendor who was just packing up who was happy to sell him the remainder of his stock for the handful of small coins mags had been given today though the skinny sausages and tiny bitesized pies the man handed over were beginning to dry out and had been made of the cheapest possible scraps and innards in the first place nevertheless mags had not scrupled to eat a half pie dropped in the dirt this morning and he wasnt going to cavil at eating these now he got a drink at a public fountain and horse trough in a square on the way to his goal after devouring the sausages since the pies would keep better there was a line of workmen having a bit of a washup at another public horse trough and he took advantage of the opportunity to do the same by now inns were closing their doors and he was in a good position to scramble up to his chimney pots without being noticed as drunks who were disinclined to pay for a spot on the floor to sleep off their liquor were turned out into the street with the staff tied to his back and the bowl inside his shirt he made it up before the local constable came by on his round he tucked his pies right up against the chimneypots to keep them warm and settled in anythin from anybody he asked dallen nikolas is testing you in part dallen replied dryly as you suspected but there is reason to think there is someone up here who is in contact with our quarry whether it is someone at court a servant or even a guard we cant tell and whether the person is in collusion or being duped we cant tell that either till i actually find something dont matter he replied theyre moving me back to companions stable tomorrow dallen continued healers only has one stall for companions so there it is ive been politely asked to vacate and agreed im allowed to stand on my own a very little bit and the rest of the time i can lie down so time to give the stall back in case someone worse than me is brought in it will be nice to be in my own stall again and they will still keep working on me wisht i was there mags replied wistfully well caint be helped and i wish bones healed faster mags hesitated then asked the question that had been haunting him bear said i am quite aware of what bear said dallen replied dryly allow me to point out that bear has never healed anything but a horse and cannot possibly know what to expect from a companion i am healing fine and my legs will be just as strong as before you and i will be playing kirball as soon as you get back up here or all right maybe not quite that soon but certainly before midsummer mags heaved a sigh of intense relief companions are not often crippled except by age dallen continued bear couldnt know that of course itswell for the same reason we stay white so rest easy chosen he added fondly well soon be kirball champions again ha mags replied happily curling up to sleep ye mean you will im jest the baggage in yer saddle hmm mags got the sense that dallen had taken his medicines again and was about to drowse off i wont deny that the mares have been very attentive very atten tive mags chuckled quietly and drifted off to sleep chapter every day mags set up in one of five places where he thought that the foreigners might be hiding it wasnt at all difficult to get himself established he had learned something about the beggars just by things dallen warned him to be careful about now that he was out here he learned a lot more by catching their surface thoughts mostly what he figured he needed to do was set himself up in such a way that he didnt annoy them they could be surprisingly competitive so he needed to make sure they saw him as nothing like a threat he hadnt realized that part until he came to set up among them during the day he had been lucky his first night setting up quite by accident in a quiet spot that none of them wanted now he had to be more careful and after dark he prowled some of the darker corners of haven keeping to the shadows just in case against his own judgment the foreigners might have taken shelter among the poor and the criminal but by day and even into the night until the inns closed their doors to anyone not paying to stay the night he haunted his five districts moving once around noon and rotating them so that he never visited the same one twice in a row the constables of the five areas he frequented got to know himhe called himself treyand looked out for him which was good because he wasnt an aggressive beggar most beggars called out their sad stories to passersby and made a great display of their infirmities mags obviously did not because the one thing he did not want to do was to draw attention to himself as a consequence his takings were fairly meager on the other hand he never once got into a fight with one of the other beggars usually those fights were verbal but not always besides he couldnt afford either the attraction or the distraction that a fight would cause the constables always saw to it that he had a decent midday meal at least but things would have been very lean indeed if he had not resorted to a combination of theft and scavenging now it would have been dissembling to say that he only stole from those who deserved getting stolen frombut he really was in a good position to determine those who did deserve a bad turn and most of the time he managed to be no more than an inconvenience or an embarrassment and one thing was absolutely true he never stole from anyone who couldnt afford it and at any rate it was never anything worse than snatching a bit of foodusually by nipping in through a hall window at an inn and helping himself to meals left at the doors of people who had hired the room for reasons other than a place to sleep in short he stole from men entertaining women who were not their wives in private and very expensive rooms he never took money although the opportunity presented itself nor other property though that came within reach of his fingers even more often than money he had discovered he had a positive talent for scampering about on rooftops which considering how much of his life had been spent underground was supremely ironic it wasnt at all difficult there were never more than a handful of these special rooms in an inn and all were on the top floor just below the servants attic rooms all he had to do was wait until a postassignation meal had been left discretley at the door swing in through a hall window stuff his shirt full and scramble out again it never took him more than a few moments and to be honest these little feasts were so extravagant he doubted that much was missed he did not use that talent for roof exploration in the poorer quarters however there were plenty of souls who lived there that were far better at it than he was and most of those people had sharp tempers and sharper knives no he kept to the ground to the shadows there finding places he could hide and listen it wasnt pleasant the alleys here were only cleaned by rain and it was a good thing he had a strong stomach although he caught a few brief whispers of temper somewhere off in the distance and never for long enough to get an idea as to direction never again did he feel the full force of tempers thoughts except in sleep he slowly came to understand that as he had suspected these actually were tempers nightmares not his and that was where things took a very odd turn indeed waking the man was tough ruthless and utterly immoral in his dreams he was the victim the man spent every night fleeing from or fighting with something he knew would destroyhad destroyedeverything he cared about it had been mags own memories that had colored what he had gotten from temper and turned the dreams more personal in his dreams he didnt know what the thing was he fled from or fought temper however knew very well what or who it was but since it was a dream mags had no way of controlling it to see the situation through tempers eyes so the shadowy hunter remained a mystery it got even stranger once he realized that he began to suspect that temper was no mere hapless victim but that he had given himself into the situation willingly that he had sacrificed the very things he loved for the sake of power and strangest of all mags got the impression that the very thing he fought was the thing he served in fact the thing he fought was the thing he himself most wanted to become or perhaps replace no wonder he was insane mags wanted to feel sorry for him and couldnt the man was in every sense a monster the longer temper remained at large the more danger he posed because mags knew that he was tenacious either out of fear of his master fear of failure openeyed ambition or a combination of all three temper would not leave a job until he was called off or the job was completed aside from all that this was oddly one of the most satisfying times of mags life he was doing something important and yet he was more free than he had ever been he answered to no one except himself and he had dallen certainly he was living and sleeping rough certainly there were nights of an empty belly days in the misery of a pouring cold rain that would be followed by a night in the open hoping that someone would put a fire in one of the fireplaces served by his chimney pots but if he succeeded it would all be worth it he was learning more about haven than he had ever gotten from books or even from dallen and since most of what he did was absorptive observation he was learning far far more about people than he ever dreamed possible those little glimpses he got of their unguarded thoughts were telling him more about what it was like to be someone who had a normal life than he would have under any other circumstances it tended to leak over too more than once he found himself looking at things from two sidesthe way mags did and the way a normal person did and he learned that he was not as much of a freak as he had thought he was he learned that most intelligent people seemed to spend their lives feeling as if they didnt fit in that almost all of them felt like strangers inside their own skins even when among their own friends all of them seemed to be lonely more or less many to his surprise were certain that there was a terrible darkness inside them that would utterly revolt anyone that knew about it now it was true enough that his situation was unique he really was something of an anomoly but he wasnt alone in feeling like such a complete outsider that he might as well have been raised by wolves it struck him as so very strange and yet maybe not so strange all of these people were alone in their own heads isolated inside their own skins they didnt have never would have what he had with dallen that made him both less alone and more alien than any of them but then again that was the case with all heralds its a wonder we dont all go mad dallen said sleepily except we keep each other sane i suppose if yer sure yere not crazy dont that pretty much mean ye are he replied and got a woozy chuckle days went by without so much as a hint outside of his sleeptime of temper he began to wonder if temper had somehow detected him and was now effectively shielding his thoughts or maybe that shadow he had sensed had and was that being the case he was going to have to go back to scanning the crowds using nothing more than his eyes or rather other peoples eyes he tried briefly to use animals but there either wasnt enough mindpower there for him to skim off what they saw or else he just wasnt in tune with them but the more he practiced the better he got at it until he was able to see what was going on several blocks away and that was how it happened that three days after dallen was moved back to his old stall late at night as the inns emptied out mags thought he spotted someone familiar it was not the hair which had been cut roughly nor the clothing which was nondescript it was a way of turning the head of walking betraying an arrogance that was only partly hidden it was a barely contained force that made people give the man a wide berth he sifted through all the surface thoughts as fast as he could until he came to the right ones and he knew they were the right ones because he sensed that shadow again hiding them but it was only partly successful the shadow was keeping mags from the direct connection that he had had beforebut it couldnt stop the mans thoughts from leaking out over his rather fragmented natural shields there was something about those shields why should they be shattered like that most people that werent gifted either had no shields or were so strongly blockaded they might just as well have been lumps of stone mags got another impression a feeling more than any actual information that once upon a time this man actually had possessed good natural shields but something had fractured them and now his surface thoughts were anyones to read mags could not imagine what circumstance could have done that in his experience shields could be brought down or forced down or destroyed entirely as the mind that created them was destroyed but they couldnt be shattered like that and then left in pieces he reminded himself not to be distracted and put his attention back on gleaning every tiny bit of information that he could from those thoughts as the last time tempers main emotions were immediate irritation with the people around him layered over loathing he really really hated haven and valdemar and the people who called valdemar home he desperately wanted to leave mags got glimpses this time of the place that the man considered home proper secure it was nothing like he had expected it was like a huge guard barracks if the barracks themselves had been run by a fanatic for order and rules and had been the size of a city very regimented in every way very disciplined rigid there were few recreations and those few were strictly controlled every aspect of life from infancy to old age seemed to be dictated by the handful in power and the one aspiration that everyone had was to rise to become one of those that made the rules you were told what to do what to believe what to learn and what to think and no deviations were permitted that was the impression that mags got anyway small wonder the cheerful chaos that was life in valdemar revolted this fellow to the core to his mind to live without a rule for everything was to live like an animal he was moving off and soon he would be out of mags mental reach no hope for it mags would have to follow it was dark enough that mags felt safe in discarding his disguise altogether pulling off his eyewrap and the wax leaving his bowl and staff behind so that he could hurry to catch up to the man before he got out of the distance at which mags could keep picking up those surface thoughts at first mags thought that he was going to return to wherever it was he and the others were hiding that thought was uppermost in his mind although mags got no sense of where that might be and he was walking away from any of the areas that mags had thought likely but then something else another goal began leaking out the object the thing he had lost now temper knew exactly where it was tonight he was going to get it and he was only killing time until he reckoned it was safe enough to go after it just as he thought that temper turned his head to look over his shoulder and his eyes fell directly on magswho fortunately was limping along looking not at the man but at the ground the better to concentrate on following tempers thoughts he fought the urge to freeze or hide and kept on walking as if he too had a place to go and wanted to get into it he saw himself through the mans eyes sensed instant analysis and while he tried not to cringe in fear he sensed instant dismissal to this man the wretched creature that was limping along the street behind him posed no sort of threat this was one of the poorest of the poor in rags filthy undersized and carrying no weapons of no consequence mags heaved a sigh of relief as the man went on to examine analyze and dismiss everyone else around him he hadnt recognized mags from the collegium and he didnt realize he was being followed that was when mags sensed the cutpurse who was hiding in the alley ahead then sensed that the thief had spotted temper the surface thoughts of the thief desperation crossed with greed alarmed mags and he stopped bending over to fumble with a shoe while he tried to figure out what was going to happen and if he could do anything about it the wouldbe thief was a boy not a man a boy no older than he was a boy with a master to answer to and who so far today had nothing to bring back to him coming back meant a beating or worse and no supper the boy looked at temper with the eyes of a hunter amd saw good clothing a man wellfed with no obvious weapons that was enough the thief made his decision before mags could even think of something to try and stop him the boy was moving his was the cutandrun style rushing at the victim from under cover cutting the bands of the beltpouch and dashing off with it effective only when conditions favored a swift escape it was wellsuited to a nightthief and to thefts where crowds thickened and thinned again hampering pursuit the boy thought he had such conditionsnight the alley and a half a dozen escape routes on the other side of the street he was wrong the man heard the running footsteps his instincts all came alive and an unholy glee came over him the rest was a blur to mags caught as he was between the thoughts of the cutpurse and the thoughts of temper temper threw off such violence that it rocked mags back on his heels but it was precise and calculated violence and an acute pleasure in what he was about to do that was very nearly pain in and of itself the man moved at the last minute the boys outstretched hands missed the tempting purse there was a moment of anger and bewilderment on the part of the thief as his hands closed on air then a flash of terrible pain and incredulity then nothing and in the street ahead all that anyone would have seen was the thief make a rush the man step aside and the thief falling to the ground as if he had stumbled except the thief didnt get up again temper passed on leaving the cooling body of the boy in the street it happened that quickly one moment the thief was alive the next dead mags could scarcely believe it shaken to his core he sought for dallen but found only that haze that meant dallen was heavily drugged and nothing would rouse him he recoiled from tempers thoughts as the man savagely reviewed the three steps he had taken to break the boys neck with the pommel of his hidden dagger so as to leave no obvious signs of violence on him for the watch to find temper lingered lovingly over each move each sensation culminating with the climax of the weighted pommel striking exactly the precise point where the skull joined the spine the single point that would kill the cutpurse instantlylingering over the feel of the buttheavy dagger in his hand the solid impact with the skull the sight of the boy sprawling just a little ahead of him momentum taking what was already a corpse into a slide on the street it was a perfect kill nothing could have been betterexcept perhaps if hed had the leisure to strangle the thief with his bare hands temper loved this this was how it should be this was what he should be doing not skulking around trying to find theto find theto find the book mags realized as he finally saw what the man had been looking for all this time he recognized it hed handled it himself all unknowing it was the book of poetry with the pictures of flowers in it that had been left behind when they vacated kicked under a couch and forgotten in the haste to depart the book of poetry butwhy temper had been working for moons to discover who had it what had become of it without the book he couldnthe couldnt before that thought could emerge tempers goal swam to the forefront of his thoughts the palace no the guard archives that was where their possessions had gone when everything possible had been gleaned from them temper had finally determined this after weeks of finding where the palace guardsmen went on their nights off and pouring wine down willing throats to lubricate them now he was heading for the palace to get it back and there was no way for mags to alert anyone not this far away dallen was sleeping like the dead now tempers thoughts were overlaid with agitation and anxiety born out of the fact that the man knew he had orders yet did not know what those orders were in his world following orders was of absolute importance yet he could not follow the ones he had been given because he didnt know what they were how could he not know what they were that didnt make any sense the bookthe book what did the book have to do with all of this mags tried to think what on earth there was about the book that had escaped everyone every single soul that knew how to look for such things had examined it there were no false covers there was no invisible ink there was no way for packets of orders to be hidden in it so why mags didnt dare pause for temper acting with that terrible urgency impelling him was making his way from shadow to shadow with a speed that mags could scarcely believe the only possible way mags had of trying to contact anyone up at the collegium was to stop and concentrate but he didnt dare stop if he did hed lose the man if he lost the man and couldnt say where or how the man was going to get in the only choice would be to rouse the collegium if he did that temper would see and know that he had somehow been exposed and he would vanish again all that mags could do for the moment was to stick with him and hope that once they were on the grounds he could get hold of someone to raise a quiet alarm and ambush temper as he searched for the bookthe bookwhy the book why that book then like a gift another set of images flashed across his mind and into mags grasp and suddenly mags knew why he wanted it the thoughts were carried on waves of frustration and despair the book was the key to a cipher he and the rest were using to communicate with their superiors it was nearly unbreakable too unless you had the key the key was simple enough every fortnight it would change to the next set of lines in the given poem letters of the alphabet were assigned to the letters in those lines there were further complications involving maths that mags barely glimpsed and which made his head spin but the basis was the changing lines of poetry in that book the irony was since no one in haven had had any idea that they were getting secret ordersfrom whom mags couldnt tell that wasnt in tempers surfacethoughtsthe orders probably could have been written plainly the problem was temper and his cohorts had come to the end of the poem they were using the last message gave the number of the page the next one would be on but they hadnt memorized that so even if they had memorized all the poems in the book the odds of then remembering which one was on which page was rather slim and they couldnt tell that to their masters the message delivery all went one way nor was there any possibility of getting another copy of the book not without going home and anyone going home to report such failure would be killed there was very little tolerance for mistakes none at all for a mistake like this one the man mags called temper slowed his pace they were now among the homes of the welltodo there was great danger of being spotted here there were many patrols of both the watch and the guard and they were more alert to subtle signs of an interloper than were the ones down deeper into haven who watched mostly for overt violations of the law and crimes being committed openly on the streets this was how mags had gotten away with purloining so many dinners innkeepers and householders were expected to see to their own security after all there were only so many watchmen and guards and far too many windows doors and roofhatches ah but here mags had the advantage he knew this part of haven much better than temper did now he could run ahead while temper only skulked or so he thought to his chagrin and incredulity he sensed temper straighten take a folded sealed packet out of a pocket and with that in his hand stride confidently up the middle of the road he was a man with a message to deliver and no one was going to look at him twice no mags would have to skulk not even in the darkness was he going to pass as someone who belonged up here as ragged and filthy as he was at least he knew the area he knew who had dogs who had private guards whether or not those guards were vigilant so he followed temper just out of sight keeping walls and other obstructions between himself and the foreign agent so that if temper heard the sound of mags bare feet on the pavement hed see nothing if he turned to look he didnt seem to hear anything however and mags kept up a running mostly inarticulate prayer that he wouldnt mags was very aware of the nearness of the palace the looming walls that surrounded it and that they were drawing nearer to it with every moment there was an open space officially designated as a park between the last of the great manors and the walls around the palace and collegia here the man paused his mind closed to mags as he searched intently for something this was the back of the palace not far from companions field there was nothing like a gate here surely he wasnt going to try and get over the wall even as mags watched that was exactly what he did he raced across the open lawn and if mags hadnt been watching him he would never have seen him go he took advantage of a cloud passing over the moon to run to the wall in that moving shadow then impossibly he jumped for the wall and scuttled up it like a spider disappearing over the top with a spasm of despair mags followed in his wake chapter mags discovered why temper had chosen that particular spot to go over the wall a massive vine of some sort had grown up along itit had rightfully been killed but someone had carelessly left the main stem embedded in the wall it was just as good as a ladder that must have been how he and his cohorts had fled the palace in the first place after the blizzard whoever had left this thing here was going to get the sack at least but that would be later right now mags tumbled over the top of the wall and rolled to land temper had a good lead on him now they were right at the edge of companions field from tempers fleeting thoughts he had a good many paces lead over mags at this point mags hurried to narrow that lead and spotted the manthe shadow rather if he hadnt been watching tempers thoughts he wouldnt have known it was a manhiding in the shadow of the end of the stable that contained mags own room mags took cover himself and waited for temper to make the next move but if e goes straight fer the guard archives i kin get t th stable an get onea the other companions t wake up is herald and and that was when it all went horribly wrong temper was in sight of the companions stable his mind flashed over with that unholy glee and excitement and the image of what he was going to do to distract everyone from his raid on the archives branded itself into mags mind he was going to barricade the doors and set fire to the companions stable horror washed over mags oh the others would be able to get outthey could batter the wooden doors down and no companion was going to be as terrified by fire as a horse but dallen couldnt dallen was drugged and the next thing to immobile he would be trapped in there while the stable burned around him the moment the others broke the doors down flaming debris would fly inside setting fire to all that straw and hay hed be trapped helpless terror ripped through mags like a lightning strike there was no time to spare no time to use mindspeech to wake the people he knew no time to do anything except rouse everyone his thoughts could reach and fast except he didnt know how to do that the way that say rolan did it he could shout but only to the limited number of people he knew so he did what he had been told over and over again never to do he dropped his shields all of them even the ones that had been up and protecting him before he even knew there was such a thing as a gift before he really knew there was much of a world outside the mine everything went down so that he in turn could reach everyone and as the dozens hundreds of minds up here rushed in on him battering him from all sides he screamed his warning into them even into the mind of temper who was frozen in place for a moment as the image of what he had intended to do came flooding back at him laden with a burden of warning panic and terror the response came back to mags redoubled all those minds some shocked awake all taken by surprise all jolted by his panic and responding with panic of their own what what what feeling as if he was in the center of a cavein mags struggled to get his shields back up struggled and failed it felt as if his head was going to break into a million pieces a hundred images flashed in front of him and he couldnt tell which belonged to him voices in his mind babbled shouted at him and he couldnt understand any of them his brain burned and it was all he could do to stand erect and he felt his very hold on sanity slipping but dallen was in danger dallen was in danger scarcely able to see for the conflicting images in his head stumbling and disoriented nevertheless he rushed for temper dallen was in danger that was all that mattered he had to get to temper before temper could move he reached the man just as temper recovered from the mental blow and somewhere under the battering of a thousand confused thoughts he knew that he had never done anything this stupid before he lurched at temper with his hands out staggering like a drunk barely able to control his own body enough to run at the man heand a hundred others through his eyessaw temper pull his dagger and slash at him with it temper was moving slowly though very slowly not likea hundred others sawfelt the memory of tempers killwhen he murdered that poor thief temper recoiled his mind reflexively lashing out mags stumbled and fell which is what saved him from tempers first slash enraged afire with uncontrolled anger temper came at him again just asa myriad of confused minds tried to shove him awaymags managed to get to his feet temper slashed at him againnot the controlled and calculated movement of a skilled knifefighter but the flailing of someone who barely knew which end of the knife to hold it didnt matter the knife scored a painful slash across mags ribs the pain was what saved him momentarily at least as the blade burned across his chest that same pain made his shields snap back up he gasped with mingled agony and relief as his mind cleared unfortunately so did tempers the mans stance changed immediately and he snapped into a knifefighters crouch mag knew in an instant that he was in trouble the best he could hope for would be to stay out of reach which as tempers arm lashed out was not looking likely he moved faster than anyone that mags had ever seen mags managed to evade him but barely and temper was right on top of him before he had any right to be mags shields dropped again he staggered as too many minds to count shrieked into his nearest was the white rage of temper incandescent with furyand somehow mags reflected some of that incoherent anger right back at him causing him to stagger and miss vaguely he was aware of every window in heralds collegium lighting up of people boiling out of the building of the companions in their stable beside him screaming with rage and battering at the barricaded doors temper slashed at him again then rushed him tempers shoulder hit him right where hed been cut he gasped with pain and his shields snapped back up again he managed to shove temper off and stagger a few paces away temper rushed him again he ducked to the side getting another cut across the bicep in the process the pain kept him steady kept his shields up but he was fighting for his life and he knew it and he was in worse shape than he had been when hed been fending off bears kidnapper he was wheezing already and his side burned tempers eyes narrowed and he glanced to the side people seemed to have figured out that the stable was where they should be and a mob was heading in their direction mags half expected temper to say something when his eyes returned to mags he didnt in fact he gave mags no warning at all one moment he was crouched a few armlengths away mags didnt even see him start to move then mags back hit the stable wall knocking the breath out of him tempers forearm was across his throat and whitehot pain lanced out from the center of his gut he screamed and his shields went downhe blasted his agony out and temper staggered back both hands to his temples mags lunged at him his gut still on fire both hands going for tempers knife he had to get it away from the manhad to or he was dead he grappled with temper feeling his strength ebbing somehow he got both his hands on the knifehand his knees gave and he pulled temper down as he dropped to the ground somehow temper ended up underneath him he smashed tempers knifehand on the ground but the man would not let go of the blade mags snarled stooped and bit the hand holding the knife his teeth sinking into the flesh below the thumb until he drew blood tasted the flat sweetness of the blood felt bones snap under his teeth the dagger fell away into the dirt mags snatched it up now it was only one mind filling his and overpowering it with anger and death his eyes widened and he ground his teeth with rage he didnt even thinkhe just picked up the knife in both hands and drove it down into the thing underneath him over and over and over again temper uttered a surprised sounding gurgleand died the rage died with him abruptly emptied mags sat there for a moment the bloody knife still poised in midair then someone else hit him from the side and his gut erupted with fire again he curled in around the agony blood oozing into his hands as he clutched his middle his shields came down snapped up came down snapped up as the world spun around him anddozens of babbling angry voiceshis gut screamed andwho what why whohis vision blurred he looked up to see the king with the knife in his hands and the front of his whites dyed with blood andblood death rage rage ragehe looked down to see his own hands dripping with blood andwho death what blood rage somehow he staggered to his feet somehow with one hand clutching his stomach he started to reach out somehow then all the voices in his head shrieked at once and he reflected blasted it all back at them and he felt impact at the back of his head then an explosion of light he went down but he held to a thin thin strand of consciousness falling in and out of blankness how did he get in how did both saw him stabbing shouting hooves battering wood splintering wood blankness then something white enormous big as a house and white standing over him warm sweet hayscented breath washing over him taking some of the pain closing off some of the minds screaming in his head rolan what in the name of a snort a hoof pawing the ground impatiently beside mags head thats who mags then who is never mind that for the gods sake get a healer here and that was when mercifully it all began to fade voices pain and all leaving behind nothing but quiet darkness and peace he woke up with the warm sunlight pouring down on him and the familiar sharp scents of herbs and soap around him huh reckon i know where i am i rather thought you would welcome back mags so how beat upm i this time he was disinclined to move because he really didnt want to spoil things with pain right now he could feel a lot of bandages around his midsection though a slash across the ribs one across the bicep that is rather deep and three gutwounds that by some miracle did not touch anything vital altogether considering who you faced he restrained a shiver because it would hurt damn lucky i saw im take out that thief i seen lightnin strike slower did i kill im dallen sighed unfortunately yes then again questioning might not have gotten anything out of him anyway mags didnt consider it unfortunate at all but he didnt say anything considering how slippery temper had been there was no telling if they would have been able to hold him much less question him which one was he surprisingly not the chief of the alleged delegation in fact i am not sure you ever actually saw him when they were all up here at the palace he was one of the underlings not one of the bodyguards or at least he was feigning to be huh mags considered that that makes sense actually best place t hide so i am told well it looks like both of us will be ready to start kirball practice at about the same time dallen seemed inclined to change the subject and but mags wasnt going to let him so who hit me which time mags thought about that for a moment who hit me i th head that would have been herald yvanda i am told she smacked you with a large branch that would account for the big bump back there who knocked me offa temper that would be the king he was the first one there because he was actually in the stable he had to climb up into the loft and get down out of the hay door bloody ell mags wasnt sure whether to be appalled or full of admiration both probably there are going to be some changes made to the stable dallen added a bit grimly more than one door and breakaway hinges im afraid that the place is built a little too well aye he thought about how close dallen had come to being roasted and this time couldnt hold back the shudder but now the vision is explained it was your blood the king was covered in they were rather appalled when they saw how thoroughly you had dispatched the man you called temper but then most of them had been experiencing what you did as your shields went up and down and on reflection the general consensus is that they are surprised you hadnt diced him into a thousand pieces he thought about that reckon it was because i was runnin outa strength an blood very probably i know youre awake said bear startling him into opening his eyes you arent going to get out of taking my potion by pretending you arent oh ye reckon he said then feeling extremely awkward look im sorryfer what i said im not there was enough of it that was true that lena and i needed to hear it and better from you than someone else bear handed him a glass whatever was in it looked vile however to get back at you i have made sure these potions are all made from the worst possible tasting alternatives in my list figgers he held his breath and drank it down it was bad enough to make his eyes water ye werent lyin he gasped bear just smiled and pushed his lenses up on his nose my brother went home he said looking very smug i dont know what was said to him but he left without anything more than a really irritated goodbye he really hates being told that hes not the last authority on everything he gets treated that way by everyone in his house and he thinks he should always be treated that way mags thought he detected more amusement than anger in bears tone he smiled and felt his eyes starting to close you get some rest bear said as his lids fluttered shut another healer woke him so that he could get some lunch gazing sternly at his rather bony torso all that work to get some meat on you and you go and make it all to do again he scolded then he ordered the food and mags had a bit of a hard time getting through it all i hope the next time you get into trouble the man added a little crossly you dont decide to blast all of us out of our beds i didn reckon i had time t call people one at a time mags began well next time reckon on something else get the proper mindspeech training and finish that food the healer seemed to think he had won something and exited mags just shook his head he still didnt understand people the next time bear came he brought lena and mags steeled himself for his apology to her but she didnt even let him begin it first she fussed over him a great deal evidently having actual wounds from a weapon rather than just bruises impressed her a lot which was odd because the bruises had hurt a lot more then when he had reassured her for the third time that he was going to be all right she looked sheepish then guilty then asked all in a rush then if you are going to be all right you wont mind my father coming to ask you questions aha mystery solved er pa is suckin up to er again well fer you he replied she beamed at him and evidently all was forgiven amily turned up while he was still talking to lena and bear and the little smile she gave him warmed him more than the sunshine had none of them wanted to speak of anything but commonplaces catching him up on what had happened while he had been on his selfimposed exile and since his head wasnt working all that well under the influence of the medicines he just lay back and let them chatter it was when nikolas turned up that he woke up all the way it was just twilight someone had come around to light the lamps but there werent many of them here as the patients were generally encouraged to sleep as much as possible mags was drowsing a little when he sensed the familiar presence and opened his eyes to see nikolas just standing in the doorway the kings own smiled crookedly when he saw mags had spotted him for someone who never saw a herald before last year youre upholding our traditions very well he said what mags asked ye mean heralds being targets exactly nikolas entered and took the chair beside the bed weve just finished a literal housetohouse search of haven the rest of the foreigners are gone he was the mportant one mags said not at all surprised i reckon e was th one that kept em all here likely nikolas nodded you are going to be in for a rough couple of days i fear rolan and i are going to go rummage through everything you picked up from him while it is all still fresh in your mind we might glean some clues from it if not answers oh he grimaced that was going to be very unpleasant but he wasnt exactly in a position to say no i apologize for not being available when you needed me mags nikolas was saying while mags was still thinking over the need to go through all those nasty thoughts and images yet again i was involved in something very tricky i still am actually but its at a stage where it has to lie fallow for a while i cant tell you what it is obviously mags nodded what i will tell you is that for the next four to six moons i think you can consider yourself free to be a normal trainee nikolas grinned or at least as normal as trainees ever are play kirball humor marchand go have midsummer festival with lydia and her friends flirt with my daughter he laughed when mags blushed hotly what did you think i hadnt noticed he asked mockingly just how preoccupied with my duties do you think i am mags blushed again you will be doing something actually quite important when you do all these things mags nikolas continued sobering youll be integrating yourself with the rest of the trainees youll be establishing yourself not just to them but in your own mind as one of the circle do you understand what i am saying mags mags blinked thoughtfully i think so sir believe it mags because there is not a bit of doubt in anyone elses mind after last night nikolas stood up to go there is no one in all of valdemar more fit to be a herald than you the words echoed in his mind and followed him down into sleep bringing healing in their wake there were unanswered questions still and a great many of them but for now they could wait
