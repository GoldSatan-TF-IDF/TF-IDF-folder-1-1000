the song of deirdra king byrge and his brothers and other ballads by george borrow london printed for private circulation copyright in the united states of america by houghton mifflin co for clement shorter the song of deirdra farewell grey albyn much loved land i neer shall see thy hills again upon those hills i oft would stand and view the chase sweep oer the plain twas pleasant from their tops i ween to see the stag that bounding ran and all the rout of hunters keen the sons of usna in the van the chiefs of albyn feasted high amidst them usnas children shone and nasa kissed in secrecy the daughter fair of high dundron to her a milkwhite doe he sent with little fawn that frisked and played and once to visit her he went as home from inverness he strayed the news was scarcely brought to me when jealous rage inflamed my mind i took my boat and rushed to sea for death for speedy death inclined but swiftly swimming at my stern came ainlie bold and ardan tall those faithful striplings made me turn and brought me back to nasas hall then thrice he swore upon his arms his burnished arms the foemans bane that he would never wake alarms in this fond breast of mine again dundrons fair daughter also swore and called to witness earth and sky that since his love for her was oer a maiden she would live and dieah did she know that slain in fight he wets with gore the irish hill how great would be her moan this night but greater far would mine be still the diver a ballad translated from the german where is the man who will dive for his king in the pool as it rushes with turbulent sweep a cup from this surfbeaten jetty i fling and he who will seek it below in the deep and will bring it again to the light of the day as the meed of his valour shall bear it away now courage my knights and my warriors bold for one two and three and away it shall go he tossd as he said it the goblet of gold deep deep in the howling abysses below where is the hero who ventures to brave the whirl of the pool and the break of the wave the steelcoated lancemen and nobles around spoke not but they trembled in silent surprise and pale they all stood on the cliffs giddy bound and no one would venture to dive for the prize three times have i spoke but no hero will spring and dive for the goblet and dive for the king but still they were silent and pale as before till a brave son of eirin in venturous pride dashd forth from the lancemens trembling corps and canted his helm cast his mantle aside while spearman and noble and lady and knight gazed on the bold stripling in breathless affright unmoved by the thoughts of his horrible doom he mounted the cliffand he pausd on his leap for the waves which the pool had imbibed in its womb were spouted in thunder again from the deep yes as they returnd their report was as loud as the peal when it bursts from the stormriven cloud it roared and it drizzled it hissd and it whirld and it bubbled like water when mingled with flame and columns of foam to the heaven were hurld and billow on billow tumultuously came it seemd that the womb of the ocean would bear sea over sea to the uppermost air it thundered again as the wave gathered slow and black from the drizzling foam as it fell the mouth of the fathomless tunnel below was seen like the pass to the regions of hell the waters roll round it and gather and boom and then all at once disappear in the gloom and now ere the waves had returned from the deep the youth wiped the sweatdrops which hung on his brows and he plungedand the cataracts over him sweep and a shout from his terrified comrades arose and then there succeeded a horrible pausefor the whirlpool had closd its mysterious jaws and stiller it grew on the watery waste in the womb of the ocean it bellowd alone the knights said their aves in terrified haste and crowded each pinnacle jetty and stone the highhearted stripling is whelmd in the tide ah wail him was echoed from every side if the monarch had buried his crown in the pool and said he shall wear it who brings it again i would not have been so insensate a fool as to dive when all hope of returning were vain what heaven conceals in the gulfs of the deep lies buried for ever and there it must sleep full many a burden the whirlpool had borne and spouted it forth on the drizzling surge but nought but a mast that was splinterd and torn or the hull of a vessel was seen to emerge but wider and wider it opens its jaws and louder it gurgles and louder it draws it drizzled it thunderd it hissd and it whirld and it bubbled like water when mingled with flame and columns of foam to the heaven were hurld and flood upon flood from the deep tunnel came and then with a noise like the storm from the north the hellish eruption was vomited forth but ah what is that on the waves foamy brim disgorged with an ocean of wreck and of wood tis the snowwhite arm and the shoulder of him who daringly dived for the glittering meed tis he tis the stripling so hardy and bold who swings in his left hand the goblet of gold he draws a long breath as the breaker he leaves then swims through the water with many a strain while all his companions exultingly heave their voices above the wild din of the main tis he o tis he from the horrible hole the brave one has rescued his body and soul he reachd the tall jetty and kneeling he laid the massy gold goblet in triumph and pride at the foot of the monarch who instantly made a sign to his daughter who stood by his side she filld it with wine and the youth with a spring received it and quaffd it and turnd to the king long life to the monarch how happy are they who breathe and exist in the suns rosy light but he who is doomd in the ocean to stray views nothing around him but horror and night let no one henceforward be tempted like me to pry in the secrets containd in the sea i felt myself seized with the quickness of thought the whirlpool entombd me in body and limb and billow on billow tumultuously brought its cataracts oer me in vain did i swim for like a mere pebble with horrible sound the force of the double stream twisted me roundbut god in his mercy for to him alone in the moment of danger i ever have clung did bear me towards a projection of stone i seized it in transport and round it i hung the goblet lay too on a corally ledge which jutted just over the cataracts edge and then i lookd downward and horribly deep and twinkling sheen in the darkness below and though to the hearing it ever might sleep yet still the eye clouded with terror might know that serpents and creatures that made my blood cool were swimming and splashing about in the pool balld up to a mass in a moment uncoild they rose and again disappeard in the dark and down in the billows which over them boild i saw a behemoth contend with a shark the sounds of their hideous duel awaken the blackbellied whale and the slumbering craken still still did i linger forlorn and oppressd with a feeling of terror that curdled my blood ah think of a human and sensible breast enclosed with the hideous shapes of the flood still still did i linger but far from the reach of those that i knew would await on the beach methought that a serpent towards me did creep and trailing behind him whole fathoms of length he opend his jaws and i droppd from the steep round which i had clung with expiring strength twas well that i did so the stream bore me up and here is thy servant and there is the cup he then was retiring a look from the king detaind him my hero the cup is thine own tis richly thy meed but ill give thee this ring beset with a diamond and chrysolite stone if again thou wilt dive and discover to me whats hid in the deepest abyss of the sea the daughter heard that with compassionate thought quick quick to the feet of the monarch she flew o father desist from this horrible sport he has done what no other would venture to do if the life of a creature thou fain must destroy let a noble take place of this generous boy the monarch has taken the cup in his hand and tumbled it down in the bellowing sea and if thou canst bring it again to the strand the first and the best of my knights thou shalt be if that will not tempt thee this maid thou shalt wed and share as a husband the joys of her bed then the pride of old eirin arose in his look and it flashd from his eyeballs courageously keen one glance on the beautiful vision he took and he saw her change colour and sink on the green by the stool of saint peter the prize ill obtain he shouted and instantly dived in the mainthe waters sunk down and a thundering peal announced that the time of their sojourn was oer each eye is cast downward in terrified zeal as forth from the tunnel the cataracts pour the waters rush up and the waters subside but ah the bold diver remains in the tide king byrge and his brothers dame ingeborg three brave brothers could boast for the crown of sweden their lives they lost the nobles to sweden would fain away dame ingeborg bade them at home to stay dame ingeborg stood at helsingborgs gate dear brothers go not i beg and entreat then with one voice the brothers cried weve long for our realms
