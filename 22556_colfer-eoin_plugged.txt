eoin colfer plugged for ken bruen who made me do it with thanks to declan denny for his invaluable attention to my details chapter the great stephen king once wrote dont sweat the small stuff which i mulled over for long enough to realise that i dont entirely agree with it i get what he means we all have enough major sorrow in our lives without freaking out over the daytoday hangnails and such but sometimes sweating the small stuff helps you make it through the big stuff take me for example i have had enough earthshattering events happen to me beside me and underneath me to have most people dribbling in a psych ward but what i do is try not to think about it let it fester inside thats my philosophy its gotta be healthy right focus on the everyday nonlethal bullshit to take your mind off the landmark psychological blows that are standing in line to grind you down my philosophy has gotten me this far but my soldier sense tells me that things are about to come to a head there isnt much call for deep thinking in my current job in cloisters new jersey we dont do a lot of chatting about philosophical issues or natural phenomena in the casino i tried to talk about national geographic one night and jason gave me a look like i was insulting him so i moved on to a safer subject which of the girls have implants this is one of our regular topics so its familiar territory he calmed down after a couple of swallows from his protein shake me talking about issues scared jase more than a drunk with a pistol jason is the best doorman i have ever worked with a rare combination of big and fast and with a lot more smarts than he lets on sometimes hell forget himself and reference a fellini movie then try to cover his tracks by giving the next guy through the door a hard time guys got secrets we all do he doesnt feel like burdening me and i am absolutely fine with that attitude we both pretend were dumb and we both suspect we arent as dumb as we pretend its exhausting most nights we have time for chitchat out front everythings quiet until ten thirty or so generally just a few smalltime players undertheradar guys the party crowd doesnt show up until the regular bars close the bossman victor who i will describe in detail later because this guy deserves a movie of his own he is such a dick and to talk about him now would ruin the flow anyways vic still wants a couple of bodies out front sometimes it takes two to shut down a fight if there are accusations flying around on the back table it can get pretty heated in there especially with the little guys i blame joe pesci so i generally do the night shift not that theres a day shift per se twice or three times a month i pull doubles i dont really mind how am i going to pass the time at home do pushups and listen to mrs delano bitch tonight i get in at eight on the dot its midweek so im looking forward to a quiet evening chewing power bars with jason and talking surgery just simple distraction which is the closest to happiness im expecting to get in this lifetime jason and i are watching this russian throw around kettlebells on youtube when i get a call from marco on my headset i have to ask the little barman to repeat himself a couple of times before i get the message and hustle back to the casino floor apparently my favourite girl connie leaned in to slide cocktails on to a table and this guy goes and licks her ass moron i mean its on the wall on a brass plaque not asslicking specifically do not touch the hostesses it says universal club rule some of the hostesses will do a little touching in the booth but the customer never gets to touch back when i arrive marco is trying to hold this guy away from connie which is probably more for the guys safety than he realises i once saw connie deck a college footballer with her serving tray guys face was in the metal like a cartoon okay folks i say doing my booming doorman voice lets get this handled professionally this announcement is met with a couple of boos from the regulars who were praying for a little drama i grip marcos head like a basketball and steer him behind the bar then loom over the offender the licker has his hands on his hips like hes peter pan and connies fingers have left red stripes on his cheek why dont we take this into the back room i say giving him five seconds of eye contact before things get out of hand this bitch hit me he says pointing in case theres some doubt about which bitch hes talking about his finger is coated with the remains of a basket of buffalo wings and sauce on fingers is something that has always irritated me more than it reasonably should we got a timeout room just back here i say not looking at the brown gunk under his nails what is wrong with people you eat you keep your mouth closed you wipe your fingers how hard is that why dont we discuss your issues back there connie is quiet trying to hold her anger in chewing on some nicotine gum like its one of the guys balls connie has a temper but she wont slap without good reason shes got two kids in a crèche over on cypress so she needs the paycheque okay dan she says but can we move it along i got people dying to tip me this is an openandshut case the pointer laughs like its funny she should use that terminology i shepherd them into the timeout room which is barely more than a broom closet in fact there are a couple of mops growing like dreadlocked palms out of a cardboard box island in the corner you okay i ask connie glad to see shes not smoking six months and counting she nods sitting on a ratty sofa dude licked my ass licked it you got any wipes daniel i hand her a slim pack you always carry a pack of antiseptic wipes working a bottomrung new jersey casino like slotz theres all sorts of stuff you can catch just hanging around i look away while connie is wiping the barbecue sauce off her behind you cant help noticing cleavage in this place but i figure you can avoid the lower regions i try to keep my eyes above the waist leaves everybody with something so while shes cleaning up i turn to the guy the licker what were you thinking sir theres no touching cant you read the guy is going to rub me the wrong way i can tell just by his hair a red frizz sitting on his head like a nest fell off a roof i saw the plaque daniel he says pointing towards the casino floor this guy is a pointing machine it says do not touch and what did you do you touched no says the guy switching his pointing finger over to me so close i can smell the sauce which is putting me off barbecue for a month at least except ribs i didnt touch you touch with your hands i tasted he stops talking then like i need a second for this brilliant argument to sink in you think i never heard that stupid shit before you seriously think youre the first guy to try that on i think im the first attorney to try it on his face lights up with smugness i hate that look maybe because i get it a lot youre an attorney more pointing im tempted to snap this arseholes finger right off youre goddamn right im an attorney you try anything with me and ill shut this shithole down youll be working for me ill be working for you sir sometimes i repeat stuff people think its because im stupid but really its because i cant believe what im hearing the guy goes for option a what are you a parrot a fucking retarded oirish parrot keerist almighty this is probably the way it goes in the office for this guy he doles out garbage and people take it im guessing hes the boss or close to it only the boss or the mail guy can not give a shit how they look to this extent and get away with it suit and spectacles that could have been stolen from michael caine circa and of course the styrofoam ring of ginger hair no sir im not a parrot i say nice and calm like i learned in doorman school im the head of security and you touched the hostess whatever way you want to dress it up the guy laughs like hes got an audience dressing things up is what i do mister daniel head of security thats my motherfucking business he says motherfucking all wrong like he learned it from the tv it doesnt sound right coming out of his attorneys face its your motherfucking business i say saying the word like it should be said i learned it from a romanian mercenary working for the christian militia in tibnin anghel and his boys would tool past our camp most days in their beatup vw stopping to strike deals for longlife milk or pasta wed traded from the french garçons i liked anghel okay he never shot at me specifically his whole head was a beard and i appreciated the way he said motherfucking only one carton paddy i give you perfect good mozzerfokken hairdryer made it sound real the double z so sometimes if i want to make an impression i say it the romanian way often its enough to confuse a guy put him off his stride but not this guy the ginger monkey is seriously unimpressed by my double z and proceeds to make his second mistake of the evening that i know about he steps up to me cock of the walk like i dont have eight inches and fifty pounds on him what is this parrot shit he says and believe it or believe it not he taps me on the forehead you got a goddamn plate in your head keerist almighty i am surprised by this tap on the head but also happy because the guy has touched me now you shouldnt have touched me sir i say sadly thats assault now i got to defend myself this takes the wind out of his sails being an attorney this jackass knows the letter of the law regarding assault he is aware that now i got the right to put a little hurt on him and claim i felt threatened i practise my threatened face so he can visualise how it will look in court his pointing finger curls up like a dried turd and he takes a couple of steps back now listen you lay one hand on me he cant finish the threat because i got a free shot and he knows it at this point i would dearly love to take that shot and put this attorney out of everyones misery but connies got her kids in the crèche and the last thing she needs is a court appearance hanging over her head plus the courtroom is this guys arena before the judge hes a gladiator i can just see him jumping around like a little ginger monkey pointing like theres no tomorrow and in all honesty my threatened face aint all that hot so i say how much money you got in your wallet the guy tries a little bluster but im giving him an out and he knows it i dont know couple hundred maybe bullshit he doesnt know attorneys and accountants always know generally they stash little wads of notes all over in case they get stuck with a pushy dancer or hooker later in the evening this guy probably knows how much cash his sick momma has rolled into her tooth jar gimme three i say gimme three hundred for the hostess and i wont have to act in selfdefence the attorney physically flinches three hundred for a lick keerist almighty hell go for it i know he will the alternative is explaining to his highroller clients how he got his face rearranged in a dump like slotz where we got mould on the carpet corners and toilets with chains the guy is fumbling with his wallet like the bills are putting up a struggle so i grab it making sure to squash his soft attorneys fingers a little here let me count that sir youre shaking hes not shaking but i want to plant the idea that he should be this is not a tip i picked up in doorman school the army shrink gave me a few conflict tips before my second tour its true i snag the wallet to hurry this whole thing along but i also want to help myself to one of this guys business cards its good to have details about troublesome customers let them know theres no place to hide once i have his card i can find his wife and id like to see him try the taste defence at home his monkey head would be on a plate and no jury would convict i count out six fifties and toss him his wallet okay mister jaryd faber i say consulting the card you are hereby barred from slotz faber mutters something about not giving a shit and i cant really blame him we thank you for your business and urge you to seek counselling for your various issues standard get out and dont come back spiel youre making a big mistake daniel says faber something i hear so often they should carve it on my tombstone i got serious friends in this town we all got serious friends i say and surprise myself by coming up with a mildly witty rejoinder i got an army buddy hasnt smiled since desert storm nobody so much as acknowledges the effort and faber mutters something else possibly a fuck you still a little fire left in this attorney i decide to extinguish it take your ass home i growl before i hit you so hard youll be pressing charges from the afterlife thats not a bad line either but its a little hollywood ive used it a dozen times and its all connie can do not to groan when i trot it out again i crack my knuckles to make my point and faber wisely decides to leave hes a bad loser though and tosses another two hundred at connie from the doorway here he sneers buy yourself a boob job i fake a lunge and the attorney is gone door swinging behind him i feel like hurting this guy i really do but i know from experience that it wont make me feel much better so i swallow the instinct like its a ball of medicine and put on my funeral face for connie you okay connie is on her knees fishing for one of the fifties that has floated under the couch on the breeze of a flapping door screw him dan this is two nights with a sitter i lever the couch with my boot so she can snag the note and avoid all the other crud under there is that al capones missing rubber i say trying for some humour connie sobs maybe its the bad joke more likely its the last straw that this jerk faber probably was so i put my arm around her raising her up connie is the kind of girl a man feels like protecting shes beautiful like she belongs in a fifties movie rita hayworth hair that ripples when she walks like lava flowing down a mountain and wide green eyes that still have some warmth in them in spite of a shitty job and shittier ex come on darlin hes gone for good youll never see him again no one says darlin any more dan only in the movies i squeeze her shoulder im irish darlin were different connie adjusts the polkadot bikini that passes for a uniform in this place yeah good different i hope that creep was bad different what would you call a worm like that in ireland i think about this in ireland he would be referred to as a galloping gobshite or a worm connie smiles a watery smile but at least its something better than the despair in her eyes when i came in here galloping gobshite i like that i gotta visit ireland i say it every year little alfredo would love it and eva too green fields and friendly people not so much of either any more i confide not since the country got moneyed you could bring us dan show us around give us the authentic tour my stomach flips any time connie you know how i feel connie reaches up and tugs at the band of the black watch cap i wear every waking hour so hows it looking baby i am sensitive on this subject generally but connie and me go back nearly two years which is a lifetime in this business we got history as they say one weekend a few months back she got a sitter and we had ourselves a fling it could have gone further but she didnt want a new dad for her kids i just want to feel young for a couple nights dan okay twentyeight and she wants to feel young again every guys dream right couple of nostrings nights with a cocktail hostess i didnt push it now im thinking i should have its looking fine i tell her i got my checkup with zeb tomorrow can i see she asks long nails already peeling off the watch cap my hands jerk up to stop her but i force them back down about time i got an opinion she folds the cap into her long fingers then pushes me back under a recessed spotlight zeb did this yeah he had a few nurses too preparing the follicles students i think this is not a bad job says connie squinting ive seen plenty of hair plugs before but this is good nice spread and no scars what is it rat hair i am genuinely horrified rat christ connie its my own hair transplants from the back theyll fall out in a couple of weeks then the new hair grows in connie shrugs i hear theyre using rat now dog too tough as wire apparently i reclaim the cap spreading it over my crown like a salve no canine or rodent irish human only yeah well it looks okay another session and you wont know the difference i sigh like its cost me a lot of dollars which it has thats the idea i roll the hat back down and take connies elbow steering her back to the floor a formica bar low lighting thats more cheap than fashionable a roulette wheel that bucks with every spin two worn baize card tables and half a dozen slots slotz here she says take fifty you squeezed it out of him i fold the note back into her hand it was a pleasure darlin the day he licks my arse is the day i take fifty connie laughs full and throaty and something stirs in my stomach oh baby the day he licks your arse is the day i buy tickets to witness the consequences shes back on an even keel but its temporary this place really takes it out of decent people a toll on the soul you okay to go back on the floor sure darlin you know victor will dock me for the whole night if i quit now i lean down to whisper in her ear smelling her perfume noticing not for the first time how long her neck is feeling her peppermint breath brushing my cheek remembering between the two of us victor is also a galloping gobshite connie laughs again something i would pay money to hear then she grabs a tray from the bar and shes back on the floor hips swaying like a movie star from back when movie stars had hips worth swaying she throws a couple of tantalising sentences over her shoulder maybe we got another weekend coming up baby maybe a whole week connie darlin i think then raise my gaze stick to the code eyes up eyes up for now but me and connie have unfinished business one more look at the hips my dark side whispers then back to work as is often the case my dark side wins i give myself a moment to get my head back in the game thats the most common rookie mistake in the security business complacency thinking im big and scary and what fool is gonna take a swing at me even to impress his girl the key word in that sentence is fool they come in all shapes and sizes and most of them are juiced coked or both and would take a shot at the devil himself if they thought it would buy them a little respect from their crew or a special treat from a hostess so i shut the drawer on faber and connie and give the crowd a onceover couple of college boys eyeing the hostesses a few divorcees and old jasper biggs playing the big shot tossing in onedollar bills like theyre hundreds no danger signs still i decide to send jason back here to throw around the steroid stare cant hurt sometimes trouble begets trouble unfortunately i am not wrong before the ghost image of connies hips can fade a dozen yeehaws barrel through the double doors one of them either has a very dainty dick or a flick knife in his jeans pocket jason i think these guy should never have made it in the room as bob geldof once sang tonight of all nights theres gonna be a fight unfortunately bobs not wrong either chapter after my first stint with the irish armys peacekeeping corps in the lebanon i was flown home to a zeros welcome and found the green green grass not so lush any more apparently the general public were of the opinion that peacekeepers dont fight wars we just stand between the two armies who are fighting the wars and say stuff like ah lads thats a bit much or show me the passage in your holy book that says minefields are okay sometimes and then the armies say you know what you irish guys have hit the nail on the head no offence christians plus you have such a good record in your own country that we should all be thoroughly ashamed of ourselves for all this border conflict stuff and just accept our differences i decided that the best way to fill the crater that had been blasted in my soul by none of this happening plus all the exploding and stuff that did happen would be to volunteer for a second tour and my application apparently rang a few warning bells because the sergeant major ordered me to sashay on over to dr moriartys office at my convenience minus the words sashay and convenience plus the words hustle and right fucking now retard i know that traditionally i should have been outraged smashed my fist into my palm and blurted this is outrageous sarge or i still got the stuff but honestly the notion of being probed kind of interested me so i showed up prompt at osevenhundred the next morning only to find out that consultant shrinks do not do enlisted hours and spent the next two hours in dr moriartys waiting room reading a magazine that i swear to god was called head cases dr moriarty i know almost a professor hilarious right by the time dr simon moriarty finally showed up i was starting to get to a handle on the psychology of the whole psychiatry thing if bad things happen to you when youre young then youre liable to blame someone for it when you grow up possibly someone with a similar hairstyle to whoever did the bad things in the first place i explained my conclusions to dr moriarty when he finally rolled in looking like the guitarist from bon jovi and smelling like the drummer from the happy mondays not a dickie bow or elbow patch in sight nice theory said moriarty collapsing on to the couch i told marion we shouldnt leave psych mags strewn around the waiting room he lit a thin cigar and blew the smoke in a dense funnel towards the ceiling while i tried to remember if id ever heard the word strewn spoken aloud before the charming colonel brady suggested that i leave womans own out there so we can weed out the gays mans a genius good kisser too i said straightfaced simon moriarty grinned through a mouthful of smoke there might be some hope for you soldier i thought it best to burst that bubble i want to volunteer for a second tour in the lebanon moriarty expertly flicked his cigar through a halfopen window then again maybe not so we talked for an hour a bit like your normal pub chat when youve been out for a few days with your best mate and your eyeballs are filmed with vodka i sat behind the desk while moriarty lay on the couch and frisbeed questions at me eventually he came around to whyd you join the army daniel i remembered something from the magazine why do you think i joined the army moriarty did the kind of long hard fake laugh that would make a bond villain proud wow that is hilarious he said with a confidence that made me feel id been saying hilarious wrong all these years i feel quite the fool now wasting all that time in university when all i had to do was read a magazine have a nice time in the lebanon i sighed okay doc i joined up because moriarty actually sat up because because the uniforms set off my eyes come on doc work for the money simon moriarty blinked away the previous nights party they flew you home early mcevoy remind me why they did that i shrugged i called in some gunship fire on my own position the shrug was to make this seem like no big deal but it was a big deal and my legs were shaking as i said it and my mind flicked back to the tracers crisscrossing the night sky like something out of blade runner or maybe star wars whichever one was in space that does sound like the action of a moron he was baiting me but that was okay because we were both smiling a little now what was left of amal decided to overrun the entire compound i explained oldschool style an honesttogod battle couple of them had swords everybody made it into the bunker except the watch i had a radio so i called in a gunship was that a good decision not according to the manual lots of property damage but not as much as there might have been plus a general got to live so they shipped you out cos i was shellshocked and were you absolutely no bowel movements for three days moriarty hit me again so why did you join the army daniel he was good i wasnt expecting the change of tack i mean that gunship thing is an interesting story because i reckoned dying overseas was better than living at home moriarty punched the air one nil he crowed most nights after work at the casino i take a couple of triazolam to nod myself off i go for as long as i can trying to tune out mrs delano in the apartment above but she grinds me down with her ranting so i pop the pills just to shut her out for a few hours usually we have a little exchange through a hole around the ceiling light fitting ill lead off with something like for christs sake shut up to which mrs delano will reply for christs sake shut up i could follow this with for one night could we have a little bloody peace for one night which she might cleverly twist to one night ill give you a little bloody piece you get the idea tonight im thinking about connie so i add the triazolam to a shot of jameson and manage to grab a few hours of sweet dreams but by eight my crazy neighbours piercing tones have ruptured my rest and i lie in bed listening as delano lets fly with a few nuggets that wouldnt sound out of place in the exorcist if i ever find you baby i will poison your coffee that gets me out of bed sharpish ive lived in this building for five years and for the first couple mrs delano seemed like a normal nonhomicidal human then in year three she starts in with the poisoning coffee spiel im starting to believe that nobody really knows anyone im pretty sure no one knows me a hairobsessed exarmy doorman what are the odds of those venn diagram bubbles intersecting venn diagrams i know another nugget from simon moriarty i jump in the shower thinking about connie so the shower is the right place to be everything about her stays with me all the usual suspects the way she walks like theres a pendulum inside her how her brooklyn accent gets a little stronger when shes pissed the sharp strokes of her nose and chin wide smile like a slice of heaven oh baby shed said oh baby inside a cloud of steam my imagination adds levels a husky catch at the end of the phrase oh baaby how could i not have noticed this at the time connie was sending me a message i turn the shower knob way over in the blue sunshine is slanting through my bathroom window warming the chequered vinyl shower curtain its going to be hot today too hot for a woollen hat thats okay i got lighter hats i quite like this time of year in new jersey the air on my skin feels like home the old sod the emerald isle ireland sometimes on a clear day the sky has the same electricblue tinge just go home then and stop bitching im even beginning to irritate my own subconscious is there anything more pathetic than a mick on foreign soil wailing danny boy especially one who never liked the country when he was there it wasnt the country i remind myself it was the people in the country and the things that happened there my apartment is two floors up three blocks north of main street and ten blocks south of the line of buildings with mildly risqué fronts that pass for a strip in this town i stroll down the cracked concrete trying to rein in the menace i dated a gypsy once who told me i had an aura that looked like sharkinfested water sometimes i piss people off just by walking by so i hunch a little and keep my eyes on the ground trying to radiate friendliness think hippies think hippies dr kronskis surgery is in a part of town where there arent any trees set into the sidewalk the trashcans are generally teeming with beer bottles and if you stand in one place long enough someones going to offer you whatever you need all of which would suggest that zeb kronski isnt much of a surgeon which would be totally not true zeb kronski is a hell of a surgeon he just doesnt have a licence to practise in the united states and he cant apply because he had a boob job die on the table in tel aviv not his fault he assures me implantrelated death the building is maybe twenty years old but looks five times that part of a mini strip mall mostly glass and partition walls in winter accountants and dental nurses freeze to death in these boxes zebs is wedged between snow whites drycleaners and a britesmile chemical sandwich no wonder my doctor friend has his off days with fumes like that eating his brain i make sure my appointments are in the mornings before depression takes hold the sign is flipped to closed when i arrive surprising usually kronskis homeopathic centre is doing a brisk business in powdered crocodile penis capsules by this time zeb tells me that the homeopathic bit started out as a front but now hes having to file returns people are fucked up dan he confided one night at slotz down to a film of whiskey in the bottom of his glass everyones looking for the magic pill and they dont give a shit whose horn gets ground to make it wooden blinds stretch across the shop front reminds me of a schooner deck i worked on in cobh harbour kronskis kures reads the decal this mall is big on misspellings two doors down is close cutz and around the back theres a roomful of krazy kidz slugging down ritalin i feel a little irritated zeb better not be face down in an empty jacuzzi sleeping off a bender again last time it cost me two hundred bucks to pay off the madam ive been working up to this session mentally running through the scenarios playing devils advocate with myself what if the follicles didnt take what if i end up scarred what if im a vain asshole wholl still be ugly after the next operation and now that i have myself totally psyched as my adopted countrymen would say zeb kronski is running late and when zeb is running late he is generally running tanked i thumb the flap in my wallet for the spare key at least i can get the percolator bubbling while im waiting then i notice the door is open a crack a little odd but no more than a little zeb doesnt remember to zip his own fly when hes drinking one time in a bar honest to christ this happened one time zeb was five steps out of the john before he remembered to tuck his dick away i nudge the door open with my toe and duck inside the light is sepia and heavy with swirling dust spores something has been moving in here little moments like this i cant helping thinking of patrols in tibnin i try to avoid the whole flashback thing when ive got stuff to do but some moments are more evocative than others some moments are fat with menace for some reason this is one of those moments suddenly corporal tommy fletcher is in my head for the second time in so many days huge kerry bastard arms like popeye always complaining even on an earlybird mine sweep fletcher was mouthing off this weather is murder on my complexion sarge he was saying my freckles are fucking multiplying then a katyusha rocket took out the us m truck behind us and flipped it on to fletchers leg severing it at the knee i walked away lugging tommy on my shoulder with a coating of b and a case of tinnitus and were back in the present i try not to get bogged down in those days but when the memories hit me its like being there except you know whats coming next you surface in the present and for a moment you are that scared boy again once i wet my pants i wouldnt mind but i held it in during the real incident i love watching the tv flashback guys tom magnum mitch buchannon sonny crockett all the greats they have a tensecond jitter scene about nam then wake up barechested with a pained frown and maybe a light sweat on their smooth foreheads fletcher i think jesus christ inside zebs unit the dust is settling this place is a real dump pills heaped in untidy pyramids on the shelves a filing cabinet its drawer hanging open like a drunks mouth papers everywhere a few sheets still fluttering to earth theres somebody here i realise and miss a step catching my toe on the carpet you okay there bud says a voice there are crossed legs and loafers sticking out of the shadows in the waiting area penny loafers with actual pennies who is this guy one of the brat pack but the pennies strike a chord with me i half remember something i cough to give myself a second then answer fine goddamn rug doctor is trying to kill me a low growling laugh followed by a statement i get a lot you talk weird i get that a lot i say what is it dublin thats pretty good most people get irish but never dublin im impressed you got relations the legs uncross and stretch nah i work with a guy he watches this irish tv show on the net the pennies drop i know who this is and all it takes is a flick of the light switch to confirm it macey barrett one of michael maddens soldiers okay this could be trouble we dont really have much organised crime in cloisters too small but theres one guy trying to upgrade from hood to boss he spent a summer with his cousin in the bronx and picked up some ideas on how to run an organisation irish mike madden prostitution protection and a burgeoning crystal meth business to pull in the weekend tweakers and here sitting in my friend zebs waiting room is one of maddens boys in the dark what the hell is going on i tell myself to be calm after all hoodlums get bloated stomachs too maybe this guys here for some aloe barrett looks like an accountant expensive haircut expensive smile nice golden tan but he isnt an accountant jason pointed him out to me one night in the club you see this guy with the permatan and the penny loafers macey barrett irish mike brought him back from new york they call this guy the crab on account of this little sideways shuffle he does before he sticks you sticking people is apparently barretts favourite pastime i knew guys like that in the army they liked to get their hands red liked the feel of the blade sliding in you waiting on the doc barrett asks me like hes just passing time i help myself to a cone of water from the cooler yeah sure i have an appointment you dont say youre not in the book hes reading the book now doesnt even bother hiding the fact im not an inthebook sort of a guy barrett rolls himself out of the chair coming to his feet casually so you and the doc pretty tight talks to you and shit confides in you i shrug conveying you know whatever its not much of an answer and barrett is not happy with it im just saying you dont have an appointment and you got a key in your hand you give a key to someone hes your friend you meet for a beer after work shoot the breeze talk about whos getting what done in the back room zeb doesnt talk about patients hes like a confessor with that stuff barrett doesnt listen past the first word zeb zeb you say shit you two are tight then he changes tack altogether goes all buddybuddy so pal how do i know you i know you from somewhere right small town barrett laughs like this is some kind of joke yeah sure small town nail on the head buddy but i know you come on man dont tell me you dont know me barrett makes knowing him sound like a wonderful gift screw it yeah macey i know you i see you on the strip maddens boy and the friendliness shoots up a notch thats right i work for mike its that shithole club isnt it slotz right daniel mcevoy thats you tell me im wrong i seen you work but never heard you talk and he does a little sideways shuffle dropping his right hand low this is not a great development the sideways shuffle youre a big guy mcevoy says barrett shaking something down his sleeve david copperfield he aint i bet you knock shitkickers around pretty good im having a hard time believing this is actually happening barrett is really going to make a move on me just for being here wrong place wrong time for one of us his hand comes up quick and in his fist there is what looks like a shaft of light it looks like a shaft of light but unless hes gandalf it probably isnt good point and its more than enough for my fighters instinct to stand up and dance a jig i step to one side dig my heel into the carpet for stability adrenalin shoots through my system like nitrous oxide slowing the whole thing down the shaft of light flashes past my eye and i put the key through the side of barretts neck watch him bleed out then sit down and think about what ive done chapter when i finally parted ways with the army after my second tour i quickly realised that there was nothing for me in dublin every minute i spent in the dirty old town sent me further into the whirlwind of my own mind i couldnt find a good memory in there that didnt end in tragedy and i have a tendency to live in my head shit happens right so deal with it i did took advantage of being born in new york city and boarded a transatlantic jet to jfk wore the uniform that wasnt mine any more to check in and even got myself an upgrade oldest trick in the manual after loading a shotgun with tea bags to scare the crap out of looters dumped the beret and jacket in the lounge bathroom walked out a civilian with a firstclass ticket my mother may have been from america but with her family apartment way up high and hanging over central park she wasnt what you might call a typical new yorker and after touchdown it took me a while to credit the local accent one day its bejaysus and begorrah and the next its fugeddabout it theyre putting this on i thought yadda yadda yadda badda bing bullshit no one talks like this but they did and worse i took a couple of beatings in the early days just because i didnt understand what the hell people were saying to me wadda fucku starin at you fuckin retahded lookit dis fuckin guy it got so that i didnt wait around for the chitchat some guy started strutting my way along a bar and i let him have it with whatever i could reach an ashtray barstool whatever preempting fights comes naturally to me i always know which guys are gonna go off something simon moriarty taught me once we got to know each other a little seeing as youre determined to go back dan i may as well pass on a few useful nuggets such as such as when its time to stop peacekeeping and start shooting its in the eyes and the shoulders simon had explained they get to a point and then think screw it at that moment consequences mean nothing so you need to take your hands out of your pockets and start swinging i swing good too twelve years in the army taught me that much at least but i still get pains in my back whenever i take a swing especially in deep dark winter even though the doctors swore they got every sliver of hezbollah mortar shrapnel phantom pains they said doesnt seem phantom when the frost is creeping up my window like a silver cobweb and my lower back feels like some demented leprechaun is driving rivets into it i stuck new york for four full years working meatpacking during the day and clubs at night but my fresh start was starting to seem like a dead end love never walked around the corner plus my hair was falling out a decade in the grave and still my father was sending gifts my way four years of new york living and i was up to here with wiseguys and weisenheimers my knuckles were like acorns from punching people thats right people the women and children are dangerous in the big apple i see a needle coming at me and i dont care if the person holding it has got braids and milk teeth one humid autumn evening i gazed down on the babyfaced asian hooker i had just decked and decided to get out of the city i took her knife though nice butterfly with something chinese on the handle ive had it ever since so i packed my army duffel and took a train to the satellite town of cloisters essex county only reason i got off there was because of a billboard they had in the station cloisters for people who are tired of the city i sure did like the sound of that it turns out that here isnt much better than there was for a start cloisters has gambling only a bus ride across the hudson which means on the weekends all the city arseholes come to throw away their hardearned watch one hundred per cent nude ladies and crash in hotels that are a lot cheaper than atlantic city plus weve got our indigenous arseholes too six years have gone by and sometimes i think i should have stayed in new york more than sometimes im moving on as soon as the hair grows in once i have hair ill be happy thats what i tell myself i may have left it too late i make myself watch macey barrett die because that way it means something i dont want to kill a man then shut my eyes while he dies you make these things hard or else they get easy ive killed men before but only three and never like this never so close that i can see eyelashes flickering or hear the rattle in their chest like theres a handful of beads in there in the army you could always tell yourself this is war you get a pass for war but here and now in a pill shop in jersey it feels like this sort of thing shouldnt be happening violent death is supposed to be consigned to my past dr moriarty would call it an anachronism barrett goes slow jerking like theres a current passing through him blood everywhere what do you expect you put a spike in his jugular for some reason my subconscious sounds like zeb in the final spasm barrett loses his grip on the stiletto in his fist it twirls straight up like a cheerleaders baton burying itself in a suspendedceiling tile i relax a little thats justifiable homicide in my book but perhaps not in every book michael madden for example his book might read a little different irish mike will cut me down for killing his man simple as that i need to confuse this issue as much as possible first step lock the goddamn door stupid the key is still where i put it im not a squeamish individual but pulling that key out makes me cringe a lot more than sticking it in did it comes loose with a familiar sucking noise as though its found a nice warm home and doesnt want to leave familiar sucking noise no one should be familiar with that particular sound but i am it reminds me of the time i decided to have a go at pulling a triangle of shrapnel out of my own side it was just before i passed out i fumble the key into the lock and twist it about fifteen seconds before one of zebs customers tries the handle kronski you asshole she calls out in a voice ravaged by thousands of cigarettes your tablets gave me the shits twentysix fifty for the shits open the door dammit i can see you moving the womans silhouette trembles with fury or possibly flatulence and im starting to wonder if maybe i shouldnt be letting zeb poke holes in my scalp when he cant even hand out the right tablets i play statues until the lady moves on looking for a bathroom maybe then turn my attention to macey barrett lying blue faced and weirdly crosseyed on the carpet looks like a vampire bit him poor bastard no not poor bastard murdering bastard just like me no selfdefence even god is okay with that definitely zebs voice my subconscious has figured out something that i dont want to face i have plenty of training in the art of killing but zero in the art of cleanup and any jackass with a tv remote knows how important it is to get rid of trace evidence this is a problem there are litres of blood soaking into the carpet not to mention a twohundredpound family man lying deceased on the bloodstained carpet move the evidence all of it no body no crime its a big ask but once i get my head around the job its calming to have something to do army mentality idle hands are the devils tools busy hands too in this case zeb has a tiny supply closet in the rear i liberate some scrubs gloves and a mask theres a power bonesaw but im not ready to face that yet a key in the neck is one thing dismemberment is another i pat barrett down for his keys phone watch and wallet all the things a thief would lift the search is rewarded with topdollar goods lexus keys prada phone omega watch and a stack of fifties thicker than a quarterpounder the carpet comes away easily just a few glue strings to stretch and ping typical zeb cheap everything i yank up the entire waiting room section rolling barrett in three layers tape around the carpet trash bags over the tape more tape no blood on the tiles underneath that i can see but i give them a swab of bleach just in case they got all sorts of uv lights now even the criminals have them there isnt much you cant purchase on ebay now i have myself a cleopatra carpet package that needs moving its heavy but ive humped a couple of bodies in my day just not directly after killing them i sling the burden over one shoulder then take three quick steps out the back door to a white lexus suv this years model blackedout windows door even opens itself talk about convenient the enclosed car park seems deserted but even if a curtaintwitcher spies me all anyone can ever testify to is that a masked man rolled a rug into a car of course michael madden wont care about due process or reasonable doubt im adjusting the drivers seat for my legs when a text buzzes through on barretts cell ill check that shall i i say to the corpse in the back he doesnt object so i open the text its from mike madden irish m reads the caller id barrett has his phone set to display a photo of his boss this massive guy at an irish wedding looks like stripped to the waist two of his boys in sweaty headlocks mad eyes flat tweed cap with a shamrock pin on the peak i shudder this person is bad news i know the type irish borderline alcoholic death before disrespect i would be better off swinging by his house and putting an end to this right now but i wont because this is not a war zone there might be another way and maybe zeb is still alive i read the message did you get it i sigh and pocket the phone did you get it shit zeb is most likely dead so who is this zebulon kronski guy and how did i bump into him thats nearly better than the gunship story surprise surprise the answer to those questions lies back in the lebanon so ill keep it brief because this story is about now rather than then although then seems to be pretty much a part of now most of the time someday ill tell the full then story when i can even think of a russian bear without throwing up in a nutshell the un peacekeepers patrolled the border between israel and the lebanon trying to keep the israeli troops and the shia hezbollah and amal from blowing themselves each other and us to kingdom come those groups had been fighting for so long that they couldnt even agree which kingdom they would get blown to our main objective was to keep civilians safe but our main function seemed to be as human shields for the shia to hide behind while they fired rockets up at israeli encampments most of the time we wore camouflage went on patrol and were baked by the sun until our skin cracked but sometimes things got a little primal which tends to happen when bunches of hot grumpy men have loaded weapons and different ideas about god one weekend im on a supply run in un headquarters with tommy fletcher and he insists on a little detour to mingi street an organic souk that grows like a reef around hq and where anything is available for the right price at this point in our military careers i am the corporal and he is the sergeant so i have no choice but to follow his unexplained lead tommy is being a little mysterious about what hes looking for so i am less reluctant to tag along than i pretend curiosity has always been the cat that skinned me whenever i ask what were after he just taps his nose and says thats actually funnier than youd think so we wade our way through the kids nipping at us like cleaner fish we ignore the electronics merchants the tshirt vendors the gold guys and hashish boys i keep my finger on the trigger of my steyer and thumb on the safety its not that i didnt like the concentrated life of these ovenlike alleys but just because you like a place doesnt mean its gonna like you tommy walks ahead of me the thousand resentful stares bouncing off him like pebbles off a rhinos back with long strides he negotiates the souk brushing through the hanging sheets of fine silks and elbowing past forests of rolled rugs about ten minutes after i have totally lost any sense of place he pounds his fist on a poster of michael jackson which apparently has a door behind it michaels eyes slide back to reveal another set behind and i cannot resist saying oh for gods sake sarge youre going to buy something from these people but fletcher is undeterred and passed a few dollars through the slot which is enough to get us inside the poster goes up like a roller blind and theres a steel door behind which is hilarious because the wall is made of plasterboard im laughing openly now you know what tommy we should beat it yeah this is bad you know it i draw the line at shamon too obvious i follow tommy into the lowceilinged corridor and continue walking forwards even when i see what looks like a waiting room full of locals reading us weekly and cosmopolitan a large no smoking sign dominates the wall and amazingly for the middle east no one is ignoring it a pretty nurse talks rapidly on the phone as we enter and ignores us until tommy taps on her desk with the barrel of his weapon i need to see the doc he says pleasantly the nurse looks american with all the benefits big julia roberts teeth and boobs that could have some lucky guys eye out does sir have an appointment she says and i would guess california by the way she wobbles her head on appointment tommy nods equably yep sir does fully loaded with another few clips in his bag the nurse waves a pink nail towards the waiting room were all armed here sir i got a colt pointed at your privates right now so take a seat cos if this thing goes off even the doc cant do much about it its strange all this melodrama in one afternoon but it doesnt seem real or wrong in the heat my brain sizzles inside the gourd of its skull and the walls sizzle and crack bloody flies are huge two women in floral head wraps argue over a madonna article sorry miss says tommy were on a schedule things happen quickly then and when i try to piece it together images jump and flicker like an old vhs thats been taped over one too many times the nurse comes out of her seat and she does indeed have a large handgun in her tiny fingers suddenly the gun is in my hands i must have twisted it away from her dont recall really training took over tommys gone down the corridor and i remember thinking okay enough is enough i dont know what this is but i need to extricate myself hell i could bash my way out into the street through one of these walls but i dont go anywhere except after my sergeant the corridor is lined with posters faded in the sun i remember seeing et and one of the connery bonds then were at a door someone has written doctor in thick marker oh jaysus says tommy isnt that handy now and in he goes with me at his elbow and the nurse close behind cursing us both for sons of bitches inside the door we see a rudimentary surgery with plastic on the floor and a man in a white coat sticking a large needle of reddish gunk into another mans dick im suddenly no longer curious and tommy throws up on the covered floor sending rivulets running along the polythene bloody bastards says the doctor guy this is a sterile environment and that was how i met zebulon kronski more later once upon a time i could have driven the lexus to newark airport and abandoned it in the longterm now with homeland security theyd be shoving mirrors under it in a new york minute so i pick the local bus station instead and park the suv by the dumpsters i should get ten days grace before the blues are called with any luck some kid will jack the vehicle dump the body and screw up the chain of events for anyone trying to follow it i walk half a dozen blocks from the station then pay for a cab with one of barretts fifties guilt free screw him he tried to stick me i cant say this aloud even mutter it because i have never killed anyone outside a combat zone and i am shaken to my core you dont think that was a combat zone what would you call it then in the taxi i give myself brain ache trying to wrap my head around the mornings events zeb has a good phrase for this kind of situation a poor hand of poker or bad luck with a woman could set him off a total donkeys cock this is dan donkeys fucking cock i dont know what that phrase means exactly but somehow it catches the mood my friend has something that irish mike madden wants something so important that macey barrett was cleared to stick any witnesses without even calling it in if zeb were alive thered be no need to toss his place hed give the something up no doubt about it zero pain tolerance i once took him to emergency for a heart attack that turned out to be a trapped nerve a trapped bloody nerve shit i got a dozen of those a week in the army so this means that zeb is probably gone and if hes not what am i supposed to do about it nothing head down and pray the storm passes over grieve quietly and wish it away all that movie soldier crap about never leaving a man behind is just that movie soldier crap a man goes down behind enemy lines and hes gone first rule of combat chapter i spend an hour and a half over a tenminute lunch in chequers diner by the park i expect the turkey club to taste like ash but it doesnt sweetest sandwich ive ever had in this place and ive had plenty im alive i realise and food tastes good i remember now you make it home from reconnaissance and gritty water from the neck of an oil can tastes like nectar this trauma is bringing the memories back im starting to think like a soldier again maybe thats no bad thing once i get over the magical goodness of food i start brooding on zeb hes a friend i suppose the only one i have a man passes forty and hes supposed to have a handful of guys in his inner circle maybe in ireland theres a couple of army buddies who would step up for me but here no one even zeb wouldnt have tolerated any actual discomfort on my behalf one night i made him get out of bed to pick me up and i had to listen to it for a month probably dead more than likely no sense hoping the park is still green thats unusual for this time of year even the leaves are hanging in there through the railing i see a dad and his boy tossing a baseball like something from a happyfamily tv show its too late now for me no baseballtossing or kids with my eyes all i have to look forward to is staying alive until tonight so i can listen to my crazy neighbour mouthing off upstairs its true what they say about irish people we have a great love for the maudlin for every silver lining theres a cloud maybe thats why i get on with zeb so well it has to be said that the two of us love a good moan though zebulons beyond moaning now dont count on it you mick asshole except in my head apparently i spend the afternoon watching my own apartment from across the street there are three delis and an italian restaurant within ten yards of my front door so i load up on comfort carbs and coffee with that concoction inside me my brain is telling me to get up and go while my stomach is begging for a nap i am knocking back my fourth espresso when a couple of suits mount the steps to my building but theyre peddling the afterlife rather than an end to this one definitely not pros of any sort they walk up side by side and dont even check the door before knocking anyone so inclined could shoot both these guys through the mail slot i keep up my vigil for a couple more hours but nobody suspicious or even suspiciously ordinary shows up but that doesnt mean im clear macey barrett wont even be stiff in his rug yet eventually the caffeine in my bloodstream beats down the dough balls in my gut so i make the short walk to the club and arrive at eight mildly surprised to find myself alive and unmolested not so much as a crooked look from a passerby well no more than the usual because of the way i look people project stuff on to me as i walk past all of a sudden im their mean old daddy or their arsehole boyfriend or their handsy boss maybe if you smiled once in a while simon moriarty had suggested during one of our sessions so i tried that until my fixed grin reminded a new girl at the club of some serial killer on the fbis mostwanted list and she phoned it in that was an interesting afternoon in the tombs especially with me being handy with a knife and all luckily for me the actual killer was caught the same day when he passed out under a park bench having hit a vein trying to tattoo a psalm on to his dick it pains me mightily to say it but the guy did look a little like me the upshot of all this is that i dont smile now unless someone i like says something to me that they think is funny one of the people i like is too young to get my humour and the other is missing presumed dead it doesnt really surprise me that no one is on my tail still too early i tell myself macey barrett hasnt been gone more than half a day which hasnt stopped irish mike sending a dozen texts wondering where his employee has gotten to they start civil enough hey m whats the story deteriorate a little m you trying to be funny m and by the end are openly hostile you report in barrett or ill cut your forking head off forking predictive text i dont read any more after that i get to the club early but hang back for almost an hour see if anyone is making enquiries nothing suspicious the only dangerouslooking irish guy around here is me so i push through the black leather doors jason is at the coat check shooting the breeze with brandi one of the older hostesses i say older but brandi is barely thirty which is just out of her teens as far as im concerned brandi has been angry at the world for about a year since she had to hang up her strippers gstring and downgrade to a hostess job at slotz forced retirement at thirty jason is leaning on the counter with that fond faraway look in his eyes that tells me tonights subject is childhood memories i remember getting pissed on by my old man he says dreamily brandi shoots me a look like maybe she should hide in the coats yeah jason she says rolling her eyes at me that sounds swell jason catches the tone hes big but not stupid no nothing like that it was a game we had you know two of us at the bowl pissing as hard as we could a race dad always let me win even if he was blue in the face holding on sometimes thered be spray you know those were the days i say sincerely passing my coat to brandi any good memory is a valid good memory jason tears the foil from a protein bar bicep bulging in his sleeve you got anything dan any good memories of your pappy back home in ireland yeah there was this one day when he beat me with his hand because he couldnt find the shovel ill never forget it still brings a lump to my throat i try not to be bitter but its hard people are usually embarrassed when i start in on my father but brandi has heard a million sob stories in her years on the podium jesus dan lighten the hell up this place is gloomy enough with connie scaring away all the big tippers some of the girls are not opposed to getting frisky in a booth if it means an extra few bucks most of the guys too come on brandi guy licked her arse you can say ass dan youre in america now i sigh arse is the last piece of irish i have i decide then and there to give half of macey barretts wad to connie her kids could probably do with a weekend away maybe theyd take me along we could toss a baseball im clutching at straws now never look out the window in a diner where is connie she in yet im already seeing myself making the gesture no sign says jason checking his teeth in a tiny mirror on the back of his phone she better get here soon victors due vics favourite pastime is docking the staff any excuse he can find a while back he put a timer on the staff washroom which lasted about ten minutes before someone set fire to it and took out half the rear wall still gives you an idea of the kind of person he is yeah that vic what a prince says brandi with a sneer everybodys on the same page on the victor subject then the man himself stumbles in victor jones the worlds oldest white rapper fiftyfive resplendent in a bulls sweatsuit and cap wraparound shades and gold ropes up to his chin more than a stereotype a cartoon stereotype simon moriarty could spend the rest of his life analysing this guy im surprised victor doesnt get beaten up on a daily basis matter of fact he looks like he got beaten up tonight theres a drool pendulum swinging from his chin and what looks like puke in little triangular pools between the laces of one ruby sneaker ruby sneakers i mean come on man youre midfifties from hunterdon country have some self respect brandi is all over the boss plumping his shoulder with a boob hey vic honey whats up what happened to your shoe hypocrisy is a survival skill in slotz five minutes ago she was spitting on vics name victor bends over wipes his chin in the fucking out in the i dont fucking believe this he pukes on the other sneaker hurghhh fuck it fuck i am not too upset to be honest seeing victor doubled over is kind of amusing takes my mind off my own gangster trouble get it out mister jones i say winking at jason youll feel better and then i add bejaysus to let victor know im being irish and charming yeah get it out boss adds jason smiling so wide i can see the little diamond in his fang musta been one of those kebabs he shoots a few seconds of video with his phone shut the hell up the both of you gasps victor spitting into the puddle between his feet we got work to do hes up straight now wiping the tears from his scheming eyes okay mcevoy make sure theres nothing subv going on in the club i mean nothing you find someone holding toss em any of the girls doing side business tell em to zip it up jason i want you to make absolutely sure theres no disk in the security cameras recorder if there is wipe it wipe them all i want us squeaky clean before the cops get here brandi is snuggling his elbow again what can i do baby vic shrugs her off like a wet jacket you baby you can clean up the puke kissing arse doesnt get you anywhere with this boss then i register what victor said before the cops get here why would the cops be coming here connie generally parks her old saturn out back and slips in through the delivery entrance shes not ashamed of herself just her job and she doesnt want any of the clingons to doorstop her at the front sidewalk the police eventually cordoned off a tenmetre square around the saturn with yellow crimescene tape but not before i ignored victors instructions and rushed outside connie lay dead beside her car one shot through the head it looked like between her arched eyebrows shed struggled some her blouse was ripped and her right shoe lay apart from the body i felt numb it was too much sensory overload my brain steamed as though it was packed in ice ill feel this later i thought i was right generally im not much for scenery i dont slow down to gaze at the stars never rise early to watch the sun pulse over the skyline but sometimes a picture gets etched on to your brain and you know its there for good always the violence shit and misery i barely remember my own baby brothers face but every night dear old dad haunts my dreams threequarter profile hooded eyes tacks of grey stubble and me falling away from his fist left eye filling up with blood i will remember this night too connie lying beside the saturn slightly on her side as though turning in her sleep one cheek scuffed like a boys shoe limbs brown elbows sharply pointed car door open cab light casting a yellow glow on her face cracked and buckled asphalt with cigarette butts in the grooves blue shift dress with some kind of sparkly material sequins or metallic thread i dont know hip curved hair frizzed on the wet road and a hole in the head i stumbled back inside gasping for air did i have something to do with this is it connected the cops assemble us in the bar and announce that we are shut down for the foreseeable vic goes ape what the hell he rants going nose to nose with a detective whos got that look in her eyes that should tell vic that theres a shitlimit and hes fast approaching it shooting didnt even happen on the premises this is victimisation fucking police brutality something vic never could see the line between saving face and talking stupid theres a bakery on the other side of the lot you pricks better shut that place down too or im suing somebody im a cop sir says the detective black thirties strong features like youd get on a wood carving we dont shut down bakeries vic almost has an aneurysm fucking funny lady if i wanted to take shit from a bitch i coulda stayed at home the cop has a comeback for that too yeah well maybe if you click the heels of those ruby slippers together you could do us all a favour and magic yourself off to whatever dream world manufactures cultureraping assholes like yourself sir these are strong words but vic started in with the b word so the cop is probably on safe ground complaints wise i decide not to get on her bad side the blue puts up with five more minutes of vics obstruction then gets tired of making the effort and sends him up to the plaza for a night in the cells brandi objects loudly until the door closes behind her boss then she sparks a cigarette and says thank heaven that boy was about to feel the sting of my boot on his behind i am surprised behind is a delicate word to be coming out of brandis mouth so for two hours we sit around in the bar waiting for a crime lab crew that has to come all the way from hamilton in their paper suits then another ninety minutes while they scrutinise the area for trace good luck to them that back lot has seen more pot deals and blow jobs than the amsterdam redlight district i bet they get semen samples going back to the nineteen fifties i keep an eye on the scene through the high window all i can see of connie is her foot but its enough to make me want to cry for every sadness ive ever known i dont break down though tears from a big man are as good as an admission of guilt to a zealous cop a couple of the csis are not as processional as they might be pulling down their masks to smoke cigarettes and bobbing along to whatevers on their headphones maybe thats how they deal or maybe they genuinely do not give shit one and all the time while the trail is growing cold the staff is sitting jittery around the casinos poker table that is until brandi hits upon the notion of getting hammered on the bosss dime victors locked up connies shot dead so screw it we all need a drink after a while the only ones sober are me and jason and hes been chewing steroids like theyre juicy fruit this is fucked up man he says for the hundredth time some of the hostesses echo the sentiment back to him but the number dwindles each time he says it i know how jason feels there are no words for this kind of situation nothing covers it the numbness is leaving me now and i miss it in its place theres a ball of nausea in my gut have they told little alfredo and eva whos going to take them in i feel myself getting irish maudlin again asking the big questions where has my life gone what have i got i remember my brother conor and the look he always had on his face the look you see on dogs in the pound the ones they find in burlap with chains coiled at the bottom fresh wounds are like doors into the past who said that hope to christ it wasnt zeb i dont want to be therapising myself with any of his skewed wisdom thanks a bunch i said plenty of wise shit who told you not to fuck with the jews who told you that by the time we run out of silver tequila the cops are ready for interviews they set up in vics office and summon us one by one i go second after brandi who comes out snapping her fingers like shes won some kind of victory there are two local detectives in the room both africanamerican females which is not as much of a long shot as it used to be theyve squeezed themselves behind vics desk and swept some of his porn memorabilia into a drawer the junior detective is the lady who gave vic grief over his trainers i want to take a liking to this girl but shes got her arms folded across her chest and is wearing a pretty clear i dont make friends face i duck from habit under the steel construction beam that spans the ceiling even though its a couple of inches above head height and sit opposite the detectives i point at a pirelli calendar on the wall you might want to take that down too i am not being a smartarse here it is important to me that this investigation goes well the first fortyeight hours as they say the younger detective rips the calendar out of the wall taking a chunk of sheetrock with it satisfied mister mcevoy she asks giving me the badcop eyeball we are off on the wrong foot she has me down as noncooperative that was a genuine suggestion i protest calmly and sincerely connie was my friend and i want her killer caught the cops are not won over by my irish brogue if anything a foreigner seems to make them more suspicious they sit up shuffle papers and stuff bump shoulders in the tight space they were going for authoritative lining up behind the desk like that but they look like two school kids squeezed behind a bench cornelia delyne was your friend mister mcevoy says the older of the two cornelia i dont know why connies full name surprises me but it does mister mcevoy i focus on the lead detective she is maybe forty striking a slash of rouge on both cheeks strands of silver in her cropped hair she wears a grey suit and a colourful jamaican parrot shirt that kind of jumps out at you yes detective im detective goran this is detective deacon deacon the smart mouth is early thirties severe grey suit wearing anger on her face like latex i know the type very serious about her work well detective goran connie and i were good friends more than that briefly i figure brandi has already told her so she broke up with you and you were pissed off i dont sigh dramatically i was expecting this we never broke up as such we had a weekend together and i think there was another one coming up if you want to talk pissed off we had quite a ruckus in here last night bunch of college kids we know all about it says deacon cutting across me harmless hijinks id say we want to talk about you mister mcevoy youre saying you were this beautiful young ladys booty call i heard this phrase once maybe five years ago nobody uses it any more booty call detective fuck buddy how does that suit you from hijinks to fuck buddy in a couple of heartbeats were down to this level already i expected another minute of civility but this is how it goes its not personal except with deacon i have the feeling that maybe it is okay i get it detective i know shes she was twentyeight and im youre what seventy i dont get riled im fortytwo i counted my lucky stars believe me deacon goes for it you want to know what i think i think you were fixated on miss delyne obsessed she kept turning you down its disgusting right youre an old man in a silly hat so you freaked and shot her why dont you sign the paper and we can call it a day i cant see myself but i bet my jaw is jutting stubbornly not that easy deacon youre going to have to work on this one come on danny give it up im tired and the coffee stinks what you think im going to break down and blubber out a confession i turn to goran she always this lazy i shouldnt be smartarsing but deacon needs to refine her style a little this shooting has to be solved and the detective is throwing spears into the ocean hoping to hit something goran shields her face with a file and i suspect shes smiling you know the young uns mister mcevoy instant gratification and suddenly deacon is smiling too and i realise that this bullinachinashop attitude of hers is the oldest trick in the book you do bad cop pretty good i tell her but times awastin and i am not the guy deacon flips open a field laptop really you have quite a file here mister daniel mcevoy and looky here an interview with the fbi tagged on at the end groan word travels fast over the internet some tool in the army records department emailed my info to the fbi last year not so much as a court order and he shoots it across the pond i know what the file says if you look at the end of that page youll find it was a case of totally mistaken identity i got an official apology for christs sake deacon ignores this reading with great melodrama like she doesnt already know whats on the screen company sergeant daniel mcevoy active service in the lebanon she says lebanon with jazz hands like its disneyland extremely dangerous individual trained in closequarter combat expert knife man i dont like bazookas i say straightfaced luckily my file doesnt mention sniper and marksman skills i learned those on my own youve done some things daniel not murder not murder she jeers doing my accent sez you what are you daniel albanian im irish american too my mother was from manhattan its on the screen she checks it your mom moved to ireland from new york isnt that a little ass to mouth now shes talking about my mother its like were in the schoolyard but its tactics might even rile someone a little shorter in the tooth i have to admit this deacon woman stirs shit good i think you mean ass backwards im watching goran through all this the senior officer taking everything in letting deacon have her head for now this is their routine mother and tearaway daughter i can see how it could work on a guilty person not that i aint a guilty person im just not guilty of this what i want to do is cut through the bullshit stop playing the game and really talk to these people look i say palms up which is body talk for trust me i liked connie loved her a little maybe can we skip the regulation backandforth and see if i cant actually help out come on im not right for this once upon a time i was a professional do you seriously think i would shoot connie then leave her not ten yards from where im sitting drinking coffee how does that make sense goran nods slowly accepting the truth of my argument deacon believes it too but she sticks to her role just in case im a better actor than she is how do we know what kind of psycho you are daniel maybe you didnt get enough killing in the army maybe you want us to catch you im staring at goran now head to one side okay i see what youre doing youve got nothing so youre shaking the tree deacon closes the laptop shaking the tree is that some kind of racist comment mcevoy i do my best to ignore this accusation ask me something relevant i say to detective goran the clock is ticking your actual murderer is probably halfway across the gw bridge by now goran is not ready to share just yet and covers the file with her forearm this looks like a crime of opportunity mister mcevoy right place for him wrong place for her some crackhead looking for bag money its a theory but not a great one in ireland we would say she was patting my bottom and closing the door behind me youre in cloisters detective were not exactly overrun with crackheads this is the roughest joint in town and i havent even seen a needle in a couple of years how many crackheads you know can make a shot right between the eyes gorans chin comes up you saw the wound daniel howd that happen that was a little slip maybe its time to stop talking so fast i made it my business to see before the tape went on wanted to be sure it was connie touch anything not one damn thing goran gives me a long look searching my eyes for the lie which she doesnt find or maybe she does find it and decides to give me a little rope to tie myself up with take a walk but not too far ill be dialling your number my shoulders sag you dont want to ask me anything useful you want to tell me something useful i leave without saying another word chapter i had a whole six months of sessions with simon moriarty before the medical discharge finally came through after my second tour twice a week i took a bus to his dalkey practice and waved a cup of coffee under his nose until he rolled out of bed come on sergeant moriarty said to me one day with a grin that told me he knew a whole lot more about the world than i did make it difficult for me this is too easy textbook stuff i was lying on an oxblood leather sofa feeling about as comfortable as a cat in the doghouse usually simon lay on the sofa but this was our last session and he was taking me to task im an open book huh a pane of glass sergeant transparent let me in on the secret doc whats my problem simon lit a thin cigar with irish and jews usually its the mother with you its daddy dearest i sat up gave him a serious look are you trying to tell me that having an abusive father leads to problems in later life you must be some kind of genius hilarious sergeant hiding behind humour good tactic hows that been working out for you simon could be a pain in the arse but he generally hit the nail on the head i lay down not so good listen doc everyones got problems issues whatever you just get on with it try to stay as calm as possible moriarty flicked ash from the front of his ramones tshirt thats what were here to ascertain daniel can you stay calm we cant go releasing a trained murder machine into the big city if he cant keep his talents to himself dont worry about that ive seen enough bloodshed you have plans im free on tuesday and i know a nice bar more ashflicking life plans smartarse with your tendencies you need to be careful what kind of situations you put yourself in tendencies you make me sound like a pervert heres my theory daniel you had a violent father who beat up on your mother yourself and your baby brother got the entire family except you killed drunk driving so now you feel like you have to protect the defenceless thats why you joined up not to kill to protect the problem is that you also have difficulties with authority father figures so you felt compelled to join the army and you also felt compelled to clock your superiors do you see the conflict i felt i had to defend myself my superior officer left three of his own men pinned down between israeli troops and the militia and he refused to order any covering fire some people need to be clocked simon pretended to write something there are protocols for these things dan i know fired upon twice blahblahblah so you broke protocol and once again drew fire on your own twenty by deciding to ignore the chain of command and providing some covering fire of your own twenty thats cb not military im reaching out cut me some slack so you break protocol this time getting half a mortar shell up yer hole it was a whole shell simon frowned a shell made specifically for holes whole with a silent w oh i see but my point stands you felt compelled to protect compelled to protect got it where were you when i was signing up also you have the gambling addiction this was a new one addiction come on who told you that i like a hand of poker its true but no more than the next man its hardly a problem wishful thinking simon admitted i grow weary of this analysis plus i like a game of poker myself i dont think youre a man to be bluffed simon closed his notebook with a snap all in all i think the medical discharge is the best thing for you medical discharge sounds disgusting find yourself a nice conflictfree position continued moriarty ignoring my attempt to hide behind humour somewhere you dont have to protect anyone i cant help it dont you mean protect simon hahaed drily very good wisecracks the fast track to mental health seriously dan find yourself a stressfree position no cards no boss and no one depending on you for their wellbeing so now im a doorman at a casino but its not my fault im compelled the town is busy tonight but i dont feel connected its like im watching everything through a dirty window the world ive been holding together with spit and dreams is finally coming apart the cops toss us out on the street like were trespassers and tell us to get lost there wont be any rickety roulette or polkadot bikinis tonight connie is dead zeb is missing i killed a person with a key for christs sake i know that really the key part of it is not important but there seems to be some kind of irony in it instead of locking the door i opened barretts doorway to the next life forced laboured there is no key to life just a key to death better but i wont be writing slim volumes of poetry any time soon i feel sick deep in my stomach and theres bile in my throat bile and tequila i stop and spit in the drain and as i hawk it up bent over with my hand on a pole i see a glint of streetlight on a gum wrapper and remember something macey barretts stiletto spinning like a cheerleaders baton burying itself in the ceiling the stiletto its still there shit shit shite and bollocks what can i do about it what should i do i straighten slowly like a very old man and actually admonish myself aloud okay daniel think about this calmly in the third person now christ things are bad unfortunately my calm thinking space is out of service at the moment i try to swat aside the waves of grief and tequila fumes but my brain is fogged and buzzing it should be fine so the stiletto is up there it shouldnt lead back to me unless theres a spycam in the handle the way my lucks been going i chuckle and spit one last time to restore my manhood after all those thoughts of irony think this thing through going back to the surgery would be a big mistake irish mike could be keeping an eye on the place and showing up would only put me on his radar what about zeb i want to think something positive i would kill for some kind of bright shining answer but theres nothing coming out of my brain but fog and sadness connie darlin zeb is dead call him and find out its a thought i block the id on barretts prada cell and punch in zebs number couple of rings then a man answers yeah not zeb i can tell from a single syllable zebs got this asthma voice all in the nose dr kronski i ask like its a professional call whos speaking says the man you are i say and hang up i should probably have invented some medical yarn and promised to call back later but i cant be bothered theyre answering his calls too whatever macey barrett was looking for they havent found it yet otherwise zebs phone would be at the bottom of the reservoir along with his body i shouldnt have called i dont want any of this information its funnelling me towards a choice theres a dawn glow cupping the clouds by the time i get home i feel like crap and probably look like weekold crap the last thing i need is my upstairs neighbour mrs delano going off on an abuse bender not to mention the fact that mike madden could have cottoned on to my being a fly in his ointment by now so with all this in mind i use my army stealth training to creep into the apartment there could be a cell of jittery terrorists holed up on the second floor and they wouldnt hear company sergeant daniel mcevoy slipping down the hallway to his own door which is open the busted triplebar lock lying shamefaced on the floor i forget all about operation under the radar when i see the whirlwind that has rolled through my apartment christ almighty i shout wading through the detritus that was my life i used to do that metaphorically with simon now im doing it for real its just as painful and i dont feel better with every step the place has been wrecked destroyed ive seen bomb sites with less shredding they pulled down the wallpaper disembowelled the sofa dismantled the appliances my fridge is lying on its side leaking mayo looks like a dying robot the ac unit is in pieces on the table reminds me of a mechanics course i took once pictures on the floor a jack yeats west of ireland print i carried in a tube from dublin slashed for malice i walk around flapping my arms kicking through the debris where do you start how can you fix this then mrs delano pipes up she was waiting for me to come home im sure of it probably been up all night injecting her eyeballs with caffeine i know that sounds crazy but when you live underneath crazy some of it drips downwards keerist almighty she calls voice wafting through the light fixture keerist fucking almighty i am absolutely not in the mood for this lady right now the best tack i know is not to rise to the bait because if i react she wins and we could be at this all morning and at the end of it my stuff is still trashed you down there irish cant you keep your monkey friends under control monkey friends screw it zeb barrett and sweet connie i need to loosen the valve let off some steam so i throw my head back and roar like tarzan shut the hell up you crazy bat she comes back with hell is shut for crazy bats shut up i shout and i can feel my tendons stretch or i swear to christ i will come up there and wring your neck no christ in this neck of the woods this kind of carryon is infuriating and now that delano has me on her hook she could keep it up for hours drop dead you lunatic why dont you drop bloody dead my face is red and tight im not just shouting at delano i know but i keep shouting anyway thats right drop dead the world would be a better place dead is a better place you think dead is a better place for lunatics irish theres a new note in her voice wild past caring im a bit that way myself you heard me she doesnt respond which is unusual ominous even echoes of my own voice circle me like ghosts if this was a movie something really bad would be just about to happen what is she going to do whats the big tease how can delano haunt me for ever theres one sure way something thumps on the ceiling overhead four dead four in one day come on i race to the door skirting my ruptured easy chair the corner of my eye notices that they even took the weights off my barbells thorough up the stairs three at a time sick to my stomach heart bouncing around like a lottery ball in the cage please god not too late what the hell did she do delanos door is pretty solid with a couple of extra bolts but im running on adrenalin and take them out with a bull charge momentum carries me inside and i lurch across the threshold heaving breaths shoulder throbbing afraid to look and see i do look in case time is of the essence and i see delano sitting in a straightbacked chair a cigarette between two slim fingers there is a large book on the floor beside her a bible i think hello hero she says smoke leaking from between her bow lips you owe me a door i am such an idiot sucker delano adds which is a more accurate word my first thought is to launch into a rant but by the time i draw breath i realise theres no point its funny this whole thing is hilarious not haha funny so i dont laugh you might cut me a break i say quietly if you realised the kind of day ive had ive been up all night listening to your friends she snaps without a shred of mercy this is the closest ive stood to delano shes my age a few years younger blonde hair straight and long maybe a figure hard to tell in a towelled robe and blue eyes rimmed with kohl staring right into me like shes got mind powers i notice for the first time that this lady has got cats eyes like ava gardner or madonna beautiful but dangerous the apartment is freaky neat but cold theres a tube of wind coming in through a hole in the window she notices me looking i was having a moment she explains goddamn satsuma can you believe that made a helluva hole something to do thank christ take my mind off those eyes get those idle hands to work soldier and do not even contemplate strangling this woman you learn to use your hands in the army things break down in the field and they need to be fixed no use waiting for a requisitions crate ireland is a long way from the lebanon and even if your package makes it through the grifters on both ends of the pipeline youre still talking half a year there was a guy in my squad fixed an old radio with parts from a rolf harris stylophone he bought on mingi street a real live macgyver i wasnt good with electronics but i could manage basic household repairs so i size up the window with a squint then go foraging underneath the sink for something i can use hey irish what are you playing at maybe delano thinks im looking for trash bags to wrap her body good a pity she doesnt know about my protective instinct perhaps ill tell her later nothing under the sink to plug a hole so i rifle the storage this woman has more pills than a new york pusher and more drawers than an underwear store boomboom chuckles ghost zeb youre a funny killer daniel mcevoy yes you are stay out of my drawers irish i laugh no need to worry on that account mrs delano screw you you screw i say twisting her words childish i know but i need a laugh most of the drawers are half empty so i pour one into another and punch the board out of the first the wood comes away clean nails red with rust like theyve been sealing a coffin stay away from the imagery simon told me once because it deepens my pain no because you are shite at it id like to read the manual that came from chapter six shiteness at imagery and its effects on latent arseholery delano doesnt ask what im playing at but shes pulling hard on that cigarette now tip pulsing red and white showboating is what im doing i could just tape over the hole theres a roll right there but this board seems a more appropriate expression of the shape of my mood as a mate of mine might say i place it over the broken pane then hammer the nails into the frame with a meat tenderiser from the draining board the wind is downsized from a gale to a whistle not too shabby for once mrs delano is dumbstruck she sits like a statue smoke curling out of her fist ill call a buddy of mine i say on my way out twentyfourhour lock guy for your door and mine too until he gets here id keep the noise down you dont want to attract any undesirables in spite of my day im smiling on the steps theres not a word from delanos apartment not a peep chapter before i had more serious things to worry about i often spent the days leading up to the first transplant session searching my past trying to figure why i wanted hair plugs so badly why does a shiny skull prey on my mind so much ive spent enough hours on the couch to know that these wants often have their roots in my own history i could never come up with anything my father was dead before he got the chance to go fully bald no bald guy ever beat me or humiliated me that i can recall i dont have any hairy heroes that i want to be or hairless guys that i dont want to turn into its in the subconscious zeb informed me one night in the park the two of us were sharing a pint of jameson after the bars closed a hefty ox like me squashed into a childs swing chains cutting off the blood flow to my feet i must have been drunk believe me dan something happened i know what happened zeb offered me a good deal started showing me pictures got my vanity stoked if you got hair then maybe you aint so old and your life aint so over zeb could sell shit to a sewage plant zeb is such a good salesman that he can literally charge a guy to inject him with the fat that he just sucked out of his ass bloody bastards this is a sterile environment were the first words zeb ever spoke to me and i knew straight away by the scout boots sticking out of his scrubs that this guy was israeli army something sergeant fletcher was too busy to notice as he had a finger jammed halfway up his nose i got this bump in my nose see he said voice muted by the digit in his nostril makes me snore something terrible i need you to fix it the doctor looks a little like the bee gee who married lulu if he had just run into a sheet of plate glass you either get that or you dont he finished injecting the unconscious guys penis and petulantly threw the syringe into a metal sink come on guys im doing dick fat here its touchy work this man is a big shot in some militia or other i have to say i was a little surprised even for mingi street an underground cosmetic surgery was pretty radical though i had heard of a place in sudan that did organ transplants youd be amazed how quickly a matching donor can be found this israeli guy was a real entrepreneur especially since ninety per cent of the locals would have no hesitation sticking him with every one of his own needles i guess you get a pass if you provide a valuable service fletcher withdrew his finger what about my nose doc does this look like a swiss clinic injectables only said the man i would later know as zeb no rhino who are you calling a rhino said tommy and shot zeb in the kneecap okay that didnt happen but i can dream i dont sleep so well after my runin with mrs delano probably has something to do with me realising that my upstairs neighbour is beautifulish in a psycho kind of way though all the dead and dying connie especially has put a dent in my libido i feel a little treacherous that im not mourning zeb yet but i havent seen him on the asphalt so im nursing a spark of hope not feeling safe is the main thing keeping me awake even more than the morning sun though i reckon the hoods wont be making the rounds till noon at least these celtic gangsters are whores for the jameson and coke but once the sun crosses the yardarm mike maddens boys might pay another visit see if they cant find a few more things to break i cover the door with a wardrobe if any arseholes come through that theyll think theyre in narnia i hang a joshua tree poster over the window not bulletproof but a puzzler its all misdirection which only works if the misdirected are somewhere in between dumb and smart many of the best soldiers in the world have shit for brains and a photo of their target how did they find me anyway does irish mike have something specific or just a list of known associates i puzzle on this as eventually my mind sinks down into the black rings of sleep trust in bono thank god nearly there some rest finally then wouldnt you know a thought occurs to me one of those notions that banishes sleep like a stiff wind blowing away cobwebs keerist almighty thats what delano said keerist not plain old christ now where have i heard that recently yesterday the day before and suddenly im bolt upright in my bed that guy with the styrofoam hair the licker what was his name i have it even before i pull the card from my wallet faber the attorney with all the rioting in the club that night this guy faber completely slipped my mind delano repeats what she hears and she heard keerist faber was here and he trashed my place im on my feet pacing around the room punching a fist into my palm which i stop doing when i realise how drama queen it feels theres no sitting this out even if i wanted to faber knows where i lay my head and hes obviously got backup a runt like him didnt do this damage on his own that arsehole couldnt even lift the microwave this is not about zeb this is about connie faber killed her and hes looking for me thats it it must be christ surely nobody kills anybody over an arselicking i witnessed fabers beef with connie and i broke it up could it be that straightforward everyone wants to kill me lately its enough to make a fellow paranoid as dr moriarty often quipped you know something dan just because everyone really is out to get you doesnt mean youre not insane i always thought that sentence had a couple too many negatives three hours later im still awake thinking the old grey cells keep churning out the theories which i hammer out with ghost zeb faber killed connie possibly and you know this how because a crazy lady used his pet phrase that is pretty fucking thin as riggs and murtaugh have been known to say the world is built on thin ask george w so assuming it was the guy faber why because connie slapped him because hes a psycho pretty harsh revenge for a slap and faber did not seem like a weapons guy what about his help you dont know whos carrying steel for him good point thank you so were going to the police theres no we just me and i do not want the police poking around in my business because of the whole killingagangster thing exactly so what should we do next theres a we now i flash on tommy fletcher at this point he is back to being a corporal following an incident where he doused a sheep with gasoline set it on fire then actually ate a large portion there was quite a lot of homebrewed hooch involved tommy is belly down on a bluff overlooking nomansland loosing rounds from his fn at rangy wild dogs you shooting mutts corporal i ask him nah says tommy grinning im shooting close to the mutts watching em jump i close my eyes and feel sleep rolling over me like a wave of thick fog shoot close and watch them jump thats more or less doing nothing its aggressive passivity simon would be so proud i met zeb for the second time when i was doing my time on a door in brooklyn it was a club called queers which was trying to attract the pink pound but was pulling in the ironyloving new york artyfarts this was not my finest hour as the boss had his bouncers in spangly waistcoats and mascara any photos from this era would not be going on my website if i had one it was a brief era anyhow i lasted about a week before i got a rash on my eyelids and decided it was either buy some hypoallergenic makeup out of my own pocket or quit i chose the latter so i was on the door on my last night at queers figuring the shit quotient went up roughly two hundred per cent when the doorman was wearing mascara when this guy rolls up off his face on just about whatever he could stuff in there i did the fivefinger spread on his chest just so hed know right off how big my hand was sir dont even ask you are not coming on the premises something about this guy struck me as familiar he looked a little like one of the bee gees after a rough couple of years come on man he whined i got the cash plenty you wanna see i did not wanna see you bring cash out in the open air for more than five seconds outside a club and someone is gonna start a fight no sir keep it in your pocket the man ignored me as was to become his habit flashing a roll of fifties that could have plugged a rat hole you know what this is i put a little pressure behind my fingertips enough to back the man up a step or two i know what it is sir no sir you do not you think you know the drunk tapped his nose like there was a great secret stashed up there this here is a couple of silicone boobies and a tummy tuck sweet job too if you let me in ill give you a grand how about that one thousand dollars just to step aside i stood my ground not because i couldnt be bought but because this guy thought he could buy me if that makes any sense sorry sir put your money away and then the guy looks me in the face possibly to plead or up his offer and something pings between us hey he said wagging a finger i know you and then i had him the pasty complexion the eyes a little shiny the doctor guy from the lebanon but what i said was no i dont think weve met zeb stood back and spread his arms wide like a ringmaster introducing himself hey its me dickfat guy he kept talking like i didnt have enough information you know that militia man his cock exploded in battle im a national hero which is about the strangest collection of statements ive heard before or since i sleep till four in the afternoon and roll out of bed feeling surprised and grumpy which is a hard combination to keep going four oclock the day is dying and i dont even have shoes on and this room is a shithole and why did i not do some tidying up all that time i was lying there thinking shaving calms me down as per usual eyes open is often a bad time a moments blissful ignorance then life comes crashing in and today life is about as bad as its ever been i nick myself with the blade and watch a blood bead roll down my neck connie i think no more weekends no more you after shaving i take some of my anger out on the wall using a breeze block that was part of my shelving unit to bash a hole in the sheetrock i pull out a kevlar backpack wedged between the joists my weapons bag four years behind the plaster dust flakes stick to my sleeve i brush them away and head for chequers diner which is becoming my unofficial hq dust flakes im noticing now i must have too much time on my hands the sun has faded from red to white and im having a lords breakfast pancakes bacon sausage stack of toast and six cups of coffee im awake now let me tell you the waitress carmél comes over with my change and is a little surprised by me asking for yet another refill she bumps my elbow with her thigh i had you figured for a fitness guy dan you lose a competition or something lifes too short i tell her maybe ill take up cigarettes too carmél laughs sounds like a motor turning over im guessing shes a cigarette gal herself i have a plan of sorts you gonna save my life asks ghost zeb no you im gonna put on ice for the time being but this guy faber i need to do something about him before he makes a hole in my forehead ghost zeb is sulking yeah maybe if wed spent a weekend in the sack id be top of your list its a fair point so the plan i phone in an anonymous tip something vague about faber and his little runin with connie then i watch and see how the attorney jumps when they question him ghost zeb is incredulous thats it thats your entire plan why dont you just wish upon a star while youre at it ghost zeb is turning out to be as much of a pain in the arse as his corporeal self corporeal this one rookie in the barracks used to confuse it with corporal ten times a day until someone explained the difference i suppose it doesnt matter how you come by information as long as you remember it oh and no one gets hurt too badly no one decent at any rate i slide a couple of dimes out of my change and head for the phone booth in the corner ghost zeb is so pissed that he almost stays at the table without me i dial the cdp desk from the booth and ask for detective deacon specifically because goran is sharp shed nail me in a second what snaps deacon when she picks up like im interrupting her conference call with commissioner gordon you working the delyne case i ask doing my best nu yawker the what case connie delyne the slotz hostess you mean that stripper they aint no strippers up in there my accent is gone down south last century too yeah that hostess is one of mine who is this this is by way of a nonymous tipoff which i believe is police vernacular im playing around now i shouldnt a friend is dead another missing but in times of stress i cant help myself sometimes i giggle like a girl its embarrassing deacon sighs writing the call off i bet they get a hundred cranks a day do you have information pertaining to the delyne case sir i got something good for you miss thats detective they let ladies be detectives now that right there explains a lot come on sergeant you dont have time for this pull yourself together this is not a sixthgrade prank call seymore butz anyone i hear something creak deacon must be squeezing the phone pretty tight thats a poor attitude you have there sir i disguise my giggle with a cough take it easy detective only trying to help there are a few moments while deacon pulls herself together shes probably whispering youre a professional over and over so help im getting old here i was in slotz a few nights ago sir thats miss motherf remember detective female sorry you got kind of a deep voice i like that personally deacon breathes deep through her nose do you have any pertinent information whatsoever sir hold up is this randy are you dicking me about randy i dont know who randy is but id love to meet him i aint no randy you want this information or not yeah give it up but if this is randy im gonna have your balls in a sling sir okay miss if you is a miss i was in slotz and i seen connie beefing with this guy what guy a lawyer guy names faber jerry faber or maybe gary i hear scratching deacon is writing this down you overhear anything specific a little how he was gonna kill her she was gonna pay stuff like that deacon is taking notes now you bet she is you heard him say he was going to kill connie delyne those exact words yes sir miss detective he said it all right more than once will you testify to this im testifying right now aint i yeah but i need you to thats when i hang up smiling as i imagine deacon shouting abuse into her mouthpiece poor randy i think hes going to need a jockstrap step two of my dodgy plan stake out fabers office i take the bus across town to the financial district where fabers card tells me he operates from maybe district is too grand a term what we have in cloisters is a financial block couple of office buildings with a bennigans and a cheesecake factory thrown in for the lunchtime crowd the bennigans is across from fabers lobby so i order myself a turkey otoole i dont want and spy across the plaza through a window tinted streaky green by painted shamrocks turkey o toole jesus i dont have to wait long fifteen minutes later a police sedan pulls up in front of the hydrant idles for a few seconds then drives off to a space further along the pavement i smile behind my sandwich deacon wanted to park at the hydrant but goran made her move along interesting what would dr moriarty make of that maybe deacon was beaten up by someone dressed as a hydrant or maybe goran lost her puppy in a fire psychology anyone can do it another ten minutes and faber comes out shooting threats with his sixshooter fingers goran and deacon trail behind him with glazed eyes i know that look thats the face you put on when some sergeant major is screaming the skin off your forehead ill bet that faber is crying persecution and calling the chief of police by his golfing nickname goran taps deacons forearm with two fingers calm down the touch says we do this right faber is practically dancing now from across the square i can see his ginger fuzz vibrate its funny except that maybe he killed connie detective gorans lips are moving now and i fill in the blanks take a walk mister faber but not too far ill be dialling your number so now the cat is among the pigeons which one is the cat asks ghost zeb im not sure that particular saying has always confused me faber beeps a new mercedes down the block with his key fob and the cops traipse back to their beatup sedan probably thinking that theyre in the wrong line of work now what genius everyone has a car except you ghost zeb is getting to be something of a fixture in my head youre like my spooky sidekick screw you charming i need to get myself an actual live friend that i can leave in another room anyway the transport thing is covered there are citybike rails all over town part of the mayors a better cleaner cloisters platform along with dogshitbag dispensers and zero tolerance for wino shacks i hurry outside leaving the turkey unexplored and swipe my visa in the bike rack evening traffic the way it is in every town from here to atlantic city i shouldnt have to break a sweat keeping up with faber he might have a problem keeping up with me if he ever decided to do that a big part of me is hoping he will that would make things nice and simple law of the jungle im still tucking my pants into my socks when i notice that deacon has pulled a lazy uturn the blues are on fabers tail too we got a great big convoy sings ghost zeb i nod swinging my leg over the bar always liked that song appropriate too riding a bike didnt used to be this dangerous i almost get flattened three times crossing town to the strip three times ive led patrols through hot zones with less aggravation than this eventually some redneck pickup jim bob forces me to actually dismount and pound his hood to make him keep his distance lucky the blues are focused on fabers car or they might have spotted my antics as it is they pull around the corner on to cypress with barely a blink of the brake light i give jim bob my best stonecold stare and pedal after them not easy looking tough on a pushbike sympathises ghost zeb hes got that right when faber pulls over i brake and ditch the citybike behind a debris mountain heaped against a derelict twostorey that once housed a chinese restaurant judging by the smell of the trash the lotus blossom remember those spring rolls yeah i got it now they closed that place what do you think ghost zeb is getting a little strident its like im giving myself a pass to be a lunatic i climb on to the knoll which stinks of prawn crackers and check the street with an old vietnamera starlight scope i bought in a hells kitchen pawn shop still works okay in spite of a few years in the bag its pretty dark already but the scope amplifies the streetlight a couple of thousand times and gives me a good view of the bar faber is striding towards its an upscale joint called the brass ring a place i probably would never make it past the door unless i decided that i really wanted to go in faber flings his keys at some poor schmuck doorman and bulls straight past i know how the schmuck feels goran and deacon back into an alley and quickly settle into stakeout positions slouching down cracking open the windows two minutes later smoke curls from both sides give it another fifteen and deacon will make a coffee run their plan is as dumb as yours ghost zeb points out what happens now we sit here wasting time youre not here im not arguing with you real mature i whistle a few bars to distract him what is that song come on what are we doing right now ghost zebs chuckle whines through his nose my mind displaying its attention to detail elvis costello watching the detectives very good and that keeps him quiet for a while the blues call it stakeout and the army call it reconnaissance but it amounts to the same thing waiting and watching two hours later and faber is still in the club and i cant seem to find a position on the spicy mound that doesnt involve a rock or root poking my groin maybe you like having a root stuck in your groin i dont dignify this with a reply goran and deacon are feeling the strain the junior detective is out of the car stomping her feet against the cold and mouthing off goran wears a putuponmommy expression riding out the tantrum with the starlight i can almost read lips and what i cant make out i make up come on josie let me go in there see who faber is talking to no we do this right hang back make a case fuck that this is our man you see how he freaked out started threatening us and shit we hang back detective something along those lines or maybe not the seriousness of the situation escalates suddenly and alarmingly deacon turns her back to her superior shoulders hunched agitated cigarette hand tracing jet trails in the air jet trails not bad for a doorman there is no time for a backandforth with ghost zeb goran has slipped quietly from the passenger seat and drawn a pistol from her ankle holster a throwdown shit i could be wrong maybe im misreading the situation goran pulls a silencer from her handbag and casually twists it on to the barrel all the time her lips moving keeping the conversation smooth no warning signs warning signs or not deacon turns around and finds herself down a deserted alley in a bad part of town with the black eye of a silencer staring unblinkingly at her im not misreading anything detective goran is about to execute her partner pack up and go says zeb seriously this is the best advice of my life and i know it but ive got this whole protection thing pulling at my psyche go now cops shooting cops theres no way to get in the middle of that sandwich and not get bitten ultimately though im not an animal so what choice do i have but to help detective deacon the backpack hasnt been out of the wall in years it was never supposed to be in that building for so long neither was i nothing is going to work how could anything work not a spray of oil on the guns not a rub of a rag for the bullets the walls in my apartment are like sponges through the sights i see deacon going through the stages first her eyebrows knit in confusion what the hell are you doing then realisation drags at her features like thirty years of hard living this is followed by denial and finally bravado deacon is presenting her chest to goran now thumping it with a fist cigarette sparks flying i actually hear her challenge from across the street come on bitch shoot me it doesnt sound real its what a hollywood cop might say all the time im tugging on a pair of disposable gloves from a box in the bag then searching for my rifle which of course is in pieces we were trained in this kind of thing in the army assembling your weapon blindfolded in the rain some guy shooting blanks by your ear getting pissed on by a group of privates okay maybe not that last bit but regardless i was always useless at the blindfold assembly thing generally it took me about an hour and i ended up with a piece of modem art that would look stunning with the right lighting but couldnt shoot worth a damn i spit a string of swear words and lay down the scope across the street goran is delivering a lecture before she pulls the trigger thank god for grandstanding killers back home my squad were once brought in to hunt for an ira kidnap squad who had crossed the border we only caught them because they delayed a scheduled execution so they could film it from a couple of angles everyone wants their moment now that i have two eyes on the job the custom sharpshooter seems to assemble itself jumping out of the velcro straps the collapsible stock bolts on behind the trigger guard the stainlesssteel barrel screws in smoothly feels a little damp could be im imagining it i tear open a box of shells with my teeth and thumb one into the breech safety off starlight snapped into its bracket the smell of soy sauce is really putting me off time for one shot maybe not a moment for adjustments or to figure consequences goran is still talking thank christ maybe shes warning deacon maybe theres no need to shoot the younger detective sinks to her knees in the filth of the alley tears streaming down her face final stage acceptance thats a helluva warning goran circles behind her partner never allowing the barrel to droop no room for deacon to make her move to her credit she tries anyway and gets a pistolwhipping for her trouble goran is one cold customer i had these two figured all wrong deacons head nods maybe shes praying or maybe shes reacting to the gun barrel pressed to the crown of her skull through the eerie glow of the starlight i see that gorans face is almost blank except for a little shadow of pain like shes lost her keys the dirty detective cocks her revolver i pull my trigger and surprise the hell out of myself by actually hitting what i was aiming for up high right shoulder goran spins like a gyroscope and pitches face down into a bumshack looks like the mayor missed one detective goran will live but she wont be aiming any guns with that arm for a while i am midway through breaking down my rifle and rehearsing a smug little clint eastwood movie reference for ghost zeb when deacon realises that she hasnt been shot and after a little whitehot pain and a bout of coughing that would pull a couple of lungs free from their moorings goran is alive enough to realise that she is not dead nice move idiota says gz now we got a shootout situation idiota one of four spanish words zeb bandies about the second is puta the third is amigo and finally theres gringo which he loves to throw at me even though zeb himself has a complexion like cottage cheese dropped on to a pavement from a tall building deacon sees her partner roll over coming faceup with her police special cocked spluttering bloodbubbled curses deacon ducks under a wild shot scrabbles in the trash for gorans throwdown and puts half a dozen shots into her partners upper body expartner i guess it takes me a moment to process someone who was supposed to be winged is now dead and approximately fourteen per cent of the bullets in the corpse belong to me that was selfdefence i tell zeb its a tough report for deacon to write up but selfdefence all the same go now says ghost zeb you dont get to write up a report this time i listen chapter zeb waited around queers that night until i knocked off i say waited but a more accurate description would be passed out in the allnight pharmacy across the street he was more or less hurled into my path by the proprietor as i walked home and keep your prick away from my customers was the farewell comment obviously zeb had been up to no good just before passing out perhaps the two were connected i was in a pretty crappy mood having just told my boss where he could shove his mascara pencil but something about the sheer wretchedness of this figure at my feet dissolved my gloom and i picked the little guy off the ground and frogmarched him a couple of blocks to kelloggs diner on metropolitan he came to a little after a jug of coffee and greeted me like a lost comrade hey paddy omickster where are we what happened you were trying to inject some dick fat into a customer apparently it took zeb a minute to process this then a slow grin lit his features funny youre a funny guy irish i didnt get that sense when you were in uniform the name is daniel mcevoy i say without extending my hand paddy omickster was my mothers second choice zeb actually slapped the table more with the funny i love this guy he announced to the diners five patrons so daniel mcevoy you gonna admit me to queers tomorrow night now that weve broken the ice in response to this i explained how i was off the queers door because of a makeup disagreement i am surprised said zeb why would anyone quit over a little mascara hell im wearing womens panties right now you never know right at this point i was half amused half thinking of leaving this guy was despicable but he had a certain sleazy charm so anyways daniel omcevoy youre out of a job and i got a job with no one in it so what do you say you wanna work for zeb kronski this was about the vaguest employment offer i had ever heard and considering the man before me was wearing womens panties i thought i should ask for a couple more details it turned out that since zeb didnt have a licence to practise in the us he was doing the botox party rounds on a cashonly basis and had already been ripped off twice he could do with someone to hump the wad as he put it once he explained i signed on for a week provisionally see how things panned out provisionally said zeb rolling the word around in his mouth yeah i like the sound of that he pointed at my forehead say youre getting a little thin on top my paddy friend i got a procedure make you look like mister tom cruise what do you think of that i thanked my new boss politely but told him no no needles in the head for me i held out for six years before he persuaded me otherwise im gone before deacon has time to wonder who gifted her a second shot at life not that im expecting roses and a sloppy hug a person with her disposition might not even be grateful ive seen it before some blues are so butch that needing to be saved is a sign of weakness deacon is pretty butch its a pity to say goodbye to my beautiful custom rifle but holding on to it is akin to leaving a trail of crumbs from my backpack to the crime scene no doubt there are already a forest of fibres on the chinese knoll no need to give the forensics boys my identity tied in a velvet ribbon i break down the weapon and pedal around the west side dropping off pieces into various drains the bullets go too plinking through the bars i hear theres some test that can match one slug to a batch but jason informed me of this fact so it could be standard doorman bullshit jason once swore to me that his daddy had eyes in the back of his head actual fucking eyes in the back of his actual fucking head so not everything my comrade says can be taken as hundred per cent gospel i drop the bike at the bus station and deposit my backpack in a locker whatever investigation is coming you can bet your last pair of shorts that im going to be pulled in for questioning being in possession of a big bag of weapons is not going to swing any votes my way i hold on to a little glock though in case of an emergency which seems pretty likely the way things have been going its not a question of if its a question of when who and how many three questions really it doesnt take a napoleon to figure out my next move a quick trip home to gather a few necessities then up sticks to some cheap motel where i can figure my next move but one youre leaving me to die says ghost zeb accusingly you are dead most likely and im not leaving you im moving a little further away from irish mike and the police thats all youre leaving me some goddamn friend irish prick a sulking ghost thats all i need my street seems pretty quiet exactly the way it would seem if a couple of experienced gangsters were staking it out could be the blues are here too maybe the interested parties will stumble across each other and spark off a bloodbath fingers crossed i start three blocks out and work in decreasing circles sweeping every street checking parked cars searching for the telltale bulletproof symbol on the windscreen you find that little triangle and you know its good guys bad guys or maybe a rapper praying someone will shoot at him nothing no sign of anyone watching my apartment i try to kid myself that it makes sense goran wasnt killed with my bullets and faber has no need to keep the cat in the bag any more hes already under investigation theres a fire escape bolted to the side of my building it zigzags along the brick camouflaged by rust and looks like it hasnt been used in decades youd think it would make a hell of a racket if a person were to crank the ladder but youd be wrong for years ive been keeping the hinges oiled in case a quiet getaway is called for in the dead of night with a pillow over my face and a torrent of insults spilling down from above i often imagined that i would finally crack and strangle mrs delano once there was blessed quiet i could sleep for eight hours then pull my bag out of the wall and climb down my greased fire escape tonight im climbing up five fingers brushing flakes from the rail the other five concealing the baby glock in my palm its risky coming back here considering the size and complexity of the shit pile im in but it will only be for a few minutes ten max im stealing in the back way to cut down my chances of being seen also i dont have the key for the new lock yet in and out then daniel mcevoy is history and anyone trying to find him better be invisible or bulletproof the fire escape doesnt stop at my window but its close enough for me to perch on the railing and rest an elbow on the sill and while im up there precariously balanced on a couple of toes i realise that i forgot to take the beeper out of my pocket the window beeper is a little gadget im especially proud of just a remote linked to a tiny motor but it lets me sneak into my own apartment without leaving the window open moron snickers ghost zeb i cannot tell you how badly i want him out of my head im right here you know i can hear you good it takes a bit of contorting and theres a long moment when im teetering on the tip of one shoe but i fish the remote from my trousers and beep myself into my apartment tumbling across the sill my stomach sours at the thought of the devastation inside for the first time in my civilian life it occurs to me that maybe i should have tidied up a bit before going out my hand crabs across the floor expecting to brush against splinters of my speakers or tufts of hard foam from the disembowelled settee but theres nothing but rough carpet strange the simplicity of a security mans lot is looking pretty attractive right now keep the peace remove those who would break it no moral dilemmas involved my life has been growing ever more complicated since people started dying around me since you started killing people i wounded goran deacon killed her what about barrett selfdefence yeah because he was doing that shuffle tell that to the judge i dont think irish mike uses judges i switch on the lamp which works very surprising since the last time i was here the bulb lay like cracked eggshell on the rug have we gone back in time or has somebody tidied up option b i think though a would be nice so who i think i know says ghost zeb me too and its an alarming thought the apartment is still pretty battered but no worse than your average student accommodation surfaces have been swept and the gloss of polish shines on the table which sits legless on the floor three jumbo trash bags are propped by the door fat sentries this is an extra dimension to my life that i do not need into the bathroom i hurry my duffel bag is in the airing cupboard ready for packing with one hand reaching for the door handle i catch sight of myself in the bathroom mirror my eyes are distended ink blots with forty years of wrinkles hanging below them like sagging power lines the black watch cap has rolled back revealing an expanse of forehead and a buckshot spatter of transplanted hair its growing in you think so absolutely isnt it supposed to fall out before it grows in lets talk about this later did i look this old a couple of days ago before all the mayhem being a doorman never weighed so heavily on my face i blink a couple of times suddenly tight across the chest just when did i start worrying so much about getting old some nights in the lebanon it felt as though i couldnt wait to die or if not that then at least the idea didnt upset me just make it quick that was my only requirement most of us had kill pacts anyone in the pact takes a mortal wound the others toss a coin and finish him off sounds brutal but kill pacts were very popular i made some real friends i still drop them a line every now and then make sure they know the pact is off i notice something else in the bathroom besides my own haggard face the toilet rolls are stacked in a diamond shape this is uberfreaky i skirt the sculpture like it might suddenly come alive and start dispensing zen advice why would a toilet roll sculpture dispense anything but paper where does that thought even come from i know who built this theres only one person who would sweat gathers at the base of my neck in spite of my therapy sessions i feel woefully illequipped to deal with someone who builds toilet roll diamonds my bag is where it should be and i quickly locate the toiletries that were strewn around the floor by whoever trashed the place but are now lined neatly along the green plastic sink top i stuff them into the bag and collect one last essential i keep ten years of savings almost fifty thousand dollars stashed in the sink drain for emergencies and if this isnt an emergency its doing a good impersonation i screw off the pipe and shake loose the sealed bundles of cash usually having this much money on my person would make me nervous but im already as nervous as a person can be without shortcircuiting his brain i pocket the cash and head for the door in retrospect i should have gone back out the window deacon arrives outside the door of my apartment just as i tug it open her gun is out and there are shoals of blood spatter on her blouse i search her eyes briefly for signs of gratitude and love no luck i think about reaching for the glock inside my jacket maybe i could make it or maybe this young trained and fit officer would put a dozen slugs in a nice smiley face spread through my heart deacons cheeks are wet and her eyes are wild a couple of hours ago she was the embodiment of the law and now shes gunned down her partner with no idea why her partner was about to gun her down she has no idea who to trust or who to blame police she says and taps the badge on her belt ooookay i say interested to hear whats coming next was it you she demands and her gun is in my face shaking give me a steady weapon over a shaky one any day shaky guns tend to have shaky fingers on the trigger was it me what deacon screws the barrel into my forehead feels like a life saver mint only not so cheery dont fuck with me mcevoy was it you soldier boy the shaking gun is wiggling my eyebrows you trying to be funny you making faces at me now mcevoy its the gun i say helplessly im just standing here deacon is on the edge its in her eyes in the grit of her teeth one last time tell me it was you i dont think theres a right answer to this question okay i admit it was me it was you what jesus christ is she kidding me she cocks the weapon not kidding then it was me everything i set you on fabers trail i winged goran and i watched you finish her off deacon expected this answer but still shes stunned on a positive note her weapon drops to her side it it was you i nod warily not out of the woods yet deacons eyes are glazed and her hands are twitching my guess is shes in mild shock you face the void and cut down a friend all in the same evening and its bound to have an effect in my experience this can go one of two ways either deacon dissolves to a shuddering heap or her heart hardens and she shoots me because at least its a positive action better to make a move now while her guard is down but i barely get my fists balled when she comes at me full tilt hand flat on my chest this is confusing back into the room we stumble her fingers ripping at my shirt like its on fire then the flat of her hand is on my heart searching for the life inside her mouth is up snarling wanting the kiss so i kiss detective deacon feeling a premature postcoital regret that should warn me off but doesnt we trip as one over the remains of the couch on to the caucasian rug i got from a lebanese market it occurs to me that what were about to do on this rug is probably a sin in several religions not that this gives me pause im feeling pretty tense myself and this is as good a way as any to let it all out i guess there was a third way this could all go i never came across this option in the army very early the next morning we find ourselves mashed up against the wall half covered with a few sofa cushions the next morning i know i always hated that youre watching a movie or reading a book finally the steamy scene is on the horizon and suddenly its the next morning how does that make you feel cheated thats how so its not like im a prude but this roll on the rug was definitely weird deacon bounced me around pawing at my person im surprised given my low selfesteem issues that i was able to perform at all go on encourages ghost zeb thats all the detail you need anyway you were there yeah but i like the way you tell it in your oirish accent you are a sick little imaginary friend zeb i gotta say these conversations with gz are tiring even though i know hes just a greatest hits tape cobbled together by my memory i am starting to think stuff quietly in case he hears me i heard that dickhead think quietly what are you a lunatic i decide not to answer that question so in the morning were wedged into the corner like two corpses that have been tossed there neither with a clue what to say i regain consciousness first and use the minutes to examine the lady ive just had some kind of relations with usually i do the examining beforehand but theres nothing usual about this encounter everything about deacon says strength wide brow strong nose full lips skin the colour of polished rosewood her body is lean and muscled like she beats suspects a lot and theres a welt on her upper arm looks like a bullet wound i touch the scar gently feels like theres a marble under there nine millimetre i ask mister romance branding accident deacon grunts still half asleep i have a feeling were never going to send each other perfumed letters she shrugs her shoulder to dislodge my hand and her bracelet rattles its unusual enough for me to notice snaking around her wrist a couple of times laden with various charms washers bottle tops coloured glass ive seen these before in africa memory bracelets the story of your lifes journey worn on the wrist i try for some confirmation memory bracelet deacon grunts again most of the charms seem standard enough but theres a wizened sphere like a shrunken golf ball i tap it with a fingernail whats this one deacons voice is sleepy guy kept asking me questions she slurs his left nut okay no more questions maybe ill just take forty winks after all ive got protection deacons skin is smooth against my chest and i try to pretend shes actually fond of the person behind her maybe after a couple of years together detective deacon will develop a grudging respect for me and we can have a series of adventures unless she does a sideways shuffle and you have to kill her im starting to realise that tuning out gz is next to impossible so long as i have a single brain cell that is not distracted by life i attempt to distract myself by wondering how deacon is going to keep herself out of prison obviously she hasnt come clean about goran or shed be filling out a million forms in triplicate and holding staring contests with internal affairs they must have found goran by now deacon stiffens and i think that maybe she had been trying to distract herself with all the tough talk not yet i put her in the trunk this is not good news as deacons trunk is at the back of her car which is probably parked outside my door goran is in your trunk hard to explain that to ia something like regret flits across the side of deacons face maybe theres a human heart beating inside robocop explain to ia youre kidding right you screwed my career mcevoy and i was a good cop too twelve years in youngest black detective in the state i feel i should stand up for myself youd prefer to be dead its funny says deacon and im guessing tragifunny not funny haha people always think im dirty cos of my attitude typical a hardball boy cop is a maverick doesnt play by the rules but gets the job done you get a girl with some balls then there must be something wrong with her i was never dirty until now im finished ill be lucky to get off with manslaughter i sit up to ask the obvious question why didnt you call it in it was a righteous shoot deacon slumps even further into the corner suddenly dead tired i should have all night ive been asking myself that question i guess i panicked is that what you want to hear soldier boy my partner and superior tried to murder me i didnt know who to trust apart from the guy with the sniper rifle which i figured had to be you i hoped you might be able to tell me something but you know shit right my time with simon suddenly comes in handy there is a very strong case for posttraumatic stress here who are you says deacon sigmund freud im a cop man i know how we think and i wouldnt buy that psych bullshit for a new york minute i forge ahead no listen deacon its true your partner tried to kill you you had no idea how high the conspiracy went you panicked loaded up the body and went somewhere safe there are a few holes sure but the basic truth is you acted in selfdefence believe it or not you are in shock and you took advantage yeah its a dig but shes going for the cover story its a good story because it happens to be mostly true the only detail she has to omit is the bald irish one i can see her eyes lose focus as she imagines how it would play out back in the precinct there is a way out then deacons phone beeps and she rolls into a crouch instantly alert i see the curve of her spine shining like a samurai sword she shakes her trousers until a phone falls out and checks the text message her posture was pretty tense but now it cranks up another few notches tendons stand out like piano wire behind her knees not good news deacon bends low snagging the sig with her trigger finger youre a knife man right mcevoy thats what it said in your file i dont like the sound of this whats the word ominous suggests zeb yeah thanks so what im a rifle man too you probably worked that out i figured that one says deacon twirling the pistol but now i got this message from the county coroners office telling me that connie delyne was killed with a blade i sit up pretty quick wishing i had some pants on at this point id settle for a napkin to cover myself its barely dawn what kind of coroner works this early one who owes me so what about this blade that was a bullet hole what kind of knife makes a hole like that you tell me knife man deacon looms over me tapping the barrel against her thigh and i feel bald and naked which i am twice a week i suffer nightmares that look pretty much exactly like this it occurs to me that simon moriartys number is still in my wallet i really need to call that guy come on deacon i saved your life i put you on to faber its youyouyou says deacon levelling the weapon whatever happens daniel mcevoy is involved there is definitely some shit you are not telling me i feel myself shrink you want to aim that gun somewhere less sensitive my heart maybe no i think im aiming at the right spot think about it deacon were in this together you need me to back up your story deacon closes her eyes for half a second i do need you but i need time to get my ducks in the goddamn basket or whatever i gotta talk to a few people weigh up my options the goran situation needs to be wrapped up right before i turn myself in thats all good youre making perfect sense we need to find the connection between faber and goran theres no we says deacon just me zeb sniggers no we see how that feels i lose it for a second shut the hell up now is not the time deacon frowns now is not the time what the fuckre you crying about mcevoy you get emotional after screwing is that it and whats up with that hair i briefly consider explaining who i was actually talking to but theres no way to present ghost zeb and not sound a little unstable okay calm down for a minute think things through deacon cocks the gun resplendently naked not a selfconscious atom in her body whereas i am very selfconsciously naked im gonna think things through thats it exactly cuff yourself to the radiator mcevoy cuffing myself would not be good listen deacon come on whats your first name detective says deacon tossing me the handcuffs from her belt you dont want to do this youre a mind reader now mcevoy those needles on your head some kind of antennae thats two hair jokes im counting there are bad people after me deacon you leave me here in restraints and im dead deacon shrugs and her breasts wobble which some part of me cant help noticing dont shrug im fighting for my life here youre losing nice and tight now her eyes are golden and steady shes not changing her mind at least let me have the hat finally a smile not the happy kind look at you mcevoy big sharpshootin soldier going to pieces without his hat didnt seem to bother you earlier earlier i had distractions i swear her smile softens a degree could be my imagination yeah distractions then the ice is back now cuff yourself to the goddamn radiator or i will hobble you with a leg shot i hate that word hobble halfway between hobbit and gobble which for some reason does not conjure an appealing picture youre not going to shoot me we just deacons finger creaks on the trigger we just what i shot josie and ive been sleeping with her for eight months i pick up the cuffs but never get the chance to fasten them on my wrists deacon is multitasking when mrs delano comes through the door holding a steaming tray of lasagne the detective has her gun on me and one big toe through the band of her panties it is without doubt the most surreal moment of my life i hope you dont mind me calling so early mister mcevoy chirps delano made up like cyndi lauper circa true colours your friend the nice repair man gave me your new key so i did a little cleaning up this is not the mrs delano i know this person is actually smiling there are teeth involved the outfit has shoulder pads you could launch a jet from but nevertheless shes wearing outdoor clothing for a moment i think that delano has taken a beating but then i realise shes been a little liberal with the mascara she looks like a crying stripper but theres light in her eyes and not the usual death lasers a warm light my neighbour doesnt notice anything off for a minute she has her downcast eyesbashful face on and is smiling a teenagers lovesick smile fixing the window thats what brought this on i know you eat at the club she says but i thought we could watch a movie later this evening daniel maybe split this lasagne i baked it myself we can reheat deacon freezes one leg up arse to the door god help me if i laugh now what do you say dan you want to spend some time with your best girl absolutely i reply why i have no idea in the fraction of a second left before someone gets hurt i play out a dozen possible outcomes to this ridiculous situation in the bestcase scenario i get shot in the dick in the worst i get shot in the dick and one of my balls mrs delanos eyes land on the naked policewoman in my apartment there is a beautiful kodak moment of silence then everyone starts yelling at the same time hold on now maam says deacon police business get down delano i shout on the floor mrs delanos cheeks pump up and turn crimson i half expect flames to shoot out of her ears deacon has got it covered shes a professional and her feet are planted in a wide stance now but delano throws her with i stacked your toilet rolls bastard deacon rears back like shes been bitten on the nose and she shoots me a glance that says what the hell have you and this crazy lady got going on the glance is her mistake because delano attacks steaming lasagne borne aloft i cover my balls because melted cheese sticks tough as deacon is there isnt a naked person on this planet who isnt scared of hot pasta so she gives delano her full attention and shoots the dish right out of her hands theres a béchamel explosion minced steak spatters the wall like buckshot and i make my move i get off the floor fast pistoning my legs like im coming out of a squat deacon already knows whats happening but shes not fast enough to get the gun around she screams in frustration then i have her against the wall cuffs snicked over her wrists gun smothered in my fist this is kidnapping she spits i am a friendly with a badge do you really want to throw that away friendly most of my friends dont aim their weapons at my privates most delano is still coming shes screaming too something about me being just as bad as all the others which wouldnt be so bad except for the glass shards shes swinging with every word deacon isnt calming down either shes bucking like theres a scorpion on her back and trying her damnedest to get a heel into my crotch i have no alternative but to play into mrs delanos fantasy thank god youre here darling i say hoping shes too far gone to notice my atrocious acting this woman tried to assault me you saw the gun look handcuffs delanos eyes fog over and she stutters to a halt gobs of lasagne dripping from her hands splatting on to my good rug i wince but dont mention it handcuffs i push deacons head into the wall as gently as i can covering the side of her face with my palm ive had relationships go wrong before but never this fast yeah can you believe it i woke up to find this crazy lady holding a gun on me crazy lady says delano slowly ive heard that phrase before i bet you have you fucking lunatic deacon says spitting the words through mashed lips you shut your filthy mouth orders delano and without hesitation clocks deacon on the crown with the corner of pyrex dish in her hand the blow has surprising muscle in it and detective deacon goes limp in my arms sorry baby did i catch your finger there baby ah no im fine do you think we should kill her cut her up like in the movies i have an electric carving knife penis looks good baby i lower deacon on to the rug then hurriedly pull on some pants very uncomfortable with my penis being mentioned in the same breath as an electric carving knife no no need to kill her shes confused thats all delano winks at me or maybe its just hard to keep that eyelid open with all the mascara trowelled on to it maybe she heard about mister peepee and came to see for herself m maybe i stutter whatever the reason this woman has problems we need to be compassionate show understanding or slice her head off i have plastic bags sure we could toss her in the car beside her partner then drive to the mall where i dumped macey and line up all three bodies together in the lexus hell why not steal connies corpse from the morgue to complete the set mrs delano squeezes my arm im kidding dan its my crazy sense of humour thats why you love me her face is glowing she looks young remember that time you fixed my window that was when i knew i am not qualified to deal with this why does everyone i meet seem to have mental problems ah but did they have mental problems before meeting you whos the common denominator here dan i do not have mental problems i say to the voice in my head perfectly aware how damning it would sound were i to say it aloud deacons pulse is steady but shes got a glowing bump on her noggin which i doubt will improve her mood any and she was pissed enough before lasagne lady popped her on the skull deacon moans and mumbles something that sounds like hill view utter trucker but which is probably kill you motherfucker and with this in mind i pocket her gun at least this way she will have to bludgeon me to death with her fists i cannot honestly say that i am protecting either of these women so much for my psychosis it pains me it really does but i have to protect myself in this situation and sort out the women from afar opting to stay here and nurse deacon would surely result in hosepipes frameups and jail time not necessarily in that order i pull on my clothes and mentally cobble together a story for my new girlfriend are you speaking to me baby no i dont was i mrs delano is concerned well you were kind of mumbling and looked like you were playing an invisible piano too everything okay two of my stress tells thinking aloud and conducting simon moriarty pointed those out to me i really have to call that guy just thinking you need to be safe mrs delano she walks her fingers up my chest what are we strangers sofia please i clear my throat its dangerous for you here sofia delano puts her cheek against my heart remember when you first called me sofia baby that night in coney island ill never forget it carmine carmine now im somebody else is that an improvement i wonder mrs delanos makeup leaves a face print on my chest when i peel her off you need to go upstairs now sofia go up and wait for my call i flash on the rows of pill bottles in the upstairs kitchen do you have any medication you should be taking sofia delano frowns no more pills carmine they make me stupid how about one just one to help you relax until i call maybe just one for you baby good good baby you promise sure say it promise me delano pouts and suddenly girls just wanna have fun starts playing in my mindpod i promise happy now yeah happy now i steer her towards the hallway but she stops at the door planting her back against the frame her chest is heaving and her eyes are bright carmine was a lucky guy i think what did he do to you kiss me baby she moans ive been dreaming so long after all this time i get lucky twice in one day pity about the bloodsodden circumstances come on carmine says sofia her voice sulky and impatient no kiss no pill so i kiss her she grabs a fistful of my neck hair and pulls me in deep and its like a movie kiss long and languorous and after a year or so i start wishing my name was carmine we come up for air and sofias eyes are wet blue mascara flowers on her cheeks we still got the spark carmine im feeling a bit emotional myself yeah sofia that was something her nose crinkles but what happened to your hair i hustle her up the stairs with ghost zeb chuckling in my ear i shut the door behind mrs delano then take the steps three at a time back to my apartment deacon is up and about stumbling around head in hands swear words drooling from her lips shes not fully conscious yet but any minute now she spots me with one rolling eye and lurches in my direction like an extra from day of the dead easy there detective deacon i say gallantly steering her to the remains of the sofa she plonks down deep into the butchered cushions her entire midsection disappears from boobs to knees on any other day youd have to laugh except maybe yesterday or the day before that how you feeling detective screw you we did that remember did we i didnt notice i have it on very good authority that i have a lovely peepee so lay off deacons eyes are clearing up now i can see craftiness in the corners okay it was wonderful you were like a stallion daniel she rattles her cuffs under my nose so let me go i nod slowly you put together a good argument me being like a stallion and so forth so okay i slip off one cuff just long enough to attach it to the sofas exposed metal frame deacon does not bother yanking her chain bastard she sighs rolling her eyes its temporary i assure her just until i can figure out what to do with you you could stick a knife in my forehead i mull this over tempting but no what if i winged you then you shoot yourself half a dozen times thats not funny mcevoy says deacon throwing a futile kick in my direction exactly i finish dressing hang my jacket on a nail and run the kitchen faucet over my head why did goran want to kill you deacon hawks and spits on my floor blood i bit my tongue im going to track that crazy bitch down no doubt about that it was because of faber right for some reason she didnt want faber investigated i dont care where she hides nobody takes a swing at ronelle deacon and gets away with it i clap my hands triumphantly ronelle well hello ronelle deacon scowls disgusted people call me ronnie good for the straights and the gays i nod ronnie yeah that would work cute or butch depends on how you look at it i dry my head gingerly zip my bag and throw it over my shoulder well ronnie you ready to cooperate you are a wanted man mcevoy surrender yourself into my custody and ill see what i can do come on you got a body in the trunk youre the only one who knows that and youre a fucking knife killer what kind of credibility do you have if i was as bent as goran used to be i bet i could come up with a scenario where you killed my partner and held me captive i am not liking the sound of that or the glint in deacons eyes when she says it i think ill turn you in and take my chances deacon shakes her head i dont believe you one of those bullets in gorans shoulder is yours maybe you killed connie delyne then you shot down the investigating officer i bet my superiors would go for that shes right so i say ronnie when youre right youre right you got it daniel all i need to do is put a bullet in your brain and then cry at gorans funeral she sneers daniel like its a fake name that might fool others but it wont fool ronelle deacon you cry id pay money to see that you already saw it asshole the lady is right again last night coming in the door there were tears on deacons cheeks youre not going to kill me ronnie she shrugs not without a gun unless you want to fight like a man i gave up being macho for new years bad for my health pussy no thanks i turn my back on the exchange because its giving me a headache and duck into the bathroom to use the facilities and check my hat i talk while i work heres the plan ronnie im going to stash your car somewhere safe you know the one with the dead detective covered in trace in the trunk im also taking your blouse with the blood spatter that im sure the forensics guys can read like a book then im coming back here and we can work this out you want a career and i want you to have a career blackmailing motherfucker deacon calls from behind the sofa maybe i should just throw you out the goddamn window you could land on the car bring it on doll head my headache spikes behind one eye even at a time like this people will not lay off the scalp i have had transplants if you must know i say a little touchy striding into the living area this bald thing is temporary deacon is standing by the window cuffs on the floor her gun in one hand mine in the other for you dan she says everything is temporary if i had the time and the flexibility i would kick myself in the arse not a glancing blow either you had a key on the memory bracelet right deacon smiles like a wolf thats right one of my fondest memories is a little handcuff session a couple of years ago now take your hand out of your pocket kneel down and say please please dont shoot me in the balls detective deacon i give her my best doorman dead eyes i only kneel before the baby jesus on christmas morning i glance over her shoulder why dont you ask my friend deacon closes one eye like she needs to take careful aim yeah sure ill ask the guy behind me kneel the fuck down mcevoy i press the remote button in my hand and the window buzzes open swatting the detective on the butt deacon puts three shots into the pane and im out the door before the glass stops tinkling i have a tensecond head start and i can add a couple of minutes to that unless deacon is crazy enough to chase me half naked better pick up the pace chapter army basic is a lot like school you learn a lot of junk that you wont ever need and miss out on stuff that could save your life ive been cracking heads for twentyfive years now and not once did spitshined shoes or a shipshape locker give me an edge some people learn the hard way that life lessons are the valuable ones like a certain shortlived private edgar english who checked his steyer for blockages by squinting down the barrel others are lucky enough to survive the lesson and bank the information i know because i was that student of the bleeding obvious during my second tour one desertdry evening tommy fletcher and i were leapfrogging ahead of our patrol in the village of haddataha when we were cut off by sniper fire suddenly the air was alive with buzzing shimmering missiles metal sparked against metal and chunks of building rained on our shoulders jaded old men played backgammon on their steps barely pausing to watch the intruders get shot at while i wasted time spouting military jargon and making hand signals tommy put his elbow through the window of the nearest car and twisted the ignition tumbler with his bayonet thirty seconds later we were safe in the ranks of the un peacekeepers and you can bet your grandmas medical insurance that the first thing i did when my heart slowed down was learn how to start a car i dont have papers for different time same strategy i would make my getaway in deacons car bringing the evidence with me and leaving the detective without a ride i take the steps three at a time to the street and it doesnt take a genius to spot deacons unmarked cruiser virtually abandoned in the vicinity of the kerb for a start theres a police on duty card on the dash then theres the fact that i followed this crate around cloisters on a bicycle not twelve hours since but the major clue is the trail of blood leading from the popped trunk smear pool smear is the pattern someone crawled then rested then crawled gorans alive says ghost zeb in a prince vultan voice a cop leaking outside my apartment deacon will have me on death row for this i check the trunk to be certain that goran isnt in there but the only thing i find is an in out burger carton run aground on a metal ridge in the congealing crimson lake no one with that much blood on the outside of their body is crawling very far what did you do mcevoy deacon is beside me her coat belted tightly at the waist pallor shines beneath her dark skin like a ghost behind a window not me i say i just got here deacon jams her weapon into my kneecap and i can see shes got the hobble word on her mind again there are people on the street i point out but shes beyond caring enough of this i grab the gun and twist it clean out of deacons hands a move every doorman knows well oh yeah says the detective and i glance down to see a small snubnose tickling my kidney her ankle gun cobra maybe this is insane i need to eat something and sleep some more a massage would be nice and i hear body wraps are good its just gone sunrise and im wrestling a blue on the front porch you cant just shoot me deacon the detective shrugs fuck it mcevoy im just staying alive until someone kills me i know this fatalism well there were nights in the lebanon when death and life held more or less the same appeal we need to find goran ronelle its the only way out of the tunnel deacon dips a painted nail in the blood i put a full clip into her she says staring at her fingertip i carried a survivor out of a bomb crater once and saw another guy killed by a bee sting you never know jesus christ mcevoy says deacon snapped out of it by my dimestore philosophising bee sting you on some kind of drugs any more crap about bees and i will put a slug into you this is the ronelle i am comfortable with the blood trail meanders across the street along the kerb for a couple of gouts then down a basement stairwell deacon snatches her gun from my hand what do you think hawkeye she at the bottom of the stairwell or maybe all that blood is from some guy with a bee sting i am comfortable with this ronelle thats not the same thing as happy a street sweeper trundles around the corner from cruz avenue its twin revolving brushes scraping the surface of last nights leftovers we watch the bristles turn red as the sweeper ploughs heedlessly through gorans tracks the drivers forehead smudges the glass and he looks like he would need a defibrillator to get him noticing anything christ says deacon and i notice the blood on her bare legs we splash through the street sweepers backwash to the stairwell deacon swings herself around a lamppost her coat balloons and i realise she has underwear and a shoulder holster on under there and nothing more something occurs to me careful detective too late a bullet punches into the lamppost sending a church bell bong along its shaft i pull deacon away from the stairwell did you bother to disarm your partner she was dead why disarm her detective deacon is the kind of person who would argue with st peter obviously she is not as dead as you thought deacon gets a twohanded grip on her automatic this is good if i can take her alive she can put me in the clear ish the trunk bit could take some explaining call it in then with what the spy radio in my panties a mailman runs past us shouting into his radio effectively doing the calling in for us we have about three minutes before this place is swarming with police i lie on my stomach wiggling my fingers at deacon gimme the cobra deacon looks at me as though im asking her to donate a kidney give you the what youve read my file ronelle this is what i do deacon slaps the gun against my chest like its a subpoena make sure you shoot the right cop i dont respond all this wisecracking is more exhausting than the gunplay my subconscious flicks through my memories for an appropriate lebanon flashback but i force that kaleidoscope of mayhem back down now is not the time for dwelling in the past it would be a shame to take a bullet in the head because i was reliving operation green line the basement stairways on my block are pretty uniform castiron railing eight steps down and a midget door wedged into a concrete alcove these nooks were not built for someone of my size i grab a rail and drag myself along the pavement shirt rasping against the slabs there is noise below laboured breathing and rustling of material i sense that goran is nearly done but it doesnt take much energy to pull a trigger one last time ive seen guys fight for half a day fuelled by nothing more than bile i screw my eye socket into the tiny wedge of space between the railing and the pavement deacon tugs on my pants what do you see i see a leg just one the other ones bent back i think she fell down those last few steps good you see a weapon i wiggle forward another inch gorans hand is flapping like a fish out of water her gun glints just out of reach dropped it lets go i scramble to my feet but deacon is up before me elbowing past to the first step shes fast but not fast enough there is just time to register an impression of gorans battered and bloody frame slumped like a broken mannequin when the door behind her opens an extremely hairy pair of hands reaches out grabs goran by the shoulders and hauls her inside shes gone in a second like she was never there the door slams and bolts are shot you see those hands says deacon stunned like goddamn monkey hands can you believe that i push past her and knuckle the door its steelreinforced get it open mcevoy use some military trickery i try to trick the door with my shoulder the central panel buckles and wobbles but does not give got an oxyacetylene torch tucked into your underwear beside that spy radio ronelle im thinking of a word mcevoy hobble you remember that one we dont have time for this cloisters is a small place and shots fired is big news half the police force will be landing on this block any second and i dont think now is a good time for armed company so are you waiting for backup deacon thinks aloud i cant wait i need to follow the monkey hands youre getting in deeper ronnie every step you take makes it harder to go back deacon has a look in her eyes like shes squinting at the horizon were getting in deeper mcevoy us okay were on a tangled road now but it could straighten out im not the only dimestore philosopher in the group yeah with a couple of bee stings maybe once again its the bee stings that bring deacon back screw you daniel we gotta get out of here i need goran alive without her im finished on the force she stares into my eyes and i glimpse a hopeful expression i havent seen before makes her seem at least ten years younger if i bring goran in and you make a statement i could salvage something out of this shitty day theyll bounce me back to uniform sure maybe even make me take some psych sessions but i can stay on the force my palm is resting on the reinforced door throughout this speech and i feel a sudden shock wave run through my fingers as vibration from the building transfers through the surface door slam theyre out the back door to a hospital maybe it must be faber whos behind this and i sincerely doubt they took her to a hospital deacon smiles and i am reminded of a wolf that tracked me through the loup valley once they gotta believe were on their tails she says thoughtfully i see where shes going so maybe theyll drive around a bit except we know where theyre going maybe so we can get there before them big maybe deacon lopes up the stairs big maybe she agrees ive survived worse odds than that deacon makes me sit in the back seat on the drive across town which is completely ridiculous as im not under arrest and its not even a secure cruiser theres no mesh and if i had a mind to i could probably get at the shotgun cradled under the passenger seat i dont have a mind to instead i use the short trip to grab a little shuteye power napping doesnt usually work for me if i nod off for ten minutes during sunlight hours im groggy for the rest of the day but in this instance i have no choice in spite of the few hours sleep in the apartment i am so exhausted it feels like my eyes are bleeding daniel mcevoy is not as young as he used to be true as god deacon is driving faster than she should drawing attention to herself but i dont mind all the bouncing is rocking me to sleep even the drone of her voice stringing together long and complicated litanies of swear words is soothing i slide down on the back seat cradling my head in the safety belt which smells of marijuana my thoughts are just dissolving into dreams when macey barretts phone rings in my pocket the damn thing is leaking radiation into my ear before i think to check caller id hmmph i blurt sleepily you bloody awol asshole hmmph i say again not sure whats going on exactly the military term messing with my reality are you stoned you prick i warned you about that no not stoned major just dog tired the voice is not happy with this what the hell did you call me barrett major are you trying to be fucking funny ghost zeb decides to help me out come on dan whose cell phone is this and suddenly im awake this is barretts phone and thats obviously irish mike on the other end yeah i say thats it im trying to be funny as per usual mikey boy mikey boy mikey boy too much intimacy were not that close i take it silence for a moment then who the hell is this put macey on deacon clicks her fingers to attract my attention here we go she says all business as though were off to meet our accountant i glance out the window the brass ring is closed for business at this ungodly time of the morning but i bet therell be business going on inside just the same i remember fabers benz from the previous days stakeout and see it parked across the road which pretty much confirms we came to the right place hello shouts irish mike who is this its me your close associate i reply deadpan hoping the fbi are listening what do you want to talk about mike the murders the drugs or the prostitution irish mike is suddenly sweetness itself i dont know what youre talking about mister actually im betting this is a wrong number nooo i say i recognise your number michael madden i put you on my speed dial when we were in brooklyn setting up the cocaine pipeline remember irish mike hangs up the brass ring has doormen to stop undesirables getting in whereas slotz has doormen to eject the undesirables as soon as theyve blown their wad its hard to understand why a man like jaryd faber would spend five seconds in vics seedy den when hes obviously top dog in this place maybe ill ask him before i shoot him the club is locked down tighter than a nuclear bunker during the zombie riots the media seems to feel are more or less inevitable with steel blinds rolled down over the door and windows and not one but two alarm boxes bolted to the wall deacon puts the police mobile in neutral and we spend a quiet moment sizing up the joint while we are sizing up i wedge my bundles of cash down behind the cruisers back seat it would prey on my immortal soul if faber shot me and stole my money pretty impregnable ronelle admits finally i dont know if we can take this place down not going through the front door but theyre not going through the front door not with a bleeding cop in the back seat deacon nods slowly some of her gusto has drained away maybe the truth of this situation is dawning on her ie shes chasing a wounded officer into a fortified club with only a murder suspect for backup the uncomplicated days of being a detective must seem like a rosy dream okay so we go around back we i really think now is the time for you to call the cavalry faber will soon have a dying cop in there if he hasnt got one already nobody will believe a word he says with any luck hell get himself killed during the raid deacon pouts stubbornly no the first thing faber will do when he hears a siren is put the final nail in gorans coffin and when i say nail i mean bullet and when i say coffin i mean head i need to wrap this up myself be my guest i thought you had a stake in this didnt this asshole kill your girlfriend this is true and i had pushed it to the back of my mind but even a reference to connie sets my blood boiling okay we go around back but let me have the shotgun not happening i hold up the little cobra i am not entering a building with this toy i can barely get my finger through the trigger guard we glare at each other like kids with trading cards until deacon makes an offer ive got a blade good for you why dont you throw it at the men with guns ill take the cobra and the pump you take my smith and wesson any clips two on the holster this is not a bad deal what about the blade you going to use it deacon rolls her eyes pulling an ivoryhandled flick knife from its home behind the sun visor anything else mcevoy you want my brassiere too i mull this over what size are the cups theres only one obvious way around back and thats down the same alley where deacon put half a dozen bullets into her partner ronelle moves quickly keeping her eyes off the crushed bumshack picking her way through the black pennies of blood then she changes her strategy returns to the shack pulls her gun and acts out the shooting again in total silence im dealing with it she explains grudgingly due to the fact that im looking over her shoulder by doing it again i dilute the act making it less powerful ah i say freud john wayne gacy i must look shocked because deacon half grins kidding dr phil okay thats much better i bet you wish you were diluting the act with shoes on deacon nods dr phil didnt mention that there is a small parking lot at the rear of the club which services three or four service entrances for adjacent or opposite businesses i spot two restaurants and a pet shop that is receiving a shipment of canaries the little birds sing when their crates are moved a cacophony of shrill panic thats how i feel i comment to deacon strategically exposing a sensitive facet of my character that dr simon once assured me would encourage a desire to bond thats how you sound too bitch says the detective who obviously hasnt read simons article the brass ring opens on to the north corner of the parking lot and there is a guy at the door checking cars every five seconds looking like he would dearly love to strangle every one of the canaries they havent arrived yet i deduce crouching behind a green recycling dumpster that smells like smoothies and reminds me that i havent eaten that guy is nervous look at him sucking on his cigarette like his life depends on it theyve called ahead but theyre not here yet i concur sherlock says deacon squatting beside me look at that moron jumpier than bambi all you doormen got patience issues all us doormen i bet we look the same to deacon i have an idea deacon does not clap delightedly or otherwise seem impressed you have an idea thats what my ex said after he tore the last rubber in the pack this is one of those times when i do not want to know what happened next i sulk a little until deacons curiosity gets the better of her okay you enormous baby dazzle me so i tell her my plan which sounds stupid when you say it out loud but all deacon says is who gets to do the hurtin which makes me wonder just how much of a police officer is left inside this woman which reminds me of an old joke that has no place in the modern world except perhaps in county sligo where they love a good misogynism i stamp on the dumpster brake and put my weight on the push bar it lurches forward easily lighter than i expected plastic and cardboard only mostly the lot is busy now with staff arriving for work and the pet guys humping birds into the store there are a lot of cars for the doorman to keep his eye on the dumpster trundles noisily across the lot and i graze a parked truck to make sure the doorman picks up on my approach yeah a big green dumpster says zeb i think he might pick up on that oh youre back i never went away and i will never go away unless you find me the doorman spots my head and shoulders bobbing behind the dumpster hey trash man get off the fucking ramp okay i got a car coming in i shout over the tweeting come on guy how many times i gotta tell you people i am a recycling engineer not a trash man ghost zeb chuckles nice build your character build my character what are you al pacino now i could give a fuck what you call yourself get off the ramp or maybe you want me to tear one of your ears off thats a real specific threat i say trundling closer sounds like you might actually do that doorman is proud thats my thing specific threats people dont believe the vague stuff but you go specific on their asses then its a whole different thing i stamp on the dumpster brake so it doesnt slide back down the ramp i get it specific like im gonna open this lid and a big pissedoff cop is gonna put your lights out with the butt of her shotgun doorman chews this over thats a little bit overkill you know too much information by the time i get through digesting that shit is long over precisely i say in my moriarty voice huh says doorman private joke i say then pull the lever deacon pops up and puts doormans lights out with the butt of her shotgun so now doorman is in the dumpster with deacon and im the new doorman when they come with goran me and deacon are going to take the car simple as that two of us ready for action maximum four of them not expecting trouble it should be stressful but easy unless someone comes to check on you says ghost zeb ever the pessimist okay there is that and so long as faber is not in the car he knows your face point taken now can you let me watch the lot and lets not forget the possibility that goran called someone else not faber you could be in the wrong part of town this is a depressing thought and more plausible than hairy hands and goran actually turning up here the doorway is a pretty typical delivery entrance set atop a concrete ramp and flanked by reinforced double doors from the corridor behind emanate various kitchen sounds and smells as the staff get the food started for the lunch trade and from somewhere in the bowels comes the dull thump thump of a dance tracks bass line a big screen over the bar im guessing a couple of kitchen workers pass me with barely a grunt shoulders hunched against the chill cigarette smoke trailing behind them like morning mist a black benz with smoked passenger windows pulls into the lot doing about thirty mph more than it should be the car whacks its underside on the ramp shunting the dumpster across the asphalt i see hairy hands gripping the passenger dash the dumpsters wheels snag on the kerb sending doorman and deacon flying through the air like a couple of superheroes i swear deacon manages to throw me a recriminating look before she crashes through the windscreen of a parked chevy doorman lands nice and neat in the rear of the pet van sending out an oomph of yellow canaries i am stunned so much for stressful but easy canaries come on are there cameras rolling somewhere my great plan is completely blown the car was supposed to stop short of the ramp because of the great big green dumpster blocking the entrance then gorans rescuersabductors would be forced to either move the dumpster or carry their wounded cop to the club door while they were thus engaged deacon would do her hellcat jackinthebox bit and i would come in from the flank now however deacon is folded into the front seat of a chevy and there are four big men getting out of hairy hands car think soldier improvise the lot is in chaos now screeching birds everywhere flapping and launching salvoes of shite a couple of pet shop guys with nets calling to the canaries like birds speak english car alarms screeching big men shouting at each other and then here i am standing like a stone pillar move save deacon at least i must admit it does cross my mind to fade into the background and save myself much heartache and possibly ballache too but the notion fades fast and i find myself drawing the smith and wesson and sizing up the competition drop hairy hands first i reckon he was the one who rescued goran and he gets to sit in front plus he has the most expensive sunglasses alpha male without a doubt i put a shot into hairy hands elbow an accident i was aiming for the shoulder but this gun is new to me the elbow is gonna take years to heal up maybe later ill light a candle for this guy for now i have his two friends to worry about in about a second hairy hands buddies are going to figure out that i am not the house doorman maybe half a second if theyre not as stupid as they look i get a couple of steps down the ramp when i feel twin jabs in my neck either ive been bitten by the worlds smallest vampire or those jabs were the darts from an electric stun gun high voltage sings ghost zeb rock and roll then fifty thousand volts shoot down my spine and send me jittering down that ramp like a monkey with rock and roll in his soul acdc i think highway to hell too easy theres bacon frying somewhere i can hear it popping in the pan its a cruel thing to fry bacon near a man and not let him taste it i swear i can smell salsa too or something tangy and i am so goddamn hungry garibaldi biscuits the french soldiers at the offbase observation posts always had garibaldi biscuits they charged outrageous prices for them but i generally paid those guys had the best field rations stew lasagne casserole topped off with a cool gitane i can smell all of those dishes now and i hang around on the fringe of alertness savouring the memories eventually the dreams evaporate and i come back into consciousness on the tail end of the notion i went out on vampire i shout straining to jump out of the chair i am taped to keerist almighty says a familiar annoying voice vampire that taser must have scrambled your brain fella im awake now but i feel like a brittle husk as if the stun gun hollowed me out i cough and spit out what feels like a lump of coal im surprised not to be breathing fire faber is bent over hands on knees two feet away faber you prick you know me cop do i know you my eyes are heavy and full of sand but i force myself to blink until my surroundings sharpen up im in a kitchen highclass place all stainless steel and marble worktops theres bacon in the pan thank god that means im not having a stroke my weapons are gone and in spite of the situation i muster a little selfcongratulation for stashing my cash faber i am starving honestly man those stun guns take it out of a person you think i could have a blt even just a b this freaks faber out and he does a little dance clicking and pointing trying to remember where hes seen me i use the time to absorb as much of the room as i can six people that i can see faber dancing his ginger jig dressed in something else from his wardrobe of anachronisms looks like a beige mohair suit with honesttogod flares and captain kirk boots who the hell is this guys stylist engelbert humperdinck three of his guys are ranged behind him jackets off sleeves rolled up ready to do business one new one must be the stun gun guy deacon out cold taped to what i presume is a meat gurney like some lab experiment and goran shivering on the floor a pool of her watery blood shining on the concrete stop pointing at me man or so help me faber does a twofingered point to show me whos in charge the doorman daniel in slotz with that hostess thats right connie you remember her something in my voice makes faber take a few steps back he puts one of his guys between him and me yeah he smirks i remember her someone punched her ticket thats what i hear you ask me she got what she deserved i consider throwing a fit straining against my bonds and cursing fabers seed breed and generation but i was once a professional soldier and i know any display would only serve to amuse my captors so i take a few deep breaths and apparently calm myself we all get what we deserve faber in the end faber steps from behind his mans bulk really you think so doorman i deserve my drugs and because of you i cant get them okay were about to get to the nub of this whole affair there are drugs involved goran was obviously involved with these drugs thinking about goran i glance over at her she has stopped shivering and is staring at a point in the air im guessing she sees angels your pet cop is in a little discomfort faber doesnt even look screw her he says waving dismissively she aint getting up youre a sweet guy faber i bet your wife tells you that every night after you fill her in on your day dead hostesses bleeding cops and whatnot faber helps himself to some bacon patting it down with a square of kitchen paper what happened dan did you maybe see a movie where the good guy is a smartass and gets to live he rolls the bacon strip and chews it thats not how it works outside your shithole club okay you had the muscle in slotz but not here i have to ask so i say i gotta ask faber what the hell are you doing in slotz this is a nice place youve got here smells good even in the kitchen i havent seen a single roach for chrissakes im playing for time a little with this kind of small talk but i would genuinely like to know faber is prepared to give me a moment so long as he gets to talk about himself thats an interesting question daniel and i get where youre coming from you look at me wearing a suit thats worth more than you make in a year i order my face not to react and you ask yourself whats a successful classy guy like mister faber doing in a shithole like slotz thats pretty much it i say thinking that maybe im overplaying the straight face faber checks the buttons on his waistcoat the thing is doorman dan all day im eating lobster with judges and drinking dom with millionaires and sometimes when the day is done i feel like getting down and dirty you know what i mean i nod obligingly well it doesnt get much more down and dirty than slotz yessir vic is quite a character hes the boss the attorney works up the courage to step closer here im the boss this mood swing is driven home with a backhanded slap across my face i roll my head with the blow but honestly i neednt have bothered i spit on the floor no blood just spit what do you want from me faber how come im not dead youre not dead dan because i need to know what you know says faber jiggling his glasses for some reason maybe its supposed to signify that these spectacles can see into my soul about what these drugs that you cant get keep going doorman goran used to get your drugs you two had some kind of scam going and we have a winner give that prick a cigar i feel utterly screwed somehow up to this point i had managed to nurture a spark of optimism ive been in worse scrapes that sort of thing but now with gorans eyes filming and deacon strapped to the gurney i am suddenly devastated the steel and concrete are too real and the walls are closing in i dont know anything faber im only here because of the girl faber teases his styrofoam hair with greasy fingers what girl take your pick you got one dead one more or less dead and one on the gurney what the stripper thats why you put the cops on to me she was murdered and its hostess you think i killed her i know you killed her arsehole faber paces the kitchen counting off points on his fingers so you tip deacon about my fight with connie i freak because of this deal we have tonight deacon gets suspicious and goran makes an onthespot decision to whack her which doesnt work out then deacons whacking also falls a little short so goran calls me to come get her faber is filling in a lot of blanks here obviously at this point he doesnt care what i know which is never good being filled in is okay when youre a kid and you need basic information about numbers and poisonous foods and such but in my world knowledge gets a person dead quicker than anthrax i had a shootout with your boys right outside the door i point out to the pointer the cops are going to find us soon faber is delighted by this observation presumably because its way off base no cops my friend i own a lot of property including this entire lot and the basement where we picked up goran the attorney squats to think quietly no he says finally knees creaking as he stands i cant think of a way out the three of you need to die its tough about the product but you know sometimes you gotta eat losses you cant just let a statement like this fade without argument wait a second faber you have heavies cant they get your product i dont use words like product or heavies they sound d coming out of my mouth i half expect them to plop in cardboard letters to the floor faber chuckles like hes fond of me what these dummies i wouldnt let them pick up my mail no offence guys this whole thing is too complicated without goran the dummies shrug amiably no offence taken faber pats his pockets looking for something or maybe hes just twitchy this is a big step for me cop killing theres no going back after this the attorney seems genuinely worried but i feel its more a logistics thing than anything to do with a conscience which riles me enough to comment kill a hostess though thats okay no foul as far as youre concerned connie had two kids faber can you get off that please sighs faber youve got a couple of minutes left use it well why not beg for your life you beg for yours faber does this weird little tap dance with a tadah at the end which his dummies actually applaud this whole fakeratpack thing has gotta be unhealthy simon would get a couple of chapters out of the guy okay sir says faber like im in the front row of his show i would like you to know that i regret the whole slotz thing something about that sleazy shithole dump appeals to me and i never wanted to blot my card there theres a lot to be said for getting a cheap blow job at the end of the day without bumping into the mayor im not apologising again it would be a bit rich in the circumstances but i do regret the incident thats all im saying apologising again i dont remember the first time so im gonna have you three killed i feel okay about that now but i suppose ill probably lose some sleep over the years a single silenced gunshot pops like a smoker coughing into his fist goran spasms then lies still faber squeaks with fright then recovers himself what the hell he shouts actually stamping a foot never when im in the room how many goddamn times if i dont see it then it didnt happen it happened it definitely happened maybe goran was dying but now shes dead sorry mister faber mumbles the shooter wont do it again fabers pointing finger is a fan i know you wont i know you fucking wont wilbur wilbur i cant hold in a chuckle after all this time done in by a wilbur wilbur shoots me a venomous look can i kill him first mister faber of course you can just wait until until youre outside the door very good when you hear it click then fire away get rid of the bodies at the smelter smelter a word like that makes everything real all of a sudden so practical hey faber the attorney waves me away too late daniel i have to be in court in an hour as the judge might say your appeal is denied tell him you can get his drugs suggests ghost zeb faber has his hand on the doorknob i can get your drugs i say i suppose you could say i blurt the words a bit more squeak in the promise than id like the attorney steps slowly away from the door as if a sudden movement could make the knob go click say that again daniel a fly zapper on the wall sparks as some poor insect gets too close to the light i said i can get your product faber drags a chair across the concrete floor and sits himself down facing me i suppose it couldnt hurt to talk chapter so now ive got this thing under the leg of my jeans a security bracelet faber called it quite popular with the celebs feels like theres a mutant beetle clamped on to my ankle waiting to sink its teeth or claws or whatever weapons a mutant beetle might possess into my fibula its a clever little machine no doubt about it im surprised theyve even got stuff like this outside the pages of a scifi novel faber took great glee from explaining its workings to me he came across like a technofool who knows how this one thing works and bores the bejasus out of everyone passing on his snippet of knowhow so what we have here daniel is a little electronic insurance policy judge friend of mine gave it to me in payment for my opinion on a statutory case he was eh involved in homeland are already using them and theres a strong lobby to snap them on us parolees too given the percentage of repeat offenders yeah spare me the lecture faber i said playing it cool okay let me give you the specs its tamperproof naturally theres a sensor on there that monitors pulse and blood pressure its got gps that feeds into my laptop so we know exactly what building youre in at any time you nip into the john for a quick dump and the bracelet picks up the splash but heres the bit i really love i can remotely inflict electromuscular disruption if you aint doing what youre supposed to be doing where youre supposed to be doing it or to give you the doorman version i can zap enough voltage up your ass to make you shit your pants this thing makes the taser shock seem like a tickle with a feather and then faber gave me a little taste just to show me he wasnt kidding felt like he popped my brain into a blender by the time it was over i was giving serious consideration to the aforementioned pantsshitting so now i am fabers boy hes got the key to my heart rate i spend a minute trying to think of some way to screw with him but its a foolproof system and so i settle down in my seat at the back of the new york bus and try to grab a little sleep maybe a low heart rate will fool faber into thinking im dead i cross my ankles over the canvas bag at my feet at least fabers plan involved me catching a bus so i got to collect my weapons and drop off my cash after i had picked it up from the cruiser it takes most of the day to get out to farmington from new york first a train to new haven from manhattan then a transit bus it might speed things up a bit if the driver didnt stop at every corner in long island on the way seems like everyone knows his name except me i dont know why im fuming its not like im in any great hurry to get where im going plus the rocking motion should help me to digest the sack of taco bell i bought at grand central i wolfed it down a little quick my first proper meal in over twentyfour hours when youre having a crappy week nothing comforts like taco bell i have to admit standing there under grand centrals famous vaulted ceiling i did think about nipping to the rest room sticking my foot down a toilet and putting a few rounds into the bracelet how tough can this thing be ghost zeb reasoned eager to have me back on his own case while i was mulling this over faber gave me an almost psychic call on macey barretts cell which i told him was my phone so heres the thing dan he said and i could almost hear the air part as he jabbed a finger at his mouthpiece sometimes distance makes people brave they start thinking like its traditional warfare and they can run away before you give in to that impulse i got some information a chivalrous guy like yourself should have chivalrous does everyone know my weak spot yeah whats that counsellor your lady friend the cop on the trolley if i dont hear from you by nightfall she goes in the freezer we just wheel her right in there and once in shes not coming out i had a plate bolted over the safety latch after that i set my dogs on you you shot the cops and my bodyguards shot you simple looks like chivalry might soon be dead along with detective deacon the bodies just keep stacking up like sandbags i spend a futile moment wishing that things were normal again if this were a normal week i would be meeting zeb for karaoke later the little mensch loves the karaoke bar barry manilow is his speciality if you can believe that oh mandy you came and i came you were fakin i think he might have screwed up the words a little karaoke says ghost zeb into his sleeve the way he does when hes in one of his moods not likely since you abandoned the search for me to save princess supercop im as good as dead dont be like that i havent abandoned you but im on the clock with deacon theyre going to ice her man that makes two of us says ghost zeb why dont you do something about my problem since youre just sitting there have you even thought of a plan yet i roll my eyes which must look strange to the old lady in the seat opposite giving me the glare treatment im a little preoccupied at the moment not so preoccupied that your brain doesnt have a few spare cells to conjure me up okay okay i have been thinking about this as you perfectly well know let me make a call make your call judas hey judas wasnt irish just make the call one call then im back on deacon it takes me a minute to remember corporal tommy fletchers number i punch it in carefully big fingers little buttons from what i hear irish mike madden has family in ireland maybe tommy can do a little recon get us some leverage its a start i suppose says zeb unwilling to give up his sulk but dont think youre off the hook if you dont find the real me im gonna move into your temporal lobe permanently great another ultimatum just what i need tommy answers when im on the point of hanging up what the fuck he says instead of plain old hello which is a pretty standard opener for corporal fletcher as far as i remember is that any way to talk to your sergeant i ask half smiling in spite of the whirlwind of crap spinning around me im not in the army no more grumbles tommy especially not at four in the bloody morning i got a headache and its nearly bedtime tommy draws a sharp breath as he realises who hes talking to daniel dan fucking mcevoy is that the big jackeen himself thats sergeant mcevoy to you fletcher danny brother are you in country we gotta party we gotta go crazy man you ever see a onelegged man dance so where are you sarge im overseas corporal still knocking heads a few thats why im calling something i can help you with tommy always caught on fast i have a little recon mission for you if youre up to it there is an uncomfortable silence then tommy mumbles thing is dan i dont really do that kind of thing any more i got kids now i feel bad forget i mentioned it tommy i didnt realise tommy cackles just screwing with you sarge course im up for it no killing gypsies though i had a curse put on me no gypsicide honest i just need you to trace the roots of a certain family tree what find a few people but be careful they have dangerous relatives tommy is unimpressed shit my brother has a dangerous relative who do you need me to find i give tommy the details and he promises to get back to me asafp i never wanted a phone before but im starting to realise how convenient they are irish mike is paying for the call too chuckles zeb coming out of his funk nice touch i must have chuckled too because now the old lady opposite is showing me her can of mace its early evening by the time i finally get where im going in farmington this is not the sort of place doormen are usually required the entire avenue is so wholesome and autumnal that it reminds me of ireland even in these circumstances i can feel the first lilting twinges of the immigrant gene kicking in farmington is even nicer than cloisters far too nice you would think to have a criminal underbelly but as i found out only hours ago the farmington criminal underbelly is doing quite well on this avenue especially i do the last mile from the bus stop on foot humping the weapons bag and find a bench to rest my weary frame while i finish off my big bell box meal the spicy food reminds me of monterrey and i cant help wondering how fast i could get there yeah thats right amigo pack up and leave me to rot calm down i called tommy didnt i wheels are in motion now piss off and let me think you think too much you need to get out of your head and into the real world irony must be so i sit on the bench reining in my aura trying to look like a member of the community and not an exarmy doorman sent to rip off a steroid lab i chew my burrito awhile and grudgingly admit that faber and goran had a sweet deal figured back in cloisters faber got a little teary spelling it out as an attorney in the city i represent a lot of drug people i get to know them they fill me in on every detail of their operation and armed with this information i get them off most of the time i remember making myself pay attention even though half my brain cells were fried from the anklet jolt and the rest were threatening to break apart and liquefy so a year goes by maybe eighteen months these guys have forgotten all about their natty attorney when one of their labs gets busted by the cops first through the door is my dead friend detective goran followed closely by a few of my own humps all rigged out in dea armour and helmets they secure the bad guys load the drugs into the van and thats all she wrote our fake police squad drives away leaving the rippedoff drug merchants hogtied with plasticuffs sometimes we load a couple in the van for show then toss em a few blocks later he leaned back on his heels waiting for me to think it through appreciate his genius which i did so the theft is never reported what are they gonna say is that the police id like to report that you people stole my drugs dont think so and you got a buyer i represent a lot of drug guys they figure im brokering for another client that was pretty good so i said thats pretty goddamn good jaryd faber couldnt help preening why thank you daniel but now youre screwed because your pet detective is dead pet detective says gz nice and im guessing goran wasnt stupid enough to let you keep the riot gear correct goran headed up operations in the field i did the planning its a good plan sweet the kids might say again thank you but much as i appreciate your appreciation i need more than that before i let you go after my package in ireland going after a guys package means grabbing him by the balls i think faber is talking about his drugs again you read my file no any good bits i have a special skill set any of those skills relevant shit faber if your package was in fallujah i could extract it faber licked his lips extract he liked that bit of military it begins with an f but it aint fallujah ten minutes later faber had deacons computer on his knee and was scrolling my file keerist almighty daniel this reads good you kill anyone over there only the ones that died whats in this for me faber if im gonna be a criminal i might as well get paid i figured if anyone could understand greed it would be a lawyer you get my package and ill give you fifty grand plus your life back he was lying and we both knew it what we didnt know was if the other person knew we knew it what are you six okay faber you got a deal cut me loose and give me the details faber called one of his boys over gave him a set of keys and a few whispered instructions not just yet daniel i need to make an impression on you first show you what a dead serious kinda guy i am one more taste of electromuscular disruption should do it the house im watching is straight out of the opening credits of a suburban sitcom according to what tv tells us there should be an overweight dad a foxy mom couple of smartarse kids and maybe an inlaw down the basement work in a couple of catchphrases like sheesh ma or none of you people get me and next thing you know its season nine and dvd box sets are topping the charts this is the last place youd expect to find a steroid lab nevertheless according to faber this is exactly where i will find one and a lotta security he said state of the art these guys dont skimp faber is not risking any of his guys on this run so im on my own no fake police backup a pity as according to faber goran had put together quite the strike force probars oneman battering rams the whole kit and caboodle think of it as a test daniel you bring home the goods and maybe next time i let you take out some of the boys i should call the fbi thats what i should do but once the feds become involved the bestcase scenario is i live out my days in witness protection the worstcase is deacon freezes and i get life without parole so maybe i put newark on speed dial but i dont push the button just yet newark on speed dial your thoughts are beginning to sound american zeb is right ive been here too long i need a pint of guinness thats taken five minutes to pour and a date with a freckled redhead the house looks normal but i squint into the shadows and see camera domes suckered to the eaves laser eyes too on stalks in the garden the windows are small with decorative castiron bars and the door is painted to look wooden but im betting on steel spotlights on the lawn and roof complete the package this place is a subtle fortress theres no chance im fighting my way inside i circle around back which is not as easy as it sounds in modern americas paranoid suburbia the tendency is to shoot strangers first and ask questions later if at all there are stories on the news every day about garbage men getting plugged by panicked housewives just because they were speaking in some language that was not english sometimes thats their actual court defence he was round back of my house messing with my trash speaking terrorist talk what does he spect but i politicise luckily shadows are lengthening im wearing black and i have done this kind of thing before i nip through the adjoining yard all ready to lay someone out if i have to im hoping for a male i could live with socking some stocky gardener but a slip of a girl might be more than my beleaguered psyche will allow pull yourself together or youll start making mistakes yeah thats rich coming from a guy who once tossed back three shots of furniture polish after the club one night three shots before he noticed something wrong first decent crap i took in months says ghost zeb i make it around back through a bricked alley without having to relieve anyone of their senses and conceal myself in a cluster of evergreens i peep through branches to the bay window and see the empty lounge of an affluent suburban home with regulation eames recliner that is too expensive for the kids to ever sit in nice garden though i gotta say plenty of green nice wild feel to it without being neglected reminds me of oh please shut the hell up okay then i hear a sudden growling and i realise that theres a dog in the trees with me big bastard too im guessing by the way his breath is in my ear these are his trees and hes pissed i have maybe two seconds before he clamps his teeth around my face faber will notice a hell of a spike in my vitals then please not a rottweiler please not a rottweiler i look and theres a rottweiler two feet away from me his sharp head comically bewigged by soft green ferns hes got his lips pulled back over his incisors and his black eyeballs are on me like target lasers which kinda takes the comic out of it christ this is not right how much more shit can be piled on one person in a day the dog lunges and i roll back into the tree roots and shrubs with him clamping his snout with one hand i get a fistful of dog snot but at least those teeth are contained for the moment i reach down with the other hand and grab the dogs crotch congratulations its a boy screw squeamishness in the words of david byrne i aint got time for that now the dog is in my arms and hes wriggling like a sea creature out of water i can feel the animals fury testing my muscles to their limits branches snap around our heads and with the dusk falling its like a scene from a horror movie i half expect some masked creep to emerge from the alley with a mommy fixation and a carving knife i give the rottweilers balls a squeeze to get him good and angry then use every pound of strength i can muster to flip him over the garden fence i hear the thump and scrabble as he lands awkwardly next door then finds his paws this is not a move i had ever planned or run through in any of my justincase scenarios its kind of a spurofthemoment thing and could even work to my advantage go bonzo i broadcast at the dog give em hell next door the commotion is immediate bonzo rampages through the drug dens back garden looking for some throats to tear out im betting this particular dog is not used to being manhandled over a fence they say that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned but i would argue that a scorned woman would pale and back out of the room faced with a rottweiler who just got his scrotum twisted i peep over the fence next doors garden has roughly the same dimensions a rectangular lawn maybe twenty by thirty with various immature trees clustered at the end it also has a freshly laid rear driveway with a pickup reversed up to a back door which is obviously reinforced theres a guy on the door who doesnt know whether to give bonzo his toughguy face or shit his pants i may not be able to get myself into this house but maybe i can make whoever is in there come out to me the dog shakes his sleek head like hes disembowelling an imaginary rabbit then spots the guy at the door and decides to transfer my crimes to him his growl says i am going to eat you alive motherfucking ballsqueezer there isnt a man on this planet who isnt scared by a rottweiler coming at him with drool streaming out of his mouth i squat to rummage through the bag at my feet first i pop a couple of earplugs from their plastic envelope then i select a steyer bullpup assault rifle with a mm grenade launcher slung underneath the barrel and to think i almost didnt go for the launcher option but the dealer sold me on it hey dont take the launcher model what do i care but for a hundred bucks i can throw in two grenades a hundred bucks you telling me irish that you cant think of a single situation where a couple of grenades wouldnt come in handy i could think of a couple of situations this wasnt one of them flying dogs and grenades in the suburbs i stick my head over the fence and peer through the branches just in time to lipread the doormans fuck this and see him hurry in the back door he slams it half a second too late to stop the rottweiler making it inside that is a lucky bonus i was hoping for the dog outside at the door causing a distraction but inside the house itself should be carnage hopefully seconds later the consternation starts crashing tinkling shouts of surprise a couple of gunshots theyre thinking what the hell is going on where is this coming from pack up the shit pack it up first rule of any factory protect the product i pull the assault rifle into my shoulder and flick off the safety and instantly i am a soldier again its the click once the safety is off it is no longer a drill i strafe the roof knocking holes in the slates leaving beams exposed and severing the power lines if those guys dont have a generator in there surveillance is down even if they do i have a minute now theyre thinking gunfire its a raid we need to move out gunfire is one thing but explosions really light a fire under people i feed a grenade into the launcher close the slide and pull the secondary trigger sending a silver mm egg of explosives through a hole in the roof i hope no one was hiding their christmas presents up there the explosion is not hollywood big but its enough to reduce the attic space to so much firewood the sound wave makes reality jump a frame or two and a cloud of smoke and dust hang over the house a marker for the fire brigade thats all the destruction i need i stuff the assault rifle back into my magic bag and drop over the fence into enemy territory maybe their cameras are out maybe not either way i have to act the pickup crouches in the driveway like a wild beast a brandnew hilux with outsize wheels and probably a lot more than shop horsepower waiting under the hood this is the getaway vehicle no doubt about it any aggravation comes in the front door and the steroids go out the back in this beauty a guy comes on to the patio gun in one hand and keys in the other theres a stripe of blood across his arm and im thinking good boy bonzo and also rest in peace doggie i twist the wing mirror so i can follow whats happening then squat behind the hiluxs grille and give the situation a few seconds to develop maybe this guy has the steroids on him or maybe not a second man wheels out two large sealed plastic barrels on a drum caddy this guy is limping from a leg bite and im starting to feel sad for bonzo the men load both barrels into the flatbed grunting and cursing get the last barrel the first man shouts over the crackling flames billowing from the attic fuck that says junior guy i aint going back in there guy brandishes his weapon in a way that tells me he doesnt have a whole lot of guntime okay says junior guy hurriedly jesus bobby we just split a tuna melt it was a nice sandwich man and well always have that but im the supervisor and i gotta put the tuna aside so just get the barrel e bomb shit e bomb tiptoes back into the house in a way that makes me think that bonzo is still alive e bomb christ what have nicknames come to the problem is that these guys are inventing their own names no one christens themselves foureyes or shitbreath one guy back in dublin did six months for peeping tom offences guys called him windows now thats a nickname even though the house is under attack this guy is so focused on making sure there isnt a dog clamped to his arse that he never sees me coming i sneak around the drivers side punch him in the temple hard and catch his keys before they hit the ground i dont even need to take my slim jim out of the bag thanks bobby bobby bounces off the door belches then collapses to the drive i smell tuna i am amazed when he shakes his head and gets in a swing at me a good one that connects with my entire face i am going to be lit up like a pumpkin in the morning i am so pissed that i smack bobbys head against the fender maybe a little harder than i need to i beep the pickup with a toyota fob and jump inside slinging my bag of tricks into the passenger seat that punch hurt my knuckles maybe cracked one could be arthritis says ghost zeb rifling my repressed memories your father suffered from it one of the reasons he drank so he said didnt stop him beating on us the pickup starts on the first turn of the key i should bloody think so all the money those steroid manufacturers spent on it i yank the gear lever and floor the gas the only thing between me and the open road is a keycoded gate that looks like it has enough square bars to contain even the hilux which is why i veer left and go through the flimsy wooden fence morons i mean really what kind of a tool organised their security it only took one man and a mutt to reduce it to smithereens the last thing i see of the steroid house in my rearview mirror is bonzo loping out of the back door with a hank of something in his jaws good dog i think good dog chapter i try to stay focused on the drive back to jersey but the smooth ride is comforting and my mind begins to wander i keep saying that im not big on flashbacks but whenever my mind blurs the lebanon is always there sky filled with streaking rockets mangled shards of metal constantly raining from above everything was pockmarked by shrapnel everything mahoganyskinned old men on their stoops shooting the breeze like it was sameold sameold which it probably was i remember one french guy whose claim to fame was a dick the size of a baguette this boast was put to the test one day when we came across a dog fight arena and macey barretts phone rings and i nearly jump out of my skin when the car automatically picks up its bluetooth signal and transfers the call to the toyotas sound system daniel holy mary i blurt which is a pretty accurate impersonation of a christian brother i used to do back in the eighties still pops out every now and then in times of stress fabers laughter is distorted by the speaker for you im holy mary god jesus and the easter bunny all rolled into one i recover myself a little faber hows it hanging jaryd good day in court pointing the shit out of everything fabers not laughing now i point for emphasis thats all you point all the bloody time it doesnt mean anything you do it so much its like a tic im telling you faber thats why you never win anything at the tables silence for a moment all i can hear is the discreet growl of the engine and the asphalt joins bumping under the wheels the heartbeat of the road faber gets over his pointing sulk have you got the product two barrels of it i hope you have secure storage two fucking barrels where am i going to put two barrels hey i can dump one no problem no i can store it i wasnt expecting two barrels a briefcase maybe this is steroids faber not heroin there must be half a million doses here faber whistles those steroid guys really work for their money the markup would make a crack dealer piss himself laughing faber this wouldnt be you trying to weasel out of giving me my fifty large because if thats the case i can drive this truck to any one of a dozen people i know that would be a bad idea daniel tell me why arsehole so he tells me because your buddy deacon shes already gone in the freezer my stomach sinks okay dickhead you watch your little screen and youll see me coming i better see you coming fast its cold in that freezer i hate this guy and i wish he was dead fabers playing it cool but he must be sweating over his decision to send me for the steroids even with a monitor on my ankle im a wild card and he knows it greed made him hasty and now hes had an entire day to think about the possible consequences i bet that pointing monkey just cannot wait to roll me into the freezer beside ronelle and start peddling his steroids outside health clubs all over new jersey i drive slow keeping to the speed limit with the radio tuned to local travel news in case theres a pileup on the motorway i need to avoid accidents mean blues and this pickup screams drug money traffic is light and theres a sweeping mist scything past the streetlight beams all those little drops like half a million twinkling steroid pills i drive on without seeing a single cruiser in spite of our mayors roadsafety drive and in a couple of hours im back on good old i cruising past monolithic borders and pottery barns past giant empty parking lots and allnight diners i am envious of the people inside in their cocoon of light enjoying the simple pleasure of some late eggs or a coffee refill not that im hungry yet with the congealed lump of mexican takeaway melting slowly in my stomach acid christ when youre inside a diner you wanna be outside and when youre outside you wanna get back in what are you schizo im talking to you arent i by three thirty im bumping my tyres down the cloisters off ramp and swinging a wide arc into the bus station car park i have to look hard to find a young hood selling pot if you didnt know any better youd think this sleepy town had no hostesskilling lawyers living in it i cut across empty spaces in the car park and pull in behind the dumpsters beside a certain white lexus that i had hoped never to see again no doubt fabers computer will pick up this unscheduled stop but hes not going to risk shocking me now with all this junk in the trunk if he calls ill tell him im filling up at the twentyfourhour pumps it could be true long island is a long way from new jersey and the pumps are fifty feet away the engine is still ticking when faber calls i got my finger on the button here mcevoy come on boss i need gas i tell him five minutes delay maybe seven if i grab a coffee check your doodad theres a texaco here i imagine faber pointing at the phone gas you couldnt drive another four miles you pointing at the phone jaryd this pointing thing is a great needle and i am going to work it to death i thought i heard a rush of air like a ninja thing you a ninja pointer faber i hear a crackling noise like fabers snorting into the phone that little remark just cost your detective friend two degrees of heat that raincoat wont keep her warm in the freezer especially since i got it here in my hand what the hell were you two doing before you came over here shes only wearing purple panties and a raincoat tell me why you really pulled over daniel ive been running on fumes for the past halfhour the goddamn onboard computer is telling me i have a radius of two miles so i am filling the hell up unless you want the real cops to get hold of your steroids and what do you mean and i am sensing an and here mcevoy do you want to tell me what it is or should i just go ahead and turn the thermostat down as low as it can go see if we cant freeze deacons lingerie right off so i give him an and but not the real and okay all right take it easy i picked up a few weapons from my locker in the bus station on the way out and now im dropping them off i bring em over to your place and they get confiscated right the secret to a good lie is to bury it in truth whatve you got there asks faber playing it cool like he could tell the difference between a gatling gun and a colt i got two phasers and a fart ray what do you care youre getting your steroids maybe you should take a couple of them yourself beef up that pointing finger i cant help it its a curse five minutes says faber gruffly then hangs up i squeeze the steering wheel until the leather groans then laugh a long jagged laugh that chops at my throat like an axe hacking on a steak when the fit passes i buzz down the window and spit into the night you okay now asks ghost zeb yep fine peachy just over seven minutes later what i had to do has been done and im pulling around back of the brass ring thinking that the parking lot seems a little placid without canaries and praying i didnt get any blood on my clothes one of fabers guys wilbur is on the ramp cracking his knuckles and im having a little chuckle over his shitkicker name when i remember how eager wilbur was to shoot goran in the face im thinking that wilbur got teased a little too often in the schoolyard and is taking revenge on the world wilbur throws me a nod that speaks volumes not good hey mcevoy lets go grab a cobb salad volumes more see what i did to goran well youre next kind of volumes ive had so many security guys giving me the hard face over the past few days that its getting kind of comical i wonder is that how the world sees me bald and comical says ghost zeb thats it exactly screw you zebulon kronski stay fucked why dont you hey come on im kidding cant a guy kid keep a civil tongue in your head no more bald cracks after all the money i paid you understood it better be wilbur comes down the ramp and is half trotting beside the hilux before the vehicle comes to a full stop i step on the gas a little just to piss him off then reverse to the ramp what the fuck you doing he huffs when i step down from the cab sorry wilbur man overshot big truck you know wilbur rests a ham hand on the wing mirror wheres the stuff that deserves an eyeroll wheres the stuff you see the two enormous white barrels in the back what do you think wilbur pats something either his heart or a shoulder holster i wouldnt play smart with me irish i really wouldnt its too much i cant take it so i punch that leaningover bastard just as hard as i can in the kidney something splits inside him and my injured knuckle sings like a sawfiddle wilbur goes down gasping wishing it was five seconds ago and he had kept his mouth shut you are a dick i say sparing time for a short lecture and a murderer of women a female murdering dick thats why i burst your kidney and also so you wont be able to shoot me later because of all the pain and internal bleeding wilbur chooses not to rebut so i go on about my business there is a double drum caddy in the bay which is handy i wont even have to make two trips i roll and grunt the barrels on to the caddy and shoulder them up the ramp the club is quiet now its a week night so the entire zip code is still as the grave at this hour except wilbur whos writhing on the ground like an ageing breakdancer i take a deep breath and wheel the caddy into the club itself making sure to leave the doors ajar behind me i trundle down a hallway with red velveteen wallpaper and brass portholes if faber was going for the liberaces yacht look then hes got it spot on i didnt notice much about the decor the last time i came in the back way on account of my body being full of all this extra electricity in between the portholes the walls are lined with signed pictures of celebrities as far as i can make out these are stock head shots with nothing to suggest that kevin costner frequents the brass ring this guy faber just gets classier by the second i hear voices at the end of the corridor and so i trundle the caddy that way its either faber down there or the cleaning staff i am almost past caring my entire existence is getting a little dreamlike and i feel bulletproof and doomed at the same time i barge through the kitchen door barrels first catching faber in the middle of an anecdote two of his guys are gathered round laughing heartily like hes bill cosby in his heyday while im waiting for the hilarity to end i spot an airport wifi base station plugged into a socket by the door and i nudge it out with the caddys wheel so the guy gets off with eighteen months suspended says faber raising his hands for the punchline and i get paid by all parties everybody laughs on cue and one of those asslicking goons goes so far as to repeat the punchline and wipe a tear shameless faber lets the laughter die to let me know how unconcerned he is by this whole thing he deals with bigger fish than me every day you finished jaryd i ask him testily pushing the caddy to the centre of the room you want to let the lady out of the freezer now faber turns around making a big show out of being surprised that im even there hey dan is that the time shit ive been telling the guys a couple of war stories here forgot all about our little situation he suddenly spots the massive barrels in the middle of his kitchen and claps his hands you brought me a present i keep on pretending that im doing this for the money you got one for me fifty thousand ones faber drops a huge wink at his boys yeah sure i got your present right here why dont we just have a look at my pills first i push the caddy towards fabers biggest guy and he has to do a nimble little shuffle to save his toes knock yourself out faber has his three guys get to work one covers me with a pistol another gives me the briskfrisk while the third tips a barrel from its perch and pops the security lid the drums mouth glows and the guys double chin is swabbed by crescents of blue light holy fuck he says this shit is radioactive faber digs his arm in deep and lets the pills run through his fingers like hes a pirate feeling up his doubloons this is the point where my what i like to call plan could have been seriously derailed but i got away with it it was fiftyfifty and i picked the right fifty score he says score i say you like mtv jaryd i might as well needle him we both know whats coming at least what he thinks is coming faber opens his mouth to give the word then has a thought that disturbs him wheres wilbur whys that jaryd you told him to bring up the rear i asked you where wilbur was i shrug i dont know exactly not to the precise inch faber hurls a handful of pills back into the drum you prick mcevoy he better not be dead or what youll kill me twice the attorneys grin is sly kill you why would i want to do that because you better i know about you and connie and i tried the cops once already but it didnt work next time im gonna do the job myself faber acts frustrated why are we still talking about that stripper screw it im not wasting my time arguing with a dead guy he walks to his laptop arms swinging to let me know he means business the guy is going to shock me again i knew he would he enjoyed it so much the last times why dont you lie down for a while he says which sounds rehearsed and hits return the bracelets signal is activated and on cue i fall to the ground gibbering i feel embarrassed shaking and dribbling like that but it should buy me a minute i feel a powerful urge to sit up and explain to faber that even a child knows you cant send an internet signal without a wireless transmitter but i swallow it down and keep spasming a good thing too because a couple of seconds after i hit the floor things start happening pretty fast the first sign of trouble is the elongated whip snap of a pistol shot echoing down the corridor thats wilbur gone to meet his maker i reckon so what that arsehole shot goran maybe he killed connie too so i wont be shedding any tears faber jumps up on his toes like a ballet dancer what the hell was that gunshot says one of his guys answering literally what he was asked even though a shell has just popped outside faber takes time to turn on his own guy i know it was a goddamn gunshot abner i fucking know that much abner abner and wilbur you cannot be serious abner has his gun in a twohanded grip pointed down between his toes its a big gun and hes a big man but his brow is twisted like a childs i guess you probly did know that mister faber and predictably the pointing starts go find out who fired that shot abner scoots out the door and i am guessing hes not coming back i take all of this in from my low vantage point im not bothering to shake any more but no one notices i shift my gaze to the freezer and see the needle is way down in the blue there isnt much time left a couple more shots crack outside the door and the wall thuds and buckles like a rhino ran into it thats abner gone two left now including faber i could probably take them but then id have to take whatevers coming in from outside better to move myself out of the equation i flip on to my elbows and crawl quickly towards the freezer head down like ive been taught faber is shouting something but its just panic you would think a lawyer would know to dial nineoneone but hes not capable of putting a plan together i almost feel sorry for what ive unleashed on him footsteps thunder along the corridor outside moving towards the door inevitable as a tidal wave i pop on to my haunches and thumb the thermostat into the red for all the good that will do it will take minutes for this old freezer to shake itself awake but its better than nothing i snap the steel handle open and roll inside through the hiss and steam two seconds later the weighted door clunks shut behind me the sound makes me wince but its for the best inside is definitely better than outside for the moment ronelle is strapped on the trolley white as a marble statue frosted like a birthday cake parked carelessly in a forest of frozen carcasses so shes a marble statue birthday cake in a forest not now zeb really the buckles holding her down are cold and unnecessary the detective is alive but weak as a newborn and vibrating gently with the thrumm of deep cold i throw off her straps and cover as much of her torso as i can with my jacket any bits sticking out i rub briskly with my hands dont get any ideas ronnie i tell her just warming you up no funny stuff i move around the trolley and bump it over to the door with my hip so i can peek through the window there is an emergency intercom set into the wall and i lean over to press the switch with my forehead noise floods the freezer like a wave the porthole is frosted with crystals and streaked with grease and it feels like im watching the outside world on an old gastube tv four men have crashed into the kitchen beyond securing the room for the arrival of the fifth these men look good but not great not exmilitary thats for sure there are holes in their positions that a fiveyearold basketball player could dribble through still in their favour they have a pretty fair selection of guns between them mostly automatics but i spot a couple of oldfashioned revolvers too were better off in here i whisper to deacon who has one eye open and is glaring at me like im an alien mcevoy she chatters much to my relief i was wrong we gotta call it in now now we gotta call it in no need for that the cops are coming soon one way or another outside a man trots into the room like hes coming on stage in vegas a big guy face a road map of burst corpuscles soft cap pulled down over one eye i know who this is weve had text irish mike madden i whisper to deacon who has managed to crank the other eye open wheres my gun is her response to this news reasonable in the circumstances not here be quiet deacon wants to object but shes out of energy for the moment and it is all she can do to scowl at me mike madden does a little shuffle along the carpet all the time smiling and comes to a stop with an armwaving flourish counsellor he says to faber who is doing his damnedest not to fall down m mike he stammers mister madden what are you what brings you here i love these guys still holding on to the civil façade when theres men dying or dead in the corridor mike taps his chin like he has to think about fabers question one of my guys is missing laddie he says finally i sent him on a job to a pill shop and he never came back faber straightens his tie breathing a little better this is all a misunderstanding mike i know this is your town everybody knows it i would never madden talks right over him i sent him to a pill shop and here you are with a couple of barrels full of pills are they not your pills not yours mike how stupid do you think i am mike sighs like the truth makes him sad money makes people stupid laddie thats life faber scoops a handful of blue pills from the open barrel steroids is all mike just steroids not your territory no profit in them hardly is that so mike dances across to the barrel casually slapping fabers final guy on the cheek on his way past lets have a little looksee he tips the barrel sending thousands of blue pills bobbling across the floor faber pulls one foot up like its piranhainfested water coming his way whaddya know you werent lying just pills is all and suddenly maddens smile disappears open the other barrel counsellor faber is a smart guy he gets it then oh christ i see theres a i got an explanation for you probably mike pulls out his cell phone navigating through the touchscreen menus so im enjoying a latenight bottle of jameson with my little colleen when this text message comes through he tosses the phone to faber who lets it drip through his hands a few times before he gets a grip read it for me faber reads it to himself first and whatever blood is in his face drains out of it jesus he breathes oh god out loud roars mike suddenly on his tiptoes out loud you crooked ginger bastard he clicks his fingers and one of his guys drops fabers man with a single shot the man dies quiet sliding down the wall with no change of expression faber drops the phone and starts crying pick it up this is difficult for faber to comprehend all his life hes been talking people out of trouble and now suddenly heres this immovable object pick up the goddamn phone faber falls to his knees and has to clasp the phone in both hands before he can steady it enough to make out whats on the screen now if youd be so kind and faber reads the message in a hitching voice filled with fear and phlegm im in a barrel at the brass ring bleeding real bad faber did this the lawyer stops unable to finish and please mike i didnt do this read the fucking rest of it faber takes a few deep breaths it says it says mike cant wait any longer it says if i die kill the forker thats what it says kill the forker he laughs forker predictive text faber makes a desperate appeal for his life theres this guy on the floor back there covered in his own shit probably he did this all of it mike makes a big show of looking around nope no shitcovered mystery guy youre in the dock for this counsellor but he was there you have to believe me im telling you the truth mike sighs this is a whole lotta hoopla for not much therethere i suppose if youre as powerful as mike what you say doesnt always have to make complete sense though the hoopla therethere phrase has a ring to it open the barrel lads two of mikes men yank on the lid until one of the teeth gives the rest relinquish their grip and the barrel yawns open like a lazy crocodile they pat around in the surface pills for a while until mike grows impatient for his big moment tip it he commands dont please faber is begging maybe that should give me some satisfaction but it doesnt staying alive is all i want out of this mikes boys put their shoulders into the barrel and it teeters past the point of no return bouncing and skittering across the floor spilling out a fan of pills and the corpse of macey barrett he comes to rest at maddens feet pools of blue pills in his eye sockets and mouth faber screams and screams like hes seeing his own death which of course he is oh please says irish mike in disgust and suddenly there is a gun in his fist faber holds up his hand to ward off the bullets but mike has already pulled the trigger the bullet takes off fabers pointing finger then continues barely deflected into the attorneys heart faber clutches his chest a final scream leaking out of him takes a step backwards on to the spread of pills his final act is an ignominious pratfall then hes dead on the floor mike kneels beside macey barrett and is about to touch him when one of his guys coughs gently uh boss trace mike pulls back his fingers yeah good thanks calvin always looking out for me he pockets his gun then gives the room a quick scan looking for cameras im guessing i draw back from the freezer porthole and squat under the glass just breathing and waiting deacon is coming around now muttering to herself mostly stuff about me most of it bad i peek through the porthole again and the only people in that room are corpses i see dead people jokes zeb yep me too far too often you had mike madden out there and you never asked him about me theres a time and place zeb and that wasnt it i feel a sense of victory that im not proud of my plan was full of holes but nobody fell into them two birds with one bullet faber has paid the price for murdering connie and irish mike is no longer on the hunt for barretts killer home free thats really great im happy for you one thing at a time zeb i still got problems one of my problems groans and attempts to sit up i wedge my forearm under her head and try for a tender smile hey ronnie how you doing who the fuck are you joey tribbiani and whats that weird look youre giving me i drop the tender smile lets get you off that trolley detective the bust of your career is outside that door deacon flaps her palm against the freezer what the locked steel door i sit her upright pulling my jacket tight around her shoulders have a little faith deacon its a freezer not fort knox theres a seal around the porthole which peels off easily once i get a nail underneath it most modern freezers have a safety latch on the inside in case anyone gets trapped but just as faber said theres a plate welded over this one still its just a door with a basic lock a lot less complicated than your average automobile door i reach down inside my pants what the hell are you doing i pull out the slim jim taped to my leg for your information im gonna jimmyjang the lock thinking ahead ronnie thats the secret yeah youre a regular nostradamusseeingintothefuturemotherfucker this might not be the time to ask for a second date i think i preferred detective ronelle deacon when she was blue and frozen i feed the thin steel band into the doors innards through the slit vacated by the seal a good carjacker could pop this door in under a dozen seconds but it takes me half a minute i feel the latch cord tugging the steel band and i cant resist a wink at ronelle before i yank it open showoff she says but shes smiling and i think that maybe theres a future where shes not trying to kill me maybe deacon tries to slap me off but i carry her out into the kitchen freezer steam floods out behind us like london fog christ breathes the detective and i realise that this is probably her first glimpse of carnage whose fault is all of this ours i prop her on a highbacked stool goran was dealing drugs i tell her she had a scam going with faber ripping off dealers faber murdered my friend too i clasp her shoulders firmly making steady eye contact they were always heading towards this none of it is our fault deacon does not avert her eyes i think maybe a lot of it is your fault dan but i dont know how a siren sounds in the distance coming closer finally a concerned citizen says deacon i was starting to believe that there werent any left bad timing i havent had time to drill a story into her listen ronelle we have shady circumstances here very dubious you have to tell internal affairs something they want to hear or both of us will be taking a trip to state deacons brow furrows cracking the ice on there i gotta tell the truth dan theres no other way im still police there are bullets from your gun in your partner whos to say that youre not the bent detective and goran died trying to take you down at the very least your career is over for not calling this in last night at most you get nailed for murder one it makes sense but will deacon see it in time that siren is awfully close what do you suggest thank christ you got an anonymous tip about faber on the delyne murder which is true you came over to find a drug deal in progress they got the jump on you shot your partner and locked you in the freezer you got out and made them pay for shooting a cop deacons eyebrows go up and snow flutters down her cheeks what all of them hey youre ronelle deacon you were pissed id believe it deacon wrings her fingers getting the blood flowing okay lemme think she wrings for another second right thats the stupidest bucketofpigshit plan that i ever heard you know how long its gonna take ia to tear that into confetti what you hate me mcevoy is that it hey take it easy ronelle i got feelings so officer deacon you bust out of a freezer in your french under things unarmed and kill like a hundred guys jesus christ the sirens are closer i think i hear tyres squealing it sounded better when i said it youre using mocking voices and stuff while shes thinking ronelle paws at an automatic in the sink picking it up with fingers that are still white thats probably loaded ronnie just so you know she twists her frozen finger around the stock loaded okay christ i hope my spazzy fingers dont accidentally shoot someone i swallow drily okay funny now i got to get going the automatic is pointed roughly at my groin im supposed to let you walk i try to look earnest and good come on deacon im just a complication if i disappear all is right in the world the siren is right out front red light swings across the roof through the blinds i start tapping my foot cant help it the foottapping jiggles my anklet so i quickly saw through the strap with a handy cleaver you look like shit mcevoy comments deacon as i work guy tagged me when i was trying to save your life for the second time i say picking up baretts phone which i have become attached to i hope i didnt overplay the hero thing doesnt matter really because any brownie points i might have accumulated are about to be wiped out yep so anyways i gotta put you back in the freezer i say stuffing the anklet in my pocket deacons face says what the fuck my plan was fine until the last bit about you breaking out and going rambo deacon doesnt say anything for a moment and im pretty sure shes thinking about shooting me in a vein youre a good cop ronelle i know it this is your chance to be a good cop again it might cost you a few brain cells but you can offer that up to jesus thats what we do in ireland deacon mulls it over then hands me my jacket and nods at the freezer door youre right i gotta go back in fuck it it really is the only way if the blues find deacon strapped to a gurney in a locked freezer then she is totally clear she can even claim memory loss its just for a few seconds theyre right here and i turned the temperature up ronelle lets me hoist her back inside well turn it back down dipshit i hope its not krieger and fortz those two couldnt find their dicks with a dickoscope dickoscope nice i lay deacon on the trolley hoping her frozen marrow doesnt snap and strap her down just tight enough before i can secure her right arm she reaches up and catches my jaw with one shivering hand im cold daniel she says its just for a minute she pulls me down for an icy kiss i feel our lips stick together thanks for coming back i wont forget it next time i catch you for murder one i might break it down to manslaughter appreciate it it takes a lot for someone like deacon to say thank you i expected the barb on the end as soon as she started the sentence you better get out of here before i start warming up cute i am out of there chapter i worked for zeb off and on for a few years mostly around manhattan and i saw gallons of botox injected into acres of skin the money was irregular but good and i have to admit that the perks were exciting only problem was the ladies that zeb had ministered to were not supposed to do a lot of jiggling for twentyfour hours so things could be a little muted we got on okay at first when i say okay i mean i never had to ask more than five times for my money and he never tried to hold back more than forty per cent on one occasion i was forced to shake him by the collar but that was as rough as it got nobody tried to rip him off either for the first year which really pissed zeb off in his twisted mind nobody ripping him off was tantamount to me ripping him off as he was paying me for nothing i tried explaining that i was a bit like a nuclear deterrent but zeb refused to see the sense in this as it didnt align with how he was thinking it got so that he started to pick fights with people daring them to screw with him or rather with me mostly these people were confused housewives who had never heard verbal abuse before that wasnt filtered through the tv but every once in a while the household had its own security and i took a couple of unnecessary punches because zeb felt the need to big himself up it got so he took to strutting down eighth avenue like tony minero tossing insults left and right he barely noticed me just took my presence for granted one night i just stopped at the crosswalk and let him go ahead with his motherfucker this and get out of my way asshole that until some college kid pounded him a good one in the side of the face the kind of punch that makes everyone who sees it go damn we parted company soon after and i upped sticks for cloisters but after six months zeb tracked me down and set up kronskis kures in the minimall for almost a year he claimed the relocation was on account of me being his only friend but one night in olearys he got so drunk that he forgot who i was and confided in who he thought i was saying how some pushers girlfriend in queens had a permanent droop on one side of her face on account of the cheap botulism he pumped into her forehead and he was hiding out here in the styx with the big mick until things cooled down but then he started making good green here in cloisters and decided to stay a while i dont work for zeb any more though he begs me every day i just hang around with him for free its nice to have a whiskey buddy plus we have this thing we do with movie references and song titles can be lots of fun ive been in worse shape but not recently seems to me there was a time when i could take punishment the way a young man takes his liquor go all night and still function at work the next day now im grunting with every step walking like my bones are made of glass the various tussles with bonzo the tunamelt guy and fabers goons have really taken a toll and i wouldnt be surprised if i die earlier than i should as a direct result at least the book is closed on faber unless he can generate himself a fresh ticker whatever his reasons for murdering connie he took them to the grave maybe when he floats out of the tunnel hell have to explain himself to st peter for his sake i hope he can come up with something better than she slapped me jesus i would pay good money to hear that conversation the deacon problem is on hold but i have a feeling that as soon as ronnie gets bored of the supercop tag shell be giving me a call it would be nice to believe that detective deacon would be in my corner should i need some badge ill make the call if i have to but im not counting any chickens first and foremost ronnie is a cop and shell uphold the law even if it means hanging her and me both counting chickens pipes up ghost zeb still hanging on in there what the hell are you doing counting chickens dont you listen im not counting chickens counting chickens not counting chickens i could give a shit all these situations youre closing the door on what about me im out there somewhere probably dead probably yes but did you ever think that i could just be maimed im out there somewhere with my dick cut off i got maybe fortyfive minutes to make it to the er for reattachment surgery i cant help wincing okay zeb okay ill make a few enquiries when soon very soon i just have to pick up my funds at the bus station then square things with work and mrs delano im bleeding to death and youre squaring things if i find you will you get out of my head not only that but ill do all your checkups for free yeah see thats how i know youre not the real zeb my apartment should be goonfree now that fabers breath has fogged its last mirror just in case there are any hostile stragglers i dial a phoney be call into the local blues from mr hong down the hall and slip upstairs to sofias apartment when the cruiser whoops up to the steps sofia delano pulls open her door before the knock reverb fades and stands before me chest heaving like shes run a mile to get there carmine she breathes ive been waiting so long i slip inside her lobby passing close feeling the breath from her upturned mouth on my cheek seeing the sheen of her lipstick delano reminds me of someone not cyndi lauper any more another eighties icon blonde hair blowdried big striped woollen dress leggings and ballet pumps ghost zeb puts his finger on it were the kids in america wohoh my kim wilde look says sofia delano you always liked it carmine remember that club the one eight seven those were good times she looks wonderful smells intoxicating if only i could remember the good times mrs delano sofia im not carmine im daniel mcevoy from downstairs you hate me remember she takes my face in her hands not any more she says and kisses me hard not any more does that mean she doesnt hate me any more or she doesnt remember i dont know and for a moment i dont care and even though i didnt share the eighties with this woman i do remember the decade and here they are coming around again with sweet chocolatey perfume shoulder pads the haze of hairspray and soft red lips this is more than a kiss its a time machine i feel sofias sprayed hair scratch my cheek and hear the moan in her throat like all her dreams have come true and i want to weep is this how low i have sunk making out with a disturbed woman i push her gently away hearing the soft pop as the vacuum seal of our lips is broken w wait i stammer this is not right i cant we cant there is a bruise of lipstick smeared across her upper lip sure we can baby its not the first time but lets do it like its the last what an invitation you could sell a movie with a tagline like that no sofia mrs delano this is not me i mean i am not carmine then something unexpected she slaps me in the face hard i actually rock back on my heels pull yourself together carmine how many lives do you think we get im forty years old next summer and this is my last second chance you going to break my heart again i cant do it i should goddamn me but i cant find the strength okay sofia okay i get it i stroke her cheek tenderly its easy to do natural no broken hearts tonight i want to do it slow take things easy we got time right she blinks uncertain as though offering sex to this man carmine is all she knows how to do time yeah time for romance romance the word hiccups in her throat you want romance sure a man can change cant he i i guess whew a reprieve though a big insistent part of me doesnt want a reprieve good great so sofia you got anything to drink i got some cough syrup and some coffee i react to coffee like its the holy grail wow coffee that would be awesome definite overkill i use the word awesome about as much as i use the word bling sofia stumbles to the kitchen on sea legs a bewildered smile cutting through the lipstick carmine delano asking for coffee my husband certainly has changed maybe you dumped some of that macho baggage youve been lugging around along with the hair its temporary i blurt wanting to please her now the hair its growing back sofia pours two mugs from the machine hair no hair doesnt bother me baby so long as i have you its been hours since you left i was starting to think i did something wrong hours more like years i uh i had some business to take care of sofia pushes me gently to the settee deep brown leather squeaks when i sit a man could get used to relaxing in a promo sofa like this smells of italian food and perfume business like that naked bitch downstairs same old carmine i absurdly defend myself that woman was a detective she was trying to kill me sofia eyes me archly uhhuh i bet she had good reason i know what you are carmine all about your dalliances dalliances first time ive heard that word since ireland drinking and dalliances thats you isnt it thats your entire goddamn life in a nutshell mother shouting that at my father and him laughing scratching his chin with one hand and swiping the air with the other trying to catch an invisible fly dalliances eh hed twitter then do a little mocking fairy dance was this before or after the croquet back to here and now but im shaking a little no sofia no dalliances its only you youre the only one for me its easy to say and it would be easy to mean sofia glows she sweeps her blonde hair aside eyes downcast like a twentyyearold bride you mean it baby you mean it this time i do i take her hand and place it on my chest feel my heart and tell me im lying if my heart could speak it would say that my every word is a lie her husband is gone and he better stay gone because if he comes back i might just have to kill him sofia places her cheek beside her slim fingers its a strong heart daniel strong enough to protect me no ones going to hurt you now sofia that guy the keerist almighty guy hes gone for good keerist almighty beep whispers sofia then falls asleep just like that keerist almighty beep says ghost zeb what the hell does that mean i decide to think about that later for the moment im thinking about how mrs delano just called me daniel the human mind has layers simon moriarty once told me some of them know whats going on some of them dont i really must call that guy so i do call the guy next evening over a late late breakfast before i head out to work ive had eighteen hours sleep and three square meals and i feel like its time to solve some of my problems hey doc its daniel mcevoy silence on the other end for a few moments while moriarty opens his mental filing cabinet daniel daniel bloody mcevoy a blast from the past how are you doing dan not too well im guessing i allow my gaze to drift out the window theres a light drizzle coming down silver though the streetlights looks nice like movie rain well im noticing how nice the rains looking if that means anything i hear the sound of a zippo wheel spinning and it brings me back ten years noticing rain you are truly screwed my boy nine out of ten serial killers start paying close attention to meteorology just before they cut loose by the way you do know its two in the morning over here youre lucky i was up carousing im smiling into my phone a sucker for the old accent whatever you arsehole gobshite you sure you have a degree you called me sergeant mcevoy whats your problem problems doc problems okay shoot so long as youre aware im billing the army for this down the street a couple are arguing about something shes big on the hand gestures waving like a windmill would i find that cute or irritating shit im already irritated okay ive got this woman in love with me well done live long die happy no she thinks im someone else ah well sometimes secrets are a good thing i know that general thinking says holding things in can be damaging but some things are better kept to oneself its more than secrets doc she actually believes im a different person her husband i think and youre not her husband no id remember okay i hate to diagnose on the phone but it sounds like shes delusional you think so holy shit simon chuckles in the tiny speaker it sounds like hes gargling tar okay im remembering you now mcevoy what can i do dont shatter her illusions too harshly you could do irreparable damage play along for the time being until you can get professional help that could be tricky tricky how i think sofia could turn violent shes been hurt before i hear moriarty drag deep on his cigar christ this is so unprofessional look dan if you care for this woman get her into treatment use some pretext or other say its marriage counselling marriage counselling nice one i am about to fold macey barretts phone when dr moriarty asks a question and what about you daniel how are you cracked knuckle maybe mentally smartarse how am i theres a question im carrying around my best friend in my head im obsessing about my hairline and i am giving serious consideration to entering a relationship under an assumed name yeah im fine simon really i can hear moriartys pen clicking on the other side of the atlantic youre lying to me daniel you sure yes im sure its all docmoriartyarsehole then suddenly its simon youre trying to gain my trust by humanising yourself textbook stuff i am human simon another chuckle from ireland not to me to me youre nothing more than a few stripes on a sleeve i realise that i like this guy and that it would be good to have a beer and not discuss my various hangups fixations and neuroses i suppose im transparent to you doc absolutely i take a deep breath realising that there is no way to say what i am about to say without sounding a little section eight okay doc i have this friend really you have this friend who cant get an erection and could i make the prescription out in your name no not like that i have this real friend whose personality lives in my brain shit there ive said it youre just having conversations in your head playing devils advocate with yourself everyone does it no its more than that hes a real presence he doesnt follow the rules you have rules for your imaginary friends dan hey im pretty sure that youre not supposed to mock your patients when you send me a cheque you can be my patient there is no point trying to outsmart this guy he does it for a living so i forge ahead usually these devils advocated internal conversations happen when i want them to theyre kinda vague and in the background but this guy zeb is here all the time distracting me poking his nose in then when i actually need some advice he disappears is he there now no zeb doesnt trust doctors i see and what does the real zeb do for a living hes a doctor i say smiling i hear simons pen clicking half a dozen times then youre not a dummy dan even if you pretend to be you know this guy zeb is just a part of you i guessed as much so no need for a straitjacket yet not so long as youre in control lot of your murderers swear the voices told them to do it dont worry zeb has been urging me to kill people for years ive ignored him so far so far maybe i should write you a prescription a couple of gentle antipsychotics could do you the world of good i know some vets who took antipsychotics every one of those guys thought tweety and sylvester were hilarious no thanks doc i think ill pass on the meds i need my wits about me right now whatever you say sergeant keep tabs on yourself then if such a thing is possible and if you find yourself sawing bodies into pieces on the suggestion of this zeb voice then drink a fifth of whiskey put yourself to sleep for eight hours and call me in the morning so im your patient now should i send you a cheque its moriartys turn to snort yes thats it dan you send me a cheque i hear another voice in my ear a bedrumpled female come on simo says the woman not a patient im guessing you cant stop in the middle i better let you go i say one of you better says simon and hangs up ghost zeb comes out from beneath the synapse bridge he was hiding under shrinks he says and i can feel his shrug like a cool bottle of beer rolled across my forehead witch doctors every one of them cloisters seedy street isnt too obvious as these places go on new yorks th avenue you know exactly what kind of street youre walking the flashing billboards and windows stacked high with lingerieclothed mannequins never let you forget it the smell of lust rises from the pavement and the door handles are coated with grease and guilt cloisters doesnt have so much in the way of billboards and guilty handles we have three gentlemens clubs that you wouldnt know were there unless you knew they were there with nothing but a small neon sign square of red carpet and a velvet rope to drop a wink to those on the lookout there are eight casinos in cloisters each one marked by a sign that city regulations restrict to a size slightly larger than a pizza after my transatlantic phone call i take a brisk walk through the rain to the bus station to pick up my savings then cross town to the strip and announce myself at the casino door tadah i sing spreading my arms wide jason gives me the diamondfang smile hey dan buddy where the hell you been fucking ireland or some shit seriously victor lost his nut here yesterday fired your ass in absentia this is bad news but i was expecting it you dont pull a noshow on victor jones and expect him to let it slide victor never lets anything slide that fucker wouldnt let anything slide at a baseball game i chuckle zeb made this pronouncement one night after victor cut off his tab jason is not expecting a chuckle in response to his litany of doom i respect your balls dan chuckling and shit showing up here like its business as usual after missing a shift but youre gonna have to pull some hocuspocus outta your hat for victor you feel me i envy jason his ability to confidently use phrases like you feel me or off the hook another of his favourites okay i better get inside and grovel jason cracks his neck which always makes me wince come on jason i hate that do you want to give yourself arthritis sorry dan im aggravated we got no customers yet so vics rolling a couple of the new girls rolling the new girls is not as bad as it sounds okay maybe it is as bad as it sounds just different bad rolling the girls is one of victors favourite pastimes and hes going to keep on doing it until one of the rolled girls goes crazy and spikes his dom p with rat poison this thought brings on a dreamy sigh hey dan you dreaming about oirland again its marco the little barman peeking out across the empty bar smiling but not laughing because im a lot bigger than he is then he notices my bruised face and his smile shrinks a few molars holy shit man what happened to you i was dreaming about oirland i say straightfaced and this guy interrupted me so we had a talk you should see the state hes in i mime drinking through a straw in the side of my mouth marco wipes a glass like hes trying to climb inside it youre a funny man daniel hilarious you know ive got a weak heart right i cut him some slack with a soft smile i know marco victors in back marco wipes harder not happy with giving bad news to big people yeah doing his favourite thang he said to send you back if you showed up those exact words not exactly give it to me straight what he said exactly was if that irish monkeyfucker shows up you send him back here for a bitch slapping my eyebrows shoot up to my hairline of old monkeyfucker marco almost disappears behind the bar not my words then he gets brave i would probably have said leprechaunfucker to tie in with the irish thing yeah thats much better do me a favour marco pour me a large jameson i should be out in a minute to drink it you got it dan says marco reaching for the optic im gonna miss you man im getting fired not dying i mutter and head for the back room the back room in slotz is the only original part of the building nice little redbrick room with a row of headheight postbox windows vic installed a polished wooden bar in the corner thats way too big for the space and theres an old green baize card table with brass corners wedged into the leftover room this is where the real money is made in slotz the back room has been running a highstakes game since prohibition to hear vic tell it youd think that every new york gangster from schultz to gotti had lost a bundle in here when i push through the door vic is swizzling a green cocktail and treating a couple of teenage girls to a social studies lesson the entire room is living history this table this exact table is fifty years old the girls are nodding eagerly hoping for vics approval i on the other hand have decided not to beg for my job back i have realised suddenly that without connie this dump holds zero appeal for me so i do not have to listen to vics shit for one more second fifty years back home we have fastfood joints older than that we have bloody walls older than this entire country victor jumps he was so into his spiel that he didnt even notice me coming in what the hell he stammers for some reason grabbing at his purple bowler hat like thats the first thing a raider would go for i notice that hes wearing a bandanna under the hat and another stuffed into his breast pocket mcevoy youre like a case of the clap you arrive quiet then flare up brandi is in the room hovering at vics shoulder like the spectre of death in heels so obviously she laughs victors got one of his cousins there too aj a prize moron rumour has it that aj once twisted a model statue of liberty up his arse then tried to tell the er doctor he sat on it in battery park you know a lot about the clap vic victor sees my eyes then and he knows im not here to petition you want to watch what you say to me mcevoy im connected i am so sick of this man this is the man who ordered his surveillance discs wiped on the night of connies murder even though there may have been evidence on one of them connected give me a break vic your fat arse is connected to that chair thats about it your brain isnt connected to your stupid mouth thats for sure aj is off his chair baring his teeth waiting on the word i eyeball him good you better sit down lady liberty unless you got room for my foot up there alongside that statue vic waves a pudgy finger sit aj this man could kill us all without breaking a sweat maybe youre not as stupid as i thought my former boss leans back in his chair steepling his fingers a cross between al pacino p diddy and elmer fudd so what can i do for you doorman before i bar you for life barred for life not much of a threat you can pay me its the end of the month vic is delighted he pokes the table with a finger yesterday was the end of the month you didnt work the full month mcevoy typical listen vic mister jones i had an emergency so i missed a day and okay i didnt call so dock me for the time i missed and pay me the rest its not really the money i have fifty grand plus on my person but this piece of slime owes me and he is going to pay one way or the other vic affects a pout i would love to pay you sincerely but i got all my disposable cash tied up in this game with these lovely ladies one of the lovely ladies simpers like vics doing them a favour taking her money the other one knows how much trouble theyre in she is pale and her fingers grip the tables edge like its the railing of the titanic open the safe then what safe i dont have a safe doorman anybody know anything about a safe i pinch my nose and breathe heavily after everything thats happened i am not about to be messed around by a smalltime bigtime wannabe like victor jones look you can hang around until i finish the game i do good then maybe you get paid vic snaps a finger at brandi who takes his glass making sure to squeak her boobs around the bosss arm while shes doing it or you can keep dropping in for a few weeks until you catch me with a couple of bucks in my pocket more than a couple a couple of thousand more like vic shrugs like this makes zero difference whatever less than fifty grand i could give a shit fifty grand you could buy the lease on this entire club for half that he picks a fresh pack of cards from the table and rips off the plastic now if you would kindly get out of my face i got a game to play like i said im not much for flashbacks but for a second the sound of that plastic tearing has me back in a camo tent on the southern lebanese border with israel theres death at our door and blast tremors rattling the tent poles and im saying one more hand come on guys one more hand victor does a few wedge shuffles and my eyes follow the snap of the cards one of the girls starts to cry her bony shoulders hitching her fake boobs bobbing like buoys in the tide i like that one buoys in the tide sounds like an eagles number vics little con is as simple as it is lowdown any time new girls come in looking to make a little money hostessing vic softens them up with tequila and then charms them into a few hands of poker with brandi looking over their shoulders and dropping her boss the wink the girls quickly lose their first months wages and before they know whats happening theyre toting trays for tips modernday slavery is what it is you rolling these little girls vic is this how your mother raised you vic does not bite on that hook my mother was wasted by two thirty every afternoon i raised myself i built everything i have let the girls go vic wipe their slate tell you what you let those two out of here all square and you can keep my salary i find it hard to believe that im saying this simon moriarty would be writing i told you so in that little notebook of his all capitals hey you hear that aj big noble mcevoy giving it up for the ladies they only owe me a couple of weeks wages maybe theyll win it back and maybe hell will freeze over what do you say vic it would save me having to get angry vic has an answer to that dont worry mcevoy you get angry and i will fucking shoot you make no mistake obviously i hope it doesnt come to that hes not lying vic shot a drunk about eighteen months ago he didnt enjoy the intense police scrutiny and swears often and loudly that the next person he shoots is going to absolutely deserve it come on vic keep my money let them go theyre too skinny to work here hey says one of the girls the other pinches her friends bare arm shut up valerie the old bald guy is trying to help this gets a big laugh from vic and aj even brandi has a titter make you a deal doorman grins vic in a good mood now you wanna save these two you wanna free them from my evil clutches ill give you chips for your wages and you try to win the ladies money back i should have seen this coming this is vics answer to everything he once suggested it to an irs guy not happening i havent played cards since the army vic flaps his lips everything is since the army with you i havent played cards since the army i havent defused a mine since the army i havent killed anyone since the army he winks at brandi going for the big laugh i hope you dont mind me saying but youve been one boring motherfucker since you quit that army aj cracks up brandi actually gives vic a round of applause im not playing victor then stop breathing my air doorman and let me get on with my game the smarter of the girls shoots me a look of skeletal desperation she has caught a glimpse of her future and is beyond terrified i grind my teeth another situation i do not want shit christ bollocks okay vic a couple of hands to get the girls clear how far down are they vics grin is like a smear of butter twelve hundred plus the vig i pull out a chair violently fuck your interest theyve been here half an hour touchy screw you jones i say settling into the chair youre not my boss any more so you dont get the respect you never deserved and put out that cigar smoke gets in my eyes and i cant tell diamonds from hearts vic screws the fat stogie into an ashtray whats the matter you quit smoking when you left the army aj almost hacks up a lung you tell your cousin to stop laughing he might crap a statue a single squeak of laughter shoots from between brandis ruby lips and flies around the room like a canary are we playing or talking says vic putting on his game face i snap my fingers at aj gimme some chips two grand mixed vic clears the order with a slow blink and soon four towers of chips list before me i straighten them with forefinger and thumb while vic takes a slug out of his refreshed cocktail whats the game he asks straight poker i shoot back nothing wild no wrinkles all face down five and three thats it vic nods hes giving me some latitude because hes a player and im an amateur straight poker it is brandi honey get mcevoy something from the bar what do you need shit all this time and i dont even know what you drink i shake my head you stay right where you are brandi honey i dont need you behind me feeding the boss my figures in fact i want to see you in front of me at all times brandi pouts cocking her hip boosting her breasts high with crossed forearms shit dan that hurts sure whatever also keep that compact in your bag you know the one with the mirror vic chuckles not in the least offended that i have more or less accused him of being a lifelong cheat i guess you better stay where you are honey aj you in no he is not in i say before aj can answer poker is not supposed to be a team sport one on one vic is getting a little pissed now okay doorman is that it any more rules just tell me because i dont want you bitching when i clean you out we play for the girls first i say the smart one deals which is the smart one i nod at the terrified girl a skinny brunette whose blotted mascara makes her look like a skull she doesnt have the hope in her to smile the one who knows how much trouble shes in after i dig the girls out we play for my salary vic shrugs the magnanimous monarch green is green doorman the order it comes in doesnt matter to me the girl deals shes so nervous that she flips a couple of cards and has to start again finally vic and i have five apiece too late to back out now i check my cards fanning them inside the clam shells of my hands two kings not a bad start i suppose ghost zeb grudgingly agrees maybe you know what youre doing half an hour later im down to my last hundred bucks in chips moron says ghost zeb moron says vic and i cut him a suspicious look what moron he repeats obviously i have been emasculated by my unlucky streak you come into my club and try to take me on me victor jones you know how many guys have taken a beating here its two grand vic get a grip two grand more that these lovely ladies owe no i protest i lost my wages thats all vic chews an unlit cigar no no fuck that you said we were playing for the girls first those chips were my wages anything i won was to get these two out of the shitpile theyre in aj is snuffling and snorting beads of sweat standing out on his red forehead begging to be turned loose but vic holds him back with a frown magnanimous in his good fortune any way you look at it mcevoy these pretty things are still in the hole you aint saved nobody not since the army that joke is getting old ive got a hundred bucks left on the table you never know my luck might be about to change vic lights his cigar twisting it slowly for an even burn hes past pretending to give a shit what i think one more hand why not after today doorman youre gonna have to borrow a pot to piss in ill give you a good rate on one of those very funny vic lets play cards its the macho thing to say but i dont feel very tough vic is crucifying me maybe simon moriarty was right and i am totally transparent a good dealer can land five cards right on top of each other so the corners match up this girl is so rattled one of my cards floats right off the table you wanna change that mcevoy i snag the card with two fingers no vic im good its not a bad hand two pair queens and eights were both in for fifty then i tap the table and the girl slides a single card over vic passes his hand across his cards like a magician hes sticking with what hes got which should mean that he has everything he needs unless hes bluffing a couple of hands back i folded on a pair of aces lost over seven hundred dollars i never paid to see vics cards but ive seen him bluff with nothing the problem is that when vic has his game face on nothing changes his voice is steady his features are calm his body language says fuck you no matter how good his hand i thought i could find a chink in his armour but i cant my only hope is lady luck fifty i say even though my fifth card is useless to me why not go for broke this is going to be easy says vic pushing in a stack five hundred you cant pay youre gone no ious here house rules i know the house rules vic you made us memorise them remember vic relaxes a little now that the battle is won aj here cant memorise dick thats why we call him by his initials so he can remember his own name maybe that torch scratched his brain aj smacks the flat of his hand on the table but he wont move without a go from vic okay says vic so youre done doorman get the hell out of my club youre barred unless i got dollars to spend right i dont turn down cash money you never know if you drop by maybe marcie here will give you a handjob in one of the booths work off some of her debt marcie cries a river and i reach for my wallet ill see your five hundred vic hides his surprise well you sure about that what you thought i was walking around broke i got funds vic so i see your five you never turn down cash money right i toss the bills in with a flourish never vic cups his stash with two hands and pushes it all in theres your five hundred and two thousand more you got that much walkingaround money im watching him closely same old vic i was hoping the surprise funds might throw him yeah i got it your getaway money come on dan are you going to blow all that for these two airheads they dug this hole for themselves i have no intention of blowing it all just enough to clear the girls and maybe get my wages back this pot and thats it how much you got in that safe you dont have vic somehow keeps the face straight i bet his toes are curled in his shoes i got the nights float thats twenty grand daniel and there it is he was all mcevoydoormanmoron and suddenly its daniel vic never called me daniel in his life its just like dr moriarty said vics subconscious is trying to gain my trust because hes lying bluffing i realise with a rush of certainty that vic doesnt have shit in his hand i can win big here my resolve to play it safe dissolves and in its place floats a shining christmas bauble vision of a moment in the near future when i leave victor jones weeping at his own table if i let him keep the table this is the guy whose first thought on seeing connie dead in the parking lot was for his own sleazy business and i feel an irresistible urge to take that business away from him my poker face is nowhere near as good as vics so i hide it in my hands feigning distress twenty grand christ but youre not going to risk all that no way maybe i will maybe i wont okay okay ill take five ive got five so thats three grand to you the stash is spread all over my body some in each breast pocket and the rest in my socks i empty one pocket and place the wedge gingerly on the pile making sure vic sees the pocket is empty sheeeit you must be related to these dumb bitches vic clicks a finger at aj who springs to his feet as though the gravity holding him down has been siphoned off what vic what shoot him nope just open the safe and bring me the cash aj is crestfallen and actually pouts which might make him cute if he was thirty years younger and a person was ignorant of his tryst with lady liberty he trudges to the bar and successfully opens a safe hidden behind a brewery mirror i chuckle christ he remembered the combination vic breaks out of his poker face for a fleeting smirk its the date the statue was dedicated in spite of everything i cant hold in a guffaw and maybe for a millisecond i admire victor jones you are an evil arsehole vic but that was a good one youll have to change the combination now vic accepts the compliment with a royal wave then plucks a brick of cash from ajs fingers plonking ten grand on the pot your three and seven more now you are screwed again daniel no pay no play i have him a sense of savage victory glows like a light bulb inside my skull and i close my mouth to stop it shining out ooooh says ghost zeb you think theres actual light shining outta your irish mouth i think you better phone that guy simon its a fair point dont worry vic im playing i got one more pocket i pull out two more wedges each one wrapped in cling film any more and i have to go into my socks i see the seven and raise it another three vic struggles with his expression its a challenge to keep the poker mask in place and a winding vein swells between his ear and eyebrow if he folds hes down ten grand plus i hear rumours that vic owes money to some real criminals losing ten grand could cost him a lot more than ten grand his only hope is to bankrupt me fuck you doorman he says and is that a tremor in his voice all in he throws in his final wedge like a grenade now go the fuck home its one of those moments that sucks the air out of a room whatever happens next is going to shape lives all i need to do is up the ante by eight grand or so and i squash him even if i lose i still got something brandi is leaning low across the table doing her best to boobblind me and aj is throwing back shots of stoli at the bar one after the other psyching himself up for the confrontation that is almost surely coming i put together a quick fight plan soon as this is over i deck that arsehole with my chair eight grand thats all i need but then i flash on vic leaving connie out there in the rain while he cleans house i see his fat fingers squeezing the flesh of yet another girl as hes leading her into the back room thirtyfive grand i say pulling the rolls out of my socks and fuck you vic vics breath comes hard like hes having an attack and to be honest i dont feel so hot myself both of the girls are crying now a person would have to be deaf blind and stupid not to realise that this can only end in violence now vics mask collapses and suddenly his face is lined like a dried fruit thirtyfive grand no way no goddamn way and i know then that vic is screwed and that all he can do is pray that i am bluffing too you done vic that it vics lip hangs fat and low like a slug hes getting a glimpse of his own future come collection day things are going to be a little tight he cant afford to let that money leave the table that cash is not mine to lose i owe irish mike twenty grand irish mike again the man is like a cancer all you have to do is buy a look at my cards im out tapped i reach in for the pot hoarding it with my arms sorry vic no pay no play this is fine this will do vic watches the pot move across the table like its his lifes blood draining away there must be some way to work this out i can owe you not an option your rules i can kill you you can try bigger men than you have tried go for your nine see what happens vic bought a nine millimetre because thats what the gangsters rapped about i suspect thats because of the easy rhyme its thirty grand just to see your cards this is cloisters for christs sake where am i going to get that kind of money its laughable really has this man never heard the word irony vic youve been rolling girls back here for years every one of them begged you for a little leniency you screwed them all cheated them then screwed them i pile up the cash and chips you still owe me for the chips thats four grand give or take and ill take if you dont mind vics poker face has collapsed in on itself and in its place is raw desperation fuck you doorman ill see you let me see those cards show me your money vic wrings his hands and the chains around his neck jangle i got the club bingo you dont even own this fire hazard shithole vic does not dispute my description i got a twentyyear lease thats gotta be worth fifty grand yeah and i got a shoe thats worth half a mil come on daniel ill throw in the lease for a looksee i mull this over if you win you cut these girls loose anyway and if you lose then this club and every stick of furniture and bottle of booze in it belongs to me i dont want any haggling this isnt a divorce vic nods not able to speak the words i push the pot back in show me the lease brandi hurries to the open safe and fishes about she can see where this is going in two minutes there could be a regime change around here she returns with a manila envelope tied with string this it vic looks like hes going to puke yeah and then adds bitch brandi is aching to respond its in the square of her chin the flash of her tawny eyes but this deal is not sealed just yet no one outside the game speaks because this is one of those situations that will be talked about for years whatever happens and details are important also the whole thing has an unreal quality about it like something out of a tv show and not the good ones with budget behind them the afternoon reruns from the seventies with stereotype villains and a cheap set that wobbles every time a door is closed i check the document most of it is legalese could be a guarantee for a deepfat fryer for all i know even if it is legal the entire situation is probably bullshit that any halfwaydecent attorney would tear apart without spilling his latte in spite of all that i say okay looks good i accept the wager a little formal but its that kind of night vics jowls are shuddering show me goddamn you doorman calm drapes me like a shroud and i know the club is mine two pair i say flipping the cards no bluffing on this side of the table vic doesnt bother with his cards hes screwed and killing a few people is the only way out his nerveclumsy fingers crab down his body towards the nine in his belt hes way too slow i reach across and crush his hand in mine brandi puts him away with a vicious elbow to the side of his face that girl changes allegiances in a heartbeat no thats wrong our girl brandi only has one allegiance vic slides off his chair moaning blood pouring from a cut above his nose aj is moving but i have so much adrenalin in my system that he might as well be wading through mud coming around the side of the table at my ten oclock with a look on his face thats more animal than human i draw my little glock and put a shot in the bar mirror over his head fragments rain down spectacularly glittering icicles slicing ajs neck and hands i dont have to say anything even aj is not dumb enough to go up against a gun he lies on the floor and starts crying i turn to marcie and her friend go now dont ever come back in here stay off the strip they kiss and hug me for a minute like im an old rock star thanks daddy blurts marcie then oops sorry i mean thanks mister then theyre gone skittering across the casino sandals slapping the floor thanks daddy says brandi imitating the californiamtv twang that all kids speak with these days then she cracks up laughing i dont believe this dan you own the club she stamps the heels of her catwoman boots with sheer joy that assholes time has come i should crack his skull for all the shit ive had to put up with these past months dont crack anything yet brandi vic hasnt signed the lease over hmm says brandi she rouses her exboss with a sleet of ice from a steel bucket as soon as he signs she coldcocks him with the bucket finally this club is going to rock she sings pouring herself a healthy shot of bourbon we can get some professional girls working in back maybe cut a deal with irish mike for some product make us some serious money i can see im going to have staff problems jason shows vic and aj the door with unseemly glee he actually sings them out using the tune from ymca and his own lyrics getthefuckout you pair of assholes getthefuckout and dont come back here im impressed i havent seen jason this happy since his signed lou ferrigno tshirt arrived news spreads across the club like electricity across water spasming everyone it touches pretty soon the entire staff are gathered outside the back room waiting for some kind of pep talk talking to staff is not my area having staff is not my area for christs sake travel light has always been the code i live by and yet somehow here i am with a casino and a dozen people depending on me for a living my transplants are itchy thank god the wages were paid yesterday what about me ghost zeb pitches in dont forget about me and zeb is still irish mikes captive irish mike who collects a little tribute every month from slotz it seems every time i crawl out of nomansland the earth tilts and rolls me back in i hear brandis steel heels clacking across the casino floor and i decide to face the music before she launches into another tirade i rise check my skullcap in a remaining shard of busted mirror and duck under the door frame to meet my public its a weird feeling to have subordinates smiling at you didnt happen a lot in the army mostly in the army people muttered gobshite under their breath when i was dishing out orders but here all im getting is happy faces jason is still riffing on ymca danmacevoy is fucking awesome danmacevoy kicked victor jones goddamn ass he abandons the songs structure for the last line but nevertheless his efforts earn him an enthusiastic round of applause okay i say forcing a smile okay i thank you jason the village people thank you more laughing marco tickles jason in the ribs which opens my eyes about a couple of things for tonight we do everything as normal except the booths no more handson in the booths anyone has a problem with that talk to me later also anyone working off a debt you dont owe me a dime so from now on we all get paid a couple of smiles from those no longer in the hole but the handson girls dont seem too thrilled if you get the opportunity to piss off victor jones do not take it too late chortles jason accepting multiple high fives high fives christ these guys are happy dont take it because i dont know how legal that poker game was legal says jason vics been rolling girls for years back there how legal was that this is a good point you know any good lawyers danny continues jason sure he does says gz cept danny here has a tendency to get lawyers shot dead marco trots across the floor bearing a large jameson on a scarred martini tray here you are dan you earned it i accept the drink gratefully the irish whiskey is smooth going down but has an aftershock like a jolt from a defibrillator back to work everybody enjoy the new management while it lasts i need to think for a while brandi positions herself at my side thats right people you heard the boss back to work we need to negotiate the booth action looks like i have a second in command first thing i do in vics office is to kick brandi out the second is to rip down the porn its not that i find naked women offensive its just that i prefer the real thing also the pictures remind me of the previous occupant and all the acts he claimed to have performed with the various club employees not images you want popping into your head in the course of a work day plus if vic does manage to legal me out of here i would like out of sheer vindictiveness to mess up his system as much as i can before he does it i dont know how vic got anything done his work surface is a jumble of magazine towers burger cartons and wadded foil wrappers theres a trash can in the corner that looks like it exploded some time in the nineties and the window blinds are streaked brown and yellow from decades of cigar smoke i wipe the bosss chair off and sit down and thats about as far as my plan extends adjust the chair its a nice touch i lower the chair six inches so vic will get an unexpected little shock little nuggets like this keep a man going so sit down and then what payrolls overheads rent booze orders cash deposits my transplanted follicles are begging for a scratching something zeb forbade me to do i didnt employ five students and spend eight hours separating your follicles to have you scratch the little bastards out again no touching for a month hands flat on the table i tell myself do not touch the new hair its hard to believe how difficult not scratching is ive waded through plenty of hard and distasteful tasks in my careers but right at this moment keeping my palms glued to the desk ranks right up there with any of them including latrine digging in the lebanon i try to focus on something else and the first thing that pops into my head is keerist almighty beep what did sofia mean by that where did the beep come from there was no beep mentioned the first time around where the hell do you even hear a beep these days maybe there was a car passing by or maybe something almost occurs to me but i dont let the thought materialise fully in case theres something to it i can deal with this eventuality if it becomes a possibility i follow the cable across vics desk and unearth the phone beneath a pyramid of ledgers theres no one at the number im calling of course not its my own number i count the rings until my answer machine cuts in then punch in my password one message hey guy doorman guy listen you probably dont remember me you get schmucks all the time right keerist almighty i hate machines okay anyway listen oh this is jaryd faber by the way the lawyer you ejected last night deservedly so i might add i got your number from vic and the thing is that i enjoy slotz the club shithole though it may be passing a few hours with the cards and the babes i dont want to give that up so i just wanted you to know that i smoothed things over with vic what a prince and im back in in case you see me before you see him no need to throw a punch what do you say let bygones be bygones live and let live maybe i can buy you a drink or a new suit okay we straight no hard feelings i hate saying fucking sorry for anything but there it is accept it or not you should be fucking delighted by the way if you knew who i was and what i could do to you keerist almighty then the tape runs out and theres a beep keerist almighty beep i hold the phone at arms length like its lied to me sofia heard my answerphone faber was never at the apartment i set the cops on the wrong man he was the right man for the cops says ghost zeb just the wrong man for killing connie and trashing your place and hes dead now its my fault no arguing with that so who did kill connie who wrecked my apartment a shadow falls across my face and i look up well its about time says irish mike madden ive been chasing your pale arse all over town chapter irish mike stands framed by the doorway like it was built for the purpose he is a big man huge with whiskey veins popping in his nose and cheeks his teeth are crooked and cracked from a hundred bar fights and he smiles broadly displaying them like medals he sports a soft fishermans cap worn rakishly to one side with a shamrock pin on the peak and when he speaks his accent is more hollywood irish than a living dialect irish mike a mick who has never been to ireland an immigrant who never emigrated a plastic paddy who learned all he knew about the old country from grandmas stories and boys own daniel mcevoy he says gently shuffling into the room like a crooner about to break into a number a hard man to find not for my friends madden is all leprechaun charm are we not friends then daniel his eyes are dull green and his skin reminds me of a plucked chicken i am too old for this cut the shite mike what do you want mike chuckles fondly shite i like that he leans against the wall and it creaks i want the money you owe me groan he isnt even here for me im a bonus vic owes you money not me he owes me money too but out of respect for you and your organisation you can collect first mike is a little surprised by this backchat but amused too thanks mcevoy very catholic of you but id rather you pay not the way it works mike even god cant transfer debt i dont owe you a cent and if you dont stop weaving it into the conversation ill squeeze my way through all that fat on your shoulders and break your thick neck might as well try bravado see if it works if it was fear and submission i was hoping for then my bluntness does not have the desired effect mike madden looks tired and resigned like he is so fed up of doing things the hard way and why cant it just be easy for once righto laddie i hear you now you listen to me ive been searching for something why dont you ask the universe seems to work for a lot of people thats a secret by the way madden grinds his teeth you know what im talking about we both know where this is going i dont know mike believe me but i know how you search for things mike spreads his hands wide couldnt be avoided the disk could have been in your apartment i am surprised a disk a bloody disk what do i look like to you jason goddamn bourne mike madden hooks the flap of his tweed sports coat over the revolver at his belt any road laddie youre going to have to quit work early tonight hes right i cant see any way out of leaving here with him i have a gun too you know maybe laddie but i have several one hostile move from you and the floors run with blood wooden floors though so at least the blood will wipe off if you get to it quick i place my gun on the desk no one has said laddie for a hundred bloody years you phoney my heart is irish objects mike worried more by the insult than the weapon your heart is clogged with bacon and beer and will drop you in your tracks any day now which is an unusual thing to say to a person you just met two frecklefaced potatohead types squash themselves into the doorway fumbling guns from their pockets i know them both from fabers kitchen you put that gun back in the drawer laddie or my boys will execute everyone in this club thats what i thought i glare at madden so the murder in my eyes is all he can see if i were like you mike if i didnt care about those people out there then you would be dead right now i just wanted you to know that and show a bit of respect irish mike actually winks point taken laddie now come over here and lets pretend were friends mike takes my phone then we stroll out of the office and across the casino floor like a couple of swells and consequently none of his four escorts are forced to shoot anyone jason is ready to fight chest out arms dangling but i calm him with a lateral twofingered slice which sounds a bit complicated but is one of our door signals doesnt matter how big your pecs are bullets cut right through its okay jason hold the fort ill be back in a few hours you sure boss yeah me and mike have a little business to discuss mike has an rclass mercedes benz waiting at the kerb and we wait an embarrassing few minutes while two of his laddies squash themselves into the rear seats i wink at mike since hes a winky guy youre one hell of a mob boss two of your boys in the baby seats mike is prepared to argue that one you think i should have brought two vehicles what about the environment what about my carbon footprint laddie laddie you really should drop that it is too hilarious in the car says mike straightfaced i can see im wearing him down we drive across town and i cant get to grips with the fact that its all over for me once we get wherever were going and mike madden ascertains that i do not in fact have this mysterious secretagenttype disk then he will most likely shoot me in the heart a disk this is beyond weird what the hell is zeb doing with a disk all he knows about computers could be written on one of those horse pills he sells to irritablebowel patients or the stopgo crowd as he sensitively refers to them nearly dead i think trying to nail the idea home nearly dead now but no sickening feeling of dread seeps through even the thought of torture to come doesnt penetrate my calm thats because i dont believe any of this this week has been too bizarre to be real my brain is waiting for me to wake up in a tangle of sweatsheened sheets you cant go from doorman to superman in a week not if you want to survive i do want to survive but i cant see how im going to manage it we pass chequers diner and the park i see carmél the waitress joshing it up with a customer a guy in a hunters cap he swats her behind and she pours him a refill smile bigger than a slice of melon i didnt know there was a backsideswatting option maybe there wasnt for me barely ten pm and already the streets are drying up cloisters is a daytime town leafy suburbs and fourwheel drives wooden houses filling their lots right to the fences and expansive parks with softfall areas for the little kids our sordid world fires a shot across the bows of decency once in a while but according to the cloisters chronicle this small town has the third lowest crime rate in the country and the second highest literacy rate its nice to live in a place where people still prefer books to tv ghost zeb doesnt let me get too deep into the maudlin its a bit late for community spirit partner dont tell me if you survive the night then slotz gets turned into a soup kitchen and st daniel spends his days in a soutane dispensing homely wisdom with every bowl of chowder chowder splutters irish mike jesus laddie dont crack up yet the night is young thinking aloud again bad sign i really wish that man would stop with the laddie bit its offensive maybe a sharp elbow in the ribs would knock the leprechaun out of him but then i might not reach journeys end alive and find out what happened to zeb very good point excellent in fact hold on to that where are we headed i ask mike pleasantly you never know he might tell me shut the hell up mcevoy then again we dont drive for that long nowhere is too far away in cloisters on our short trip we pass eight churches and three patrol cars god and guns thats what we put our faith in here red bulbs buzz overhead stretching down through the blocks like landing lights pretty soon were pulling around back of a familiar strip mall zebs place last time i was here i was loading a corpse into a trunk it makes sense to finish things at the clinic a couple of bodies in a burntout fire trap would have accidental death written all over them end of the line laddie says mike and i feel each stone crunch under the benzs tyres as the vehicle slows maybe i think suddenly gripped by the absolute certainty that if i go into that building on mikes terms i am dead but not the way you expect it laddie what im about to do doesnt seem part of the real world its one of those ideas that generally would never make it past the goodsense filter in my head but for the past few days that filter has been switched off and when a notion like this occurs to me i fear the switch may be jammed so two men in front two behind and irish mike to my left all armed all dangerous but all also pretty confined in their movements and probably not expecting me to buck such superior numbers if i am going to act it needs to be right now before the seat belts come off i snort a few breaths to psych myself up then make my move okay five targets here we go first i give irish mike the heel of my hand in his windpipe that should keep him gasping for five minutes his eyes bug out like hes been shot in the arse with a harpoon a vision i will hopefully have a chance to play back for jason he loves that kind of thing the guys in the back are first to react so i reach under the middle row seats yank the adjustment bars and using my legs as pistons drive them into the men behind the seats slide back smoothly on their rails god bless german engineering shins splinter and maybe an ankle one guys head cracks the rear window no weapons drawn as yet part of me feels like im watching this happen its as though someone else is taking decisive action and im somehow observing from a distance and not altogether approving of whats going on still two guys in front i reach past irish mikes spasming torso and flick the seat levers on the front seats shifting my weight forward i slam the seats till their hinges pop pinning irish mikes men to the dash one still has an arm free to reach for his gun so i dislocate the shoulders ballandsocket joint with a punch in the armpit this is working out pretty well all things considered my giddy side wants to giggle but i choke it down later for the girlishness the benz fills up with groans like were under water and theres a sea anemone of blood on the windscreen we roll ten feet and one wheel mounts the kerb swatting a trashcan i give irish mike one more whack because hes such a dick then im out of the vehicle sprinting for zebs back entrance my boots crunch on the loose stones and theres a cold mist on my face that tastes like life i relish the movement and wetness for a moment until i reach the delivery door and i need to concentrate once more all the guns i own and not one of them in my possession the door opens inwards and theres yet another of mikes potato heads coming wideeyed to investigate the trashcan ruckus this guy i almost feel sorry for his gun is dangling by his side and im bearing down on him snarling like an angry bear he manages an oh before i tuck my head under his arm and tackle him into the shop the oh shoots up a couple of octaves then were halfway across the room the guys toes are dragging the floor and his elbows beat a tattoo on my back for all the good it does him maybe if he had the wits or time to use his gun no wits and definitely no time mother he says mudda swearing or calling for his mom who knows a wall rears and i put him into it through two layers of sheetrock a timber frame and neatly on to the dentists chair cant be good for a persons insides still better to be safe than sorry so i scramble through the jagged hole and clang mikes moaning man on the temple with a handy rinsing pan no more moaning no alarm either an alarm would have been nice wait there is moaning behind me in zebs homeopathic store its me idiot i am alive zeb no way mikes man surrenders his weapon without a struggle a nice shiny colt seven in the mag one in the pipe presuming this guy lets call him steve presuming steve keeps his weapon loaded mcevoy you bastard a roar from outside irish mike has recovered quickly and is done with laddie come out mcevoy good thats good they dont want to come in theres still a slim chance of course i should have killed them all and then the chance might have some weight to it i tumble through a haze of chalk and sawdust back into zebs unit there is blood on the floor glistening in the tube light tracked in long arcs across the carpet and concrete the shiniest track leads to a shivering shape in the corner its my friend zeb taped to his own office chair theyve been playing human pinball with him zebs eyes are half closed theres a bruise covering most of his face and blood drips from his fingertips his crafty eyes are shrouded by bruised lids and of his sharp hustler features there is no sign he looks bad and probably feels worse if hes feeling anything at all i spin the chair to face me zeb tell me quick what did you do bout time zeb spits through blood bubbles paramol ibuprofen under the safe i shake him and a cut under his eye weeps blood no tell me what the hell is the disk zeb coughs and something whines in his chest no disk all bullshit come on dan pills this is how it gets after such a beating pain is the only thing in zebs life he doesnt care about living or dying just pain okay okay i pick through the bottles under the safe most of them have handwritten labels cheap generic pills zeb making a buck any way he can five minutes mike i shout at the ceiling five minutes to find this goddamn disk no answer for a moment just dragging footsteps and the clink of metal then five minutes mcevoy i hear any sirens and i burn this place to the ground great i have three hundred seconds and nothing to bargain with paramol i find a bottle and run a finger along the instructions fuck the dosage howls zeb give them all to me not happening in zebs state he would chew those things until his heart went asleep i pop the bottle shake out a double dose and zeb eats them out of my hand like a pony chewing sugar lumps by the time ive torn the tape from his wrists my restored friend is enjoying a little chemical calm where were you man he sobs then finishes with a jagged giggle ive been broadcasting sending out signals holding complete conversations with you couldnt you hear me call i didnt hear shit says ghost zeb i heard you brother i say im here now youve got to tell me what you did i stayed alive thats what i did not proud but i did it i shake him gently what did you do come on zeb tell me zeb blinks like hes about to nod off i did mike maddens hair like i did you dan sweet set of transplants hair transplants no way not all this assholes paranoid let me tell you brought in students from china to assist so they wouldnt know who he was little hands they had did lovely work in six months youll never know mike will have a head of hair that would make pierce brosnan crap himself time is awasting lovely work great so whats the problem even with a mashed face zeb manages a guilty expression it was an opportunity i couldnt pass it up from outside two minutes mcevoy you better pull the rabbit out of the hat laddie zeb chuckles laddie always with the laddie you irish all retards what opportunity zeb these people are going to kill us not you dan not you my big pet schwarzenegger i bet youve fucked up a few of them already he has a point maybe but why are they after me zeb zeb studies the blood on his fingers no clue where it came from i told mike i filmed the procedure said id put it on youtube the irish in new york would piss themselves you should have seen him during the operation big baby cried like a baby wouldnt let me smoke or anything that is unbelievable i know said zeb thickly im always careful with the ash not the cigarette you tried to blackmail a crime lord hardly a lord what has he got like a dozen men only twenty grand thats all i asked for twenty grand to destroy the disk s a bargain but there was no disk zeb hiccups and blood rims his gums course fucking not do you see any cameras it only occurred to me later i grit my teeth and when did you tell mike that i had the disk zeb wheels himself backwards two days dan for two days i swore that it was all a lie two fucking days with the teethpunching and the headbanging against the wall some fucking warehouse in ackroyd theres pieces of me all over that shithole then you told mike that i had it yeah i said that zebs chin drops to his sternum what else could i do youre a tough irish motherfucker dan i knew these whiskey gangsters couldnt drop you no way youd kill them all and save me it was my only hope this is a lot of talking for a man with broken bones and missing teeth and zeb collapses into a spasm of wet coughs idiot i shout at his shuddering frame for eight hundred years all we irish have had is our pride and you try to strip it away from a dangerous man zeb spits blood and a tooth it sits like an iceberg in the sunset sea a mistake dan i see that now but dont let me die here work something out play the celtic card zeb is crying wringing his hands the celtic card i do have one up my sleeve maybe the front door booms as a forearm is repeatedly bashed against it lights flicker with the force im guessing that the five minutes are up to hell with both of you calls irish mike madden to hell in flames orange flickers beyond the blinds could be a cop car more likely a makeshift torch mike is going to burn us out i rack my brain for the thread of an idea something to reel sanity back in nothing just more lunacy concentrate really hard and teleport dig an underground tunnel call the cops britesmile says zeb bright smile or britesmile of course go through the dentists where i deposited steve im a little embarrassed that a punchdrunk surgeon came up with that before me i take two steps towards the jagged hole before the breeze chills the sweat on my forehead theres someone in there then a voice steves out cold mcevoy took his gun steve no way irish mike calls from outside we got the exits covered mcevoy you try to run and youre dead maybe on my own i could make it but not hefting zeb i tap a finger on my temple trying to focus okay mike you win lets talk close quarters is my speciality but i need to get them close before i can be special irish mike mulls this offer over for a minute very well laddie throw steves gun next door and your shoes too then go stand in the corner shoes whats that all about what does he think im a sole ninja i toss the colt through the hole and my boots then traipse into the corner behind zeb feeling like a naughty schoolboy i bet mike would be an arsehole to work for pussy says zeb his voice barely more than a whisper i held out for two days if his ear was not crusted with blood and mucus i would smack it you shut up or pass out and let me handle this yeah maybe you can take off your pants thatll teach em zeb never lets up at least when he was in my head i didnt have to look at him and that is my best friend christ irish mike comes in the back door flanked by two of his lieutenants one is hobbling and the other is sporting a nose that wouldnt look out of place in a boxing ring mike himself wears a sunburn of anger a little less cocky though i think they shuffle slowly forward through the blood tracks and the supplement boxes never taking their eyes off me a third heavy appears at the hole in the wall squinting down the barrel of a machine pistol mike swallows and gags you prick he says gingerly massaging his throat who hits people in the neck what kind of person are you i dont answer whats the point after a minutes scowling mike is done feeling sorry for himself ill live i guess he lights a cigarette with a long wooden match sucking hard bending the flame so mcevoy wheres the disk zeb is whimpering softly maybe he has the right idea there are three criminals pointing weapons at us and i dont have any good news for them we are flanked in a small room with no hope of escape except if these people are sufficiently dim to relax their guard again heres the thing mike there is no disk never was i cant resist rapping zebs crown this gobshite tried to bluff you then dragged me in when negotiations turned painful mike conducts with his cigarette yeah see thats what the doc told me shortly after he told me there was a disk so whats true and what aint i cant tell trust me mike im irish were irish i swear on the tricolour theres no disk this dick wouldnt know how to use a camera mike reaches under his soft cap scratching his head thats touching laddie the irish connection but you know as well as i do that the gaels have been cutting each others throats for centuries its gonna take more than that so what else have we got in common we got that itch i say pointing a finger mike whips his hand down like hes been slapped by a nun what itch what the hell are you talking about is that what this is all about irish mike madden got some new hair and hes feeling a little sensitive about it fuck you shouts mike then dissolves into a racking cough those neck jabs really take it out of a person come on mike this is the twentyfirst century surgery is a positive thing it shows you care about your appearance a hair transplant today is like a barbershop shave fifty years ago if you can afford it do it zactly mutters zeb thats what ive been saying it is exactly what hes been saying im just regurgitating the spiel that zeb sold me no one cares mike you know how many americans had surgery last year have a guess go on hazard a guess i dont wait for a guess in case zeb gave mike the speech too twelve million can you believe that twelve million chances are at least one of your boys had liposuction in the past month the beefcake on mikes left blushes a little then points his gun at my forehead mike pulls himself together yeah what would you know about it i know about it i shoot back because i have that itch too its time for the cap to come off i try to do it nonchalant like i show people all the time i peel off the hat and stand there in all my transplanted glory mike squints a little then beckons me forward under the light i oblige tilting my head so the shorter guys can get a look i gotta say the boss says finally thats not half bad you should have seen him six weeks ago grunts zeb fucking cue ball now those hairs will fall out before they grow back but it gives you an idea still itches a little zeb is obviously getting his second wind its all in your head the itch doesnt last for more than a week mike is legitimately itchy he has the scabs from two thousand lateral cuts youre just a fruitcake mike pokes his scalp gingerly its driving me crazy i wanna shoot people all the time last wednesday i almost smacked my little girl i try to appear shocked as though knowing mike as well as i do littlegirlsmacking would be totally out of character your own little girl jesus i must have oversold it yeah dont take the piss mcevoy well you know hitting daughters in general its not good is it mike reaches to scratch his head then stops himself screw this your hair looks good ill give you that it gives me hope for the future but this asshole tried to blackmail me over what a hair transplant just how sensitive are you mike all of this for a hair transplant mike rears forward suddenly kicking zeb in the chest forcing his chair backwards this is not about the transplant that is not the fucking point he tried to blackmail me i gotta make an example this is priceless an example who do you think is watching mike where exactly do you think you are i shout the next line to the ceiling this is cloisters mike cloisters the local pd will tolerate you until the moment you kill someone then your arse is going to the slammer my guess mike is theyre already up on your cell phones and have your club under surveillance i dont mention the multiple homicide in the brass ring madden scowls you dont know me well enough to call me mike laddie mister madden will do just fine my mouth is running away with me now and another thing now that i think of it no one ever said laddie in ireland thats scotland youre thinking about same country offers one of mikes dimmer boys madden is horrifed same country same fucking country jesus christ henry i knew i shouldnt have hired you in fact youre fired this gets a few laughs as the firing is performed jabbedfinger apprentice style with all the attention on poor henry i decide to go close quarters it doesnt take more than a second and the atmosphere in this cramped reception area is so surreal with the strip lights and dust clouds that nobody can quite believe whats happening they keep right on laughing as i launch myself off the back of zebs chair snag macey barretts stiletto from the ceiling tile and land among them mikes men are knocked aside like skittles they tumble away from me as though i am at the centre of a blast zone cupboards collapse and zebs fake marble worktop splinters and splits you move quick for a sixfooter says mike as the steel tickles the underside of his chin im never going to learn thats twice its a tense situation i can smell gun oil and nerves my perspective is skewed by the prolonged tension and im seeing everything through a fish eye wannabe gangsters bob in and out of my vision huge pistols bearing down on me like train tunnels stay calm dan focus ghost zeb is that you no this would be real zeb shite mike is real angry now what next mcevoy my boys are jumpy enough as it is you think this kind of stunt is calming them down any time to pull myself together i want to see the transplants mike see how theyre healing up mikes face collapses in on itself like his mouth is a black hole what the are you kidding me see the transplants my shrink tells me im not ready shrink do all you guys have shrinks now tony soprano made it okay soprano never had a hair transplant laddie i push the blade a quarter of a centimetre into his neck one more laddie one more i hear a couple of schnicks and wideeyed hulks shift in my peripheral vision mikes boys are considering independent action mike raises a palm hold it wait you morons you shoot him that blade goes into my neck something occurs to him is that maceys stiletto theres no point denying it so i dont he was doing that shuffle thing i had no choice so the whole brass ring thing was a setup two birds one stone it seemed like a plan irish mike actually sniffs i gave macey that blade yeah well he should have kept it in his pants he was my best and brightest if thats true you really are screwed i grab the peak of irish mikes hat and twist it from his head aaargh he screams as though i have inflicted actual pain and i feel a moments regret its hard taking off the hat out in the world there are hundreds of tiny scabs ranged across mikes freckled scalp like rows of troops dense a lot denser than mine i had a whole team working on mike mutters zeb you get what you pay for prick says mike and i cant help agreeing with him one of mikes scabs is floating a little high so i poke it with my thumb theres your problem i say like im concerned infection you havent been taking your antibiotics mikes eyes flick to his lieutenants guilty i wanted a few beers you cant drink on those things looks pretty painful zeb this infection could it get nasty zeb catches on quick sure balls nasty your whole scalp is gonna feel like a septic pimple transplants fall out and you got a head full of scar tissue looks like a thirddegree burn zeb is full of shit but mike buys it scar tissue huh youll be like an extra from a romero movie mike is incensed this is typical of you service guys you never hear the downside beforehand its all roses until you hit an underground pipe or you find a lump you werent expecting or your fucking head explodes with pus time to wrap up my argument the point is mike you need zeb to keep an eye on you for a year make sure the wounds heal maybe put in a fresh crop you kill him now and its the public clinic for you try keeping that quiet its a strong argument well put so thats the case for him what about you me you could try to kill me but your organisation is going to be a whole lot weaker afterwards face it mike you have limited resources and macey barrett was your numberone guy i turn the stiletto a little to focus mikes attention on the subject guys like him have a hard time accepting their own mortality unless its tickling their jugular hey okay jesus laddie you drive a hard bargain i let him have that laddie so we walk mike shrugs sure but i aint paying for checkups zeb chews his lip but manages a single grudging positive grunt and you cover victor joness debt onetime payment and i send one of my staff around with the monthly mike nods any more and hell impale himself fuck that i collect myself keep an eye on your operation thats good enough good enough i say i withdraw the stiletto and a rivulet of blood flows down mikes neck pooling in the cup of his sternum he sponges it with a shirtsleeve this is not good for me making deals if word gets out that this asshole tried to blackmail irish mike madden and got off with a beating he doesnt need to say any more that kind of rumour could be disastrous a wave of welshers and con artists would rise up in the morning dont worry about that i say soothingly one word from zeb and i will deliver him to you myself one of mikes men is not taking this negotiation well his face is drawn tight with outrage i know the type a bully with a gun this guy is going to be whispering in mikes ear how i have to die soon as im out the door his jaw starts flapping i look him in the eye and wince you got something wrong with your face mcevoy you in pain not me i say and shatter his kneecap with my heel its a funny thing to see a leg bend the wrong way not funny haha the guy goes down sideways like a blackandwhite movie drunk snapping off shots as he goes one hits his partner the scotlandireland guy in the gluteus maximus he drops to his knees gasping go dan coughs zeb just kill them all wed be better off in the long run i put irish mike between me and the shooter in the other room who cant do much except holler but then another muscle man the driver comes barrelling in the back door this throws me off altogether presumably this guy was out for the count but now hes obviously awake and pissed how pissed without saying a word the guy shoots zeb in the shoulder suppressor on the pistol too classy scheherazade blurts zeb as he falls backwards in the chair as far as i know scheherazade is a character from arabian nights and i have no idea why zeb would say this maybe i misheard while im thinking about this irish mike spins and demonstrates why hes the boss unleashing a massive uppercut that takes me squarely under the chin my feet actually leave the ground then im on the floor my head between zebs knees and the stiletto six feet away stars are blinking before my eyes and its all over two seconds maybe three neck punch shouts mike eyes bright with triumph howd you like that laddie you had it coming fuck you and fuck you again what was i thinking this was never going to end well too many unknowns my unbelievable winning streak had to peter out sometime a pity it had to be with my head between zebs legs my ears are wet with the sticky flow of zebs blood and something clicked when i took the blow my jaw a couple of teeth the pain is too big to pinpoint its origin be nice to have a flashback now hear some inspirational music turn into a super soldier your head is on my balls man complains zeb who isnt dead yet thats embarrassing i dont want to be found like this me neither i dont want to be found at all the clinic is whirling and i feel sick to the pit of my stomach i smell blood sweat maybe urine zeb you piss yourself screw you ive been in this chair for ever how can we be bantering like this in the face of oblivion is this the most important thing after all communication we lie in a tangle of limbs like discarded mannequins ready for the bonfire and i feel certain that this is what mike has in mind one little inferno and all the evidence goes away i crane my neck relieving the pressure on zebs testicles and looking into my friends eyes i have to know before i die what the hell is scheherazade man that just came out its a safe word says zeb shamefacedly sometimes the s and m hookers ask for a safe word in case things get a bit out of hand i wouldnt even be telling you this if we werent about to die and i wasnt riding the painkiller wave christ a safe word they dont work outside of cathouses or dungeons and dragons my breathing seems loud and there are screams bouncing off the walls the buttshot guy and the bustedknee guy are yelling up a storm i cant even hope for a quick death now mike is shouting something but its like hes in a perspex booth his voice seems muffled and far away let you live why would i do that okay im tuning in now why would he let me live there is a reason i almost have it when mike stamps on my knee no break but painful as hell you like that mcevoy huh isnt this what they call poetic justice i do to you like you did to my man i am going to kill you slow laddie not your friend though he gets patched up to keep an eye on my new hair zeb finds himself a set of brass ones screw you madden you kill dan you better kill me too lets see if the horrific torture youre about to witness can change your mind yeah mutters zeb torture might do it mike embraces the shooter calvin that was outstanding work one shot on the move takes out the doctor and creates a diversion you pricks see that the pricks in question are writhing on the floor but still they make time for a yes mister madden that was quite a punch you threw mister madden says calvin who is no idiot yes laddie we make a good team you are my new number two barrett is dead long live calvin all this loveydovey gangster talk is giving my brain time to stop vibrating i had a plan b in case everything turned to crap plan b and then i remember tommy fletcher my ace in the green hole ballyvaloo i blurt before my mind loses it not much of a safe word notes zeb but it means something to irish mike he quits hugging his new number two and walks towards me with a face like thunder what did you say ballyvaloo i repeat spitting blood on my shirt what the fuck is a ballyvaloo wonders calvin i rub my tender jaw not what where mike raises his foot to stomp on me then thinks better of it tell me what youve done tell me nothing not yet mike is a reasonably smart guy it doesnt take him long to make the leap let me guess if i kill you then my mother is murdered blah blah blah youre bluffing mcevoy you havent set anything up you looked me up on the internet and found that i bought my dear mother a retirement cottage in ireland period shoot the fucker calvin i stare calvin down pull that trigger and mummy is dead calvin is conflicted do what the boss says or possibly be indirectly responsible for killing the bosss mother one phone call mike then do what you like look in my eyes and tell me im lying its a stupid line but at this moment i am as serious as a shattered kneecap or a bullet in the arse mike glares into my eyes snuffling like a hungry dog and apparently finds some truth in there one call mcevoy if you have harmed my mother if you have so much as disturbed her supper if i have to endure one more diatribe yeah yeah give me my phone irish mike tosses me my phone which is actually barretts phone it takes me three attempts to get the number in tiny buttons big bloodslicked fingers not a good combination its international i say trying to sound conversational so i dont want to stay on too long mikes stare could strip paint put it on speaker shithead for all i know you could be calling up your bookie fair point i find the speaker button and twist my little finger into it a shrill double brrrrp blasts from the phone weird ring says zeb now totally in the paramols clutches its like brrrrp and then another one exactly the same its true international ring tones can be surprising shattered kneecap is whining so mike has butt shot drag him out back the tension levels in the room drop instantly they go right back up again when the phone is answered by a gruff irish voice aye who is it real irish from the heart of belfast an accent to make the hardest hard man long for a mothers bosom to nuzzle yeah corporal its me dan sergeant mcevoy okay to drop the hammer no negative corporal just confirm your position christ sarge i already popped the old dear and a few of the cousins too bastard howls irish mike bastaard there follows a satisfied chuckle that reminds me of corporal fletcher shooting close to desert mutts just to see them jump irish mike madden i presume just kidding pal but now you know how its going to feel a little taste mike is winded as though gutpunched his eyes are suddenly bloodshot and his hands shake where are you where i am in the dunes above ballyvaloo looking down on a lovely little cottage smoke coming out of the chimney a light in the window sure its like a fucking postcard itd be an awful shame to lob a mortar on to that thatch mike gets his wind back you are dead you hear me deceased you know who i am i will fucking corporal tommy fletcher chuckles once more this time rolling into a fully fledged laugh that overloads the phones tiny speaker breaking into crackling static he keeps laughing until mike shuts the hell up you finished mike hey i understand youre a good son a tough guy but listen to me mike youre in over your head now before sergeant mcevoy carried me out of a war zone i did some time in the rangers thats special operations to joe public ive buried more bodies in the desert than youve had blow jobs from your hookers i leave one coded message on a website and a hundred guys are on a plane to new jersey we will bury you so deep that youll be sleeping with the dinosaurs i can do things to your mother that will make her curse your name you want that mike i

old lady maybe an eye i ticktock my head thinking about it no i think mike gets it hes top man in a big operation here you dont get to be top man by being stupid am i right mike irish mike is having a hard time dealing with the situation its affecting his entire being the power of speech seems to have deserted him and his head is bulging in places where bulges should not be hes snorting like a bull in the ring and his hands are raised strangling an invisible person am i right mike i prompt or do i tell my corporal to proceed youre right says mike dully this doesnt have to go any further i think we can call it a day he lifts a hand finger crooked to scratch his scalp nuuh mister madden admonishes zeb no scratching you want scars is that it youre right of course no scratching i speak clearly into the phone did you get that tommy stand down say again was it stand down or go to town because i can go to town on this old lady right now stand down you crazy bastard do not hurt mrs madden okay sarge copy keep tabs though right thats a roger i say military speak always unsettles civilians im off for a pint then if theres no shooting to be done talk to you tomorrow tomorrow and every day tommy hangs up and i fold the phone into my pocket you see how it is mike mike is dazed now arms dangling by his sides eyes heavylidded yeah i see what do you want i roll slowly to my knees and from there make the mammoth transition to standing upright this is not a shakedown mike all you have to do is go home its as simple as that everything else stays the same zeb does your checkups i pay protection and ill even throw in vics debt everyones as happy as they can be without true love im not happy moans zeb i got fucking shot i hoist him up by the elbow you needed to get shot this is all your fault who you talking to real zeb or ghost zeb i really hope zeb develops posttraumatic amnesia maybe i should give him a few more of his own pills mike is working his fists like he has walnuts in there okay were out of here this never happened one word of this around town and i got no choice but to take action my jaw is hurting now and i feel like taking a pop at mike to speed him on his way but i hold back fair enough i want my lexus back ill drive it over tomorrow with vics debt plus interest these guys and their interest screw your interest mike the rates are too fluid with you people mike nods slowly trying to find some closure this is a longterm arrangement but a man like him needs the final word otherwise he may just say screw it kill the both of us get a black armband and wear a hat for the rest of his life the gang boss takes two steps towards the back door then hesitates he turns back settling the soft cap over his head of scabs from the look on his face id say hes thought of a few final words my mother is an old woman he says she could go at any time after that there are a few cousins but i could give a fuck about them so the clock is ticking laddies when ma dies im coming after you those are pretty good words chapter i call deacon from outside the store shes at the hospital with a guy on the door so how you doing i ask wasting a few seconds on

sucks i say nodding in sympathy like she can see me you okay to dial the office and i lay out some throwntogether story about masked raiders let me get this straight mcevoy she says and i can almost hear her teeth chatter as she tries to grin you just happen by your friends store late at night and find him tied to a chair with a bullet in his shoulder this is worse than your last effort about me busting out of the freezer yeah detective shocking aint it an irishman who cant tell a story dan weve been through some shit and you did me a solid with that tension screw and saved your life those times and the lifesaving sure but im a cop first and foremost and i am watching you man i dont know how a fascinating and talented individual like yourself stayed off my radar for so long im a quiet guy detective from now on im back under the radar deacon laughs people like you and me dan trouble sniffs us out maybe you can hide out for a while maybe even a few years but eventually someone needs to be saved or someone needs to be killed im out of those businesses thats right i hear daniel mcevoy is a club owner these days news travels fast its temporary deacon sighs and i guess shes thinking about her expartner everythings temporary dan ill use my good fingers to expedite the an ambulance should be with you in ten see you real soon thanks ronnie ill call you zeb has somehow managed to give himself an injection of something while i was outside negotiating with the cavalry he sits pale under a flickering strip light eyes rolled back in his head and bloodslick shirt sticking to his chest zeb nothing whatever he dosed himself with is doing the trick man you look like a poster for a horror movie screw you dan still a few marbles in the jar then what was in that shot zebs irises roll down like slotmachine bars one of my own concoctions i am feeling no pain dan you see the ponies the ambulance is coming sirens and lights the whole nine yards the medics will want to know what you took zeb smiles and bubbles burst in the corner of his mouth i took as much as i could dan being shot is no joke this blackmail thing was my worst idea ever i beg to differ no that shemale last summer was the worst idea ever dont knock it says zeb then his eyes roll back in his head i wheel zeb and his chair outside just as the ambulance pulls into the lot a paramedic jumps out of the moving vehicle like hes auditioning for quentin tarantino he grabs me by the forearm did he take any drugs take your pick i say nodding towards the stores sign the paramedic pokes around zebs wound is he allergic to anything zeb allergic to drugs funny not so far hell live pronounces the paramedic after a cursory examination but its going to be a rough night good i say then go inside to get my boots slotz is doing good business by the time i get back jason is parading the street chatting with the university beer crowd where you gonna go he asks a group of guys sporting shorts and calf tattoos every other street in this town is dead you gotta curfew or something he spots me shuffling down the sidewalk hey hey bossman you all straight with irish mike i was worried i try to smile but my jaw

changed i realise i was expecting something not bluebirds and fruit punch but maybe a less oppressive atmosphere no vic cruising the floor throwing a jaundiced eye over everyones shoulder no lights off over the back booth but its sameold sameold the atmosphere is fakecheery and the girls are nothing but tired marco is the only ray of hope polishing glasses like they were diamonds working hard marco i say to the little barman pointing at the jameson bottle over his head he pours me a large one you ever see jason so happy hes out on the street selling this joint that boy is on fire i decide to make marcos night i promoted him to business manager marco flaps at me with his rag get the fuck out you did not yup true as god you wont regret it beams marco jason will work himself to death i take a sip of whiskey feeling it slide down my throat smooth as mercury have a word with him about the diamond i have a feeling he listens to you and i leave him openmouthed wondering if their secret is out i was hoping that the booth would be empty by the time i finished my drink no such luck one of brandis catwoman boots is protruding from the gloom and something is squeaking hopefully the upholstery this brandi issue has to be sorted out sometime it may as well be now get all my confrontations over in one night the booth has its own light switch under the tables rim and i flick it without warning first thing i see is a pale bloated stomach second is brandi down in the shadows writhing like a snake the guy with the stomach jerks so hard he bashes brandis head on the table rim what the his eyes focus and he sees me there looming over him best grim look in place cop tell me youre not a cop this is a respectable club sir no contact allowed brandi surfaces rubbing her crown jesus christ dan what the fuck i mean what the fuck i try to shame her with a look but brandi is impervious the booth action is done finished we talked about this she tries the old kissass routine come on baby a girls gotta eat now its my turn to be impervious maybe but she doesnt have to eat that bellyguy has lost the urge hey listen you two have got some kind of employment dispute why dont i give you some space to work it out communication is so important i cock my head waiting for a trademark ghost zeb comment nothing the ghost is gone reunited with his wounded self in st johns hospital alleluia yes sir why dont you tuck yourself in and try your luck at the tables i believe i shall says bellyguy formal with relief brandi watches her john skip around stools in his hurry to get away from me she is furious anyone with ten minutes elementary bodylanguage studies could see that her bottom lip is pushed out like a segment of blood orange and her cocked hip is sharp as a guillotine problem i enquire mildly her eyes flash and she wants to claw my eyes out but brandi is the consummate survivor no problem dan we got a few bumps thats all not even bumps implants and suddenly her breasts are wrapped around my arm took all of four seconds for her mood to swing no bumps i say flexing my bicep so her boobs pop off the booth is closed now you go do your job i wasnt sure i could flex enough to dislodge brandi but i did and it was cool i leave her wobbling and stride towards the office the phone is buzzing when i reach the desk in vics office but i let it ring out i need a minute to put my pieces back together my jaw throbs and my knuckles ache and i realise that i should have raided zebs painkiller stash i crank vics chair down a few more notches and settle back until my head touches the wall behind me my office my desk thats it crises over now i need to take stock of whats happened a lot of new things have come into my life and i dont know which ones i want to keep one thing is for certain as soon as zeb is back on his feet i am going to knock him on his arse after that i need to get my head straight then take a few days rest with nothing on my mind but food and drink my eyes begin to close and i dont fight it the familiar sounds of chips clicking glasses clinking and gamblers moaning in the casino beyond are almost like a lullaby relax i tell myself irish mike is off my back for the moment okay the sofia delano situation needs a little work but its not lifethreatening breathe in through the nose out through the mouth breathe in balls breathe out pussy as the marines say though i always thought that came off a little ambiguous getting there nearly calm now the phone rings again and i nearly fall out of the seat i slap the receiver out of its cradle what what now ronelle deacons laugh is like whiskey and cigarettes management too stressful for you dan you cracking up already i blink myself alert its been a long night detective a long week i sent a couple of uniforms over to your friends store quite a mess or to quote patrolman lewis big motherfucking hole in the motherfucking wall a couple quarts of blood too you wouldnt know anything about that not a thing i arrived after the fact zeb was the only one bleeding brandi slinks in the door making full use of her stripper training every movement is choreographed i see where this is going im in for a fullon booth negotiation dan she purrs we need to talk baby i raise one rigid finger in a minute i am not good at multitasking especially when there are people involved yeah thats what i thought continues deacon and you didnt see anything right not a thing but my friend bleeding i decide to use a little distraction technique come on ronnie its too late for work why dont you check out of that hospital and come on over here for a few drinks im in good with the management you still got nine fingers right more than enough to pick up a beer maybe when i solve this murder im working on from my sickbed woman killed outside slotz maybe you knew her my stomach lurches connie how could she have slipped my mind even for a moment anything i can do brandi is tapping her forearm she doesnt like to be kept waiting i grit my teeth and focus on the handset i got some more news on the murder weapon says ronnie quietly maybe there are nurses hovering i thought i could run it past you since we have such a special relationship unofficially of course as i am technically off duty for the foreseeable it was some kind of a blade no we got some metal fragments from the wound too soft for a blade maybe a tube like the tip of an umbrella with some kind of glittery substance on the shaft that ringing any bells mcevoy nothing pops out at me me neither this makes it a spurofthemoment thing our murderer could be anyone now could be staring us right in the face brandi sits opposite me and swings her legs on to the desk crossing them at the ankles her boots shine like gloss paint youll be thinking on it i dont say anything because suddenly there is no air in the room more than that the room has become a vacuum popping my ears and expanding my brain a metal tube glittery substance detective deacon is still talking right dan yo danny boy youre gonna work with me on this my fingers paw the desktop like a blind mans until i find the phone and cut ronnie off i hate people calling me danny boy my father used to do that and sing that goddamn dirge in pubs though no one asked him i know you want to make changes dan brandi is saying doing her best trailertrash talkshow spiel i know that and i respect you for it but i think if you look inside yourself youll find that youre still in shock over connie she never went in the booth so now youre gonna shut the booth down see what im saying brandis sixinch heels are in my face her trademark catwoman boots ive seen her kick sparks from the pavement with those boots she picks at a tiny square of body glitter on her forearm i hate to speak ill of the dead dan but that girls morals were costing us all money hell we lost a dozen highrollers last month because little virgin connie didnt want any hands on her ass my tips were way down and i need my tips cats gotta have her cream the phone is still at my ear beeping i cant seem to remember where it should go i aint missing her none of the girls are i can see how it happened they met in the parking lot words were exchanged connie and brandi differed on how the job should be done things got heated maybe a slap turned into a tussle connie went down and brandi put her heel through connies forehead shes capable of it god knows shes capable its true my gut knows it i stare at brandis heels mesmerised they are shining and wicked after the deed was done brandi stood at the door beside me building her alibi hell she probably had blood on her if anyone bothered to look so come on dan what do you say to a little action in the booth ill give you a free taste the heel glints and i see in the centre a tiny perfect circle of dried blood could be mud coffee anything its blood i swear i can smell it jason puts his head around the door hes half apologetic half smiling boss we got a lady outside looks like material girl madonna got a casserole for you says shes your wife you want me to show her the door i cant talk cant say a word i shake my head to defer the decision brandi doesnt want her meeting hijacked so dan is the booth back in business you want me to slide under that desk i keep shaking brandi killed connie should i bring her through shes pretty hot boss and that casserole smells amazing i manage one word just what dan just throw her out boss i try again just brandi is doing a few slinky dance moves just do it dan give me five minutes bring her in throw her out keep the food though right just wait i shout just wait a goddamn second the handset is still beside my ear and suddenly the beeping is replaced by a familiar voice that bitch murdered me says ghost connie she made orphans out of my alfredo and eva no not another one i slam the phone into its cradle not another ghost no way i want to go back in time i want to steal apples from an orchard in blackrock and eat them with my little brother on the beach i want to count the new stars as they switch on and stay out until were sure daddy is passed out drunk connie beautiful connie brandi deserves to be dropped in the river the look on brandis face tells me ive said this out loud she wants to laugh but is afraid to whos going in the river dan not me right all i want to do is sell a few handjobs thats not a crime is it i try to speak calmly jason please bring mrs delano to the back room tell her ill be with her in a minute brandi stay where you are you take one step towards the door and i swear to christ youll regret it but dan i am not in the mood for argument so i simply take my gun from the drawer and place it on the desk its a clear message hard to misinterpret but jason does anyway hey come on boss guns all of a sudden did mike initiate you into the gang what you got a shamrock tattoo now its a tense situation so i say something to jason that i regret before the echo fades get out jason go give marco a cuddle brandi shrieks with joy finally zing fuck you jason tough guy jason gives me a look like i shot his puppy and i feel like ive turned into my own father he closes the door softly and i start figuring how im going to make it up to him a weekend in atlantic city at least the elephant has left the room brandi crows her legs doing a little scissors kick on my desk you need to get rid of that faggot danny hes bad for business this switches my attention back to her and gives me a nice segue like connie was bad for business i say this ominously but brandis selfpreservation cat sense is switched off no not really id say jason would have no problem with some guy licking his ass id say thats exactly the kind of thing hed have zero problem with so youd get rid of him brandi winks her eyelid heavy with crusted glittering eyeshadow toss that boy on the street marco too we gotta make some business decisions like you got rid of connie i dont expect brandi to fall into that trap and she doesnt but her eyes give her away its not much just a quick flicker but i notice got rid of connie she says haltingly drawing her boots off the desk this to me seems like a crucial moment in the development of this whole confrontation for some reason i absolutely believe that if brandi gets her boots off the surface of vics desk my desk then i have lost whatever upper hand i had which was pretty crappy in the first place so brandi is pulling her boots away from me knees up around her pirate earrings but she doesnt move fast enough i reach out and grab her right ankle and squeeze it till the patent leather squeaks which kinda sucks the gravity from the moment this smells clean i say gritting my teeth with the effort of holding on to the boot and carrying on a conversation real clean i bet you used a whole pack of antiseptic wipes on this boot gotta keep germfree daniel says brandi her voice is superinnocent like a girl scout but her eyes are darting around the office like something or someone is going to pop up with another surprise you should have burned this pair brandi i know theyre your favourites but youve got others im rambling a bit but thats because half of me knows that the accusation im about to make is at best based on a hunch and at worst based on supernatural intervention why the fuck are we talking about my boots first no booth now you have something against my boots let go of my goddamn leg dan you should have burned them i say again using my old trick of repeating myself to buy a second because all the blues need is one strand of dna caught in a stitch all they need to do is match your heel to the hole in connies head brandi is a little pale under her makeup let go of my leg daniel youre hurting me is this what she should say is this what an innocent person would say arent you going to tell me that youre innocent protest and so forth and so forth who the fuck are you i admit it that was a little dr moriarty im taking this boot to the cops if they find nothing then no harm done and you can jerk whoevers pecker you like for a month but if they find some trace then there wont be any peckers where youre going brandi sees in my face that this isnt one she can talk her way out of get your hands off me asshole whats the problem just give me the boot and you get to rule the roost around here so long as you had nothing to do with connie brandi sneers at the sheer volume of dumbness in my plan i dont care if that boot has connies eyeball stuck on the heel youre still the one handing it over the jilted boyfriend that takes a moment to sink in but shes right even if brandi owns the murder weapon it doesnt mean she did the murdering ill take my chances the police will look closely at both of us something i have no problem with halfway through this last sentence i try to take brandi by surprise standing suddenly and yanking the boot with me hoping it will come clean off but brandi is ready and curls her toes going up with the boot now i am in the cartoon situation of holding a grown woman upsidedown by the ankle shite i say seems appropriate what next dan asks brandi her hair brushing the floor i worked the pole for years i can do this all night i dont know what next i really dont i cannot believe the situation in which i find myself standing in my exbosss office holding the stripper who possibly murdered my potential sweetheart aloft by her ankle it pains me to say it but this girl is heavy and my bicep is aching already hey says brandi having a lightbulb moment are you wired this thought freaks her out so much that she does a pretty impressive stripper move and folds herself upwards swinging her other leg around and suddenly there is an angry woman on my shoulders i hear something scrape along the desktop and a quick glance is enough to confirm that she has snagged my gun on the way up brandis legs are strongly muscled and shes doing her damnedest to squeeze my brain out of my ears i feel a metallic ring digging into my scalp through my cap and i realise that i probably have two seconds to live before brandi composes herself and flicks the safety amazingly i am almost as worried about brandi damaging the hair grafts as i am about sudden death i take two rapid steps forward around the side of the desk its instinct really im just trying to get away as i clear the desk i hear a dull bong like a bell in a sack and brandi goes over backwards her legs are still locked but her upper half is dazed shes cracked her head on something metal the ceiling beam i remember barely sixandahalffoot clearance the immediate danger is past and so i take a second to assess to look at myself from afar i see a middleaged craggylooking exsoldier standing in the middle of his office panting like a donkey with a stripper wrapped around his neck and its not even the strangest situation hes been in today jason comes through the door and his face is red with chokeddown rage i dont blame him hey screw you daniel he says barging all the way in still pissed about the give marco a cuddle comment eyes burning holes in the floor its bad enough that i gotta go around every second of my life but then i actually try to help you and you throw that shit at me i gulp down a couple of breaths like theres a shortage and try to get my middleaged heart to slow down a little while jason folds his arms apparently oblivious to the person around my neck the least i can do is apologise okay jason that comment about marco was crude i was going for lighthearted i know about the gay thing and i dont care but it came out all spiteful so you know sorry i misjudged jason softens a little but hes gonna hold it over me for a while okay daniel you get one chance next time we find out how tough you really are i hang my head in shame which is not easy with brandis thigh in the way i hear you man do you want to hug or something jason frowns what am i a walton i am a crap modern man i just assumed okay i say you call the cops i gotta take the boots off this unconscious exstripper jason seems to suddenly notice brandi but it doesnt faze him in our line of work we see stranger shit than this at least once a week epilogue zeb is back in business after a week bolstering his system in cloisters general he was finally kicked out having been caught on video loitering around the pharmacy with obvious intent the blues questioned him for six hours straight over the incident at his store but he stuck to his story got hit on the head from behind woke up in an ambulance dont remember anything they questioned me too but deacon took the lead and she was prepared to swallow my monumental crock of shit in light of all my lifesaving efforts i tried to mention the word freezer as much as possible while giving my final statement the file is pretty much closed and im hoping it will be gathering dust soon the brandi file on the other hand is wide open deacon ran the boot through the lab they found blood bone brain matter dna the works brandis boot was the murder weapon no doubt about it unfortunately brandi fled custody from the hospital before the tests came back and fled the state shortly after that pausing only to raise funds at a slotz regulars house in the suburbs she was last sighted in florida so here i am back to the quiet life in cloisters again all the craziness seems totally unreal could it have actually happened just last week all that crap in a couple of days when things had been pretty quiet for over a decade not a single person killed less than a dozen in the hospital and a couple of them were faking trauma for legal reasons then faber comes along and things go red all over again did any of it happen i know it did because connies kids are in a foster home instead of watching tv with their mom its not an institution and the mcguffins are good people and im gonna visit every week like i promised but its still a foster home what i should have done looking at it now in retrospect was to walk into the casino and kick good old mister faber so hard in the balls that any mischiefmaking he was cooking up in his ginger head would have disintegrated along with his favourite executive toys but i didnt do that since i cant see into the future and apply it to the past so it all went ahead and happened i sat down and watched barrett bleed out ive still got blood on my cuff or i used to until i burned that shirt and flushed the ashes it took three flushes crappy plumbing ronnie deacons words echo in my mind people like you and me dan trouble sniffs us out maybe you can hide out for a while maybe even a few years but eventually someone needs to be saved or someone needs to be killed no it wont be like that for me i was superman for a week but now im just a bald guy with a humdrum job no more quick thinking crazy coincidences or lunatic plans i feel a little antsy walking into work this afternoon because todays the day mikes coming to personally collect his payment also he says the brakes on the lexus are whistling a little and i gotta take care of it which is a crock cos that lexus was braking fine when i sent it over i look around and the car park is empty but for the aforementioned lexus and my ghosts i can hear cars passing on the street and they seem a long way away i yank my hat off my head defiantly revealing my head in public for the first time postop in some kind of gesture symbolising i dont know what maybe ive turned a corner maybe there are things more important than a head of hair zeb says the bald patch will be gone and thats enough for me no more needles in the scalp so thats no more killing lunatic plans needles in the head the club is quiet except for jason in the foyer pulling on a giant rubber band that he swears does wonders for his abs gotta keep myself looking good for marco he grunts i swear that guy bats his eyes at every queer on the strip this statement is more important than it sounds jason is being casual like this to show me im forgiven i stop for a minute trying to think of something to say that wont open the wound again hug in your dreams danny you better go in mikes waiting mike is waiting in my chair which is a bit of a cheek but after the month ive had im finding myself very tolerant of things that dont threaten to immediately kill me mister madden i say squeezing into the old wooden chair on the visitors side of the desk hoping it doesnt collapse which might startle mike into shooting me hows tricks i mean business tricks not prostitution obviously mike does not glare at me he is calm a man biding his time business is good danny boy booming people always want shite you know so i give them the shite they want and to be honest i cant get hold of the shite fast enough seems as though mike is afraid of wires and likes the word shite and hows tricks with you daniel business i mean i give the standard irish tellemnothin response ah sure you know not too bad mike winces not what i hear i hear vic jones is causing a few problems its true victor has a lawyer claiming that the poker game never happened and he signed his lease away under duress with aj and brandi in the wind the only other witnesses to the game are the two girls whose future we played for jason has a team out looking for them but even if we do find them a poker lease transfer may not hold up as it wasnt agreed to by the owner but i say dont worry about vic you get your shite no matter whos behind the desk mike smiles and touches the peak of his soft cap oh im not worried danny boy i always get whats due to me i decide to change the subject hows your mother doing mikes smile grows so i can see his ivoryyellow fangs shes old dan and she has a bit of a flu lets hope it doesnt develop into something i should have picked another subject to change to the door to my office opens and zebs head appears weirdly disembodied in the gap i wasnt expecting to see him today but hes probably drunk or bored or both on seeing us he calls hey its the hairy boys whats up gangstas mike tries to rip off the armrest but its one of those testedinspace toughened materials and resists his efforts he shoots me a look and mutters you know danny i love my ma but theres going to come a point with this guy i hear you i say forgetting for a moment that if zeb goes in the river the next splash i hear will be my own zeb is unconcerned by this death threat come on guys im bustin your chops thats all shoving firecrackers up your asses is what makes life worth living youre a funny one dr zeb says mike firecrackers indeed you want to pull yourself together before you say the wrong thing to the wrong person i add the force of my glares to mikes you should take a photo zeb i say because this is me agreeing with mike zeb takes what looks like a clay urn from a pocket and pulls a cork out with his teeth oh come on motherfuckers lets do shots this stuff will put hair on your chests mike grabs the urn and takes a sniff how about my head will it put hair on my head sure says zeb dipping his fingers into a cluster of glasses on the shelf plus its got a kick like a mule on steroids monks make it from yak spit totally illegal totally illegal eh mike is intrigued how much you paying for that bottle zeb smells a profit ten bucks i could sell it to you for twelve mike and zeb put their heads together and start horse trading as though the former had never kidnapped the latter who had just tried to blackmail the former for a second i cant remember which one of them is my friend and when i do remember i cant figure out why maybe its time i tried forgetting instead of remembering just for an hour or two hey zeb i say pour me a glass of that yak spit we can talk about the brakes later
