stephen hunter point of impact the first book in the bob lee swagger series to ch you tried like hell only accurate rifles are interesting colonel townsend whelen acknowledgments the author would like to thank the many people who helped him in the preparation of this book while acknowledging that he alone is responsible for all errors of omission or commission john feamster of tuscaloosa alabama was especially generous in time and effort bob lopez randi henderson lenne miller jean marbella joe fanzone mike hill and weyman swagger in the baltimore area lent support when it was needed in new york my editor ann harris helped me find out what my own book was about and wouldnt let me stop working until i did and my agent victoria gould pryor did her usual splendid job my children jake and amy put up with the whole unruly process and my wife lucy watched me disappear toward shooting ranges gun shows and my own office for nearly four years without complaint chapter one it was november cold and wet in west arkansas a miserable dawn following on a miserable night sleet whistled through the pines and collected on the humps of stone that jutted out of the earth low overhead angry clouds hurtled by now and then the wind would rush through the canyons between the trees and blow the sleet like gunsmoke it was the day before hunting season bob lee swagger had placed himself just off the last climb that led up to hard bargain valley that flat splurge of tabletop high in the ouachitas and he sat in perfect silence and perfect stillness against an old pine the rifle across his knees this was bobs first gift the gift of stillness he acquired it naturally without instruction from some inner pool where stress never reached back in nam he was something of a legend for the nearly animallike way he could will his body reactions down stiller than death the cold had fought through his wool leggings and up and under his down vest and begun to climb up his spine like a sly little mouse he gritted his teeth fighting the urge to let them chatter now and then his hip throbbed from a wound from long ago he instructed his brain to ignore the phantom ache he was beyond will he was in some other place he was earning tim you see hed tell you if you were one of the two or three men in the world he talked to old sam vincent say the expolk county prosecutor or maybe doc lemieux the dentist or vernon tell the sheriff you cant just shoot an animal shootings the easy part any city dick can sit in a stand drink hot coffee and wait till some doe goes prancing by close enough to touch and then put out the muzzle of his walmart rifle and squeezejerk the trigger and blow a quart of her guts out and find her three counties away bled out her eyes still somehow beaming dumb pain you earned your shot bob would tell you by letting whatever was happening to the animal happen to you and for however long fair was fair after all through the pines and the saplings he could see the clearing yards ahead a little below coming gradually into what small low light thered be that day a trail ran through it and at dawn and again at twilight he knew the animals would filter through one by one a buck and his harem last night bob had seen twelve three bucks one a nice fat eightpointer even and their ladies but hed come for tim old tim scarred and beat up with many an adventure behind him tim would be alone too tim didnt have a harem and didnt need one anymore one year tim had had a prong of antler shot off by some lucky city dick from little rock and looked out of balance for a whole season tim had limped another whole year because sam vincent not as spry as once hed been had held sloppy and put a softpoint too much gun but sam loved that old winchester into his haunches and only bled him bad enough to kill any normal buck tim was tough bob knew and that was the kindest word he had for anybody living or dead bob was in his seventeenth hour of sitting he had sat all night in the cold and when about four sleet had started he still sat he was so cold and wet he was hardly alive and now and again a picture of another time would come up before his eyes but always hed shake it out keeping himself set on what lay ahead yards come on you old bastard he was thinking im earning you then he saw something but it was only a doe and her fawn and in their lazy confident stupid animal way they came down the trail from the hill and began to move on down to graze in the lower forest where some lucky city fool would certainly kill them bob just sat there next to his tree dr dobbler swallowed trying to read the mystery in colonel shrecks eyes but as always shreck sat there with a fierce scowl masking his blunt features radiating power and impatience and somehow scaring everybody in the room shreck was scary he was the scariest man dobbler had ever known scarier even than russell isandhlwana the dope dealer who had raped dobbler in the showers of norfolk state penitentiary in massachusetts and made the doctor his punk for a very very long three months it was late outside the rain drummed on the tin roof of the quonset a stench of rusting metal old leather dust unwashed socks and stale beer hung in the room it was a prison smell though this wasnt a prison but the field headquarters of an outfit calling itself ramdyne security on several hundred obscure acres of untillable central virginia the planners sat in front of the darkened room the brutish jack payne the second scariest man in the world sat across the table and that was all such a tiny team for the immense and melancholy task that lay ahead of them on a small screen four faces had been projected now glowing in the dark each represented a hundred other possibilities these men had been discovered by research investigated at length by plans watched by the pros from operations and then winnowed to this sullen quartet it was dobblers job to break them down psychologically for colonel raymond shrecks final decision each of the final four had a flaw of course dr dobbler pointed these out he was after all still a psychiatrist if now uncertified flaws were his profession too narcissistic he said of one he spends too much on his hair never trust a man in a seventyfivedollar haircut he expects to be treated special we need somebody who is special but has never been treated special as for number too smart brilliant tactically brilliant but always playing the games always thinking ahead never at rest of the third wonderfully stupid but slow exactly what we need so far as certain qualities are required and experienced in the technical area obedient as a dog but slow too slow too literal too eager to please too rigid i hear you flirting again dobbler said colonel shreck brutally just give us the information without the charm dobbler winced well he finally said that leaves us with only one jack payne hated dobbler the softy dobbler with his big head scraggly beard and long sensitive fingers was everything pussy in the world he had tits he was almost a woman he tried to turn everything into show jack payne was a dour nastylooking little man tattooed and remote with blank tiny eyes in his meaty face he was enormously strong with a pain threshold that was off the charts his specialty was getting things done no matter what he touched the cutdown remington in its custom undershoulder rig beneath his left arm in the long tube under the barrel there were six doubleought gauge shells in each shell were nine caliber pellets he could fire fiftyfour bullets in less than three seconds got lots of stuff done with that the details are impressive dobbler was saying he killed eightyseven men that is eightyseven men stalked and taken under the most ferocious conditions i think wed all have to agree thats impressive there was a pause i killed eightyseven men in an afternoon jack said jack had been stuck in a long siege at an ateam camp in the southern highlands and in the last days the gooks had thrown human wave attacks at them but all at once with an m said colonel shreck i was there too go ahead dobbler dobbler was trembling jack could see he still trembled when the colonel addressed him directly sometimes jack almost laughed he smelled fear on the psychiatrist he loved the odor of other mens fear but dobbler pressed ahead this is none other than gunnery sergeant bob lee swagger usmc retired of blue eye arkansas they called him bob the nailer he was the united states marine corpss second leading individual killer in vietnam gentlemen i give you the great american sniper bob loved their magic when he had hunted men there was no magic men were stupid they farted and yakked and gave themselves away miles before they moved into the killing zone but the deer particularly the old ouachita stags appeared like ghosts simply exploding out of brushy nothingness as if they were superior visitors from another planet and they were superior in their way bob knew their senses so razor keen everything focused on the next two minutes that was their secret they didnt think about the last two minutes which had ceased entirely to exist in the second after they were experienced had evaporated entirely they only thought about the next two minutes no past no real future there was only now and so when tim materialized with the force of a sharp memory out of the thin arkansas pines stunning bob with his beauty he did not quite surprise him bob had learned years back in hard places that surprise was dangerous it made you jerk awkwardly upon the first moment of encounter and you gave away your edge so bobs initial reaction to tim was nothing that his body showed he was downwind so no odors would reach tims keen nostrils though bob of course had washed yesterday with odorless soap hed airdried his clothes hed washed his mouth out with peroxide so no tang of toothpaste could hang in the forest air the animals head twitched and turned and unerringly turned to bob you cant see me bob thought i know how you operate you can see motion youre a smart boy at picking out a flick of motion scampering off to safety but you cant see pattern here i sit and youre looking right at me and you cant see me bob let the beasts gaze wash over him then felt it slide away this was the part he liked the best the exciting fragility of it all the flimsiness of the connections that brought buck and man together through the medium of the rifle but only for a few seconds and knowing that in a minute if the buck held if the wind held if his nerve held if his luck held hed have tim in his cross hairs he lifted the rifle it was a remington bolt action lovingly purchased by the marine marksmanship team and presented to him as a retirement gift when hed been invalided out of the corps in it had a heavy varmint barrel which almost neutralized vibration when he fired though bob had since replaced the original barrel with a stainless steel one from hart which hed then finished with teflon so the whole piece had the appearance of old pewter the barrel action and even the screws were bedded in devcon aluminum into a black fiberglass and kevlar stock the screws were torqued through aluminum pilars tightened to sixty pounds the rifle was purely ugly it was a winchester and one of bobs own handloads now rested in the chamber bob slid the rifle up in a smooth and practiced motion economical from long years of repetition under slightly less adverse conditions he would have elected the prone the stablest shooting position but since he knew hed have to be still for so long he had been afraid the contact with the cold ground would chill his body numb instead he drew the rifle up to his shoulder notching his elbows inside his splayed knees canting his shoulders locking his arms under the rifles ten pounds so that it was supported off bone not muscle he was building a bone bridge running from the piece itself to the ground anchoring it so that no whimsy of muscle fiber no throb of heart or twitch of pulse could deflect him at the last moment bobs eye slid behind the scope a leupold the bold optics of the magnification snatching every bit of light from the air threw up tims head and shoulders ten times the size of life again the animal turned toward him though this time he was projected against the intersection of the cross hairs with a thumb bob snicked off the safety and settled in to shoot ive earned you you son of a bitch he thought and by god i own your ass you are mine his heart seemed to thump a bit now he was trying to slip into that calm pool of nearnothingness where the little patch on the tip of his finger just took over as if on autopilot reading the play of the cross hairs matching their rhythm anticipating their direction okay bob thought as he made the minute corrections and the cross hairs settled on tims spine as he nimbly licked iceglazed shoots from a tree okay now i own you on the screen the four faces vanished and then bobs young face suddenly appeared hes twentysix on his third tour of vietnam said dr dobbler its june tenth hes just officially killed his thirtyninth and fortieth men though unofficially the total is far higher the slide showed a raw young face lean and sullen the eyes were slits the skin tight the mouth a hyphen there was something somehow southern in the bone structure he looked mean too and very competent without a lick of humor with no patience for outsiders with a willingness to fight anyone who pushed him too far a boonie hat was pressed back on his head revealing a thatch of crewcut he wore rumpled utilities with globe and anchor inscribed on the pocket and trapped proudly in the joint of his left arm so that it lay along the length of his forearm and was cupped in his hand at the trigger guard and comb was a black heavybarreled rifle with a long telescopic sight dobbler looked at the boy on the screen it was the same expressionless face you saw on the whitetrash tough guys the human tattoo museums and borntokill bikers and assaultwithintent pros who did their time in the joint as easily as a vacation whereas he himself had nearly died from it that was the first shock of a cultured man that in such savagery some people not only survived but actually thrived the doctor continued please note its not robert lee swagger his father named him bob lee he gets quite angry when people call him robert and he likes to be called bob not bob lee hes very proud of his father although he must only vaguely remember him earl swagger won the congressional medal of honor on iwo jima in world war two and was an arkansas state trooper killed in the line of duty in when bob was nine the boys mother returned from little rock to the family farm outside blue eye in polk county in western arkansas where she and her mother and bob managed a threadbare existence bob is in many ways a child of the embarrassing second amendment and he fits the profile of other great american gun heroes both alvin york and audie murphy come to mind he grew up orphaned early in a border state on a hardscrabble farm where his hunting was not only natural and expected but necessary he quickly became a proficient hunter with a singleshot rifle and graduated in his teens to a leveraction deer gun and finally a winchester in caliber he was from the very first time his father allowed him to shoot an exceedingly gifted rifleman in having graduated from high school where he got this is perhaps not as amazing as it seems excellent grades bob turned down a college scholarship and instead joined the united states marines just in time for the vietnam war he did a tour in as an infantry lance corporal and was wounded twice he did one in during tet as a recon patrol leader doing a lot of dangerous work up near the dmz in at camp perry ohio bob lee was the national thousandyard centerfire rifle champion it got him noticed he returned to vietnam in late to the scoutsniper platoon headquarters company twentysixth regiment first marine division operating outside da nang he clicked a button the screen displayed a business card with a neat block of print under the silhouette of a telescopic rifle it said we deal in lead friend scoutsniper platoon headquarters company first marines the line was stolen from steve mcqueen in the magnificent seven it was his platoons calling card part of the first marine psywar operations in its region left in prominent places in the area where bob and his men were operating usually in the left hand of corpses dropped by a single bullet in the chest scoutsniper of the first was the most proficient unit of professional killers this country had ever sponsored at least on an individual basis in the six years it operated it is said to have killed over one thousand seven hundred fifty enemy soldiers itself it only counted fortysix men in its ranks over those years a sergeant named carl hitchcock with ninetythree confirmed kills was highest bob five years later was second with his eightyseven but there were several other snipers in the sixties and more than a dozen in the fifties as for bob ill only sketch the high points he evidently did a few jobs for the cias operation phoenix liquidating hardcore infrastructure people vietcong tax collectors and regional chieftains and the like so he is not unfamiliar with the operations of professional intelligence agencies but his more common targets were rankandfile north vietnamese regulars operating in the area they even had a huge reward out for bob over fifty thousand piasters but most astonishingly he and his best friend and spotter a lance corporal named donny fenn once ambushed a north vietnamese battalion which was rushing toward an isolated special forces camp the weather was bad and the jungle was triple canopy so air support or evacuation was impossible it was out of range of artillery a thousand men heading toward twelve on a hilltop but bob and his spotter were the only other friendly forces in the area they tracked the north vietnamese and began taking out officers one at a time over a fortyeighthour stretch in the an loc valley the battalion never reached the green berets and swagger and his spotter made it out three days later he killed over thirty men in that twoday adventure even payne who tried never to be impressed had to suck in some air cocksucker can shoot a little he said the projector clicked a man swaddled in bandages lay in a hospital bed leg locked in traction face bleak eyes hugely hollow bob lee swaggers war came to an end on eleven december he was sliding over a crest line on his way out when he was hit in the hip by a rifle bullet fired from over a thousand yards his friend and spotter donny fenn slid down the embankment to get him the next bullet hit donny in the chest blew through to his spine bob lay out there all morning with his dead friend in his arms until they could call in artillery on the suspected sniper position it ended his war and it ended his career in the marine corps he was invalided out of the service in after three years painful rehabilitation it ended his competitive shooting too competitive shooting is an extremely formalized sport involving positions of great physical discomfort while wrapped tightly in leather shooting garments for maximum body control with his hip wired together bob was never able to achieve those formal positions with the same degree of intensity you could say i suppose that bob lee swagger gave everything to his country and in return it took everything from him his heroism was of a sort that makes many americans uneasy he wasnt an inspiring leader he didnt save lives he didnt rise in the chain of command he was simply and explicitly an extraordinary killer almost certainly for that reason he never got the medals and the acclaim he deserved what followed one can almost predict he was married but the marriage fell apart a career in real estate sales outside camp lejeune collapsed he tried to go back to school but lost interest he was into and out of alcoholism clinics in the mid to late seventies in the eighties he seems to have come to some sort of provisional peace with himself and with his country if only by withdrawing and one can only imagine what the excessive patriotic hubris of the persian gulf victory has done to increase his isolation and his bitterness he lives in a trailer alone in the ouachita mountains a few miles outside of blue eye subsisting on his marine disability pay and whats left of the thirty thousand dollars his pal an old country lawyer named sam vincent won for him in a lawsuit against mercenary magazine in alone that is except for his guns of which he has dozens and which he shoots every day as if they are his only friends you can see of course his ready fund of resentment his sense of isolation all these things make him vulnerable and malleable said the doctor hes the man weve been taught to hate hes the solitary american gun nut bob knew as the gun jolted into his shoulder and the sight picture disappeared in a blur of recoil that the perfect shot hed been building toward all these hours was his it was as if the image at the second when the lockwork of the remington bolt had delivered striker to primer were engraved in his mind and he had fractions of a second to analyze at a speed that has no place in real time yes the rifle was held true yes the scope zeroed onto two hundred yards with a group size of less than two inches was placed exactly where he wanted it yes the trigger pull was smooth unhurried yes he was surprised when it broke yes his position was solid and no no last second twitch no flicker of doubt or lack of selfbelief had betrayed him yes hed hit the animal stricken bucked ferociously in its sudden shroud of red mist its great antlered head spasmed back as its front legs collapsed under it and it crashed to the ground without unshouldering bob flicked the bolt tossing a piece of spent brass ramming home a new and reacquired the target but he saw immediately that no followup was necessary he snapped the safety on lowered the rifle and watched tim thrash his bull neck beating against the sleet and dust the animal could not accept that it had been hit or that its legs no longer functioned or that numbness was spreading through it go on fight it boy thought bob the more you fight it the faster it gets you at last the man stood his legs ached and he suddenly noticed how cold it was he flexed his fingers to make certain they still worked his hand flew to the ache in his hip then denied it he shivered under the down vest he was bathed in sweat numbly he went over and retrieved the shell casing hed just ejected after shooting bob felt nothing he felt even more nothing than he did in shooting he looked at the animal in the undergrowth a hundredodd yards away no sense of triumph filled him no elation yeah well i can still shoot a little he thought not so old as i thought creakily he walked down the hill to the clearing and over to the fallen stag the sleet pelted him stinging his face the whole world seemed gray and wet he squinted shivered drew the parka tighter about himself the animal wheezed its head still beat against the ground its eye was opened desperately and it craned back to see bob he thought he could see fear glinting out of that great black eyeball fear and rage and betrayal all the huge things that something thats just been shot feels the animals tongue hung from its halfopened mouth as the deeper paralysis overcame all its systems the buck was a brute all right and its legs were as scarred as a football players knees bob could see a pucker of dead tissue high on the flank where sam vincents sloppy had flashed through years earlier but the horns though now slightly asymmetrical were beautiful tim wore an enormous rack twelve points of staghorn in a convoluted density of random growth like a crown of thorns atop the narrow beauty of his head he was all trophy maybe a record for the boone and crockett book his flanks still heaved showing the struts of his ribs his living warmth and its musty dense animal smell rose through the plunging sleet you could almost warm your fingers off of him his left back leg kicked ineffectually as even now he fought it bob looked at the bullet strike he could see the impact just where hed willed it to be and just where the remington had sent it to go a crimson stain above the shoulder immediately above the spine figure i hit you just about dead perfect partner bob thought tim snorted piteously thrashing again it irked bob that he thrashed and splattered the mud up on his tawny hide spotting it the animal could not take its eye off bob as bob bent and stroked it bob touched the throat then pulled out his knife an old randall survivor murderously sharp be over in a second partner he thought bending toward tim wait a minute said payne dobbler swallowed in the dark payne looked over at him with a pathological glare everybody was afraid of payne except shreck colonel i been around a lot of guys like that in the service and so have you he said to shreck proud to say i served with them in my twentytwo years in the special forces now when its killing time there aint no better boy than your white country southerner those boys can shoot and they got stones the size of cars but they got an attitude problem too they got this thing about their honor cross one of them boys and they make it their business to even the score and i aint shitting you ive seen it happen in service too fuckin many times to talk about it go on payne said the colonel theyre true men and when they get something in their heads they wont let go of it i saw enough of it in vietnam im just telling you cross this man and im guaranfuckingteeing you the worst kind of trouble i think said the doctor in a loud voice that mr payne has made an excellent point it would not do at all to underestimate bob lee swagger and he is especially right when he notes bobs honor but surely you can also see that its his honor that makes him so potentially valuable to us he is in fact quite a bit like the precision rifle with which he earned his nickname extremely dangerous if used sloppily yet absolutely perfect if used well he after all knows more about what we are interested in than nearly any man alive he is simply the best sniper in the western world he shot a glance at the silent figure of shreck and received in reply only more stony silence but there is a problem bob the nailer as perfect as he seems does present one terrible terrible problem he has a deep flaw bob leaned over tim gripping the randall in his left hand tim snorted one more time bob spun the gnarled haft of the weapon in his hand bringing the serrated upper teeth to bear with the saw blade he hacked at the base of the left antler not in the veiny velvety knob but an inch or two higher where the horn was stone dead in a second the teeth cut into and through the horn and bob yanked as a half of the heavy crown fell into his hand he tossed it away into the undergrowth bent and just as forcefully sawed the second antler off then he backed off to avoid getting trampled the beast lurched halfway to its feet bob gave it a hard swat on the rump go on boy git git git outta here you old sonovabitch tim bucked up snorted once shook his unchained head with a shiver of the purest delight and his nostrils spurting a double plume of rancid smoky breath he seemed to gather even more strength and bounded off crazily bending aside saplings and flinging shards of ice as he plunged into the forest in a second he was gone i own you you sonovabitch bob thought watching as the stag disappeared he turned and started the long trek home his flaw said the doctor is that he will not kill anymore he still hunts he goes to great lengths and puts himself through extraordinary ordeals to fire at trophy animals but he hits them with his own extremely light bullets machined of delrin plastic at a hundred yards range if he hits the creatures right and he always does he aims for the shoulder above the spine he can literally stun them off their feet for five or six minutes theres a small compartment of red aluminum dust for weight in each bullet and as the bullet smashes against the flank of the beast it smears the animal with a red stain which the rain quickly washes off extraordinary then he saws their antlers off so that no hunter will shoot them for a trophy he hates trophy hunting after all hes been a trophy colonel shreck spoke all right then its swagger but well have to find a trophy this asshole will hunt he said chapter two it was funny how a rifle will sometimes go sour on you bobs fine old pre winchester model in had been a minuteofangle gun for five years shooting within an inch at a hundred yards or two at two hundred or three at three holding ever true to that abstraction of rifle accuracy but it had suddenly opened up on todays target the bullet punctures formed a raggedy constellation over three times an inch yet baffled as he was a certain part of bob was tickled it was so damned interesting it was one more thing to find out about another trip deep into the maze that kept him or so he believed sane take this damn he could spend a week on it hed take it apart down to its finest screw and spring and go over each tiny bit of it looking for burrs in the metal for pieces of grit in the works for signs of wear or fatigue hed steam clean the trigger mechanism with his fingers hed probe every square centimeter of the stock feeling for knots splinters warps anything that could lay just the softest finger of pressure against the barrel to nudge the rifle out of true and when that was done if it didnt shoot right hed just do it again his tiny shop was out back of the trailer a shed of corrugated tin dark and oily off to one side stood a reloading bench with a singlestage rock chucker for his rifle loads and a dillon for hiss and stacked along the wall neatly and fastidiously were his many dies the back wall had filing cabinets for his notebooks and his targets and bins for used brass that hed yet to reload the smell of shooters choice bore solvent hung in the air like a vapor a single light illuminated the darkness and if he wasnt shooting or sleeping he was reading guns ammo or shooting times or the american rifleman or accuracy shooting or the shotgun news or rifle but on this afternoon as he contemplated the delinquent model he heard his dog mike barking mike a furious old halfbeagle with a mangy coat and yellow eyes prowled the fence bob had built around his trailer in exchange for table scraps and a daily romp through the hills hed chase any human thing away except for the two or three that bob allowed to call on him but this day mike just kept howling for the longest damn time and bob knew that whoever had come by wasnt about to leave he slipped a cocked and locked series colt out of a drawer and slid it into the back pocket of his jeans then threw on a jacket and his razorback baseball hat and stepped out the sun was a thin wash around him the blue ouachitas rose bleakly bled dry of color by the coming of cold weather and bob turned the corner to see two men lounging next to what had to be a rented car just beyond the gate while mike yowled at them as if hed kill them if they came closer they wore raincoats over suits but they were soldiers of a sort maybe not now but theyd been soldiers that was clear they were carved from the same tough tree one square and blocky bobs own age but a head and a half lower to the ground with huge hands and a weight lifters body he had a sheen of crewcut hair and every square inch of him said nco the other was the officer taller but husky too wellproportioned with a square face and short but not crewcut hair he had the look of at least nine of bobs eleven battalion commanders down through the years men bob didnt love but respected because they put mission first and last and always accomplished it go on shuddup bob said to mike giving him a kick the dog slunk off to the door but bob didnt open his locked fence he put his hand under his jacket and set it on the haft of the because its always better to have your gun in your hand than in your pants if it comes to kickass time yall want something he said squinting up his face youre mr bob lee swagger said the officer i am sir bob spit a glob of phlegm into the dust youre a hard man to get ahold of mr swagger weve sent you five registered letters you wont even sign for them and open them you dont have a telephone bob recalled the damn letters hed thought they were from susan his exwife wanting more money or from one of those nutty war groups that wanted to pay him just to come stand around at some motel and tell stories this is private property he said youre not welcome here you go on back to where you came from and let me be mr swagger said the officer were here with a business proposition that could mean a lot of money to you i dont need any money bob said i have plenty of money i was hoping youd do me the favor of listening to me thats all take five minutes of your time and then if youre not interested in what i have to say and what im proposing im out of here the smaller of the two men had not said anything he was just eyeing bob and he stunk of aggression his big hands were in his pockets and bob didnt like the way there was a suggestion of bulk under the right arm of his raincoat bob turned back to the officer why should i do you any sort of favor sir i dont even know you possibly this will establish my bona fides with that the older man slipped a jewelry case out of his pocket and flipped it over the fence it landed at bobs feet in the mud its authentic said the man i won it all right in near dak to just off highway one i was a major in the twentyfourth mech infantry a very busy day bob picked the case up and popped the lid to discover a congressional medal of honor he swallowed just a bit his own daddy had won one on the iwo and at least a dozen officers had told him hed earned one when he and donny fenn dusted that main forces battalion in the an loc but that it was a shame hed never get it as the politics of the moment were such that a sniper couldnt get the big medal it didnt bother bob hed never wanted a medal he just didnt like the idea that the killing hed done was somehow wrong and couldnt be recognized all right said bob trying to put that shame out of his mind out of respect for what you did for your country ill hear your piece just keep it short he unlocked the gate inside the trailer the two men took off their coats to reveal business suits it now looked as if the smaller man had some sort of sawedoff pump gun under his arm but he just sat back a dullness coming over his face bob thought of him as some sort of attack hound when bob hadnt been sure whether or not hed let them in he was all tense and full of fury ready to strike now that they were inside the little guy went limp the other man however did not leaning across the small table in the neat little living room of the trailer he stared his bright dark eyes boring into bob here mr swagger this will help he pushed a business card across at bob who read colonel william a bruce usa ret presidentchief operating officer accutech industries inc it gave an address somewhere in maryland and in smaller type it listed the firms specialties law enforcement technology law enforcement ammunition training seminars and firearms consultation okay said bob so colonel whats on your mind mr swagger after i retired in i spent the next sixteen years as the supervisor of the arizona state police i retired from that post last year and now ive started this little business which means to bring progressive equipment and philosophy to american law enforcement is that why your boy is wearing a pump gun under his arm the expression on the smaller ones face didnt change but at the word boy his face seemed to lose just a shred of color as if the man inside were baking in an oven my associate is also my bodyguard mr swagger like anybody whos spent a career in law enforcement i have some enemies mr payne is duly licensed by the state of maryland to carry concealed and hes been authorized by the state of arkansas to the same courtesy yes sir at any rate this is why im here the newest addition to my product line he pushed a yellow box the size of two cigarette packs across the table at bob accutech sniper grade it said in bright red letters under that it said law enforcement use only bob saw that it was grain hollowtip he cracked the box slid the ammo out to discover it displayed headstamp up in a styrofoam tray twenty perfect double circles peeped up at him rimedge and primer looking like eggs or eyes he plucked a cartridge from the tray heavy brass gleaming brightly the coppersheathed cone climaxing in the precise circle of the crater at the tip it looked like any other except for the bright band of glossier brass at the neck of the cartridge none of the big american ammo companies can touch this stuff said the colonel not even the expensive grade lines the winchester supreme the federal premium the remington extended range i guarantee minute of angle in a proper rifle neck turned bob said his finger touching the bright band how can you massproduce a neckturned round thats a handloaders job i dont see how it can be done lasers hmm said bob okay i know some outfits these days use lasers as sighting devices but yall use them in the loading thats right said the colonel leaning forward industrial lasers are the coming thing in precision manufacturing now theyre used in the manufacture of electronic components missile guidance systems hightech materials my brainstorm was to try them on ammunition they can be coded into a computerized program so that you get extraordinary repeatability you know what the secret of a quality round is precision so all the things that a handloader can do on a very small scale we can do on a larger scale with brilliant perfection we buy our brass from remington in hundredthousand case quantities our lasers score the neck of the case both inside and out so that it has the exact diameter all the way around and each case has the exact diameter of every other case exactly precisely then we can deburr the flash hole and seat each primer the identical depth we can manage it with laserguided machining in other words we can code the machines to follow laser tracks as specified by a computer program we can get the kind of careful quality thousands of rounds by thousands of rounds that you can get round by round on your lee or rcbs or wilson or whatever dies it is you use bob looked down at the round in his hand ive gotten some pretty damned fine groups over the years but youve had to work to get them is that right said the colonel yes sir thats right thats it in a box its a natural for the police market which is considerable later maybe well expand to the civilian if we can establish a law enforcement reputation so what is it you want from me mr swagger im looking for a professional shooter to fly around the country and put on shooting demonstrations for police departments that are upgrading their swat capabilities but i need a man with a reputation a man whos been in hard places kept his head and come back alive why dont you get carl hitchcock hes famous they wrote a damn book about him and made up a poster hes number one carl is making too much money on the personal appearance circuit they pay him two thousand dollars just to appear at a gun show for one day did you know that carl always was a lucky boy we have a facility in garrett county maryland where were doing our testing what wed like to do is fly you up there for a weekend at our expense of course you bring your favorite rifle your favorite handloads okay then you can go out on the range with some of our shooters and engineers fire our rounds and your rounds side by side we think if you do that youll see how our rounds group consistently with your own thats all we ask your forbearance give us a chance to let you believe if you believe all else will follow bob had no real need or urge to leave his mountain the fact was except for getting his hair cut picking up magazines and his government check at the post office once a month and a chat or two with old sam vincent and now and then having a routine checkup on his health or his teeth he hadnt been down in five years it would be a great job said the colonel id fly you around the country and youd be with men whod respect you you know the world has changed since vietnam they say the vietnam syndrome is dead we had a war that we won big time and now everybody who was in the military can be a hero again youd get exactly what you didnt get the first time youd get respect and love and appreciation bob made a sour look hed believe it when he saw it but he knew he couldnt stay up here forever he looked at the rifle cartridge he was curious goddamned thing looked like it would shoot the tits off a mother flea but there was only proof in the shooting not in the looking but he heard it singing to him in a strange way poked he was poked in the head hadnt been poked in the head since hed given up the drinking when whens convenient cant leave now got a rifle gone barn sour on me say next weekend well all right whatever you have a credit card yes i do you go ahead and charge your tickets keep all the receipts and well expense it out or you could sign a contract now and we could write you an advance check and no thanks on the contract i didnt think so and do you want to be picked up at the baltimore airport or rent your own car id take the car thank you its done then thats all there is to it said bob now i have to feed my damn dog chapter three bob made his inquiries discreetly from bill dodges exxon station on route he called an old nco buddy who was a master sergeant going for his thirty now working personnel in the pentagon and put certain questions before him the next day the friend replied with a telegram dear coot it said your pal col bruce is the real mccoy he led an apc attack on a bunker position was hit twice and pulled his men out of the burning thing himself they say he did become a cop in arizona semper fi bud that learned bob stopped in at sara vincents travel agency sara was sam vincents divorced daughter and a woman so plain shed even scare mike and bought his tickets made arrangements with sam to check his property once or twice a day and feed the dog and tried to get himself ready for the world again he was all right too until the last night he knew he had to get up early for the drive to little rock and just when hed thought he had everything checked out and was ready for the sack it came over him thats the way it came fast without preparation without announcement it just came and there it was it was a bad one he hadnt had it so bad since the president declared the little war in the desert a victory and america went on a bender and everybody was happy except himself and maybe another million boys who wondered why nobody put up ribbons for them twenty years ago when it might have mattered now you hold it on down he told himself aching for a glass of smooth brown whiskey to flatten himself out knowing that if he had one many more would follow but there was no whiskey nothing to blunt what happened in his mind the memories hit him hard he remembered the vc he shot who turned out to be an eightyearold boy with a hoe it had looked like an ak through the at eight hundred meters in the bad light of sunset he remembered the smell of burned villages after the search and destroys and the crying of the women and the way the goddamned kids just looked at you during his first tour he remembered the bellytime moving through the high grass avoiding the crest lines as the ants crawled over you and the snakes slithered by and you just lay there waiting for days sometimes until someone passed into the kill zone eight hundred meters out and you could put them down he remembered the way they fell when hit instant rag doll the toppling surrender the small cloud of dust it raised so many of them the confirmed kills were only the ones with a spotter there to write it in the log and make a report but mostly he remembered the sudden shock as his hip went numb and he collapsed and slid down the earthen dam of the perimeter he looked down and saw the smashed flesh the pulsing red remembering he put his hand on the wound and it throbbed some then he remembered donny scrambling down no he yelled get your young ass back and the bullet came from so long away it arrived a full second before its own sound it drilled donny in the chest and tunneled to his spine he was dead before he collapsed against bob and lay across him that long morning hell of a shot bob the major said later we made it over a thousand yards who knew they could shoot that good who knew they had a man that good you could never forget stuff like that not really but he learned somehow not to let it rag him most of the time he could ride it out in the mountains or in the solitude bob sat at what had passed for a kitchen table his rebuilt hip ached a bit all that plastic instead of cartilage he could feel what he called his own personal night passing over him of course the time of day had nothing to do with it what he called his own personal night was about the feeling of being nothing of having no worth of having spent himself in a war nobody cared about and having given up everything that was important and good in other days this was what got bob off on his drinking and drunk he turned mean as shit but now he didnt drink and instead he threw on a coat and went out into the harsh arkansas night and walked the mile or so downhill inside aurora baptist some kind of service was going on he heard the black people singing something loud and crazy what are they so goddamned happy for inside that shaky little white clapboard building anyhow out beyond the church was the little graveyard and there among the washingtons and the lincolns and the delanos of polk county was one spindly marker for a man named bo stark bob just looked at it the wind howled and roared through the trees the moon was a raggedyassed streetlamp the music pumped and blasted the black people were singing up a storm beating the devil down bo stark was his own age and the only white man in the cemetery because no other cemetery would have him hed come from a fine family and had known bob all through high school theyd gone to the same doctor the same dentist played on the same football team but bos people had money hed gone on to the university in fayetteville and from there had joined the army and spent a year as a lieutenant in the st airborne another fool for duty whod believed in it all and after that nothing bo stark had gone a man and come home a noaccount the war got inside him and never let him go one bad thing turned to another couldnt hold a job wouldnt pay back loans was searching for the death hed only just missed in the land of bad things two weeks after the war in the desert was over after the mighty victory and the celebration one sunday night hed finally killed a man in a bar with a knife in little rock and when the police found him in his daddys garage in blue eye hed blown a through the roof of his mouth so bob stood there as the wind brought cold memories from the cold ground out at him and looked at the marker bo stark it said airborne all the way he came here when he was frightened because in the radiance of the glowing church standing over the body of the man who could have been and was almost him he could see it in the stone bob lee swagger usmc semper fidelis now he looked at it and realized it was time to do that which could kill him fastest of all possible dangers to go back he wondered if he had the pured stones for it he still thought of it as the world it was the place where all things were where women and liquor and pleasure and temptation commingled now he was back in it he landed at baltimorewashington international airport after a crazed flight that took him to st louis from little rock then east he was worried that his rifle with the bright orange airline tag on the handle of the gun case hadnt made the trip you always worried that some person in the airlines system would see the thing and snap it up but sure enough the case came out of the luggage chute and moved along to him on the rubber belt so that he could pluck it up damn someone said hunting seasons long over pardner it was early january though surprisingly mild just a target rifle bob said easily to the man scooping up the case he felt a little silly with the long hard thing so weirdly shaped among all the other luggage and knowing that he himself looked so cowboylike to these eastern people in his best black tony lamas a nice pair of levis a pointedcollar shirt with string tie and a black stetson all under a sheepskin coat his best coat getting the car turned out to be no problem at all as the reservation in his name was waiting and the girl at the counter was especially ingratiating she thought he was some kind of cowboy hero her eyes lit with joy at what he took to be his incredibleness and when he called her maam she was doubly pleased he left the airport found his way to the baltimorewashington parkway from there to the baltimore beltway and then west out i across maryland even in the yellowed state of high dead winter he could see that it was a lovely place rolling not so savage as arkansas soon he came to mountains old humped things ridge after ridge of them in three hours beyond cumberland he found himself in marylands wildest pastures in its farthest westernmost regions not wild like the ouachitas but nevertheless free of the poison taint of the city and just barely tame enough to accommodate the most provisional sort of farming it looked to be fine deer country way out in garrett county he was searching for a town called accident and halfway between it and nowhere just where theyd said it would be he found the small ramada inn nestled under the mountains he checked in his reservations all made and an envelope waiting for him with a hearty welcoming letter and detailed instructions on how to reach the headquarters of accutech at its shooting facility a few miles down the road there was also his per diem ten crisp twentydollar bills bob went to his room and lay down on the bed and didnt go out anymore that night he just thought it all out trying not to be bothered that he had been followed his whole long trip out from the airport by a very good surveillance team like everything associated with ramdyne the trailer was small and seedy and cheap the outfit never did anything firstclass and seemed only to have cretins of the prison guard mentality working for it like the horrid jack payne and now it was jammed with men dobbler was supposedly briefing the doctor sighed looking at the dull faces in his audience er could i have your attention please he couldnt they paid him no attention at all he was irrelevant to them how far hed fallen and how fast once the youngest member of the harvard medical school psychiatric faculty and the sole proprietor of one of the most flourishing private practices in the cambridgegreater boston area hed had the life hed dreamed of and worked for so furiously one day however when he was tired and his resources nearly depleted on a last appointment hed let his discipline slip hed touched a woman why had he done it he didnt know in the nanosecond before he did it it hadnt even been in his mind but he did it hed touched her and when she looked at him he realized that she wanted him to touch her more the sexual savagery that spilled out stunned him he made love to her right there in the office it was the start of his outofcontrol phase abetted by a severe amphetamine habit he seduced nine patients inevitably one had gone to the police the charge was rape the squalor played itself out over six melancholy months climaxing in his acceptance of a pleabargained seconddegree assault conviction which delivered him courtesy of a feminist judge to the ungentle ministrations of russell isandhlwana the symmetry was perfect even awesome justice at its finest dobbler had fucked nine neurotic women in his office in prison he was fucked by an immense man who called him his dickhole and now he was raymond shrecks dickhole not sexually of course but even dobbler found a certain black humor in the irony hed gone from the ignominy of the prison to somehow secure a position in subservience to a man with the same though somewhat modulated sense of physical power and ruthlessness as russell isandhlwana a man whom like russell he totally feared but whom he needed for protection and strength earth to planet doctor it was the horrid payne what hey get with the program you lost it there man ah hed lost his place again wasnt sure what question he was answering it was the last briefing before the subject showed up oh yes he was holding forth on bobs unique capacity for utter neardeath stillness explaining to paynes perplexed listeners why it was that bob though in his room from fivethirty pm on the previous evening had simply ceased to exist for their listening devices he was trying to get them to see how important this was for it got to the very nature of swaggers uniqueness ah yes he has an ability to shut down and let the world go about its business while hes frozen and then when hes become a part of the environment then and only then will he strike but like any skill its a skill that simply has to be practiced he was practicing nothingness somebody yawned somebody farted somebody laughed all right said shreck vigorously climbing up front and by sheer body heat exiling the doctor to the wings thanks dobbler now listen up i want eyes front payne get your people to pay some attention for once its very close to the most sensitive part of this operation the next thirtysix to fortyeight hours shrecks dark eyes seemed to beam with strange force let me tell you who youre dealing with so theres no misunderstanding this guy is muleproud southern as stubborn as they come he doesnt want to be pushed and he wont stand to be insulted hes also still got some gungho marine in him hell be a fucking ramrod you try and bend him and he may kick your ass so the way we play him is slow and steady you dont push you dont order you just smile and go along any questions shrecks sudden dramatic appearance had its desired effect it silenced the troops they were fools sir someone had leaned in yeah said shreck sir its hours surveillance called subject just left the motel hes on his way okay said shreck i hope you were listening to the doctor because if anybody screws up ill have his ass now lets get cracking people first day on a new job if nothing else it had a comforting feeling it was after all a rifle range one of those peeling flaking sagging yet grand places where men have always gathered to plunk themselves down before a piece of paper with a black circle imprinted on it and discover the secrets of their own rifles and their own selves bob had spent a lifetime it sometimes seemed in such a place and always the talk was good and the feeling among the shooters easy and generous he stood on a concrete apron before a series of tshaped shooting benches green always green on every shooting range in america they were green bob could see the place had been built sometime in the thirties the private preserve of some hunting and shooting club or other and he knew that under the sagging roof that shielded the apron and the benches thered been many tales told of deer that had gotten away and of loads good and loads bad and rifles worth as much as a good woman and rifles worth as little as a dog with the clap the only unusual thing about this place a mile or so off the main road by a series of convoluted gravel tracks was a trailer off to one side which while not new looked as if it had just been dumped there before it stood the sign of the sponsors of this days labors accutech he could see the targets across the faintly sloping yellow meadow beyond the line of benches a black dot at a hundred yards a black period at two hundred and a black pinprick at three hundred coffee mr swagger asked the colonel still in his raincoat next to him was the morose little noncom who always looked ready for a fight everybody else was a gofer except one pearshaped city boy with a goatee who looked like he had a finger up his ass no thanks he said it jitters the nerves decaf decafs fine he said and colonel shreck nodded to a man who quickly poured bob a paper cupful from a thermos it was surprisingly temperate around sixty and a gentle breeze pressed over the range above a palelemon sun stood in a palelemon sky it was the false spring a phony of a day too sweet to be trusted this month all set then asked the colonel i suppose bob said do you want to recheck your zero before we start the testing rounds yes sir all right gentlemen lets move away eyes and ears on bob uncased his rifle lodged it on a sandbag rampart and slid the bolt back he cracked open a box of the lake city match rounds threaded five one after the other with a brass clicking into the magazine pushed home and locked the bolt which flew forward and rotated shut with the gliding ease of a vault door closing on ball bearings and grease he pulled his rayban aviators on hooking them behind the ears and slid his earmuffs down across the top of his head clamping his ears off from the world he felt the roar of blood rushing in his brain bob slid up to the rifle and found his bench shooters position his boots flat upon the cement apron of the range as if making the magic construction of stability up through his body that would translate to the rockhard hold of the rifle itself he pulled the rifle up and in chunking it against his shoulder placing his hand upon the comb tuned so just the faintest smudge of fingertip caressed the lightened trigger adjusting a bunnyear bag underneath the buttheel his other arm ran flat along the shooting bench under the rifle which itself had been sunk just right into the sandbags bob found his spotweld and closed his left eye the image was a bit out of focus so he diddled with the ring to bring it back to clarity and for his effort was rewarded with the black image of perfect circumference quartered precisely by the stadia of the scope ten times the size it had been now as big as a halfdollar at pointblank range he exhaled half a breath held what he had and with that wished the end of his finger to contract but a bit and was rewarded with the thrill of recoil the blur as the rifle ticked off a round as he was throwing the bolt he heard a spotter xring damn right in the middle perfect a perfect shot bob fired four more times into the same hole i guess im zeroed he said a man called hatcher briefed him on the test mr swagger one of my associates will load your rifle with five rounds youll not know if youre shooting your own handloads the federal premium the lake city match or our own accutech sniper grade ammunition youll fire four groups of five rounds each at a hundred yards four at two hundred yards and four at three hundred yards then well compute the groupings and see how the ammunition stacks up then this afternoon wed like to run a similar series of tests but from offhand or improvised positions with a stress factor added in i think youll find it quite interesting youre paying the bills lets get shooting bob said bob shot with extraordinary concentration what separated him from other shooters was his utter consistency his sameness he was a human ransom rest like the mechanical gizmo they use to test pistols coming each time to the same strained yet perfectly built position cement to bone to wood bone to rifle fingertip to trigger each time the same his cheek just so against the fiberglass of the stock the same pull of rifle into shoulder the same cant to his hand on the grip the same angle and looseness of his offhand the same distance between eye and scope the same halfbreath held the same three heartbeats in suspended animation the same infinitesimal backwards slide of trigger as the slack came out the same crispness like a grass rod snapping as the trigger broke the same soundless detonation and blur as the rifle shivered under the ignition of its round xring little high maybe a third of an inch high at two oclock xring within an inch xring inside an inch there were no flyers no glitches no mistakes bob found the groove and stayed there throughout the long morning hardly moving or breathing or wasting a second or a motion it pleased him queerly that the rifle was taken from him empty then brought back loaded that regularly someone ran to record and change the targets he lost count it was like the nam you just shot and watched the bullet go where you sent it with the tiniest of deviations it became almost abstract completely impersonal you didnt brood on it merely broke it down into small rituals small repetitions and on and on the score mounted so that nobody could stay with him and he got closer and closer to carl hitchcocks legendary figure of ninetythree xring xring xring when he was done had shot all four fiveshot strings at all three ranges he put the rifle down while technicians ran out to secure the targets and calculate the group sizes of course bob had made the loads early on by the slight difference in the kicks he knew his own rounds right off and was just a bit slower in marking the difference between the federal and the lake city loads but in time he could tell that left by process of elimination only the accutech sniper grade ammunition it shot a mite high he felt and he had the impression of the shots clustering just over the xring carrying a bit lots of ooomph though a hot round very consistent mr swagger would you like to see your results asked hatcher yes i would said bob he went over to a bench where the results were being tabulated by two men with a set of dial calipers okay said hatcher i think youll be pleased ive marked each target according to the distance and the ammunition you fired at a hundred yards you fired federal premium accutech lake city match ms and your own handload in that order here are the targets bob looked at the mutilated xrings the small spatters of perforations dead center where the bullet holes had cloverleafed the group size as we make it is as follows federal inches accutech inches lake city match inches and your handload inches bob examined them yes the accutech stuff was about as good as his own handloads and quite a bit better than the two best factory loadings he nodded lets see how she holds out a bit he said okay at two hundred you drop the four and a half inches the ballistics table says youll drop but youll see the group sizes remain under a minute of angle though the federal begins to push it again bob saw the neat clusters of punctures this time however cloverleafs were rarer almost a function of coincidence each group was between one and a half and two inches in diameter and each about two inches off the xring as the bullet had dropped the federal surprisingly yielded the sloppiest grouping with the holes spread out at almost two inches exactly again bobs handloads held truest at inches center of outer hole to center of outer hole less than half a minute of angle but the accutech lot was pressing him closely with ainch rating also less than half a minute of angle and bob felt he might have done better because he sensed his own round immediately and relaxed having the confidence in its ability to perform and now our pièce de résistance said hatcher mike the threehundredyard targets please mr swagger i think youre going to see why we call our ammunition sniper grade you above all others should grasp the significance he handed the four targets out when bob was impressed that respect took the form of a low involuntary whistle he whistled at three hundred yards cloverleafs were a thing of fantasy at three hundred yards the groups fell between nine and eleven inches from the xring at six oclock outside of the black the groups opened up and the federal revealed its fraudulence it had exploded beyond minute of angle to a full inches bob shook his head with an evil snort deeply disappointed the group looked like the random pokings of a child the lake city did a bit better but not much it was just at the minute of angle limit the group playing across three inches though in truth one of them might have been a flyer because if you subtracted it the group fell to inches and bob saw that the accutech stuff had beaten him his own group still had the illusion of a circle the punctures clustered within inches he was subminute of angle still but the damned accutech was inches with one threeshot triangle within inches damn he said thats shooting someone said thats fine shooting most men cant see at three hundred yards even with a no said bob awed thats ammo thats fine ammo it was fine ammo only fifty to sixty men in the world could handload ammo that fine frank barnes maybe a couple of the sublime technicians at speer or hornady or sierra a few wildcatters of a dying breed old gnarled men whod lived with guns in machine shops their whole lives a few worldclass benchrest shooters who agged in the s a few delta or fbi swat armorers whoever put this stuff together knew what he was doing bob had an image in his head of some old man whod done it a million times working the brass down to the finest smallest perfection it took more than patience it took a kind of genius he felt him he felt him on the range the presence of an old shooter who knew what he was doing bob knew then hed suspected before but now he knew they were playing him guiding him they werent what they said then who were they bob smiled now what colonel well lets eat then this afternoon wed like to take you to another range where youll be gunning for targets at even farther rangesbeyond five hundred yards out as far as a thousand sounds good to me said bob then tomorrow morning mr swagger im going to give you some real fun that night bob turned down an invitation from the accutech crew for a nice feed at a restaurant in thayersville and instead took his rented car and simply drove alone until he found an unpretentious place farther out away from the builtup areas a country place where he could sit by himself and not be paid any mind they didnt follow him they now kept their distance thinking sure they had him and maybe they did he was damned curious where all this was headed he knew in a general sense of course what it had to be it had to be about killing his reputation had preceded him people in certain zones knew of him occasionally something weird would come his way a nibble a veiled hint just the slightest indication that some really nice money could be his if hed only meet soandso in st louis or memphis or texarkana and listen to a certain proposal these offers came from strange sources over the years certainly some were from what he took to be organized crime interests others came from what had to be intelligence sources bob after all had done two jobs against civilian targets in the nam when ordered to in writing by higher headquarters still other approaches were simply welloff men with pathological inclinations who wished to use him in some way to solve a business problem to right a wrong to avenge an infidelity no bob always explained it was against the law go away please most of them did though occasionally one didnt there was one breed of hater it took special effort to drive away those who knew that the country was entirely theirs and that all good things would flow if others were removed of course what they meant usually was the black people bob had served with too many fine black ncos in the nam to listen to this kind of shit and though he had more or less given up on violence he had broken the nose of a fellow from some outfit calling itself the white order the man had said through blood and anger theyd put bob on the list too and bob had grabbed the man and thrust the blunt muzzle of his colt government model down his throat and explained simply mister if you cant do your own killing you dont scare me worth a drink of spit the man had pissed in his pants and disappeared off bobs mountain but fast but now these others this damn colonel bruce with his medal and his little bird dog payne rich enough to buy this whole spread bring him way out here have someone make up these excellent cartridges who were they who was worth killing to go to this much trouble agency he could smell it all over them this was how the agency worked at odd angles never quite out in the open bringing you halfway in so that by the time you figured out what was what it took more effort to get out than to stay so he sat and considered perplexed aching for a taste of liquor a cold splash of beer against his throat to soften up his mind so that he could think better but he knew one drink and he was lost so he fought his way through stonecold sober agency wants me hunting again but who bob thought and thought on it in the little restaurant his head and hip aching and got nowhere and only after many hours did he notice the place was about to close and the waitress was making hungry eyes at him hed have no part of that no thank you no women no liquor never again only rifles and duty but what was duty who was worth hunting who had loaded the accutech ammo bob got in his car and drove back he slept dreamlessly still setting course by a single star nothing is worth killing hed tell them tomorrow after hearing them out he would not kill again chapter four the next day they met at the threehundredyard range but without explanation the colonel was absent without his intense presence his people seemed a little more relaxed the man hatcher seemed to be in charge though only barely he was a wiry fiftyyearold redhead with spaces between his teeth a pocketful of pens nested in some kind of plastic envelope in his breast pocket and the distracted air of a man who knows too much about one thing and not enough about a lot of things he herded bob into a black jeep cherokee and with two others including the stolid payne they drove over a network of back roads around the hilltop to another area what he saw shocked bob some a large clear field on the down slope of a hill at one end of which stood a jerrybuilt scaffolding pipes bolted together the whole mad structure held stable by guy wires sunk into the ground at a variety of points around its perimeter it looked like a circus tent without the canvas or the skeleton of a building without the cement bob saw a series of ladders to its upper reaches and up there he saw a platform where a shooting bench and a chair had been installed its a building in tulsa oklahoma said hatcher or rather the height and the distances equal exactly the height and distances of a building in tulsa oklahoma see the car at one end of a dirt road that ran before the whole ridiculous structure there was an old limousine chassis its engine long since gone its body rusty but its passenger compartment reasonably intact it was attached by chain and winch to what must have been an engine a half mile away now what the hell is this its our swat scenario said hatcher weve gamed out a situation where were going to ask you to fire on a moving target in a hostage situation youll be operating off cues youll be earphoned into a network and youll get an okay to fire at a bank robber whos fleeing the scene surrounded by hostages youll have an envelope of about five seconds to go for a head shot its based on an event that took place in tulsa in where an fbi sniper had to take the same shot what happened ah he hit a woman hostage in the spine paralyzing her the bad guy shot two other hostages to death and then killed himself it was a horrible thing just a horrible thing man that agent trained for that shot his whole life and when it came he blew it a shame they were in a limo no it was the back of a pickup we got a deal on the limo the cherokee parked and various people stopped scuffling about and came over to greet the team hatcher checked with technicians radios were issued and handed out and they took bob to a blackboard under a leanto you know mr swagger in the past fifteen years by our computations law enforcement authorities federal and local have taken over eight hundred fifty precision shots that is through scopes at armed felons at ranges from between thirtyfive and three hundred fifty yards do you know what the oneshot stop ratio is id bet its low thirtyone percent oneshot drops hell just last year in sacramento california a police sniper took a clear shot at an unmoving gunman through the door of an electronics store and missed him completely the guy shot three hostages to death before they settled his hash do you know why bob thought a while took his time and then delivered an answer some tiny percentage of the misses might be due to round deviation or equipment failure but id bet the most usual cause is shooter failure in the nam i missed my first shot and my second it takes practice to get used to staying relaxed while taking the trigger slack out on a man you have to find a little cold place and be there by yourself for a while he was thinking thats right hatcher sang out cheerily so our theory is that if we can increase their confidence factor even by a tiny margin its a great thing you want that guy on the rifle knowing what hes got in his chambers going to do its job if he does his and one reason hell believe it were hoping is because youve told him so and showed him how bob nodded can i see the vehicle no think of it this way did the fbi agent see the vehicle any time before he had to fire no he didnt and we want to put you where he was and were not going to tell you the range either thats something wed like you to dope out on your own no what wed like is to put you up there on whats supposed to be the fifth floor of the tulsa casualty and life building its october tenth and a bank robber named willie downing with a cheap star mm and three female hostages is being driven toward tulsa international airport where an airliner is waiting he thinks to fly him to africa youre special agent nick memphis of the fbi swat trained the best rifle and pistol marksman in the office sometime in the next few hours willie downing will be before your sights having killed a policeman and a bank guard and wounded two more and now demonstrating serious signs of a pcpinduced psychotic episode your supervisor has determined that yours is the best shot you have the angle and the opportunity the real nick memphis was firing a remington in but without the heavy varmint barrel shouldnt have mattered said bob not for one shot anyway were going to tie you into a radio net and a lot of the information youll be getting is based on the actual transcripts so youll be in about the same situation as nick memphis was ill be on the mike down here reading you the radio commands to play you just the way his supervisors played nick memphis youll have plenty of time to set up just like he did and plenty of time to acquire the target while youre waiting for the green light so mr swagger now that youve seen it do you want to play bob looked up the teetery structure of rods and lumber it didnt seem too damn steady but it had him his vanity was pricked could he hit this shot especially where some federal fool had failed using up several lives in the process suddenly for the first time in his stay in maryland bob let the tiniest hint of smile crease his face lets do it he said for the moment not giving a damn about accutech but eager to the point of glee to take on willie downing and nick memphis they told him the real nick memphis had fired off of sandbags in a fifthfloor windowsill and way up in the scaffolding after a long climb he discovered that setup necessarily juryrigged but stable enough he put on the earphones and handsfree mike and switched as instructed to channel the fbi control channel there was the hiss and crackle of static then he heard ahh charlie four do you read charlie four do you read am i charlie four he asked affirmative came the response charlie four please advise as to your position it was hatcher playacting base well im up here dammit bob lets put ourself in for the sake of the exercise said hatcher over the earphones just reply in standard radio argot read you base ah im situated in the fifth floor of tulsa casualty i have a clear view east down he tried to remember from the map the name of the street down which memphis took his shot down ridgely ah okay thats an affirmative charlie four you just hold steady now whats the situation ah charlie four we have suspect heading your direction down mosher hes gone through two ambushes but onsite command wouldnt authorize a go because nobody could get a clear shot at the suspect hes surrounded by these damn hysterical women and we think he may have tied himself to them read you base please stand by bob took a second to look at the rough street down which hed be shooting the problem of course was range knowndistance shooting was easier because then you can calculate the bullet drop by the ballistics tables and your own experience but bob had no natural feeling for range some men could look at something and by the weird mechanics of the brain simply know what the distance was not bob so he had worked out a crude nakedeye system in vietnam if he could make out eyes he knew he was inside a hundred yards the rare shot if he could make out face he was under two hundred yards if he could just make out head he was under three hundred if he could make out only legs he was under four hundred if he could make out body he was under five hundred if he could only see movement he was under six hundred from his vantage point he watched as technicians scurried over the killing ground beneath him examining the chain that would tow the car fussing with the engine that would pull it adjusting video cameras mounted on tripods down the roadway he fixed them in his mind reading their shape and making his calculations off them he figured the shooting site would be about yards out meanwhile the crackle and hiss played against his ears as he heard other reports from police and fbi units checking in for instruction it was a constant chatter a torrent of loose noise why hadnt poor memphis had a spotter with him someone to run interference and to shelter him from the hundred distractions though bob could only see bluehumped mountains and rolling forest and though the breeze played against his skin cooling it he had no trouble imagining memphis in the hot little office behind the sandbags and the rifle his tension and agitation growing as he waited alone his excitement bounding as the situation drew nearer and nearer to him it was the excitement that fucked him bob thought you dont shoot from excitement or haste or urgency you shoot out of calm professional confidence rooted in the belief built up over a thousand hours practice and a hundred thousand bullets fired that if you can see it you can hit it charlie four you there affirmative base command advises that suspect vehicle has just turned down lincoln entering your district i have that base eta four minutes read you base back to you ah charlie four im getting real bad reports from people in the field theyre telling me this guy is waving his gun and screaming at the hostages and that every time he sees a police vehicle he acts a little crazier hes bad news bad bad news reading you base charlie four you think youd be able to make that shot bob squinted through the scope at the road down which the hostage vehicle would travel i have it big and clear base the shot is there for me if its there for you charlie four this guy could go off at any moment and hurt some more people i read you base you got an eta for me hes at lincoln charlie four lincoln and chesley and a uniformed officer says hes really flipped out makin me nervous very nervous base i make the shot three hundred twenty yards i can put it in a fiftycent piece at that range confidence is high here ah charlie four ive been in contact with command and its getting real hairy in that car were um weve decided to authorize a green light for you charlie four im reading you base and making ready to shoot ill be off the air now ah charlie four thats a negative ive got two spotters here ill be notifying you when suspect gun is pointed in safe direction and you can go for a head shot charlie four we cant risk a spasm shot do you read negative base i cant be concentrating on anything but my shooting then stand down charlie four i wont authorize a green light unless ive visually verified suspects gun position just like the book says so there nick memphis had had it caught right on the horns hed have some guy yelling in his ear as he was shooting or hed have to stand down and walk away from it all right base you talked me into it im sliding into shooting position now you sing out when your people say its clear bob slid the rifle into his shoulder watched as the scope came up big and bright and clean a moviescreen world all in primary colors bold and furious charlie four hes turned down ridgely hes coming into your kill zone right about now bob threw the bolt feeding one of the accutechs into his chamber he drew the rifle to him found the handsfree mike got in the way of his spotweld and thus quickly and savagely bent it out of the way to take his place behind the gun it was a modified sitting position with the weight on his left ham his body canted slightly as the rifle was pulled to him while resting solidly on the sandbag barricade it felt completely moored to the bags its weight entirely on them his upper body supported itself on elbows and the rifle rode a fulcrum of the sandbag guided by his hands pulling it tight against his shoulder his hip flared a bit under the strain but it wasnt anything he couldnt handle as he looked through the scope bob made subtle corrections in his grip and body position trying to find given the circumstances an equipoise one position where everything was tucked just right where he felt most comfortable less stressed where his breathing was natural and loose and yet through it all he still felt anchored into his chair and the bench and the bags through the scope he watched the slight tremble of the cross hairs matching his breathing that was the enemy really not willie downing or nick memphis or accutech or anything no it was his own heart which he could not quite control nobody could and which would send random messages of treachery to the various parts of his body at these last moments the heart could betray anyone firing off a bolt of fear that would evince itself in a dozen tragic ways a trigger finger hitch a breath held too long a weirdly detonating synapse that caused the eye to lose its sharpness or its perspective an ear that suddenly heard too much or not enough a foot that fell asleep and distracted its owner from the serious business at hand bob blinked quickly ordered himself to chill out and tried to see in the lazy tremble in the cross hairs not something to hate his own weakness but something to make peace with something to forgive selfforgiveness was a large part of it you cant be perfect all the time nobody can accept your weakness try to tame it and make it work for you bob breathed slowly letting the air hum half into his lungs then humming it half out he didnt want a lot of oxygen in them ballooning out on him at the awkward moments but dammit he still didnt quite feel comfortable it was all so strange sitting up there in the pretend building pretending to be an fbi agent pretending it was trying to pretend it was real there is nothing to pretend he told himself there is only shooting and thats never pretend hed figured the math out much earlier having memorized the ballistics table he knew that at yards the grain bullet was programmed to drop about ten inches and would have slowed by this distance to a velocity of about feet per second but he also knew that this accutech stuff was a bit hotter than the standard and so he figured it would only drop eight inches but he was shooting downhill a slightly different problem than shooting flat this meant hed add more of a drop because bullets fired at an angle fall farther he took another inch out of the equation that put him nine inches low at yards except that the wind just a slight breeze would move the bullet as it traveled perhaps four inches to the left so he had to hold nine inches lower and four inches to the left then he had to lead to compensate for the speed of the car and he had to do it on cue when he got the green light command over his earphones charlie four do you read fuck it thought bob what does he want he said nothing the mike was bent under his chin and to pull it back into place was to blow his spotweld his hold and his peace he would not give that up charlie four goddammit where are you bob was silent awaiting the arrival of the vehicle in the bottom right quadrant of his scope charlie four goddammit get on the air do you acknowledge call in goddammit charlie four i need you authenticated bob was silent trying to flatten out that bit of tremble from the reticle he tried to make his mind blank and cool and drive out any sensation of his own body there should be only two things finding the right hold and preserving it through the trigger pull charlie four you dont call in im not gonna green light you goddammit i have to have you on the air so i know youre reading my commands bob held silent his breath was rougher now he felt like tossing the earphones away talking to him now he tried to clear his head to make everything go away except the shot he could not charlie four green light canceled abort it hang it up if youre there charlie four do you read shot authorization is canceled therell be no shooting goddammit charlie four and now he saw it the limo body hauled by the chain slid into view its angle from him was not acute but more like forty degrees the car appeared to be moving at about twenty miles per hour bob had no trouble pivoting the rifle on the bag through a short arc as he tracked the car looking for his hold he tried not to note the details but he could hardly help it downing for example was preposterously a watermelon the four hostages around him were balloons it was crude but effective especially in the way the wind made the balloons waver in unpredictable ways and the bump and grind of the two made the melon queerly elastic nearly human bob almost laughed all this money to shoot a melon and he knew it was absurd too a hundred men could hit a melon like this but only one of them could hit a head and then that was gone too as suddenly bob had the position had it knew it had the shot had it right had it perfect he held as the car continued to slide and involuntarily without having consciously decided to disobey orders he began to take the trigger slack out he was going to shoot anyway fuck it charlie four gun is down green light green light green li but bob had fired already by then having already made the decision at some subconscious level his brain had yielded to his finger his finger had decided and in the instant before the blur took it all away from his eye he saw the melon detonate into a smear of red against the green maryland countryside as the bullet tore through it and mushroomed and when the scope came back from the recoil he saw all four ballons still waving in the wind and the melon blown in half congratulations said hatcher you win all the marbles you solved it bob said nothing just fixed him with a cool eye he had climbed down from the tower to be surrounded by admirers when did you decide to shoot it just happened you were so fast when you got the green light damn you were so fast bob didnt tell them he was halfway through the pull when the word came here you can read the transcripts yourself he handed them over to bob who looked at them briefly enough to satisfy himself that yes indeed base had been on the earphones to poor memphis until almost the last second base have you acquired the target agent memphis yes sir uh hes at the bottom of my scope hes rising into my cross hairs uh hes base hold your fire charlie four until i have a confirmation that his piece is down agent memphis base goddammit i have him i have him i base no authorization hold it charlie four i cant let you shoot i agent memphis garbled have it dammit i can base negative negative charlie two can you give me a visual agent obrian i cant see his gun base i oh christ hes going to fire base garbled shoot green light fire goddammit take his ass down agent memphis garbled base god you hit the girl he hit a girl oh jesus in the back agent obrian suspect is firing on his hostages jesus will somebody hit him nick hit him hit him hit him agent memphis i cant see hes behind oh jesus hes shooting them i cant get another shot oh jesus help them help them somebody help them agent obrian he just blew his own head away obscenity nick he put that gunbarrel in his mouth and blew his obscenity head away he base get those people medical aid get those people medical aid jesus christ get those agent memphis shit that was enough why hadnt memphis had a spotter someone sitting next to him up there sniping was a twoman job or it was a oneman on his lonesome job it wasnt for a guy with a radio playing in his ear and base base was the real enemy base had made it impossible for the guy to hit that shot blabbering away like an old woman they fucked him but good said bob through tight lips he thought of the poor jerk watching the great tulsa massacre through his scope helpless enraged and most of all unforgivingly furious at himself for having missed the shot and hit the woman what happened to him he married the woman he hit he quadded her and he married her still in the bureau with a poor woman in a wheelchair to care for the rest of his life well heres to you nick memphis thought bob if i were still a drinking man id lift a glass to you and if i ever become one another time then ill lift one for you too its remarkable how institutions reveal themselves under stress said hatcher see the bureau is basically a bureaucracy and under everything it does theres a bureaucratic imperative so base had to monitor memphis even at the moment of firing had to neurotically pathologically that was bases first operating principle to cover his own ass and poor memphis being a team guy even though the solo artist poor memphis played along and in so doing completely compromised his shot there was a pause but mr swagger you didnt because youre not a member of a team and you have no norms and traditions to live up to you can just go for it you see through to the necessary which is utmost concentration that shot was probably within the furthest reaches of memphiss envelope and under perfect circumstances hed have made it but he got fucked we tried to fuck you and you just sailed on through it man you whacked willie downing good there were several other fans clustered around bob besides the gooney hatcher he could sense their admiration and despised them for it now mr swagger weve got one more test for you do you still want to play bob launched another gob into the dust queerly uncomfortable but not entirely displeased with the awe that was being thrust upon him ill take another shot he said maybe ill get lucky again this one is straight up your alley its pure sniper war this one is based on an incident that took place outside medellín in colombia in its highly classified so ive got to ask you never to disclose specifics to anybody fair enough im just here to shoot not talk as i explain it to you i think youll understand the need for delicacy in the matter it involves a dea agent who took a fourteenhundredyard shot at a drug dealer who was responsible for the murder of a dea team the guy had fantastic security bunches of colombians packing a lot of automatic heat and the word was out if anybody tried to take the guy down the colombians would just start blasting so reluctantly and unofficially dea decided to take the guy out with a minimum of fuss highly illegal but it was felt a message had to be sent to certain parties in colombia so it was a straight hit bob asked yes your kind of work no hostages nothing just a man and a rifle and a hell of a long shot youre not making any fourteenhundredyarder with a ill tell you that youre anticipating us again the dea shooter used a h h magnum with a sierra grain slug here heres the rifle the same one he nodded and one of the technicians brought a rifle case over and opened it bob only saw a rifle but what a rifle goddamn he said almost involuntarily thats a honey of a piece damn it was a boltaction model target pre with a fat bull barrel and a unertl scope running nearly along its entire barrel length its dark gleam blazed out at him in that high sheen that was now a lost art but had reached its highest pitch in the great american gunmaking days of the s and s it was almost pristine too clean and crisp well tended much loved and trusted but it was the wood that really hit him the wood in that slightly thicker pre configuration was almost black hed never seen a walnut with such blackness to it but it wasnt like black plastic for it had the warm gleam of the organic to it black wood thats a hell of a rifle he said he bent quickly to look at the serial number my god it was a one followed by five beautiful goose eggs the hundredthousandth that made it infinitely desirable to a collector and marked it as having been made around from the winchester plant in the metal was heattreated at higher temperatures to give it the strength to stand up to a thousandyard cartridge okay lets give it a whirl you have the ammo hatcher handed over a box of accutech sniper grade h h magnum law enforcement use only it said in red letters bob opened the box took out one of the long h hs it was like a small ballistic missile in his hand close to four inches of shell and powder and bullet heavy as an ostrichs egg what kind of ballistics its a thumper were kicking it out off grains of h and our own grain bullet boattail hollowpoint about three thousand feet per second bob thought numbers and came up with a inch drop at a thousand yards figure maybe for fourteen hundred yards bob took the rifle his first love had been a model often called the riflemans rifle and he now owned several including that recalcitrant that had consumed him before coming up to maryland and whose problems he hadnt quite mastered so the rifle was like an old friend where can i take it to zero uh its zeroed one of our technicians has worked it out to the yard itll shoot to point of aim at the proper range hold on there sir i dont like to shoot for money with a rifle i havent tested ah said hatcher embarrassed at bobs flinty reluctance i can assure you that you cant assure me of a thing if i havent done it myself would you like me to get the colonel why dont you just do that all right but i can tell you that the man who zeroed the rifle to that load and range he won a thousandyard championship with it in the midfifties itll shoot i guarantee you itll shoot hes got the trophies to prove it bob squinted finally he said goes against my principles but goddammit if it says winchester ill take a crack at it bob lay in a spider hole it was cramped and dirty the walls seemed to press in his view of the world consisted of only a slot maybe six inches by four inches and through it he saw a series of low ridges far far away there was a raw wall where the earth had been bulldozed up to form a bulwark he waited in that hole for two weeks hatcher had told him just be glad we dont put you through that and after all that waiting the shot came and he missed it a shame garcia diego for this was the dope dealers name was a careful man and had extended his security arrangements out a thousand yards from his hacienda he was the most hunted man in colombia after wiping out the team in miami now dea had tracked him down and knew that if he slipped out it would be at dawn over the back wall of his hacienda and hed be visible for just a second or two before he scurried away to his atv and disappeared into the jungle what youll see bob said hatcher is a remarkably lifelike human form its an anatomically correct dummy were pulling it over the ridge on guy wires that wont be visible to you and its suspended in a frame but it should from this distance look startlingly like a man youd best go for a center body shot now alone bob settled in behind the rifle the old winchester was the rifle hed learned to shoot on all those deer seasons back in arkansas it was like a letter from home or from the early fifties and it made him think of his old dad earl swagger was a dark and hairy man with a voice like a rasp being drawn over bare iron a man of solemn dignity and quietude well packed in muscle who nevertheless never ever raised his voice or struck anybody who hadnt first broached the issue of violence himself and who treated all men including what in those days everybody called niggers with the same slowtalking courtesy calling everybody even the lowest scum of earth sir he stood over bob patient as the summer sun endlessly still and steady now bob lee bob could remember him saying now bob lee rifles only as good as the man using it you use it well itll stand by you come heaven or hell you treat it mean and rotten like an ugly dog or ignore it like a woman who complains too much and by god itll find a way to betray you hell hath no fury the good book says like a rifle scorned well the good book dont say that exactly but it could bob lee you hear me bob lee nodded swearing that hed never mistreat a rifle and these many years later that was he felt the one claim he could make hed never let a rifle or his father down he looked down to the firing ground there was no movement at all it was quiet except that the wind had picked up he could hear it thrumming like a cicada low and insistent beyond a thousand yards youre in a different universe the wind which under three hundred yards can be a pain in the butt becomes savage the bullet loses so much velocity on its downrange journey that its trajectory becomes as fragile as a childs breath the secret is to make the wind work for you to read it and know it its the only way to hit beyond a thousand yards even with a scope theres no chance of bullseye no talk of xrings youre just trying to get on the target though an exceedingly gifted shooter with the best rig in the world can bring his shots in within four inches with his thumb he snicked the safety off the winchester locked his hands around the grip and pulled it in tight to his shoulder and ordered his body to relax as he looked for his spotweld scrunched into the spider hole among the stench of loam and mud he was in something as close to the classic bench shooters position as he could get rifle braced on sandbags fore and aft with just the softest give in the rear bag so he could move the piece in the brief period of time hed have to track the moving man his breath came in soft wheezes half a lung in half a lung out as he adjusted to the lesser stream of oxygen finding the spotweld at last he was amazed at how bright and clear the world looked through a unertl good thing he was indexed in the right direction the bigger the scope the smaller the field of view if hed had to hunt for it through the little bit of world the scope allowed him it could take all day and then he saw it it was just a shimmer of motion right at the crest line of the earthen wall fourteen hundred long yards away a mans head peeped over and peeped back he was coming bob felt the tension in him begin to rise and then he realized suddenly though not in words for there was no time for words in the blaze of the moment that this shot was what it was all about the rest of it accutech sniper grade ammo nick memphis in tulsa a dea mission against a dope king all that was prelude this was the moment theyd been nursing him toward by slow degrees an inch at a time coming onto it the way a man would come upon a final and much waited for much anticipated threshold it was a terribly long shot he now saw almost nobody in the world could make it he calculated the ballistics roughly and quickly because hed done it a hundred thousand times before trying at least to bracket what the bullet ought to do at the range from what other bullets of similar weight and trajectory had done and felt the wind and tried to dope his way toward a hold tried to instinct his brain into the shot but he felt that he was way out there he was in undiscovered territory nobody had ever been where he was before whod risk a shot like this it was criminally dangerous dope king or not all these thoughts of course fired through his head in nanoseconds the man emerged from the wall slithered over the top and stood there for just a moment sloppy as shit happy as a lark he was a dot a period a pill he was so very far away bob made half a hundred minute corrections in a time span that has no human measure found his spot in that weird moment of clarity and felt the trigger go back on itself and break and lost the picture from the scope in the blur of the rifles buck and knew hed sent the shot home for hed had a flash of the figure going instantly limp on him and it fell and rolled without dignity down the slope now bob saw what he had done what they had made him do and for the first time bob felt as if hed blasphemed with a rifle their enthusiasm didnt mean a great deal mr swagger by god burbled hatcher do you realize weve had twentyeight men in here weve had some exdelta force shooters some top fbi people the top gun on lapd swat and half a dozen other big city swat teams weve had the top shooters from the nra thousandyard championships and nobody none of them not a one of them has hit that shot you put that bullet within an inch of the heart a oneshot kill at fourteen hundred yards bob looked at him squinteyed its a nice rifle he said and whoever you got loading for you knows what the hell hes doing yes sir even payne so unimpressed yet curious now looked at him with some strange glint in his eye hell of a shot he said in a voice meant to suggest that in his time he too had seen and maybe even taken some hellacious long shots but bob still felt tainted it was like waking up after a night with a low woman and hating yourself for what you sold to have her mr swagger you all right damn if youd have been with dea diego garcia would be historical right now instead of the richest man in colombia bob smiled trying to pin down the peculiarity he felt daddy what did i do he thought remembering when hed taken his first shot at a deer and gutshot the poor creature and hed felt shame and hatred for himself his daddy had told him that it was all right and tracked the creature down himself to finish it off three long hours of following blood trails up and down some of the roughest slopes in the ouachitas his daddy had told him god forgives the bad shots if god knows that in your heart you were trying to put meat on your familys table and that you truly loved the creature you were hunting and were making it and yourself a part of nature if god didnt want man to hunt why did he give him the brains to figure out gunpowder and the model winchester rifle oh i figure i know where i stand he said because it just flashed into his head and he knew what theyd done to him and what i figure is youd best go get that phony colonel of yours and get him fast so he can explain to me why it is you went to all this trouble to turn me into the gook who hunted me he turned glaring you motherfucker you turned me into the sniper who crippled me and then killed my best friend he felt like fighting he turned and drove the model rifle butt into paynes mouth literally lifting the man off the ground with the blow and driving him to earth leaking shattered teeth and blood he hated to tarnish the rifles glowing wood with such dreadful matters but certain things demand to be done the blow sounded like somebody hitting a haunch of beef with a steel pipe and it completely destroyed paynes fat ugly face and put fear into his little pig eyes then bob reached down and yanked the hidden cutdown remington from paynes shoulder holster jacked the six red shells out into the dust and tossed the piece behind him my dog doesnt like you and i dont like you payne i dont like a man who carries a sawedoff semiauto gauge full of doubleought because he doesnt want to miss he turned back to hatcher to find the educated mans stunned disbelief at the rapidity and absoluteness of the violence you still here get your colonel or ill whip up on old payne here till the sun goes down then he watched them scamper chapter five myra died on tuesday at am the hospital called him right there in his office it was dr hilton nick just said yeah oh okay i should have been there nick she wasnt conscious okay dont hold that against yourself yeah but i should have been there theyd said it would probably come at the end of the week the vital signs were very low and she hadnt come out of the coma for nearly ten days so it was not unexpected but when these things happen they carry a sort of devastation with them that is impossible to imagine nick was stupefied at how hard it hit him sitting there in his office listening to the chatter and hum of life going on about him he remembered that on one of her last clear days she herself had told him to be strong to get himself ready that her time was near and of course she told him not to feel bad hed done as much as any man could do hed paid all his debts oh lord hed paid them it was worth it she said thered never have been a nick for her any way except the way it happened and she was glad that it had happened the way it had happened now he was to go have some fun that was myra never asked for much and certainly didnt get much but somehow made her way through it never picking up the bitterness some people who have far more seem to acquire he wished she were with him now because over the years hed come to rely on her in special ways almost as much as shed had to rely on him but that was stupid he wished his wife were here to help him get through the death of his wife instead nick got up and found hap fencl and told him he had to go out for a little while and that maybe he was going to take some time off now myra yeah finally boy she fought you want a valium or anything nick old son nah im okay what you got ticking anything hot i can look over for you while youre gone got a bust or two coming up i love the hairy stuff you know me a commando type this was a joke hap stood five feet eight and weighed about pounds while nick was a wide man thick and strong and a judo champ black belt and still the best shot in the office but nick didnt laugh because hed sort of phased out there for a second he blinked and pulled himself back oh uh nothing no the usual following colombians all over the town with mickey sontag thats all mickeys out at the cop range today on that swat qualification i was just going to push some paper more or less until he comes back hap was the supervisory agent in charge here in the new orleans office and a very good guy easy to work with he specialized in organized crime while nick worked drugs usually in liaison with the dea mainly because he had a diplomatic touch and got along well with what most of the other men called the doa boys so it was no problem for nick to drive out to the hospital he got there in fifteen minutes on a drive so blank it could have lasted for fifteen hours and taken him from omaha to tallahassee they hadnt moved her do you mind could i be alone with her for just a minute he said to the nurse sure but well have to take her to the mortuary soon enough yeah i know they scurried out nick looked around hating the goddamned room it was like all the rooms hed spent his life in anonymous personalityless some fake paintings on the wall the smell of plastic and disinfectant heavy in the air yet hating it he knew myra wouldnt have minded it it was never her way to mind such things i was meant to die that day she once told him like the other two girls and that man but your bullet saved me it delivered me it gave me you nick memphis it made me mrs nick memphis and so what ive got is all gravy its dessert six years of dessert well dammit now he was crying wasnt he shed forbidden that when it became clear that her collapse was accelerating and dr hilton said there was almost no chance at all shed told him she couldnt have him crying you should be happy no more lady in a wheelchair youre still a young man go out get drunk throw a party he went to the bed where she lay under a sheet hed seen corpses of course at crime scenes in morgues and when his mother had died in while he was at quantico and of course hed seen them in the tulsa street that day but still he found himself shuddering and had to make himself pull the sheet back wondering if he should but he wanted to he wanted to see her once more of course the coma had drained the flesh from her face and her eyes those hot bright fascinating eyes were closed and some time ago theyd cut her red hair short almost as a boys but it was myra she looked like a little bird her skin was pale and her bones were as fragile and precise as doilies but the pain was gone myra had pretty much lived in pain for six years no arms no legs plenty of pain so her face had a kind of repose it never quite achieved in life oh boy he thought honey i am really fucking up you said not to cry and ive just lost it lost it lost it nick it was the doctor nick you want us to get you anything no im okay we have to take her now all right he stood back and let them have his wife nick went out into the sun blinked reached for a cigarette before he remembered hed quit he put on his sunglasses because he felt his eyes swollen and pouchy he tried to think then he remembered there wasnt much to think about theyd made plans he knew where she was going and when the funeral would be it would be in two days which would make it lets see thursday between now and then it was all automatic all of it he supposed he ought to go home maybe some people would come by or something some guys from the office maybe their wives hed taken myra to some of the parties over the years and once theyd gotten over their clumsiness about the tragedy as he knew it was called they got to like her and some of the wives grew close to myra and had the habit of dropping in but he shook the image out of his head feeling the temptation to slide back into the good old days he knew that way was craziness hed end up in another crying jag he tried to get hold of himself thought the best thing might be to go for a long drive just point the car toward biloxi and go maybe spend a couple of days lying at the beach jesus maybe find a girl like myra said get laid for crying out loud but he knew he couldnt and he wouldnt do that he didnt know what to do that was the hardest part he just didnt know what to do then he thought about going to the movies or something anything to just take his head out of here for a few hours but movies were usually filled with people getting killed or maimed and he didnt feel up to it at last he hit on the lake hed just drive over there down by the water where it would be calm and cool and he could sit there and enjoy the scenery and let the sun melt on his face for a couple of hours and just chill out flatten out drift a bit but he figured he ought to call in what the hell just in case he found a pay phone and dropped the quarter fencl answered hey hap i think im shorted out for the day im going to fade okay thats cool big guy hey the guys want to take up a collection no flowers she didnt want flowers and dont break any arms okay they want to give fine if not thats fine too and give it in her name to some charity that would be very very nice id like that a lot great no problem by the way you got a snitch named eduardo huh guy calling himself eduardo calls in bout half an hour ago said he had to talk to you very shook latino accent probably nothing but you cant tell nick ransacked his head eduardo he had about fifteen investigations going mostly smalltime drug runners most of them thought to be working for gilly stefanelli the capo of the new orleans organized crime branch but he could place no eduardo in this catalog of losers grifters sharpies and angleplayers though indeed the name sounded familiar then yeah he had it it was a passover wally deaver whod just left dea for private business had told him hed given his name to a few of his snitches and contacts because he didnt want the guys in his fuckin office making supervisor off of his snitches whats the number ah lemme see nineeighteight twentytwenty room fiftyeight from the exchange id say its out by the airport isnt it yeah i could hear jets overhead you know nick why dont you pass on it its no big deal these guys call in with shit all the time thats all if its important hell call back take some time sort it all out put all your pieces back together its no problem im sorry i even mentioned it no i ought to give the guy a call you never know talk to you nick hung up fished for another quarter and dialed the number quick before it vanished from his head he got a desk clerk identifying the place as the palm court and asked to be put through to room the phone rang and rang and rang i guess he aint there said the clerk hey where are you its just off iten at the airport exit were on the left two down from the holiday inn great thanks said nick looked at his watch and with a sigh decided to go back to work the palm court motel turned out to be a shabby nonchain budget joint familiar by type out of half a hundred thirdrate dope deals that nick had either watched or busted or simply listened to it was one of those cinder block places painted in gaudy oncefanciful colors and built in the early fifties when americans were just discovering their automobiles and the seductions of a bright band of highway to ride to the horizon he pulled into a stall found room near the stairway on the first floor bathed in the fluorescent glow of two coke and two pepsi machines he knocked hard on the door nick was a big man almost two hundred and though extremely strong never quite looked it he had a soft mulchy body and wore his hair in a longish crewcut he was wide really rather than big and the hair was a bit blond and the eyes bluish he looked more like a junior minister or a soap salesman than a federal agent his gift was for friendly perseverance a virtue learned from myra he thought of before as his hot days thered been a time when hed burned to lock criminals away to test himself in the streets and sewers to save america from itself in service to that dream hed driven himself monastically for close to his first five years in the bureau he was always pushing himself and yearned to go on the raids the big busts to get assigned to the counterterrorism squad or the bank robbery rolling stakeout team he wanted to kill a bad man in a fair gunfight that was his goal then it all came apart in tulsa since then hed surrendered both his body and his career in making up for that one botched moment in trying to drive it from his mind but sometimes lying there hearing myras tortured wheezing next to him or seeing in the moonlight the skeletal silhouette of the chair it would come back over him with the force of an unexpected blow god you hit the girl thats what base had said nick would get up and be physically ill hed stagger into the john and blow his food for an hour and come out reeking and shaking and so full of hate for himself and his botched moment leaden with infinite futile regret he realized his fingers were bleeding from pounding on the door mister hey mister i dont think hes there nick looked up from his fadeout to see a maid oh yeah he said sorry say you see the guy what kind of guy was he older guy you know nothing special just another traveler how long ago he leave i didnt never see him leave they came to visit him then they left you a cop im with the fbi who came to him what kind of guys guys in suits you know like you younger maybe darker maybe thats all left oh maybe ten minutes ago do me a favor go get the manager the manager was a geezer in a hawaiian print shirt so garish it looked like a nuclear nova hurling gobs of orange light off into the universe it was quite a shirt for such a scrawny old rat who smelled of bourbon and deodorant nick flashed badge and id and told the guy to pop the door you got a warrant or anything it amazed him the lip he had to take it was television and the movies ten years ago it was all yes sir thank you sir what can we do sir now everybody thought the fbi was a bunch of fascists and had an attitude to throw what are you a lawyer nick asked the guy wants to talk to me maybe hes sleeping come on you dont need a hassle here just do me the favor okay no its that this guy was a bastard he insisted on this room the one next to the coke machines it wasnt even made up yet but he threw a horror show so thats why i didnt want to come crashing just pop the lock and let me do the talking nick said the old guy made a face and let nick know how reluctant he was and nick realized he was being played for a tenspot but he just put his dumb patient look on and waited the performance out and finally the man unlocked the door the first thing nick noticed as he stepped inside was the blood the blood everywhere on the walls on the bed on the mirror on the ceiling classic arterial spatter pattern aghhhhhhh the maid screamed holy fuck said the manager all right nick said you two out this is a crime scene you go on in and call eighteightfive threefourthreefour and ask for agent fencl you give him the address tell him its a real bad eleventwenty and that he should get the troops out fast before the city boys get here tell him nick is already here do you understand the old guys eyes were broadcasting station panic but he ran off to do what he was told nick edged into the room it was a slaughterhouse most of the killing had been done on the bed it was soaked in blood and there were jet sprays all over the wall above the headboard nick thought theyd hit him with axes and from the gore on the walls figured that maybe two or three whackers had gone to it he could see bloodsoaked adhesive tape where theyd splayed him to the bedpost to work on his soft areas with the axes but eduardo wasnt there nick could see a blood trail leading off the room into the bathroom jesus the guy chopped and mangled like that he had somehow tried to crawl into the bathroom nick could see his bare feet now pigeontoed in that loose way that prerigor bodies often have where theres no will or dignity and the limbs just arrange themselves into random patterns as defined by gravity he walked delicately over to the bathroom doorway and leaned in to look down at the body he noted a broad but old bare back and sinewy muscles eduardo still wore his suit trousers bloodsoaked white linen the head was skewed to the right and nick could see the profile of an elegant perhaps aristocratic face with balding white hair and an aquiline nose a bondage of electricians tape crudely encircling the lower head locked a wad of cotton into his soundless mouth the visible eye was open wide in horror and the face as did the whole body seemed almost to be floating on a tide of blood so much blood nick stared why the hell would he crawl in here why die on a bathroom floor instead of in a bed why roll off the bed and crawl dragging your guts and lungs and organs into the bathroom but then he followed the mans splayed left arm and at the end of his hand nick saw his finger pointing no writing hed written something in his own blood on the white linoleum floor but as nick watched in horror the tide of blood seeped farther out in satiny blackish splendor from the ravaged body of señor eduardo and it engulfed the word that he had written just as it vanished however nick made it out it said rom do the forensics people had been there an hour and the body had finally been carted off and hap fencl was still yelling at and being yelled at by a captain of homicide in the new orleans police department in the neverending turf war between local and federal agencies particularly on crimes that seemed initially solvable when finally nick down the hall on a pay phone made contact with wally deaver deaver was now head of security for a large pharmaceutical firm in boston and it had taken the better part of the intervening time for nick to track him down walter deaver wally hey wally youll never guess nick memphis man id know your merry tone anywhere how the hell are you hows frenchtown gumbo still hot that it is old pal now listen theres a little something thats come up i wanted to nick you ought to give up the bureau and join me out here jesus nick money money money theres so much money to be made it would be great for myra and you could yeah sounds great this is no line of work for banking any bucks thats for sure not if you stay straight listen wally theres some old busine hows myra shes great he lied anyway you remember just before you left you gave me a list of snitches you said might call youd given em my number instead of any of the guys in your own outfit because you were so pissed off about policy yeah what did one of them go sour on you boy did he go sour somebody whacked him but good he looks like that panther battalion got hold of him he was referring to the salvadoran ranger unit that had shot up a village and killed almost two hundred women and children a story that was all over the news a month or so ago when the investigation drew so much attention i figure couple of guys worked him over with fire axes whacked his action like you wouldnt believe oh jesus he must have crossed the colombians those guys are barbarians you mess with them and they mess with you right back yeah maybe so which of my bad boys was it guy named eduardo he tried to call me but i was out by the time i tracked him down theyd totaled him in a sleazoid motel out by the airport im there now eduardo yeah oh yeah eduardo wally said unconvincingly i made him to be about fiftyfive maybe sixty kind of an aristocraticlooking guy ring any bells yeah eduardo lanzman but guess what hes not a colombian hes a salvadoran and the news gets worse heres the punch line hes a spook a spook yeah i met him down there you remember when bush had the drug summit in cartagena lots of dea guys went down mixed with their opposite numbers as part of the deal he had it in colombia of course but there were guys there from all over centrala so i meet this guy he was in their national police intelligence section from salvo seemed like a decent guy so you know cops we exchange cards i tell him if he gets anything hot headed my way he gives me a call but someone later said he was an asset you know agency pork agency not as in deagency but as in ciagency hey if he had something why wouldnt he call his own team you never know nick in that world maybe it was panther battalion that hit him and didnt have anything to do with drugs but was political thats a serious league down there you piss off the wrong guys and the comanche with the darkened windows comes calling at midnight you did give him my name i was right on that if its the same guy maybe just before i left i went through my rolodex and sent out a form letter to all my snitches and contacts great and one more thing you got any idea what rom do might mean his last message maybe what he was trying to lay on me any idea at all doesnt mean a thing to me nick okay thanks wally he put the phone down turning the information over in his head nick we got something his passport it was fencl calling him from room guys name is eduardo lachine of panama city panama he had a ticket stub from a flight in from panama this am plane stopped in mexico city as we make it he came straight here probably by taxi according to the hotel he made one call to me yeah i guess and that was it are we going through his luggage thats just it there isnt any luggage the room clerk said there wasnt any luggage either this wasnt a trip he came here to see just one person you and it killed him said nick chapter six the colonel had attitude that was for certain not a twitch of regret touched his tough face not a shred of selfdoubt what he got from bob furious rectitude and the concealed threat of violence he paid back in spades all right swagger he said youve seen through us what do you expect congratulations you were supposed to its time to put the cards on the table whyd you do that to me whyd you set me up to take that shot on myself and poor donny they say you dont trophyhunt anymore swagger i wanted to let you know that there were still trophies worth hunting they were now in a small crummy conference room in the trailer that wore the accutech sign near the threehundredyard range the colonel glared at bob the others were some kind of bearded sissy bob had seen at the range and the suckass hatcher weirdly dominating the conference table on which it sat was a large sony tv with vcr were they going to watch a show what is your name sir said bob it isnt william bruce said the colonel though there is a colonel william bruce and he did win the congressional and he was supervisor of the arizona state police a fine man im not a fine man im a man who gets things done and i usually dont have the time to be anything except an asshole and this is one of those times i dont like being lied to youd best come clean or im on my way out of here youll sit there until i say so said the colonel fixing those hard level eyes on him asserting the weight of rank it was a sense of command that hed seen in some of the best officers the men who pushed the hardest it wasnt inspirational except by deflection it was instead a gathering of will a fury to win or die it was a gift too and without it in battle an army was lost but bob had seen its ugliness too that rigidity that could conceive of no other way but its own that willingness to spend other mens lives that came from holding ones own cheaply but the mission dearly this guy stunk of duty and thats what made him so fucking dangerous were after a man the colonel said hes a very special man a very sly man we think were going to get a shot at him were after the soviet sniper who has hit many great shots in his time among them the fourteenhundredyard job that blew out your hip and the spine shot on donny fenn it was amazing dr dobbler was thinking his selfcontrol was astonishing no gasp no double take as if it didnt matter swagger simply took it in and went on his concentration unmodified his glare unblinking no signs of excitation as were common to the species in moments of conflict no rapid breathing no facial coloration no liplicking muscular tension no excitation no wonder he had been such an extraordinary soldier in battle dobbler wondered how rare this was was it as rare say as the ability to hit a major league fastball a gift given to about a hundred babies a year or was it extraordinarily rare such as the ability to hit a major league fastball for an average of or better which arrives to a baby once in a generation or so dobbler knew hed come across something rare and it gave him a thrill it scared him too bob was leaning forward you dont give a shit about donny fenn theres only two of us left in the world that remember that young man and you dont give a shit about my bad pin you know what swagger youre right i dont give a shit about donny fenn and i dont care about your hip but i care about this russian because hes back hes hunting again nick put fifty cents in and after a bit somewhere inside the machine there was a shifting and a clunking and after another bit a can of diet coke rolled down a chute and banged into the bin he pulled it out peeled the pop top back and took a long bracing swig damn said hap fencl fifty cents in our building the goddamn things cost seventyfive but nick didnt respond i cant think why a guy would want to be next to a coke machine he finally said hell two coke machines two pepsi machines an ice machine and a machine that drops bags of stale peanuts he gestured to the little arsenal of vending equipment clustered in the alcove just outside room maybe the guy had a sweet tooth never wanted to be away from the machine no its the last room youd take you got guys dropping quarters or rattling through the ice all night long it doesnt make a lot of sense nick he thought he was being followed maybe so he wants a room where theres a lot of action outside in the hallways figuring it might scare the hitters off these guys though nothing would have scared them off yeah but hey nick youre not thinking straight youve seen a dozen of these things not quite so bloody its a straight drugtrade wipeout the colombians or the peruvians or whatever sending the word out that they are not to be disobeyed or nasty things happen this guy got caught snitching went underground they caught him and whacked his butt good okay nick nodded still it bothered him why me he thought why would this guy call me of all people on the day my wife dies he emptied the coke can in one wet sweet swig here he is mr swagger said the colonel the man who shot donny fenn and who crippled you bob looked at the face that the colonel had brought to the television screen with the snap of a remote control he tried to see some special thing there something that said shooter something that said sniper what he saw was a lean hard face a face that had no nonsense in it the eyes were slotted and dark like gun slits the cheekbones were streamlined knobs the hair a tight military sheen there was a streak of the orient in him in the slight flare of his cheekbones he looked like a mongol solaratov t we think thats his name but nobody knows what the t stands for bob just grunted because he didnt know what else was available t solaratov as photographed from quite a distance away by an agent codenamed flowerpot in kabul afghanistan in our last picture of him and our best hes fiftyfour years old in peak condition runs twelve miles a day he was in afghanistan advising spetsnaz units on sniper deployment hes an expert on sniper deployment hes hunted men all over the world whenever the soviets needed a shot to be taken he took it for them how many men have you killed sergeant bob hated this question it was nobodys business it didnt matter all right said the colonel you can be strong and silent but the official records say eightyseven and id bet you hit lots more lots bob knew what the figure was he sometimes pretended he didnt but he knew exactly we figure comrade t solaratov has sent over three hundred fifty suckers on to a better world head shots mostly his trademark no pussy centerofbody shit for this boy bob grunted that was serious shooting nick flashed his id on the woman and in a few seconds he was led in to see mr hillary dwight vice president the cocacola bottling company of new orleans in charge of vending sales mr dwight was a florid man in a white tropical suit who perhaps drank so much pure coke that it had affected his ample waistline but he had a monks shrewd devotional eyes and an office so neat it spoke of a tidy precisionoriented mind so what is it i can do for you mr memphis he asked i hope one of my drivers hasnt gone and done something wrong those boys have access to all sorts of institutions and frankly the quality of personnel just isnt quite what it once was no sir said nick no its just a little mystery im trying to get a handle on we have a fellow who got himself killed in a motel room out near the airport good heavens said dwight but before he got killed he specifically asked for the room near the coke machines you have two coke machines just outside and pepsicola has two there was also a handycandy dispensing machine for candy bars and nuts and the like now what are the properties of a coke machine that might make a man who suspects hes being trailed by killers seek out their presence or am i barking up a wrong tree entirely hmmm dwights plump face knitted up densely with the process of thought what was the motel nick told him he stood spun to face a desktop computer terminal and ticketyticked in some instructions nick watched as obediently in electroyellow the program rose before him the fat man studied it well now mr memphis you see were in the process of replacing our vendodyne series with the more advanced vendodyne youve seen them they talk to you you can put dollar bills into them and get change a very sophisticated piece of machinery and powerful too nick nodded enjoying the arcana of coke culture that was one of the many things about his job he liked so much it took you into new worlds all the time ah yes yes wed just serviced that place and yessiree wed replaced the fifteen hundreds with eighteen hundreds just last month a great advantage is size the eighteen hundreds hold two thousand cans while the fifteen hundreds only hold five hundred means we dont have to service them nearly as much and we can pass the savings on to the consumer nick remembered fifty cents a can so what does that tell us he asked remembering the glossy blinding brilliance of the new coke machine in the hallway well sir one of the properties of the eighteen hundred happens to be its field generation nick waited on the explanation the eighteen hundred really encompasses a small computer chip and it needs power to run it so it generates an electromagnetic field we had two of them there well they were putting out a blanket of electromagnetic pulse that means nick shook his head cursing his own stupidity i dont get it he said mr dwight smiled and then explained all right swagger heres what weve been able to turn up on the guy t solaratov according to an israeli team that went after the fucker and almost nailed him when he was instructing fatah in sniper techniques in the camps of the bekka valley in the midseventies our best source of information on him i might add and a damned shame for all of us that as close as they got they werent able quite to get their man when he was eighteen in the soviet naval marines his shooting abilities were first discovered and cultivated in the years to he absolutely ruled the eastern bloc shooting matches he was an extraordinary target marksman we believe he got his first kills however in hungary in both nicholas humml and pavel upranyehungarian nationalists arguing for further resistance to the soviet troops were dispatched from long distance by moisennagant bullets at rallies no trace was ever found of their killer by after certain exploits in the congo he had obtained a commission and been selected out of the soviet naval marines for an even higher elite the spetsnaz the soviet special forces he more or less retired from competitive target shooting in then he disappeared except for the occasional sightings and some other rumored guest appearances and in when a gunnery sergeant named bob lee swagger bounced number three battalion of the fifth peoples shock infantry in the an loc valley killing thirtysix men over a heroic twoday encounter and thus saving the lives of twelve green berets and a hundred indig troops on an eavesdropping mission up near the cambo border the nvc freak and send to moscow for a pro so comrade solaratov arrives hes searching for one guy you it takes him a week to infiltrate in but he cant get closer than fourteen hundred yards he studies you living and pissing and shitting in that little hole for a week then when everythings perfect he takes the shot you took today oh but fourteen hundred yards is a long way he didnt get the drop right said bob thats right so he takes you low in the hip but that gives him the range and when donny comes over he hits it center chest then hes history solaratovs a big hero he gets the fiftythousandpiaster reward on your head and two days later hes in moscow having strawberry blintz and getting laid bob looked at the shooters face on the television screen yeah hed heard the rumors guys came back said a white guy had nailed him the colonel continued we have him next in angola in the seventies weve got him in nicaragua instructing sandinista shooters weve got him in and out of the middle east as i told you where the israelis laid on a napalm strike just for him and missed him by less than an hour hes very big in the middle east does a lot of work for some nasty boys over there weve got him in afghanistan for a long long time he ran a unit of spetsnaz snipers there they dropped their targets in the hundreds make you and donny look like sunday school teachers bobs hand went to his hip to quell a little flare of pain down there nick called a guy he knew in dea who had a brother who worked for defense mapping in washington but who had at one time worked for a certain outfit quartered in langley virginia it was a complicated exchange involving a lot of billing and cooing and finally begging on nicks part but finally the brother said that yes he knew some people in the outfit still and he could make a certain highly unofficial call to an old buddy and ask nicks one question he would only ask the one he would ask no others and he would deny till the day he died that he ever knew or heard of a nick memphis he would call nick backwell hed call nick back when he was good and ready to why would a russian be back in this country hunting somebody bob said i said he was a russian said the man i didnt say he was hunting for the russians solaratov was ousted unceremoniously retired when the red army downsized last year after the soviet union broke up pissed him off he felt discarded he felt bitter know anything about an old warhorse who feels discarded sergeant swagger bob just stared at the prick he was spotted in july guess where i dont like games mister it would have been your first and only guess downtown baghdad in the presence of a general khalil alwazir who is head of al mukharabat the iraqi secret police now sergeant into the present let me tell you about rainbow do you know what rainbow is i dont know what rainbow is said bob wanting the man to be done with it hardly anybody does its a satellite exceedingly sophisticated stealth impregnated that sits in very high orbit above the middle east seeing all that it can see and sending the pictures back to us very helpful the past few years the iraqis and the syrians and the libyans suspect its there but they cant verify it because they cant pick it up on their cheap eastern bloc radar but theyre careful when they do their secret things they do them at night when rainbow isnt nearly so effective but strange things do happen who would play lotteries if they didnt now look at this he snapped the picture control and brought up a series of photos they appeared to show one after another a hazy series of markings on the earth as seen from high up thats rainbow working over central iraq about two hundred miles above baghdad near a military installation at ad dujayi late one night a few weeks ago trying to get a line on our old friends the medina division of the republican guard and what do you see you see almost nothing and thena miracle he clicked again the photo was dramatically clearer what bob saw was towers very like the one he had perched in that morning overlooking networks of roads or amphitheaters at varying distances the geometry of each setting subtly different from its brothers lightning natures flashbulb something nobody could predict it lit the ground at the instant that rainbow was snapping away and yet the clouds werent sufficient to blot out our view of this rather elaborate arrangement but whats really interesting about this setup is they take it down every day it must take hundreds of men and just to keep our satellites from getting the snapshot weve just seen look heres what the daylight reveals he clicked again what bob saw was simply a random pattern of roads across a desolate plain now can you solve the puzzle swagger these photos solaratov in iraq do you see it yet swagger sure said bob theyre prepping a shot those are buildings and streets hell have handled the range and angle solutions already itll be familiar to him we should have come to you in the beginning it took a young man in the agency a photo analyst weeks to come up with the same answer and those are lost weeks but he finally had the bright idea of coding the grids of buildings to streets by angle with the help of a computer and having the computer run a check on those same streets and angles swagger its the inner harbor from the usf g building in baltimore its the back porch of the white house from a roof at the justice department the justice department and its downing and huguenot streets in north cincinnati and finally its north rampart and st ann in new orleans all right said bob so it is sergeant those places have one thing in common they are all sites of speeches to be given over the next several weeks by the president of the united states dobbler watched the two of them they were both children of the superego they had nothing in them that would ever tell them to stop hold back wait consider they were both forceful men without ideological underpinnings who approached the world simply as a set of problems to be solved he remembered when the colonel had found him working in a mill clinic in rafferty massachusetts prescribing aspirin and bandages to the children of mill workers the colonel had simply walked in so vivid a presence that no nurse would hold him back laid down the boston globe front page that carried the news of dobblers sentence the year before across three columns and said if you can keep your dick in your pants i can get you some really interesting work lots of money fun travel adventure some of its even legal wwhat do i have to do supervise recruitment analyze prospects from a psychologicalpsychiatric perspective tell me which of em will jump when i say boo nobody can do that no but you ought to come closest or would you rather stay here and hand out bandages for the rest of your life its part of my arrangement with the cour not anymore the colonel laid a parole board exemption before him are you with the government asked dr dobbler you might say that said the colonel bob let the silence hang in the air until it seemed to crack theyre still trying to win that war said the man they think they can win it with one shot and solaratovs the hired gun what do you want from me swagger youve done something damn few men have done youve stalked and hunted men hundreds of them you are one of the worlds two or three best maybe an israeli or two maybe an sas man somewhere this solaratov carl hitchcock but nobody else in the world is in your class we need a man wholl attack our problem for us the way a sniper would we want to know how hed put an operation together where hed shoot from what sort of ordnance hed use we want you to brief our security people wholl find ways of making sure the information is inserted into the federal security mainstream and acted upon because we want to catch this piece of terrorist shit and turn him and empty out all his little secrets and use him as a club against his masters in baghdad well smartbomb them back to dust and cinders bob said nothing for a time he was thinking things through and still he didnt like all this didnt like the fact that these boys still had agency on them like a smell he wasnt sure if he trusted them enough to have a cup of coffee with but then he knew he didnt really have a lot of choice it was all set up set up years ago he remembered the numbness and collapse as he went down and the way donny scrambled down after him his whole life ahead of him and the way the light vanished instantly from donnys eyes as the bullet bit through to his spine he finally turned to the colonel he said put me on the rifle colonel and ill bodybag this sly old boy for you for the first time in many years bob the nailer smiled feeling just a bit reborn aroused dobbler wrote chapter seven the funeral was on a thursday with all the office guys there and most of their wives even some of the office girls and maybe a few dozen other people from the law enforcement community in which nick moved and their wives too and some people whod simply read of myra in the timespicayune obit there must have been fifty or sixty they stood quietly in the sunlight not really moving or talking but just by their radiance being there with him trying somehow to help him and do something for myra it pleased nick that so many showed up myra had been such a quiet little mouse about her life taking what she was given there should be medals for the myras of the world but somehow there never were so a graveyard crowd was the next best thing the cemetery was out in kenner fifteen long miles west of the city a place nick had chosen on his own because it was so open and grassy none of those looming dark jungly trees and the soupy ground sheathed in thatches of reeds that seemed everywhere in what passed for country around new orleans just an expanse of green overlooking some tract houses and in the faroff the lake nick liked it because it seemed midwestern to him and he liked all the sun the grass and the trees that werent cypress or fern and of course it was a bright and shiny day a bit chilly everybody at their best it was formal in the most meaningful sense it gave myra the idea of having counted and being part of some larger more organized whole a society he even spoke a few words over the bier after the minister had finished look um he mumbled i wanted to thank all of you and your wives for taking time off to come on out and help me say goodbye to myra uh she was a terrific gal as you all know and its real great that you guys came on by i know it would have made her real happy so uh thanks again for you know coming on by it sounded lame but he didnt care then they filed by and shook his hand and said dumb stupid things and he nodded and watched them go im so sorry nick said sally ellion one of the pretty girls in the computer records section oh he said somewhat startled to see her here yeah well uh thanks for coming you were so brave she said huh me yes you nick and then she moved on one of the last in the line was hap fencl nick take some time off for christ sakes you been through a lot give yourself a break hap the best thing for me is to get back to work you know id just get bigger and dopier if i hung around the house and theres all the things to remind me so ill see you in an hour or so nick you take care of yourself you hear said haps wife marlee you need any help you let me know sure he said then he watched them go until he was alone with the box except he could see some old black guys standing way off with shovels theyd wait and wait until he left and then theyd lower her and discreetly cover her over with dirt that was all that was it that was what had to be faced okay babe he finally said the guys with the shovels are here time to go ill always remember goodbye now people hap was saying when nick showed up late still in his dark blue suit were getting the buzz out of washington on these colombians still and dea all over the goddamn board is howling that were not putting them in our loop so but if you give it to those guys its all over the street in fifteen seconds okay dea has a slightly different agenda than we do you all know that theyre going for the quality bust because they dont have enough guys to burn small fry like us so once in a while yes mike they do let a little something loose so as to turn it for something bigger still what im giving you is the official word from on high you guys gotta share with dea there was a murmur of disapproval from the twelve agents of the new orleans fbi narcotics squad outside in the bright afternoon sun the traffic snorted and honked up loyola street in front of the federal building nick slid in next to his partner mickey sontag whod held a seat for him i miss same old the mick whispered just shit on paperwork flow on some new buymoney regs due out some news on qualifications and swat applications the same old sameold great said nick the meeting continued the usual early thursday afternoon ordeal and nick wondered why hap didnt just cancel but hap was old bureau no matter how much a oneoftheguys type he pretended to be with a dad and an uncle having retired as supervisory agents and so hed always play rules rules rules that was the fbi way as nick knew better than most then they moved to cases as one by one the agents briefed their pals on what was hot and what was not all of it standard and routine the point was that in giveandtaking like this on a formal basis every week maybe somebody would notice connections between cases make quantum leaps or free associations and it sometimes happened but it didnt this time just droning men in their law enforcementdud voices ripping fast as hell through stuff that nobody else much cared about no patterns in it anywhere nick couldnt pitch in having not really leaned into his job since myra died and that goddamned guy got whacked in the palm court motel but he made a noise when it came to questions one and all questions one and all there were a few nothing much and finally nick got his hand up in symphony with haps glance in his direction say hap on that guy whacked at the palm court whats the disposition not much dea has no record on him in the dope loop and nopd cant commit any real manpower thank you you know how those guys are in throwing bodies at cases that look like theyre not headed to an arrest so where does that leave us guy was trying to reach me he you know nick its not really our bailiwick if hes not fleeing a federal charge or committing a federal crime i think itll end up in nopds ihopesomebodytellsuswhodidthis file come on hap you know we can ride hard on anything if we can find the angle yeah but it doesnt look remotely promising drugs maybe but theres no evidence anywhere in the system the guys not from here you say hes agency but the agency doesnt say hes agency the agency never says theyre agency according to the agency the agency doesnt exist but this guys not a panamanian hap my source told me he was a salvadoran yeah well the paperwork doesnt bear it out that was a legit passport which could mean hes major league spook which probably means hes minor league nothing and if he were spook you damn well know the agency would be here running a damage control operation they freak when were talking national security you know how that bends them out of shape they dont care no leads no nothing it could be jealous husbands squabble over profits family problems that sort of thing its interesting like a mystery novel clues that rom do bit yes i give you that but theres gonna be two hundred fifty unsolved homicides in this area this year and im looking at one of them eh pardner its just not interesting you know in dc they want body bags to brag about indictments convictions that sort of scalp hunting so i cant commit to big maybes you know nick i got something for you i think youd like you give me a chance to get to it well let me just throw a fast possibility at you okay ive been thinking it over its late nick and theres some other please oh go ahead shoot fire away nick cleared his throat first i have to ask myself howd those guys get in that room the hitters guy was scared guy was on the run guy thought hed been made guy was sending out signals of catastrophe but hes only in the room maybe ten minutes before theyre on him maybe he ordered out for room service and no room service in a crappy joint like the palm court plus he wouldnt have no way he was just going to sit tight until he talked to somebody he trusted that being me because he had my name from a guy he knew in dea me bureau rather than somebody in dea because like we all know dea isnt tight we just joked about it a few minutes ago theyre not tight he doesnt trust them doesnt that tell you the guy knows what hes doing okay so go on said hap heres a second thing he asks for no he demands a room next to all the coke machines very weird you have to admit now why would he do this i mean really coke machines maybe he liked coke nick somebody said when the laughter died nick said the agency says hes not one of theirs but let me tell you something very interesting not two weeks ago this agency which doesnt exist it puts out a routine whats called technology memo for field usage about the useful properties just discovered in vending machines that would especially help a guy on the run in an industrialized city i went over to the coke company a couple of days ago coke machines especially the new powerful ones guess what they put out a lowfrequency electromagnetic force field enough to screw up a tv radio a small appliance or a parabolic mike for acoustical penetration he looked at them let it sink in he knew he was being hunted by pros pros whod have the latest audio stuff the agency had just told him how to beat it dont you see nick i started hap but it gets even more interesting know why see they had very good stuff not crap stuff like we have but stateoftheart eavesdropping gear so he thought he had them beat but they had him beat and thats how they got in whats the eavesdropping have to only way they could get in without a struggle or leaving pick marks on the lock or any physical evidence of entry is with the magic two words the magic two words were nick memphis eduardo lanzman or lachine or whatever he calls himself he calls the office asks for nick memphis leaves a message ten minutes later knock comes at door somebody says nick memphis eduardo opens theyre on him very fast and they whack him fair enough so howd they get my name the guys looked at him silently mike farthing lit a cigarette hap was making like a couch potato mickey sontag another bruiser but a young one scratched his nose they couldnt run a tap they didnt have time howd they get my name okay whatre you saying they had to have a parabolic mike they acoustically penetrated his motel room it wasnt hardsealed of course but they could beam through the electronic interference of the coke machines and hear what he was saying okay its the only adequate explanation of the event they were looking at him and the significance of that if their equipment is that good then its one of those jobs that costs out at about two hundred thousand dollars were talking an expensive piece of equipment we dont even have one you guys know if we want one we have to petition washington make the case that our bust is that important and they send it over from miami or down from st louis in a van with two technicians that is if we can get the highest approval so whats a piece of the space age like that doing being deployed in some lowranking drug hit im telling you guys the signature all over this one is that it involves some bigtime heavy hitters some intelligence people maybe or at the least some very very big drug operators hap considered nick its thin you dont have any hard evidence you have nothing to take to court you only have your interpretation and the word of some guy from coke hap just give me a week or two its the silly season and if now and then it runs thin ill drift over to robbery detail or shag paper for buncofraud or run stakeouts here on narc so these guys can take a day off now and then whats your angle i want to ride the mike thing who makes these things how are they dispersed who owns them how would people get hold of them we can justify it by saying that its a possible stolen government equipment thing if you get any heat on it but just let me attack it through that angle and in a week or so ill let you know what ive come up with ahh said hap its not making me happy nick i have to answer to washington and you know what pricks they can be tell you what you do me a favor ill do you a favor and well see how we shake down end of the week name it well your favorite mickey mouse outfit our old pals in the secret service are a chorus of groans secret service personnel were arrogant reputedly the best shots in federal service very showy very touchy and always hard to deal with because they put their agenda up front of everything hold the cheers girls anyway theyre sending a security detail down because in um three weeks flashlight is coming yep the man himself anyway washington wants us to cooperate up the kazoo with secret service and the bad part is the people on pennsylvania avenue are sending a heavy hitter down to run the liaison because yours truly doesnt quite carry enough weight but we have to provide support so i need a gofer to run errands for this big guy and keep him out of the offices hair and make my life easier so heres the deal nick you fill this guys coffee cup for him and kiss his butt just where he likes it to be kissed and dovetail with the assholes from secret service and ill cut you some slack to run this investigation it was a deal nick couldnt say no to and so he said yes happily but the happiness only lasted a second yeah now i got you buddy guess who the washington shot is nick had a presentiment of tragedy no sorry yeah guys a comer what can i say its howdy duty howdy duty was the nickname of howard d utey special assistant to the director former head of counterespionage staff director of counterterror former assistant director of organized crime one of the hardestcharging law enforcement executives in the bureau and a man much loathed and feared by all who knew him but especially nick for in howard d utey howdy duty on his way up fast had been supervisor of the tulsa office howdy duty had been on the other end of the mike when nick took his shot howdy duty was base howling in his ear as he blew out the spine of the only woman hed ever love chapter eight bob made a fast check from outside if theyd been in theyd been damned careful and very professional he could find no trace of entry no tracks or disturbances in the dust no sign even of scuffing where they might have wiped out tracks most important the dog mike was slightly mangier for wear but not dead and bob knew that if anyone had tried to enter the trailer compound mike would kill or die himself sam vincent had kept the beast fed while bob was gone and mike part sloppy beagle and part godknewwhat from deep in the ouachitas was on him when he unlocked the cyclone gate tongue wet and gloppy eyes warm yet mournful mike was another solitary creature a great pal who could seem to make no other friends and simply gave himself wholly to bobs service bob rubbed him and made him sing for joy then got him some food as he opened his various padlocks the trailer first immaculate and pristine as he had left it the gun vault all guns gleaming in their patina of oil he quickly replaced the remington while doing this and finally the shop out back where the problematic winchester damn its stubborn soul still sat disassembled he looked at it felt a yearning to lose himself once more in its intricacies and try to get at its secrets why was it now betraying him had it grown bored with loyalty and not enough attention had it a weak character was it not a piece to be trusted when things turned dark and hairy or was it just tired being fifty years or so old an ancient piece of steel that had lost some inner fortitude but as he stared at it he knew he could not give himself to it no matter the ache involved he had something to do now something he wanted so bad it hurt him in places where he didnt think it would hurt ever again or that he even had he remembered himself lying with donnys heavy stillness atop him donnys warm blood flooding over him mingling with his own as the flies came and feasted on the stuff and from just inside the embankment the major was yelling dont you move bob goddammit we got a fire mission coming in well smoke his fucking ass he remembered remembering while he lay there the time in the an loc donny had stood out in the motherfucking green open with his m calmly shooting at gooks and drawing lots and lots of fire as poor bob busted from cover downslope like a covey of quail scrambled up to the safety of the crest amid a sleet of destruction his flapping stupidly in the breeze the jungle floor erupting from the misses around him until he finally made it to the top and the two of them fell behind the crest laughing like maniacs just spared death high and nuts on danger so in love with the great fun of their profession and the sense of the edge that made all pleasures so infinitely tasty oh christ bob you shoulda seen the look on your damn face coming up that hill damn i near to bust a gut you dumb sonovabitch kid why didnt you get your ass down no sense both our asses getting wasted fuck bob itd been worth it to die to see you lookin so scared and he dissolved in laughter he remembered his old dream he and donny and donnys beautiful young wife julie a few dogs some good old arkansas whiskey for cold nights all of them somehow living together in the ouachitas away from civilization with their rifles hunting every day drinking every night it was a stupid dream he now realized stupid as they come because there was no way the world would permit such a thing but hed been young and dumb when hed thought it up and he remembered when the major came in and saw him his leg slung above him in plaster the whole left side of his body immobilized didnt know they had someone who was that good the major had said it was a hell of a shot oh yes it was it was a hell of a shot i want him bob thought oh jesus i want him but it was a year before his body was well enough to hold a rifle again and by that time hed heard the rumors white guy specialist someone brought in for just one job but by that time too his war was over so now he thought hed tremble or cry the dogs warm tongue came slopping across his open hand jarring him back from there to here he shook his head a bit to stir the memories and make them flee and was aware how rocky he suddenly felt oh you russian how i want you for what you took from me then he got hold of himself felt his remade self fly back inside his body he was all right he was bob again who never talked but to three or four men in blue eye sam and doc lemieux sheriff tell the late bo stark when he was sober and who shot at least a hundred rounds a day rain or shine and had given himself up entirely to the rifles so that he could live out his life and feel nothing at all he was all right he had work to do it was fine now he was ready bob worked it out on decaf coffee and tv dinners his own way that is eighteen twenty twentytwo hours at it nailed at the kitchen table under a dim wash of bulb or a gray wash of thin january sunlight with only the morning walk with mike and the few hours sleep to break up the journey he did it slowly carefully never speeding up never slowing down looking through the maps and plans drawing diagrams taking measurements off his calculator studying the architectural renderings of the buildings making notes to himself he was a jungle shooter of course an outdoorsman but it seemed to him nevertheless that a city was a different kind of jungle so that the same lessons would apply a shooter would need the same requirements the same perfect harmony of elements before taking a shot and by this knowledge he steered himself a shooter would need first off a clean theater of fire by that bob meant more than just a lane of fire hed need a line to the target of course but equally important hed not want a formation of buildings either to the east or the west to funnel the prevailing winds and generate unpredictable shears of energy that could take the fragile trajectory of the shot and make a pretzel of it hed want the sun behind him when he shot to kill the possibility that his scope would pick up a beam of light from the sun in front of it and toss it somewhere someone was looking and the secret service would certainly be looking and then there was range the secret service worry zone tragically nonexistent in would almost certainly be a half mile out by this time thats yards where no windows could be open where thered be cops on every rooftop circling helicopters security checkpoints the russian would be at least a thousand yards out maybe more like twelve hundred hed need a place to shoot from threequarters of a mile away and it would have to be a secure place too with an easy unobservable entrance and exit with access to an escape route and it would have to be high for visibility to the target but not too high shooting downward on an angle always played tricks on bullet trajectory too particularly at extended ranges but there was a cutoff point beyond which the trajectory became too irrational and was uncontrollable bob figured solaratov would be at least three stories high but could not be any more than five and the temperature was important too a heavily humid climate could affect bullet trajectory too but a frigid one would be even chancier the neartozero weather making the guns action stiff and awkward and subtly transforming the vibratory patterns of the wood of the stock and the metal of the barrel to say nothing of the fiber of the man behind the trigger bob had heard a hundred stories of good men taking that most important shot at a twelvepoint buck on a frozen winter day and watching in horror as the bullet puffed harmlessly against the bluff ten yards away and the beast took flight leaving the hunter to face a bitter winter he didnt think the russian would shoot in any kind of cold weather or in a particularly damp climate too many ifs too many maybes if youre going to do it right you do it where the earth itself is your ally where the climate and the land and the sun and the sky are your friends he looked for a shot to take place where it was between fifty and seventy degrees out on an overcast day but a coastal city where the wind was tempered by offshore fronts and didnt howl in off a frozen midwestern plain or a frozen lake then there was the question of noise no matter what weapon solaratov chose this time he could not use a silencer that would only work with a subsonic round hed have to be at velocities of over two thousand feet per second with a weight of at least grains and more likely to have a chance of making a twelvehundredyard head or torso kill theyd have to build him some sort of nearly soundproof room or chamber a shooting bunker with acoustic baffling and only the smallest aperture for sighting and shooting but he himself would have to be back from the aperture so that the muzzle blast would be absorbed by the acoustic baffling with some sound leakage from the aperture but not enough to get a real fix on as the sound would be generalized and diffuse so bob thought of a rooftop structure a disguised heating plant and from that he calculated thered have to be nothing jerrybuilt about it they were working on it even now a structure of some sophistication and complexity easy to disassemble perhaps but nevertheless convincingly stable they could use any thousandyard rifle from a on up to a caliber sniping rifle of the sort now said to be in the inventory of elite units surely the russian would have access to a that possibility blew the distance factor out close to seventeen hundred yards and it opened up the circle of possibility even further bob moaned rare enough for him the job seemed huge his head ached he looked and couldnt tell if it was day or night checked the jungle seiko hed worn since hed bought it for twelve dollars in an army px in and saw that it was almost midnight he sighed and went back to work location time distance weapon these were the points of his compass as he studied the documents and tested a hundred shooting sites against them he came up dry the first time through he tried again harder sinking deeper into it he tried to imagine the man a shooter like himself sunk in his sandbags in a little dark room a mile out watching through the scope as the president of the united states did this thing and that thing and then his head blew off in a big red gout of tissue a blizzard of bone and blood and brain it would take weeks to find the room if he were firing from a mile out they might never find it he worked it through over and over and over in slow grinding degrees sinking so far beneath the surface he wondered if there was a surface was there a solution could it be done where could he find everything he hey he watched it appear watched it organize itself before his very eyes saw it all fit together he saw in that instant how it would happen how it had to happen he knew where it was the third day late well past midnight all right he thought you motherfuckers think its fourteen hundred yards outside the da nang wire as sniper team alpha slides over the berm it wont be because this time ill be waiting chapter nine nicky nicky said tommy montoya oh my boy this is not like you montoya was cuban deep into spook life who occasionally came across tips that he passed memphiss way as he did his jobs for various agencies of the federal government and perhaps for other customers as well he was one of those edgemasters a bit too clever for his own good whod some day be found in the big muddy or lake pontchartrain with a diesel crankcase wired to his ankle and a school of guppies living in a thoracic wound cavity but until then tommy montoya would lick the oyster dry and now he smiled holding an opened bivalve in one fat hand and his thick tongue darted out to nudge the gelid thing loose from its tray of shell so that he could suck it down in one intense sensuous moment nick tried to avert his eyes christ how could anyone eat one of those things nick was of the opinion that if it didnt bleed when you cut it you didnt put it in your mouth but the cuban still had his uses he knew things nobody else knew the business for example nicky he said again you know you go through channels deas got priority on those big eavesdropping rigs you apply through come on tommy said nick in a hurry to get through tommys coy games because howdy duty was due in that afternoon and he wanted to be ready when the old base got there because if you got off on the wrong foot with utey you never got back to the right one as nick knew only too well so he was nervous and not handling this brilliantly besides the bar on the riverfront was dark and seething with exotic men and nick in a stayprest blue poplin suit and a white shirt felt as if he had fed stenciled between his hairline and his eyebrows in letters three inches tall and knew the long grip of his smith was printing through the coat he plunged ahead all illusion of finesse gone say i needed one fast i gotta circumvent the red tape i got a big bust coming up but im afraid say theres a leak either in dea or my own shop i want ultrasophisticated listening technology and just to make it worth somebodys while lets say i liberated enough cash from a bad dealer to be able to pay the going tariff so whats my best move you aint wearing a wire my friend youre not trying to bug a bugger or con a con man you always seemed to me to be a pretty straight kind of guy it was said of tommy that hed gone ashore with brigade at the bay of pigs and spent two years in castros prisons and that he had scars like star bursts on his back he had that latin thing cajones machismo whatever that lurid but nonneurotic willingness to do violence that radiated out of every pore of his ample body no im clean man thats all i just have to figure out how some guys got some powerful listening equipment into play out by the airport a couple of days ago where they got some stuff and got it quick to set up a hit that guy had his insides cut to ribbons yeah that guy ooooooo nicky thats a strange one you know you always hear things always you know the players the teams when something like this goes down except now nicky my friend would you believe i aint heard nothing its strictly from out of town its got nothing to do with us ill tell you maybe not still its kinda personal come on tommy im just playing up the equipment angle i have a source who swears the guy was some kind of salvadoran spook and im also hearing agency on him but the agency wont play ball with me and his records are so suspiciously clean it makes me wonder how come a guy could lead a whole life without ever getting a parking ticket tommy made a sour face then with his tongue liberated another oyster how such a thick man could do such an obscene thing with such quick delicacy really amazed nick im trying to figure how the hell the guys got in to whack the john they heard him trying to reach me with some gear now where the hell you get stuff like that around here well tommy finally said what i think you want would be one of the electrotek models its a portable directional parabolic microphone very state of the art known for its capacity to penetrate even hardened rooms were talking over a million the unit far as i know only seven were built four for dea two for the agency and one for a foreign client very hushhush what country asked nick oh i wouldnt want to say my friend but they had themselves a nasty little war going on el salvador thats it son of a bitch he saw pattern before his eyes its what he lived for the magic connection between parts of a case he was thinking in great leaps electrotek goes to el salvador in what year say late eighties when were pouring aid in okay so this guy eduardo lanzman hes spook but he learns something something big something dangerous scares his butt so he thinks who the fuck can i call obviously its got spook business all over it so he doesnt want to go to his old pals in the agency right because he hasnt shaken it out doesnt know quite whos doing what to whom whos on which side oh i know how shadowy it gets so he has to find someone outside someone safe someone he can trust to tell so he thinks of an old pal in dea who might have some kind of perspective except that guy is not in the life anymore so he then thinks of this fbi agent the dea guy told him about so he takes off but now they know hes gone so he cools his heels somewhere just to throw them off the track but somehow they know hes headed toward new orleans so that gets them time to get the unit up here and set up a surveillance at the airport where they spot him they follow him theyve got the goddamn thing in play they find the room they penetrate it electronically these salvadorans they get my name they pop the room and turn poor eduardo inside out tommy looked at him nick you look like you just had a religious experience the virgin did she talk to you somebody did nick said not normally religious he had a brief impulse to make the sign of the cross for eduardo who opened the door expecting to see dull old nick but instead caught three bad hitters in the face and died the death only a mandarin torturer could have inventedand yet who cared so much that even after the executioners had left and his guts were like dirty socks in the bed and the shock had worn off enough for the pain to be the fifth act of every opera ever written this guy still had the machismo to crawl to the linoleum and pass on the message rom do rom do what did it mean what was this clue so tantalizing so goddamn cute i got another weird one for you this guy he left a message written in his own blood rom do in caps whats the words rom do mean to you tommy anything i spent thirteen hours in the library the other day just going through books on crime and espionage looking for something i asked the big smart guys at quantico in the behavioral science department you know our intellectuals they came up with nothing any idea rom do could be anything man then he laughed funny it reminds me of something okay said nick so sing tell me oh its crazy crazier the better my friend thats where im at you know i was on the island in sixtyone bahia de cochinos huh my friend the bay with the piggies yeah so its said okay my battalion was first ashore at red beach you know near playa larga okay we used army call signs just like the american army because we believed in america and we believed in that cocksucker jfk man we loved him and we loved our little invasion the bitterness spurted out and clouded his words then he caught himself anyway later they changed it okay they changed it and made it more jet age the d i mean what are you talking about the d became delta d for delta not dog no more but delta you went on the radio and your call sign was a d you were delta delta company delta flight delta squadron delta force that sort of thing but in the early sixties they hadnt changed d was dog r was romeo it was call signs and i was in second battalion brigade la brigada and we were romeo dog two there was a romeo dog three four and five the guy running the show the patron out there on the ship he was romeo dog six rom do your guys hurrying on that floor his mind aint working right hes dying hes sending you a message from the past romeo dog get it romeo dog no i dont get it nick said turning the info over in his head what the hell was romeo dog howdy duty hadnt changed he was one of those men who couldnt change but then nick hadnt changed either nick would never change hed always be a special agent and never a supervisory agent maybe he didnt really mind that because in his own heart he knew he wasnt cut out to give orders and he wasnt interested in power and a fine home in the virginia suburbs of washington but having the nopromotion tag on his record would at least keep him off of the really interesting squads and out of washington forever hed never get antiterrorist which was the crème de la crème in the eighties and probably would be well into the nineties it was fastreacting jungle gym stuff guns and swat tactics and interfacing with some extremely interesting other agencies the fastest league of all hed never get a hostage rescue team now those boys were the elite hrts kicked down doors and smoked bad guys when it came the time to walk the walk and hed never get organized crime either and that was hot stuff sinking through the membrane of the mafia entering that twisted yet fascinating world if you got that you were doing something it was true of counterespionage too only the hard part of that was simply following cubans around washington and wiretapping embassies but also interesting no nick would stay forever in outoftheway bcity offices baltimore or richmond or frederick were as close as hed come to washington and though less than a hundred miles each way from the big town they were still universes away and the leap from one to another without a validating stop in new york or miami or la where nick would never go either was a quantum leapimpossible by the physics of bureau culture yet for all of that he did not hate howdy duty utey had simply faced the hard decision of sorting out the tulsa incident so that it would do the bureau the most good and if he identified himself and his own career as the bureau in some way it wasnt a selfish decision so much as a helpless one that was how it went that was how he thought and so when nick picked howard d utey up at the new orleans airport it wasnt a particularly tense or awkward thing they both understood howard stood on the curb outside the american terminal and waved when he saw nick in the gray government ford he even had a little smile as he ducked to come in tossing his bag in the backseat hi nick boy youre looking great still keeping that hair huh thats right howard it just wont fall out i dont know why nick i was sorry to hear about myra was she in any pain at the end no shed been in a coma for a long time she just stopped breathing it wasnt hard end she had a hard life but she had an easy end well thank god for small and tender mercies i know howard said nick dully concentrating on not calling him howdy though it occasionally happened and utey who knew his nickname well always pretended not to notice howdy duty was quite a small man actually small and ferrety but not stupid or slow he had simply given himself totally to the bureau and had set about to rise with the patience and the fury of a poor boy he managed it with certain political gifts to be sure but also by working as hard as it was possible to work they still call me howdy duty nick im afraid they do howard said nick as they drove in from the airport well thats all right as long as its behind my back and as long as i never hear that its gotten to secret service nick that i would have to regard as an act of treachery not to me personally but to the bureau as a whole you know everybody here likes you nick everybody everywhere likes you thats one of your gifts and itd do everybody a lot of good if youd pass that information around i know that informally passed information is sometimes more efficiently communicated than office memos fair enough yes howard said nick that was howard he established the rules and played by them unless it suited his purposes to change them now nick a lot of what well be doing in the next few weeks is liaison which again is why its great to have you on the team you have a wonderful gift for getting along with people dont think it hasnt been noticed and youll need all your affability all right all of it every bit sure howard so whatm i going to be doing i heard the pres thats right nick on march first the president will be flying down from washington in the morning for a speech and presentation in downtown new orleans hes going to be giving archbishop jorge roberto lopez the freedom medal you know the archbishop of salvador who won the nobel peace prize nick knew of course archbishop roberto lopez was a validated great man the heir to the martyred archbishop oscar romero he had worked tirelessly at getting the two sides in that bitter war exacerbated so terribly of late by the panther battalion massacre to talk nick remembered the news footage bishop roberto lopez walking among the dead children by the riverbank in his humble black cloth with a humble silver cross about his neck his eyes wracked with tears behind the wireframe glasses a poet an expert on medieval latin alchemy a complete apolitical who had the love in his heart to tell nbc i do not hate the men who did this i love them and i forgive them to hate them and to demand their punishment is to guarantee that such horror will be perpetuated the presidents popularity has slipped a bit since the war nick i think he wants to get on the bishop roberto lopez bandwagon it certainly wont do him any harm maybe he just admires the guy said nick a lot of people do anyway i know youre not aware of this down here you know he meant nick knew at your level but recently relations between the bureau and the secret service have not been very friendly in chicago three months ago we ran into a problem of intersecting investigations counterfeit money drew treasury in and we were working it from an organized crime standpoint and somehow we never knew the other was there an arrest sequence got confused and one of our people shot one of theirs didnt kill him and they say hell probably be on his feet in six months or so but it left bad feelings nick shook his head it sure as hell must have no one really liked working with the secret service particularly on security details where the guys in the sunglasses were absolute pricks and by informal fiat took command of any situation feelings always were rubbed raw no tenyear bureau man liked being told what to do by a twentythreeyearold boy in shades with an earpiece a lapel pin and an uzi in a briefcase and yet thats the way it always happened its the same drill nick you know it secret service will provide the manpower and the closeup security theyll run their own security investigations but were there to back them up to run interference with the locals with them and to handle any investigative work that wont fit into their time frames to be their gofers nick thought bleakly now the director is adamant howdy continued weve got some fencemending to do and thats our job fencemending you and i nick we are the fence menders through you ill be turning over the resources of our new orleans office to secret service in turn were to be granted a bit of security authority ourselves and indeed well be part of the operation on the day flashlight arrives its a good chance nick its something i thought youd enjoy and if it goes well ill certainly mention you prominently in the reports youll have a great deal of latitude too the freedom to do what best you can do who knows things can change this might just get you out of your rut sure howard i appreciate the chance but nick knew howard would be on him like a cheap cologne that was howards way that was the bureaus way it had happened in tulsa it was happening now so nick youve got a clean desk youre ready to swing away hap fencl said youd come to me with nothing hanging over you is that right more or less ive got this one little thing going a murder that was probably facilitated by some hightech military equipment you know its funny the guy was also salva dont we turn here they had just sailed by a sign that pointed to downtown off a lefthand turn huh im staying at the hilton werent we supposed to turn here oh uh no howard not that way thatd get you there but this time of day its faster to stay on sixtyone then cut over to ninety see oh all right its your town but i would have turned there howdy duty said he didnt mean to sound displeased nick thought but he did anyway chapter ten in each of the four cities he presented the same phenomenon a tall lanky man in boots and a blue denim shirt pressed and buttoned to the top he wore a downfilled field coat suede tony lamas and his black wide stetson but in baltimore he felt out of place with the hat and left it in his room in each city he checked into a middlerange downtown hotel after taking a cab in from the airport he ate modestly and never drank and when he wasnt in his room studying his maps he discreetly toured the shooting sites taking notes walking off the distances watching the fall of the light and the way the shadow angles changed as the sun moved across the sky feeling the temperature the push of the prevailing winds looking at the traffic patterns in and out at the theaters or stages where the president would be speaking when the shot was to be fired he walked endlessly around the buildings into their lobbies but he never pressed his luck and made no attempt to get into places where he was not permitted his only eccentricity most people mistook for an elaborate camera in fact it was a barr stroud prismatic optical rangefinder with two lenses eighty centimeters apart it enabled him to measure distances with unerring accuracy in each city he learned things no map or guidebook could tell him he discovered small discrepancies in the elevation grids of the cincinnati hills not much but just enough to throw a shooter off hed be higher than he thought he was and his bullets trajectory therefore more subject to the pull of gravity in baltimore he noted the persistence of wind off the harbor hed never associated baltimore with wind at all and the information irritated him the guidebooks never said a damned thing about it but the gulls hanging like helicopter gunships over a burning village told the story he imagined a bullet riding those winds drifting this way and that in their grasp perhaps true to its aim perhaps not in washington he saw the trees the shot indicated in the picture of the soviet shooting mockup would have to pass through trees admittedly this time of year the visibility was fairly good but bob thought the problem was a bulletdeflecting sprig of limb it would be like firing through a labyrinth and even the smallest of obstructions could send a heavycaliber bullet moving at close to three thousand feet per second spinning off in the craziest ways then too in washington the shooting platforms were exceedingly iffy justice was closest but the angle into the back lawn of the white house was extreme and if he were shooting from there about yards t solaratov would have a quarter profile as a target always the hardest angle into major body structures a devilishly hard shot though bob had dropped a few that way almost a full mile out from the department of agriculture the sniper would have a much wider target and presumably a much stabler one as bodies dont move laterally during speeches nearly so much as they moved up and back stillshooting through trees a mile out from atop a government building this said nothing of the extraordinary deception operation that would have to be mounted to get him in and out seemed the longest of long shots purely from a technical point of view new orleans was a southern city which he appreciated the air was balmy the breezes mild of all the cities he liked it the best and quickly found that only a sliver of it was the fabled block or so of bourbon street where all the movies were filmed the place itself had a sleepy nondescript way to it and the black people still carried themselves with that elegant dignity that is only possible in the true south but the problem with new orleans was the air which was heavy with the tang of salt water and the acrid dense musk that miles of mushy swamp produced it was almost a jungle climate and though it could be shot through with accuracy bob had done it after all it produced the sort of accuracy warpage that would have to be planned for and practiced in this was most interesting if they were going to go for a caliber shot a mile out in new orleans it occurred to bob that theyd almost have to build themselves a mile of range here because each swampy ecosystem has its own peculiar climate depending on the density of the salt water the gassiness of the swamp the prevailing winds you couldnt prep a new orleans shot in iraq or even russia except in its most inconsequential aspects youd have to do it over a period of days in a period of weather conditions to see what hob the moisture would play on the bullet might be interesting to check out he thought his travels finished after ten long days on the road bob flew back to arkansas and returned to his trailer again it was as he left it unentered again mikes slobbery love greeted him and he took some time to work with the dog to pet him and make him feel wanted to rub those velvety ears you didnt want to spoil a creature with too much attention but mike had such need it moved bob it was the longest time hed ever been away from the dog the dumb love poured up to him from the eyes and the hot breath its paws were flung upon him as mike went nuts in bliss hey boy your old mans back he said again surprising himself with a kind of laugh truth was he felt pretty damned good hed been in the world tested himself against it and come back in one piece not destroyed the work was fascinating and what hed found pleased him he was eager to get on with the next bit he went to the icebox found some chili frozen in a square like a brick and set it to warming on the stove then he showered quickly changed into clean jeans and shirt and boots then he took mike for a good fourmile walk by the time he was back the stuff was hot and red as he liked it he ate it quickly and economically with large glasses of iced tea only momentarily missing the beer that had once been his chief sensual pleasure with hot food then though tired he felt nourished he went over to a typewriter that had been in the family since his grandfather was sheriff of polk county back in the twenties and began very slowly and carefully to write bob always surprised people with his literacy they expected an exmarine gunnery sergeant from arkansas to be a complete fool when it came to letters not knowing say capitals from small letters or what a paragraph was about or the difference between a period and a colon or the meaning of that great puzzler the apostrophe but he knew all that more he knew he had a small quiet gift for expressing himself clearly and it always pleased him to do so and he did so now he wrote a twentytwopage document explaining his analysis of the four shooting sites and his prediction of t solaratovs preferences he knew of course where hed shoot from himself it scared him a little because he saw how easy it would be how in spite of all the advances since how despite the extent to which everyone had entered the era of maximum paranoia and security it was still nearly impossible to stop a man with a rifle and the will and the skill to use it it was not an eloquent document but it was direct after the military fashion it is my feeling that the subject will most likely attempt his shooting of the president on march of this year at louis armstrong park in new orleans he will be shooting a grain coppersheathed caliber round from approximately yards out the bullet will be traveling when it strikes the president at over feet per second and that should with the bullet weight defeat any body armor the president is wearing the time of the shooting will almost certainly be near the end of the presidents speech which is scheduled to begin at and last minutes there are three reasons for this first a shadow falls across the podium of the shooting site between am and pm on that day give or take a few minutes and the president will be deepest into it at the end of his speech which will mean that the glare from the contrast between the light and the dark will be at its minimum during the time of his exposure this would not be a factor under normal ranges but the extreme distance of the shot will make even the most incidental considerations important second midday is by weather bureau records the calmest time of day the prevailing winds tend to be at their gustiest during the morning hours the russian will almost certainly know this if hes studied carefully in fact of the four shooting sites only new orleans puts the president in the zone of exposure during the calmest part of the day with cincinnati a distant second and finally the new orleans site offers at least three escape routes if he shoots from the steeple of st louis cathedral in the french quarter which is located yards from the site of the speech and he uses some kind of external by that i mean nonballistic noise suppression system he can very easily retreat down the closed stairway step into the crowds on the square and melt away it is unlikely that discovery of the site would be made for several minutes perhaps hours because the site is so far from the bullet strike from the church he could very quickly walk to the mississippi which is less than half a mile away and flee by boat down into the bayou system and it would be almost impossible to locate him in there he could also depart down decatur a major thoroughfare unlikely to be burdened by heavy traffic at that time of day or finally in desperate straits he could be picked up by helicopter in the open space of jackson square just in front of the church then bob made his recommendations secret service should be informed at earliest possible date of the soviet attempt and brought in on our side but they have to be made to understand that the point of the operation is not only to safeguard the presidents life but to apprehend and interrogate the sovietiraqi shooting team and its support units radio networks should be authorized and interjurisdictional limits set so that ss knows exactly its responsibilities and this agency knows what it can do too monitoring of st louis cathedral in new orleans should begin immediately almost surely the shooting team will begin to modify and adapt it prior to march at the same time surveillance should be extremely discreet so as not to scare away the bird as enemy investigation of the site will almost certainly be thorough it is further recommended that no direct observational devices or planted listening devices be employed they would be onto those in a second a very good way might be to observe from above fjs at feet orbiting in circle with infrared cameras for heat signatures in the way the air force did in vietnam when it was interdicting the ho chi minh trail an aerial search of greater new orleans bayou and swamp area should be commenced immediately in order to locate the site of russian preparation in order to adjust to climatic conditions in late winter early spring the shooting team will almost certainly hold several live fire runthroughs under circumstances as exact as possible so that solaratov knows exactly what to expect as to load performance and so forth the president should of course be warned but if he is as courageous as he proved to be in the war against iraq he will insist upon taking part in the exercise to lure the shooting team onward rather than using a double or canceling the event his earliest participation is necessary on day of event counter sniper teams should be stationed concentrically from the presidents speaking position as indicated on map these positions are located roughly yards out and are oriented away from rather than toward the president each unit should be equipped with one remington modela rifle with unertl scope and carry duty load of m match accuracy lake city arsenal mm nato cartridges in order to engage the sovietiraqi team in the event of actual shooting i would like to lead one of these units and i prefer to locate myself at the starred site on the map on the day of the event if necessary and given the proper command authority i can take out the soviet iraqi team before any harm is done ill shoot the shooter through center mass and the spotter if there is one in the left body quadrant a quick reactive team can almost certainly get to him before he comes out of shock and begins selfdestruction procedures he should be an interesting intelligence source debriefing of captured soviet andor personnel should begin immediately so that we may act on their intelligence immediately in vietnam interrogation information was sometimes squandered when we reacted too slowly he stopped typing that was it what else was there well of course there was one other thing and it was the thing that no man could plan for luck one only prayed for it and maybe it would be there and maybe it wouldnt he looked at his watch time to sleep tomorrow hed send the report to the people he now believed represented the central intelligence agency he stripped and crawled into bed mike bounded up too for the big soft stupid dog liked to touch him ever so slightly through the covers in sleep but at four he awakened and went back and read the document over it seemed good he couldnt sleep however he knew it was absurd but he felt he was being watched or something he sat back and tried to work out his feelings about his new employers he didnt trust them but they were all he had and then he thought i need an edge i need a way to keep these boys from turning on me if things go wrong he tried to think of what that might be but he couldnt come up with a thing chapter eleven it was humiliating nick had become a complete and total gofer a clerk a fool he bustled through the corridors with files and coffee and doughnuts like hazel the maid howdy duty hardly let him talk to the secret service people at all leaving that delicate task to himself nick had been appointed head eunuch hey memphis your slip is showing his expartner mickey sontag yelled out as nick raced from the file room to a former storage room now bearing the important title on the door joint secret servicebureau meeting group where the federal bodyguards and the sanctimonious utey had set up shop yeah yeah said nick helplessly knowing he was running late pissed as hell that ginny feany mistress of the files had not found the dope on one clark clarkson white knight of the lafayette parish ku klux klan quite fast enough boy they running you ragged old saint nick nick was thirtyfour this old shit had to stop but yeah yeah was all he could think to say in the meeting the senior secret service guy phil mueller was sounding off as usual like general patton for a squad of his own troops and for howdy as well and this is the last of them he says it is answered utey for nick before nick could answer for himself even the inactives the discontinueds the imprisoned and the dead ones all of them phil so with your files with our information and with the stuff from the national crime index we got what total maybe two hundred fifty names triaged into three categories alphas betas and charlies for bad risk possible risk and shouldbecheckedout hows the numbers on it you getting through the alphas uh phil said one of the secret service joes were working them pretty hard ive got three teams on them thats six guys for fiftysix of them ive got a beta team and weve got a hundred twentyfour betas the rest charlies hows it shaping up timewise i think well make the alphas no sweat if we bring some of our other people in i think well make most of the betas too we get a break or two but its those damn charlies that have us worried i just dont think manpowerwise were going to get very far into them um said mueller a thought phil said howdy duty yes howard maybe nick could work the charlies most of its phone no checking up hmmm said mueller hed be more than willing right nick nick just sat there stewing great what these guys were doing what they always did prior to a visit by the man was developing in coordination with local law enforcement and cooperating federal agencies a regional list of known wackos screwballs right and leftwing dingbats survivalists and others fitting the potential risk profile these people were then investigated by teams to determine location and current situation if some signal of instability was detected by the officers then surveillance was sometimes mandated more frequently the guys were simply rousted savagely detained had the shit scared out of them then sent on their way it was painstaking boring work absolutely the dullest but it was secret service policy to know where all the nuts were stored before the man got into gun range but the bomb nick began can wait snapped mueller you get digging into the charlies okay memphis hell do it assured utey nick you wont mind putting in the extra time will you so what do you say well the good bureau man doesnt say anything he doesnt let anything show he just nods and knuckles under and gets behind the team and thats what nick committed himself to doing biting down his anger that hed missed a shot at the secret service bomb detail now those guys were pros hed wanted to see them work they were so legendary they did site preparation and when they were done working an area over you knew it was sanitized that the dogs had sniffed no explosives or wires that the spectrometers had uncovered no unusual radio waves for command detonations that no snipers nests or shooting platforms had been uncovered and it was outdoor work it was doing something it was getting back into the field away from all this political nonsense and being just a clerkjerk and the truth was what nick hated most of all of it was sitting in the office he knew he wasnt thorough enough that he tended to make small mistakes he cursed silently as his fate overtook him but he kept his face flat and mild when it was over herm sloane who wasnt too bad a guy slid by and said too bad nick know you wanted to slip out tomorrow were just bogged down no problem said nick trying for cheer which was his usual way of dealing with adversity i dont know whos worse sloane added conspiratorially my guy assholing it all over the place or your guy sucking it up all over the place its pretty fucking pathetic nick said you got those charlies for me fraid so old pal sloane handed over the stack of files that he had triaged into the charlie category nick looked at them sadly it was hours and hours of work he knew his investigation on the death of eduardo lanzman was falling apart it wasnt happening because he couldnt get to it the names were prosaic pitiful and as he glanced through the files he saw the usual litany of failure and hatred the usual roundup the usual suspects little men with large grudges and imprecise grips on reality who were only to be reckoned with because they had or could get guns and then nick saw the name of his hero bob lee swagger bob the nailer he thought jesus christ in three fourteenhour days nick managed to eliminate fiftysix of his seventy charlies it was exhausting work sitting there phoning this office or that tracking down that parole officer or this one going through phone books and the state prison records division talking to cops and lawyers and the various parish morgues of the fiftysix more than half twentynine had simply died since for whatever reason they had been placed on the secret service active suspect list nick suspected therefore that the list was very old so many old men another sixteen were serving jail time five were currently in mental institutions these were the real crazos whose difficulty in dealing with authority over the long term had finally gotten them classified pathological and who were now rusticating in some picturesque bayou bin six more had vanished left the city or the state simply disappeared off the face of the earth they were now happily somebody elses worry that left fourteen to be accounted for tracked located what have you it was not easy work but he went at it with a great deal of effort and it left bob the nailer nick had first heard of the great marine sniper sometime in the early eighties in an article in one of those soldier of fortunetype magazines that he used to read at the time he remembered the cover photo of the lean young man in the camouflage paint and the intense eyes and the beautiful remington rifle he was carrying and the cover line the most dangerous man alive the stories were incredible whatever the guy shot died bob the nailer had eightyseven confirmed kills in vietnam he did some jobs for the agency it was said and his masterpiece hed hit a north vietnamese battalion moving on an isolated green beret camp and held it down for two days killing thirtyodd men in the process saving the special forces bacon that was when nick himself was trying to be the great shooter back in his asskicking swat days before myra and tulsa thinking back now it all seemed so clear and innocent you were a trained man you went against bad guys and because you were so good they got nailed that was when hed sold his soul to the rifle when he was however briefly an acolyte in the cult of the sniper he shivered a bit at the vanity of it remembering what his pride had turned into in tulsa still all these years later he had a place in him full of respect for bob bob had never wavered had let nothing stand between himself and what he wanted to be and bob had tested himself in the crucible of the actual while nick had only tried once and failed spectacularly his bullet had gone exactly where he had not wanted it to so it was with a sense of facing his old self and his old beliefs and the mistakes of his own youth that he set about to track down bob the nailer and like many memories this one proved easy enough to unearth bob was not hard to find that is the traces of bob hed checked into the robert oliver hotel in the french quarter on february and checked out on february two days nobody much remembered him the only vague reports nick could scare up told of a tall westernstyled man very leathery who said nothing kept to himself was gone all day and left without fuss had a funny camera with him some expensive jap thing probably business of some sort nick thought hed heard that swagger hadnt been able to stay in the marines because of his injuries probably today he was some kind of traveling salesman or something or an arkansas farmer into the big city for the hell of it a wild few days or something take some pictures like any tourist and go on back to the south forty but it occurred to nick to ask a more fundamental question why was the guy on the suspects list at all who put him there what gets you there he ran swagger through the fbi computer and learned he had no record at least no felonies listed anywhere he checked him against the national crime index and again came up with nothing calling the department of the navy he learned that bob had retired at the rank of gunnery sergeant with physical disability pay after twelve years active service and close to three years in the hospital undergoing joint reconstruction and extensive physical therapy and had no blemishes on his record he checked with the veterans administration and found out that bob had never sought or received any kind of psychological testing or counseling or anything like that there seemed to be nothing on him at all now why the hell had he ended up on this list and who was tracking him enough to note that he was here in new orleans he called herm sloane hey herm nick were really pressed for time up here what is it i just have one question these charlies where do you get them how does a guy get on the charlie list well the alphas are usually developed from intelligence usually from the bureau investigations of dangerous groups from other justice department or dea sources and our own intelligence unit um the betas are usually guys with minor criminal records guys whove made lots of public threats who have an authority complex and tend to attract attention and your charlies are letter writers we keep all the threatening letters the president gets or threateningseeming letters why oh theres a charlie here that surprised me listen call tom marbella at treasury in dc he collates the letter files hell let you know whats what some minutes later nick managed to track down marbella and marbella said hed check it out let him know and some time after that it was the next day actually marbella called back okay ive got the file up on my computer terminal now your boy seems to think he should have won the congressional medal of honor said marbella hmm said nick a noise he made when he wanted to indicate he was on the phone still but that he had no attitude or information to convey three weeks ago he writes a letter to the president explaining that the marine corps screwed him out of the congressional medal of honor that was his by rights just like his dads and that he now wanted his medal and would the president please send it on and that gets him on a secret service list hey after sixtythree anything gets you on a secret service list friend we take no chances we win no friends but we take no chances is there anything threatening in the letter uh well our staff psychiatrist says so its not an explicit threat so much as a tone listen to this sir i only request that the nation give me that which is my due as i served my country well in the jungles its quite important to me that i get this medal exclamation point it is mine exclamation point i earned it exclamation point theres no two ways about it sir that medal is mine exclamation point nick shook his head like so many others the great bob the nailer the warrior champion of vietnam the master sniper had yielded to vanity too it was no longer enough merely to have done the impossible on a routine basis and to know that you and you alone were of the elect no in his surrender bob like so many others wanted celebrity attention validation more more for me i want more and i want it now its my turn thats what nick ran into all the time on the streets somehow in america it had stopped being about us or we or the team or the family it was this mething that turned people crazy they expected so much they thought they were so important everybody was an only child but it seemed so unboblike somehow it sounds pretty harmless to me nick said its the exclamation points four of em our reading is that exclamation points indicate a tendency toward violence not an inclination but a tendency a capacity to let go thats the theory at any rate though the truth is weve found that letter writers almost never go to guns they just dont for most of them writing the letter is the thing that satisfies them they sit back and everything is nice still this guy is supposedly a hell of a shot or was at one time he used four exclamation points and we do have it on record that he did go to new orleans yeah ive confirmed that and so we put him on the charlie list check him out see if he deserves an upgrade to beta thats what im doing i know the charlie list is shit memphis nobody likes to do the charlie list usually the guys just out of training end up doing charlies you sound um a little old for charlies look i do what my boss says thats all we appreciate it glad to have the bureaus help how did you know he was in new orleans huh you said and he was in new orleans how did you know that uh said marbella it says so right here in his file but where did that information come from i mean a snitch another agency a cop shop the pentagon the va hey it doesnt say you know this stuff comes in from all over some of it pretty raw whats the big deal is somebody watching swagger shit man im the last guy to know and it doesnt say a thing here its just raw data memphis some of its accurate some of it isnt its up to you to check it out okay bud yeah sure hey thanks a lot nick said he hung up what should i do i should do something he called directory information for the state of arkansas learned quickly that bob lee swagger had no listed or unlisted phone number he called the arkansas state police and found that bob lee swagger was not under investigation or indictment of any sort but from that he learned bobs address which was simply rural route blue eye finally he called vernon tell who was the sheriff of polk county arkansas and after giving the fbi identification code quickly got to the sheriff himself bob lee bob lee just lives up the mountain by himself thats all any problems with him no sir not the most sociable fellow in the world no sir bob lee keeps to himself and dont like people picking at him but hes a good man he done his country proud in the war and his daddy done his country proud and earls daddy lucas was actually the sheriff back in the twenties theyre all old polk county folks and wouldnt hurt nobody didnt hurt them first but it bothered nick that bob lived alone away from society with a lot of guns the profile of the loner gunman had proved out too many times to be coincidental any drinking or substance abuse problems mr memphis believe me it would be a lie if i didnt tell you some years back bob lee had a problem with the bottle and had some wild times hes always in pain you know because of the way he was hurt in the war but i believe bob lee has found himself in some way all he wants from life is freedom and to be left alone what about medals has he ever said anything about medals are medals important to him to bob lee let me tell you something son were you in the war or anything no sir i wasnt well son the only people that are interested in medals are the ones that are fixing to run for office some day i went from one side of burma to the other with general merrills marauders in and and the only man i ever saw who wanted a medal or cared about a medal later became the only governor of colorado to be impeached no son bob lee swagger dont give two damns and a jar of cold piss about medals ive been out to his place a time or so and youd be hard pressed to find an indication anywhere that this man was one of the bravest heroes our country ever produced somehow that pleased nick and that night when herm dropped by he said nick you got any charlies to butt on up to beta or alpha classification nick answered yes and he had three names men who seemed dangerous but whom he had not been able to turn up bob lee swagger was not on the list at last he was out of the office sitting in a swamp as a matter of fact but at least indisputably out of the office he sat in the back of a secret service van with herm sloane and his partner jeff till as till the expert fumbled and cursed at a control console the van was all dressed up with electronic gear not a goddamn thing said till are you sure its reading said sloane im not sure of a goddamn thing said till a little neurotically all the lights are red were on the right directional beam but believe me i am getting absolutely nothing but hum and static its making me crazy nick let the two chums take turns cursing the equipment that flickered wanly in front of them outside there was nothing but bayou and hanging cypress and the swish and rustle of swamp water and small mean creatures squishing through the mud somewhere three hundred yards ahead at least in theory there was a farmhouse that doubled as the headquarters of the white beacon of racial purity a rabidly antiblack group said to be floating around the fringes of the new orleans loonies culture these were fatbellied white guys with tattoos and ruger minis their favorite piece far to the right of the klan good old mean old boys whod dropped out of the klan because it was too dang soft that is if they existed nick was privately of the opinion that it was a policemans fantasy or rather an easy out any inconvenient crime could be blamed on the white beacon and thereby consigned to the unsolved files without much in the way of an investment in time or energy he had once spent a week trying to get a fix on them concluding that there was nothing but vapors of hate and rumors feeding on rumors but on a tip that sloane had gotten from a detective in the new orleans gang intelligence division he and his partner and as local representative the reluctant nick memphis had come out well past midnight in the services electronic monitoring vehicle in order to penetrate the farmhouse no warrant was necessary if the penetration was done via parabolic microphone and see what the white beacon boys were up to if there were white beacon boys and if this was the farmhouse where they were meeting nick knew at least three sly old cajun detectives whod drink themselves goofy in merry recollection of having sent three northern federal whiteboys out into the swamps for a night listening to the cicadas but he said nothing it cant be a goddamn overlapping signature said till its just junk equipment it isnt even digital for christs sake maybe the beam isnt getting through the trees said sloane maybe its the goddamn junk equipment said till again but nick felt as if he was in the space cruiser enterprise it was so hightech whats wrong with the equipment he asked man if we have a big bust we have to requisition our ev from miami we been trying to get an upgrade for years said till this piece of shit always goes into a zone two weeks before the man does but it was built in the sixties and its so far from being state of the art it cant even pick up hbo its a piece of shit you need an electrotek nick said innocently jesus yeah said till sure but i dont have a million bucks lying around to spend on listening in on people hell all im trying to do is protect the life of the president of the united states thats all howd you ever hear of an electrotek that goddamn things top secret guy told me said there were seven in the world no they built five or six more yeah wouldnt it be sweet if we had one man we wouldnt have to go to this fucking swamp we could go to the parking lot and tune in its the agency and dea that have them right and certain overseas clients with very high and tight connections i heard some guys got them in salvador wouldnt surprise me no death squad would be complete without them meanwhile guys like us who are trying to work for a living we get a piece of sixties shit like this man i think im getting country joe and the fish on these earphones nick shut up for a while then as till jimmied and dicked with the equipment i got something he finally said tape rolling tape rolling fine ah let me see if i can amplify it and bring it out nick heard a babble of voices chattering over the loudspeakers you know dem boys dey be you know um dey be hawmping in de woods fer ole gata lemme tell you um dey be hawmping da swamps shoooooeee boy wif dem like lights you know you know what im saying lights like and when dem boys git in reals close wham wham you know i hate to tell you nick said but i dont think those are the beacons not unless they started an equal opportunity program shit said sloane man what are they talking about said till in wonderment gator hunting i think these old backwoods blacks they go out late at night and attract gators with light then bop em over the head with ax handles highly illegal but they eat the meat and sell the skins and teeth poaching its poaching you guys want to bust em for conspiracy to poach its three to five and its federal shit said sloane again i know that guy said it was thirty miles out parish fivefortyseven then left at the dirt road for thirteen miles i think he was chain pulling said nick these old louisiana cops you know they love their pranks im going to report his ass said sloane hotly no dont do that see hes got you you cant prove it was anything but real and if you make a fuss youre the one that looks like the ungrateful ass listen my first year in gumboland i spent half my nights on wildgoose chases this is what passes for sport down here those guys are sitting in the back room at the alligator club right now laughing themselves sick i guarantee you but you did your job right thats the main thing christ memphis youre a walking testimonial to the human power to forgive its so much easier than being a hard guy especially in their town now i get along with them pretty well because i paid my dues and never complained ah lets get out of here said till just think till how silly youd feel if youd been parked out here in a milliondollar electrotek all dressed up and no place to go both the secret service agents laughed and then till said no way im getting hold of an electrotek unless i go to work for ramdyne which i just might do nick said ramdyne you never heard of ramdyne no its fed heaven you fuck up bad or you get fucked bad but youre good you know really good maybe ramdyne gives you a call one night then you are on easy street and you get to do all the stuff the cia used to do interesting stuff ah said sloane it doesnt even exist i hear guys talking about it now and then but i dont know a single guy whos ever gotten that kind of nod but its nice to think of the money isnt it said till dreamily chapter twelve bob came over the rise and looked down the wet tarmac to see the trailer a mile ahead and the car parked next to it he drew his parka tighter the wind pushed into and through it next to him mike poised taut his sloppy jowls tightening a curl of angry low sound slithering out of his throat easy boy said bob trying to rub some softness into the animals tension he stroked the hard neck and the velvety ears and after a second or so mike broke contact with the strangers at the trailer and cocked his head looking at bob puzzlement showing in the deep lakes of his eyes there guy bob said in a low mutter its all right theyre friends though a sardonic tone crept into the last word he had wondered when theyd be in touch it was a sleety day the weather had rushed over the ouachitas low clouds rolled angrily by pellets of ice fell diagonally cutting the skin collecting in puddles on the road while the wind sliced through the trees bob shivered not quite warm and pressed ahead the colonel sat in the car reading a newspaper payne lounged on the fender howdy payne hi ya bob nice dog dogs arent nice payne theyre either good or theyre bad meaning either they stick or they cut mike sticks payne just looked at him something like a smirk on his dark blunt features bob felt the hostility but it didnt particularly bother him payne didnt worry bob a bit hows the mouth my old man hit me harder he didnt give me no warning either payne smiled showing new dentures all right said the colonel stepping out of the car payne immediately stepped back get inside payne wait for me yes sir said payne sliding obediently into the car hello swagger how are you fine said bob nice dog said the colonel he sure is some kind of beagle beagle and something well anyway can we talk sure bob unlocked the gate and mike ran to his hut like the obedient creature he was bob took the colonel inside they sat down at bobs table and the man pulled out a wellthumbed copy of bobs report i dont mind telling you this is an excellent piece of work bob nodded you might be interested in knowing that independently we came to many of the same conclusions weve also had some further information on solaratov we think we have a very solid sighting outside of huarte city in cuba now why would that be significant the reason is that its a swampy region whose weather and proximity to the sea and humidity tendencies almost exactly match new orleanss so they may be prepping the shot down there rather than as you guessed trying to put together a range up here i see but we agree that almost certainly theyre going to go for him in new orleans bob just nodded then he said so are you going to let me be on the rifle that day the colonel looked him in the eye bob respected a man who gave you the bad news straight up no bullshit no fake sorry no no way forget about it bob said nothing higher people have decided he has to be taken alive discreetly and debriefed hes a treasure chest of information its more than personalities its politics and policies its duty bob nodded i know you want a crack at him we all do but we have to be professional we have to see him as an asset its not about justice or anything its about doing whats necessary this johnny isnt going to be so easy to nab clean well let the fbi and the secret service worry about that theyre pros so im out that what youre saying youve done your part we needed you and now that time has passed bob grunted it was sort of like vietnam thank you and fuck you therell be a check the money isnt necessary it was an honor its not a lot we didnt want to insult you its a months pay at gunnery sergeant rate fine much appreciated swagger when i walk out this door that has to be it it has to be left alone do you understand yes sir ive taken a chance a big chance telling you this much youve learned things no private citizen has ever learned we have to be able to trust you sure said bob swagger if you show up in that area with a rifle if you do something stupid to get at this solaratov you could blow the whole thing you could get yourself killed you could mess up our whole operation you could let this bastard get away we expect your discipline your best help yes sir and that means just sitting tight do you understand can you be professional ive always been a professional sir there was another curious pause in the conversation the colonel looked away clearly troubled bob just stared at him conscious of the slow tick of time the settling of atoms in the room he needed a drink first time in years he had the extraordinary urge to open a bottle of tennessee drinking whiskey and float away on its torrents to drift and bob and see where he ended up next morning or next week or whatever in whose bed in what prison shit but i dont what what secrets can this guy have hes a shooter thats all hes going to kill a great president let me be there and i can nab him with a hollowpoint thats the nabbing he deserves the colonel looked off im going to tell you why we have to take him alive im going to tell you why its absolutely imperative that we take him alive it may turn out that you werent the first american he shot and that donny wasnt the second he had an earlier tour in nam he had an earlier tour all right but it wasnt in nam we have a very good authenticated sighting of him in mexico city swagger its on film mexico city november eighteenth our people trailed him they lost him at the airport there were three flights from mexico city on november eighteenth to dallas texas the colonel held him in his eyes for a long time weve been working on this a long long time swagger we want this boy we want him so bad hes an old dog and we want him because then we can find the answers to some very interesting questions i understand said bob i was out of line i apologize all right said the colonel for the record my name is raymond davis im a senior plans officer in the central intelligence agency as you have no doubt guessed this operation is codenamed ginger dragon and it involves over three hundred men do you understand that everything ive told you is absolutely top secret yes sir well need seasoned spotters swagger men on scopes who can find solaratov for us so that we can take him nobodys better on a scope than you i suppose thats true no rifles just give us your eyes and your brains be on our team no solo work you just work with us to take this guy pay him back for donny fenn that way pay him back for all of us thats how you nail him bob can you nail him like that ill nail him said bob he had another of his bad sleepless nights and woke up swaddled in drenched sheets his hip aflame the image of the light gone from donnys blank eyes forever strobing in his mind goddamn him he thought thinking of the man hunting him as he had hunted so many others he felt greedy for vengeance and he knew it could make him stupid and sloppy and he wished again he had a way to protect himself not from them whoever they really were but from himself his own greed and selfindulgence and then an idea came to him it was so simple really it involved a few minutes welding a certain adjustment and at least from one angle he was protected from their use if they tried to use him in a certain way he laughed about it after he was finished it was such a little thing he reassembled the remington wiped it down with sheath to keep the moisture away and replaced it in his gun vault like to see the look on somebodys poke when they pulled the trigger on that one he slept dreamlessly chapter thirteen beneath the presidential security detail and the site preparation team at the furthest reaches of the security pyramid was that blur of extra bodies known as cooperating agencies and it was well within this blur sitting in an automobile with a cold cup of coffee a red lapel button and an attitude problem that nick memphis found himself at ninethirty in the morning on the day of the presidents speech he was one of several thousand cops fbi agents military personnel and the like who had to surrender their weekend because the president ever mindful that his popularity ratings in the latino communities so high after the war had begun to slip just a bit and so he had chosen to give the freedom medal to the salvadoran archbishop jorge roberto lopez nick was by himself which didnt please him much hed somehow expected more having kibitzed so valiantly with the secret service advance detail over the preceding three weeks been loyal and obedient as any dog doing howdy dutys bidding whenever possible and with a smile on his face but at intense moments all institutions default to turf warfare and nick was pained to discover that secret service did not want the bureau anywhere near the zone of its highest visibility and responsibility so hed been exiled to a further outpost of the empire of security worse mickey sontag his most recent partner was sick so poor nick had to spend all of game day by himself he now sat a good four blocks off the motorcade route and the site of the speech parked on st ann street in the quarter a block or two down from bourbons luridness and the crush of tourism around him were old brick residences all quaint all pastel all shuttered ahead in the far distance he could see the grotesque wroughtiron arch that signified the entrance to louis armstrong park on north rampart one reason why the white house had chosen the site access to it through that gate was so limited there were still worries left over from the persian gulf war about terrorists the sun above was bright and now and then people would stream by in hopes of getting a good early location on the presidents motorcade or a good seat for his speech idly nick listened to the security network channel on his radio unit as phil mueller held the whole thing together from a secret service communications center on the roof of the municipal auditorium which was just off the site of the speech ah this is airport we have flashlight on the ground and taxiing toward the hangar reading you airport this is base six nick recognized muellers authoritarian voice over the radio he knew that howdy duty would be standing right next to him really there more for public relations to keep the bureaus profile high than for any meaningful security reasons nick tried to generate some feeling for utey pro or con but he couldnt get himself to hate the guy even after tulsa all those years ago hate just wasnt in nick not a bit of it all teams in place we are waiting momentarily for flashlight to disembark thank you airport please confirm when flashlight is out of plane and motorcade is proceeding reading you and roger that base six uh people game time coming up i want to run a last security check make sure everybodys on station so by the numbers i want you to check in and give me a sitrep one by one the security units checked in a torrent of radiospeak and bored commanding voices crackling and soupy over the distorting radio network all of them because mueller was a stickler that was three helicopter teams over fifty men spread around on rooftops maybe seventyfive police units at various intersections on and nearby the motorcade route all the highpowered lookout posts in the immediate vicinity of the site and of course the hot dogs of the presidential security detail many of whom had come ahead and were already in position on site when it came time for nick he was on the ball ah base six this is bureau four im on station on st ann ah all activity normal ive got nothing on rooftops or any visible window activity affirmative bureau four keep your eyes open nick said mueller the touch of personal recognition pleased nick not that it meant a damned thing four out he said and went back to eyeballing whatever was around him which was not much he squirmed uncomfortably because the smith was held in the bureaus de rigueur high hip carry in a pancake holster above his right buttock and though the pistol was flat unlike a revolver it still bit into him many agents secretly kept their pistols in glove compartments when they drove around but it was nicks law to always play by every rule and so he just let the thing gnaw on him under his suitcoat as he sat there nick phased out the rest of security checkins and tried to reassemble his thoughts on the eduardo lanzman case because he wanted to really get cracking on it as soon as flashlight was out of town the report from salvador just in had been a disappointment the salvadoran national police had no lanzman on their rolls and who up here could prove different and nick also had the bureau research people trying to find something out about this ramdyne outfit hed picked up on from till and he thought that but then the message came rumbling across the net ah base four flashlight has debarked and the motorcade is about to commence all right people lets look sharp said base six game time ah base four flashlight has debarked and the motorcade is about to commence bob heard over the radio then all right people lets look sharp game time bob thats it the shows begun it was payne nearby okay bob said got you clean and simple and am all set but he wished he had a rifle and in fact felt like a simpleton without one he was a good four hundred yards from the presidents speech in the fourthfloor room of an old house on st ann but he didnt look toward the park he looked back toward and over the french quarter seated at a table he stared through a leupold spotting scope that he had carefully aimed at the church steeple still another thousand yards out it was the steeple from which hed predicted the shot would come payne and a new orleans uniformed cop named timmons were with him payne on the radio timmons just more or less there he heard the security people on their network ah base six this is alpha one we are progressing down us ten at approximately fortyfive miles per hour our eta is approximately hours do you read have you affirmative said base six units ten and twelve be advised flashlight and friends are moving through your area shortly we have it under advisement base six everything looking fine here over and out bob thought it was like a big airmobile operation in the nam an orchestration of elements all moving in perfect syncopation and held together by some command hotshot on the radio network as the various units through whose sector flashlight moved called in their reports ah base six this is ginger dragon two we have all quiet in our secure zone at present he heard payne speak into the phone thats a roger ginger dragon two were reading you our apprehension teams are on instant standby anything yet timmons now asked him he was a large dour man whose belly pressed outward against his uniform he seemed nervous bobs eye was in the scope though the target was so much farther out he could see three ramshackle arched openings under the crown of the steeple each louvered closed each dirty and untouched its the middle window payne now said calmly i know what window it is bob said why were these guys talking so much i have no movement maybe hes not there yet said timmons oh hes there its too close to time hes there if hes anywhere bob thought hes there hes sitting very still now and though we cant see him hes drawing himself together for the shot hes probably taken as close as can be constructed to this shot a thousand or so times maybe ten thousand times i know i would if i were in his shoes but hes a little nervous hell want to be alone and hell want it quiet if there are others in the room with him then theyre just sitting there not making any noise letting him accumulate his strength according to colonel davis a very skilled fbi embassy penetration team had discreetly planted lightsensitive sensors in the belfry and the sensors had recorded data to suggest that every night between four and five am a working party of five men entered the room and made preparations bob assumed they were soundproofing the walls and building a shooting platform to get the proper angle into the presidents site fourteen hundred far yards away at the precise moment three or four of the louvers would be removed hed scope and shoot and the team would replace the louvers the window of vulnerability was maybe ten seconds ginger dragon six we are beginning our apprehension maneuver keep it discreet apprehension teams bob recognized colonel davis who was running this operation the one concealed within the larger drama of the presidents arrival and security fuckin a said payne they getting ready to nab the sucker bob looked at his watch it was only hours now still an hour from the shooting event man i hope your federal team has got it together this is a very nervous cat hes got spotters himself making sure he hasnt been blown these are the very best guys payne said these guys have been training for this one a long time lots and lots of dues gonna get paid off today i can tell you its payback time something melodramatic and movielike in payne today irritated bob ginger dragon two you have the best angle on the target you have anything to announce hes talking to you swagger thats a negative but if theyre there they probably came in late last night and theyll be real quiet tell him that lack of activity is to be expected uh ginger dragon six this is dragon two uh spotter has a negative so far is he sure oh christ said bob tell him theyre there goddammit and that ill sing out when i get a visual confirm and that that will be at the point of shooting and goddammit he better get set to bounce his people in there fast now wasnt the time to begin doubting the scenario they all believed in the scenario theyd discussed it dispassionately all afternoon yesterday uh confidence here is still high dragon six said payne thats what ruined operations and thats what killed people in the field that sudden lastminute spurt of doubt like the lash of a whip it made people morons so many times bob had seen it it was exactly what sniping wasnt we may have to go early said ginger dragon six do that and you got nothing said bob hes there goddamn i can feel him oh hes there and hes on his rifle and hes just settling into it he wished he had a rifle too okay alpha team this is base six flashlights eta is now just five minutes base six to alpha flashlight is now in your zone we have flashlight thank you base six good job roof team this is base six any activity negative six all clear except for our people keep me informed roof team we are near maximum vulnerability now have you six all teams max v condition on your toes people on your toes on his toes nick felt so out of it he almost had to laugh this is your life nick memphis he sat in the car alone in a zone so barren of life it seemed despoiled or some vista in a scifi movie set after the end of the world all the tourists had hustled on by to get a looksee at the president here he was on the far outside now he saw it the motorcade hurtled down north rampart and just briefly the gates to the park were opened and through it sped flashlights threemilliondollar lincoln which no bullet could penetrate sixteen new orleans motorcycle cops the security detail quick reaction van and two cars of reporters and tv people and then they were gone man he thought im so far to the outside there is no inside he tried to stay alert out of respect for the ritual and the big smith in the pancake holster was some help it gouged him but in his curious way he enjoyed it yet always he felt a little guilt hed gotten the easy part for he knew that the forty minutes of max v as flashlight was exposed were absolutely the most terrifying and exhilarating for the secret service agents who now ran the show ah alpha four to alpha response i have a squirrel in the fourth row left can we get a team on him please like really fast guys it was the crowd squad working the people alpha four the hispanic guy right black overcoat came muellers response from the roof of the municipal auditorium just beside the podium that had been erected in front of a wading pool thats my squirrel guys got a shifty stressed look and his hands are in his pockets i cant tell if hes by himself ah okay alpha were moving in the crowd squad maneuvered quickly to neutralize the guy theyd idd as a possible nick envied them the action even if as it did out of a thousand times it turned out to be groundless okay alpha four the squirrel just lifted his little girl up to see the man and hes got three other kids with him back off then alpha four good work nick heard cheers and laughter echoing through the empty streets the president had made a joke he checked his watch they were running a bit behind schedule it was almost noon and the speech was scheduled to have started at but it had just gotten under way hed seen the site plan amazed at how precisely these things are choreographed thered even been a rehearsal for the security detail to get them used to body moves to the look of the situation so that if something ungodly happened the place at least would be familiar to them but nick could remember from the site plan where flashlight would be standing where the archbishop would be flanked by his own bodyguard the rest of the guys up there were service beef two staff assistants and mr football as they called the air force staff colonel who was always a discreet ten feet from flashlight with a briefcase full of that days nuclear gocodes nick could imagine them up there in the love and glee of the crowd these happy men who ruled the world and who would not even in their older age remember this day ah chopper four this is base six can you take a righthand circle about halfmile out i have a new orleans police report of some roofline movement im looking at grid square limathirteentango i got a cop in that area says he thinks he saw something my countersniper team in that zone has called it a noshow but take a look will you big guy thats a big rog alpha six came the voice from the chopper and nick heard the thing roar overhead a black huey ah base ive got an all clear your cop must have seen a mirage okay chopper good work im out of here alpha six the birds roar fluttered and diminished nick was alone again on the face of the moon time asked bob and lost the answer in the roar of the chopper when the bird cleared he asked again elevenfiftysix pal came paynes answer bob breathed out heavily a stupid move because it somewhat jittered his eyes placement against the scope he blinked lost his image came back to find a black halfmoon of eyerelief error cutting into the cone of his vision because he wasnt properly aligned his heart was pumping goddamn he told himself be cool man and there it was again the arch in the steeple in perfect clarity its black dullness sealing off his vision simply a maze of ancient slats he stared at it as if pouring himself through it willing what he wanted to be there to be there so far away fourteen hundred yards from the target but just within the range of a worldclass shooter like t solaratov where are you you bastard and then he saw him he saw the sniper it was a subtlety in the light behind the slats a shifting a certain tightening a certain coming together as his mind raced to put the variousmolecules of light and dark together into a picture he realized that fifteen or so feet back the sniper at a bench like any rifle bench was feeling his way into position and in the next second or so the whole thing assembled in his head for now he saw also the solemn drift of the others in the room very slow very steady but moving ever so slightly a man on a scope next to the shooter two men well back from the window then he watched as one by one with the slowness of a glaciers move a slat and then another and still a third was removed the diagonal slash in the arch was three inches wide behind it he saw something move or tighten very quietly bob said payne hes there i got his ass hes minute or so from shooting send the boys in now goddammit send em in hes there hes there ginger dragon weve got him go go go go said payne you got him yelled timmons the cop you got him send those damn boys fast said bob hes set christ he wished he had a rifle it was his shot it was a shot that kept him alive all these years to have the motherfucker there the man who did donny fenn the man who blew out his hip and ended the life he was born to live to have him right where the remington wanted to go right where he could put it his trigger finger began to constrict and he imagined the buck of the rifle as he fired he could take the trigger slack all the way down and ship a hollowpoint out there and send that fuck straight to hell drive his heart and spine all over new orl goddamn where are they get em in there hes going to all elements move in ginger dragon go go go he heard payne on the radio where were they there should be a chopper overhead fbi swat guys in black rappelling down it men moving in from all the hidden parts of the universe men with guns and purpose moving swiftly to stop where are they bob saw the spurt of flame as solaratov fired bob he turned and payne shot him in the chest from a range of six feet nick yawned and he heard the sound of a shot it froze him the universe seemed to halt and his heart turned to stone then the radio exploded my god flashlight is down he sat up swallowed again the shot came from close by we are under fire on the podium flashlight is hit and down my god alpha actual alpha actual all units alpha actual actual was the code word it meant somebody was shooting at or had shot the president medics vector in those medics get these people out of here medevac this is alpha four we need you asap the man is down and hit oh christ oh jesus get him fast theres some other people up here hit oh christ off the air alpha

you have targets this means you countersnipers wheres that fuckin medevac we have blood everywhere guys are down nick listened in horrified fascination do we have an isolation on the shot it was a long one phil a sniper i think it came from someplace out there beyond rampart in those fuckin houses maybe that tall one swat people lets get going negative that this is base goddammit weve got to get that chopper in and get the man out of here but me nick thought i have to move i have to move he was out of the car hating himself for the five seconds or so hed lost without willing it the smith came up into his hand from the pancake his big thumb snaked out and pushed the safety up and off he ran toward the sound of the shot which was on the left the big house at st ann payne dragged him into another room he felt the blood on his chest warm like urine so much of it it felt like the last time in the blaze of light as his head lolled and his limbs went limp he could see a shooting bench rigged together of cement blocks and weathered pieces of wood and on it there lay a rifle slightly atilt on a brace of sandbags a heavybarreled remington with a leupold ultra scope the new orleans cop was talking urgently into his radio unit base six this is victor seventwenty i have shot suspect white male with rifle at fiveonefour saint ann please send assistance i say again base six this is victor seventwenty i have shot suspect in the attic of fiveonefour saint ann please send assistance then bob looked at the rifle it was his rifle i have wounded suspect said timmons get people here fast get me ambulance get me paramedics get em here asap okay dump him said the colonel stepping out of the shadows as bob slid off into stillness and lets get the hell out of here bob sat there feeling again what he had felt on the ridge line when the bullet tore through his hip shock hatred pain but mostly rage at his own stupidity it was winding down on him his breathing came with the slow rough transit of a train that had run off its tracks and now rumbled over the cobblestones his systems were shutting down the wave of hydrostatic shock that had blown through him with the bullets passage upsetting all the little gyros in his organs he felt the blood in his lungs there was no pain quite yet but only the queer sensation of loss of blur of things slipping away then something cracked in him no you arent going let it happen you been shot before you can fight through it you be a marine he took a deep breath and in the rage and pride he found what would pass for energy and without exactly willing it he stood up again surprised that there was no pain at all and with a strange determined gait began to move toward the door jesus hes fuckin up he heard the cops anguished cry and another shot rang out hitting him high in the left shoulder glancing off the bone a heavy impact and a red sear of pain but then he was out the door and there were only two steps to go toward a window and he launched himself felt the window shattering and amid a rain of glass he fell through bright sunlight toward god knew what nick was looking around in a spasm of confusion hed entered the courtyard of the large brick house because hed heard the cop over his earpiece claiming that he had hit a suspect but that was a block away at he was at he heard a helicopters roar as it whirled and darted he heard sirens rising but he stood in the sunlight wondering if he should go back to the street to check the address he thought maybe he was in the wrong area it was a maze to him the building scruffy and dilapidated lots of other houses close by jesus any one of them could have been the location of the callin he froze wondering what the hell to do where to go what he should be doing who was in command the gun grew heavy in his hand he felt idiotically melodramatic and at the same time wished he were wearing sunglasses because the sun was so bright then immediately above him he heard what sounded like the breaking of a hundred ice cubes and he looked up into the radiant sun amid a sleet of glass a man had launched himself crazily from a fourthstory window and nick watched him fall with a sickening acceleration toward the ground except that fifteen feet into it he landed with another stupefying dustrising whack on the slanted roof of a bay window rolled akimbo down it and fell again this time by some miracle of grace and agility gaining enough control over his body so that he landed on his feet more or less on the wooden stairway which ran up the side of the house he lurched down the steps nick stared at him dumbfounded the guy looked like death itself a leanboned blondheaded man with squirrelyslit eyes and a deep tan he was in blue jeans boots and a blue workshirt there was blood on him everywhere and as he tried to stand he fell back then got his feet under him and lurched up nick threw out the mm and screamed dont move dont move fbi goddammit dont move the man went to his knees as fatigue and blood loss overwhelmed him and his head pitched forward he seemed almost to collapse and nick raced forward yanking his cuffs from the compartment on his belt got behind him and got one cuff on a limb with his one free hand holding the smith in his other even as he smelled blood and sweat and felt the man shiver and groan fucked me the man kept saying fucked me so bad fucked me fucked me fucked me the voice was crackersouth a twang drawn over a banjo string holding the cuffed hand up and tight nick slid the back into his pancake and reached for the other wrist to bring it up to the cuffs for just an instant nick knew he had him and then the whole thing turned shaky as the man with a force that stunned nick drove up and under him and nick felt his center of balance going reached back for his smith but by that time had somehow lost leverage as well as balance as the man beneath him turned into nothing but snake the world splintered as nick judoflipped expertly hit the ground his breath driven from him he tried to right himself but what he saw instead was the man above him filling the entire horizon of his vision but now coiled like a cavalry trooper with a saber except there was no saber but only an elbow which exploded into nicks cheekbone in the next second amid the roar in his head and the shock he felt a hand groping on him and as he tried feebly to prevent it through the throbbing that had overwhelmed his face he felt the pistol being slid from his holster no god he shouted grabbed the hand but even then failed now the man stood above him the pistol leveled at his head its bore a ravenous black mouth that would in an instant spit flame and that would be all nick was dead he accepted his own death felt it swell in him but then was astounded to look past the gun to the mans looming and anguished face as if he were looking up at a man hung out to die his face mottled with suffering and despair and yet in the gray eyes something terrible and abiding compassion nick thought but he could not believe it even as he recognized it then the man was gone scuttling off in a halfrun leaking blood nick stood to give chase but a bullet whistled by his ear fired from above and smacked up a cloud of dust at the fleeing mans feet two more came two more misses and then the man was out the gate and in nicks car oh christ he thought because in his urgency he knew hed left the key in it the car started revved and was gone goddamn goddamn missed him shit hit the fuck twice dammit nick turned to see a fat and sweaty new orleans cop racing toward him down the steps and yelling beretta waving about in a fat hand im fbi call it in nick yelled noting the mans radio unit ah base six where the hell are you this is victor seventwenty i have hit the suspect twice but goddamn hes still running and he jumped some guy and got his car whats the number bubba ah nick didnt know hed checked it out of the interagency motor pool that morning its a goddamn ford beige dont know the number a taurus i think theyd have the number at the pool but its got a radio in it hell be listening who are you timmons traffic division seen something up on the fourth floor moving up near the goddamned roof line called in that chopper but they didnt see nothing went in heard the goddamn shot and bounced the guy he made a jump at me and damn if i didnt put a silvertip right through his chest and knock him down and two minutes later the guy is up and running took another shot hit him in the shoulder and then hes out the fuckin window took three more shots after he decked you but missed nick just shook his head he tried to figure it out but one thing he knew for certain and that was he was in big trouble getting your piece taken from you by a presidential assassin whod already soaked up two bullets was a definite bad career move man im screwed he said in a little burst of selfpity shit no sweat said the cop i seen em hit like that before you may not get em with a oneshot stop but they bleed out in ten minutes hes a dead guy right now theyll find him half a mile away piled up against a dipsy dumpster in an alley no said nick knowing that the fates would not be so kind to him not that guy he turned get on that thing and put out an all points bulletin bob lee swagger of blue eye arkansas and the united states marine corps you know him the cop said yeah said nick suddenly feeling all sorts of pain begin to fire away all over his body but the physical pain wasnt so much as the anguish for the terrible days ahead yeah i know him bob drove through waves of hallucination skidding leftand righthand turns watching alleys fly by terrified most of all of the bird he knew if a bird had him he was dead and gone because a bird could stay with him but no bird came in a second over the cars police radio he learned why base six that medevac all set with flashlight and other wounded aboard lets clear the air so we can asap to shock trauma roger shock trauma i want all birds to go to ground level while we get the man to the hospital any word alpha lots of blood thats all i can tell you base six and we got paramedics working hard you let us worry hes in our hands now then other messages broke in and the whole thing degenerated into a cascade of possibilities of rumors of men yelling for attention and assistance he heard a couple of references to fiveonefour saint ann and the fleeing suspect but that baffled him hed been in was a block away on the other side of the street where did they get that number what was going on then he had it sure thats how well planned it was timmons gives the wrong address as if hes flustered the whole outfit goes to the wrong house a block away that gives payne and the colonel the time to slip away he drove onward down deserted streets and now a new problem began to eat at him his head kept trying to float back to vietnam he fought with it feeling very much two men a weak one who wanted to return and a strong one who would not let him hed been hit in vietnam too and once youve been hit it always feels the same he slid for a second unrooted in time the dead past floating up big as a movie in front of him there was an enormous amount of pain that day and the pain he now felt brought that back but this wasnt anything like it the pain of the hip had been absolute this pain was stunning and pointed but he knew he could beat it hed had worse pain than this plenty of times this was nothing he snorted trying to get out of the nam and made himself concentrate on old jack payne and the happy glint in his pig eyes as he pulled the trigger he felt himself slipping into numbness and stupidity he hated himself for that moment of utter strangeness when hed been shot gunsimple fool hed been easy for them because he wanted solaratov so bad that was it that was the best trick how they played on what he wanted these agency fucks had somehow found out about him and donny and how they got nailed by a nailer coming over the crest and they used it on him like a club used his most private thing agency hoods working on something big and dark and complicated meant to turn on his stupidity and his vulnerability and his need now i got to stop the blood or i die he looked about him on the seat was a bag that said dunkin donuts he reached in pulled out a wad of waxy paper he tightened it into a ball and stuffed it into the entrance wound the one that was bleeding so badly there wasnt much but it was what he had he knew exactly where he was going if he could only stay smart enough to get there hed studied it after all there was only one escape route now he had only one problem and that was the fact that he was dying or was he shouldnt he be dead by now the first bullet had gone right through him for some crazy reason and he suspected that it was a ball round overpenetrative it had missed major body structures taken out no arteries whatever as for the shoulder hit that part of his body had gone to numbness but there wasnt much blood and he had a sense maybe illusory it didnt matter that no bone had been broken so on he drove by this time calmed down and no longer roaring but he had to dump the car that was the thing the car was death he drove toward water in water there was safety attention all units we have a definite confirm we have government interagency motorpool car a beige eightyeight ford taurus plate number sierra doggie onefiveninerlima thats sierra doggie onefiveninerlima suspect is armed and dangerous a white male about forty wounded but considered dangerous and an early id for the name robert lee swagger i say again all units hes armed and dangerous approach with caution oh shit he thought but bob had seen the water he rolled off the road raising a cloud of dust behind him slewing through weeds and mulch suddenly it was before him the vast band of blueblack mississippi a sinewy bending thing he had no real idea of what he was doing because of blood loss and of course the rage which was making him insane he had no sense of making a decision the car just surged ahead and he felt a sense of liberation of release similar in fact to the one hed felt as he blew through the window and then suddenly there were bubbles and blackness all around him pulling at him in the pocket of the cab the water line rose as the car sank he rose with it until his head struck the ceiling he felt the torrent blasting through the cars open windows as he sank and he knew hed die now trapped beneath the surface but again his rage helped and it released a last pump of energy and adrenaline and with half a body and the thrust of his legs he managed to get the door open he was almost born again the water was warm and green now and he rose toward sunlight and then suddenly tasted the air the plunge off a dock had carried the car maybe fifteen feet out overhead a helicopter made a sweep of the river the way the hueys had buzzed the perfume during tet but it was far off and couldnt see him he flipped to his back and propelled himself toward shore drifting he eventually found himself among green reeds weaving in the current barges plied the water a halfmile or so away but the river was so wide here it looked to be a placid lake bob waded woozily his hair plastered against his scalp his wet shirt heavy against his skin his body drugged with fatigue he couldnt believe he was still alive and able to move it seemed a miracle he found a rotting log floating in the weeds if he stayed there hed die or get caught and he knew if he got caught he couldnt kill them all kill payne and the colonel and kill solaratov who made it all possible if it was solaratov and if it wasnt hed kill whoever it was thats what he wanted bob got his belt off stopping momentarily to discover with surprise the gun hed taken jammed into his waist thank god it was stainless steel and probably wouldnt rust as for the bullets would they corrode he didnt know what choice did he have he slid it to his jean pocket a tight fit that would hold good then he buckled the belt around the log and wrapped his arm through it and pushed off with surprising swiftness the log carried him into the center of the river and the current picked him up but he felt amazingly good now and then a chopper buzzed by but he wasnt visible against the log and when darkness came he swore at the flashing lights here and there along the shore but bob just let the current carry him along through the afternoon and the night and when the dawn broke he was right where he wanted to be he was in the jungle chapter fourteen the lead editorials mourned the passing of the great man of course but the offleads quickly got to the matter of blame and so he returns ran the piece in the washington post the next day the seedy little man with the grudge and the rifle the grudge does not make him special only the caliber rifle does like a figure from our darkest most atavistic nightmares he returns and writes himself into history if as the federal bureau of investigation has alleged the perpetrator of yesterdays shooting tragedy in new orleans turns out to be bob lee swagger the vietnam war hero fallen on hard times and embittered because his country would not award him the congressional medal of honor he felt he deserved or if he turns out to be another man with vainglorious notions of what he deserves but could not get it really doesnt matter what matters what has mattered since is that in this country alone history can be written with firearms precisely because firearms are available small men can become momentarily and delusionarily big men because firearms are available in the case of lee harvey oswald it was a cheap italian war surplus rifle in the case of yesterdays tragedy it was a highpowered american sporting firearm manufactured by remington again it doesnt matter what matters is that guns have no other purpose but to kill and that they kill so frequently has begun to erode the illusion of the american sportsman isnt it time for everybody in the terrifying wake of another bloody american tragedy a typical american tragedy involving guns and dreams that would not come true to begin to work toward the day when only policemen and soldiers and a few forest rangers have guns the new york times by contrast took a more geopolitical view the terrifying events in new orleans yesterday merely reconfirm that as a nation we have not yet recovered entirely from the great cataclysm that was the vietnam war no matter our nearly bloodless victory over saddam hussein last year a veteran of vietnam much decorated and held in great esteem by his peers perhaps propelled into bitterness by the glory of the recent battle in distinction to the lack of glory in his own evidently descended in hatred to the point where he could commit a terrible act and thereby blaspheme his own wellestablished heroism and the cause he fought so valiantly for years ago it is to be hoped that robert lee swagger the marine gunnery sergeant and champion sniper who yesterday apparently achieved his th kill may be captured alive his psyche examined the seeds of his violence exhumed the first interest here must be justice if sergeant swagger is indeed guilty of this crime he must be punished but we hope that the punishment is tempered with mercy like few other men sergeant swagger was a product of his times the wounds from which he has bled internally over the past two decades were wounds inflicted by his own country and its vast and careless disinterest in his struggles and the struggles of the men with whom he served that is why although he is not a victim he is certainly a tragedy when he is apprehended if he is not already dead as some law enforcement officers have conjectured given the gravity of his wounds perhaps these issues will be answered but perhaps they will not and perhaps finally the largest perhaps of them all will be if bob lee swagger comes at last to have some peace himself when that happens perhaps we as a nation can also have some peace when we at last accept the evil of our enterprise in vietnam and the squalor of our position in the world as we attempt to impose our way on other nations once again our way the american way has been shown to be the way of death the baltimore evening sun wondered who needs a longrange assault rifle capable of shooting a man dead at over yards certainly not the thousands of children who perish accidentally at the hands of such militaristicstyled guns each year nor the thousands more innocent citizens killed by such multishot longrange guns when carried by drug dealers on our citys streets nor do the innocent animals slaughtered by such weapons in our nations forests only the powerful gun lobby drug dealers the demented men who kill animals for pleasureand assassins as yesterdays tragedy in new orleans proved need such a gun congress should act immediately to ban telescopicpowered longrange multishot assault rifles that way we can give life a chance in fact it was not the murdered mans face that appeared on the cover of time and newsweek it was bobs in an instant he had become a world celebrity by virtue first of the killing and second of the miraculous escape and third for what he represented the dixie gun nut with all that trigger time in the nam gone off on his own twisted route he was lee harvey oswald and james earl ray and byron de la beckwith all squashed into one mythic figure the sullen white trash yankeehatin shooter a character out of faulkner a flem snopes with a rifle the case had been swiftly developed by the fbi nick memphiss visual id of the suspect minutes after the shot had been fired only hastened matters by an hour or so and the media and police computer networks were far faster and more sophisticated than theyd been in the rifle for example was quickly tracked by serial number to the naval post exchange system where it was identified as having been purchased in by an officer in the marine marksmanship unit for presentation as a retirement present to bob lee swagger gny sgt usmc bobs signature upon a receipt was uncovered it followed quickly that the new barrel a hart stainless steel model had been installed by a custom gunsmith in little rock named don frank frank had the serial number in his records and verified that the job had been done in for bob lee swagger with that information in hand by eight pm agents from the little rock office of the fbi obtained a search warrant and journeyed out to blue eye cut through the padlocks at his property and examined his trailer and the contents of his life with a great deal of care there they found even more incriminating evidence maps drawings sketches and notes of the four cities in which the president of the united states was scheduled to speak in the months of february and march with diagrams of the speaking sites the notes were particularly damning wind how much wind bob had written what time best to shoot bob had wondered what range go for a long shot or just try and get up close and what about some sort of they also found ticket stubs and hotel receipts indicating that hed traveled to all four cities and other teams of agents quickly verified his presence in each and finally they found a barr stroud rangefinder for calibrating the exact distances between shooter and target an invaluable aid for any sniper they also found thirtytwo rifles in his gun vault and seventeen handguns and an empty space where the remington had rested before he removed it for his trip to new orleans and over ten thousand rounds of ammunition and they found one other sad thing much remarked upon in the press for many weeks lying in a shallow grave the body of bobs dog mike his brain blown out with a gauge shotgun because as the senior agent in charge told nbc news he knew he probably wasnt coming back and there was no one to take care of mike who was probably the only creature bob loved in this world on the issue of the dog there was one demurral from bobs friend the old exprosecutor and war hero sam vincent who never for a second believed bob had taken the shot and who had once helped bob sue mercenary magazine ill tell you this he said to the newsmen who had tracked him down whoever done this thing to bob did a good job he framed him he took his reputation from him he made him an outlaw and the most hated man in america or the world and hes got you boys putting your lies about him in your magazines and newspapers and on the tv well i tell you he done a good job but he made one mistake he killed bobs dog well around these parts we consider our dogs family and that makes it personal this quaint bit of arkansas lore made the evening news but nobody paid it much attention because nobody wanted to get into the bitter old mans delusions other witnesses were located to discuss the phenomenon that had become bob lee swagger his fathers legendary heroism was hauled out of the files and his fathers death on us the night of july as a sergeant in the arkansas state police and one of arkansass seven medal of honor winners from the second world war a number of old arkansas salts who knew both men made television news appearances hard to blieve a son of earl swaggers could end up like this they said to a man he was one of the bravest fairest most decent men to ever walk the face o the earth weall thought bob was a trueblue type too but you cant never tell how a boys gonna turn out a few exmarine snipers whod served with bob were located only one would go on television and say interesting things and only with the proviso that his face not be shown he was now an automobile salesman bob was just a great shot but he had the coldness the man said the coldness of heart that makes a killer of all of us and there were over fifty men rotated in and out of that platoon over the three years it was operational he was certainly the best but as far as i know we all went back to civilian lives convinced wed served our country as well as we could and most of us readjusted the man went on to detail his own psychic difficulties with living with his own evil his own fascination with violence hed been in and out of programs he said had a long history of alcoholism and only just lately had gotten his life together again later when it was determined he was a fraud the story ran only on entertainment tonight on the third day the ballistics report was issued by the fbi it began with the bad news that the bullet which had mushroomed considerably as it plowed through bone and brain then veered free and struck something hard perhaps a nail in the podium was unreadable as to its rifling marks however preliminary results of tests on the bullets metallic structure via a neutron activation analysis revealed that it matched perfectly with traces of copper residue found inside the hart stainless steel barrel on bobs remington action two partial fingerprints were lifted from inside the weapons barrel channel from marine corps records they were quickly verified as bobs the empty shell found on the floor had indeed been fired in the chamber of the remington all its marks corresponded exactly to the markings of the chamber the shell itself probably came from an order of brass winchester match nickel plated lot no b manufactured by the federal cartridge company anoka minnesota which bob had purchased mail order from bob pease accuracy in new braunfels texas the matching shells some loaded some yet untouched were found in his workshop and last there was the letter poignant desperate awkward and naive it swiftly became the most famous letter in american culture bob telling the president he wants the congressional medal of honor because hes earned it it was the letter that got him on the secret services charlie list and had not an idiotic fbi agent blown the assignment it was the letter that might have saved a mans life but there it was the crucial issue of motive in all this there was not one public doubt raised about the guilt of gunnery sergeant ret bob lee swagger of blue eye arkansas in the matter of death by gunshot in new orleans louisiana on march that was finally uttered for the first time on the fourth day when a reporter from wknutv finally tracked down mrs susan swagger preece of highland junction north carolina who had once been married to bob lee swagger and was now the wife of a hardware store owner she was a bitter little woman her face almost completely concealed under a headscarf and sunglasses the reporter caught her rushing from her husbands cadillac toward his lawyers office no she had no idea where bob was and doubted very much if he was alive if hed try to make contact with her that was all over she said and life was too short to be involved with bob swagger more than one time but she had a last thought ill say this though she said turning for just a second if bob lee swagger took it in his mind to fire a bullet at the president of the united states then the president of the united states would be a dead man and not no salvadoran archbishop youre telling me bob swagger aimed at a man and missed and killed another man bob lee swagger never missed nothing he aimed at his whole life and thats the pured truth chapter fifteen millions of people saw it within minutes but nick memphis did not see it for three days and then only by accident he was at hub center of the swagger manhunt in fbi headquarters going through leads keeping his head down in the seething atmosphere of the place now so totally locked into finding the sniper that it seemed unable to pay attention to some smaller detailssuch as himself but he knew mother bureau would get around to it he knew the inevitable could not be avoided and that he was riding in a bubble of illusion the ax would fall on him soon but for now hed lost himself in the minutiae of the reports and the sightings that now extended over seven states bob was everywhere bob was in alaska bob was in california bob was really lee harvey oswalds brother bob had held up a gas station in tuscaloosa alabama bob was a dance instructor in new haven connecticut he had what appeared to be an amusing sighting in everett springs georgia where an exmarine who said he knew bob in the war swore hed run into him on a back trail in the blue ridge mountains and nick was trying to figure out how the hell bob could have gotten from new orleans with two ninemillimeters pumped into him to everett springs georgia in the damn blue ridges but from the investigators not much at all had surfaced the car had simply vanished no snitch had any word at all and the pressure was on but good helicopters cruised the highways and a hundred agents had been flown in to handle the pursuit on which considerable professional pride rested but a thousand roadblocks and a hundred thousand photos had yielded nothing at all where had the damned guy gone suddenly hap fencl was leaning in hey nick we finally got the cbs version you wanna look ahhh nick paused something weird in him ticked off no he didnt really want to see it even if by chance the cbs cameraman had been best situated to record impact and collapse and poststrike scramble and even if the pricks at cbs had been snooty about playing ball with the poor old feebs who were only in charge of tracking down the motherfucker on the trigger and even though nbc and cbs and the three new orleans affiliates whod had tape on the ultimate moment had shipped it right over that is after airing it despite all that nick was reluctant his whole misfortune was tied up in it the terribleness of his own missed shot now somehow replicated by the strange pattern in the life and times of his hero and a certain secret part of nick couldnt yet believe that the great bob the nailer the champ of vietnam and eightyseven or so odd manonman encounters in the boonies the man who never missed had somehow some waymissed bob the nailer might have been a lot of terrible things but he was a great shot he never missed thats what nick thought along with bobs wife and two or three others come on pal you might as well see what all the shoutings about the shoutings gonna be in your ear sooner or later old buddy hap said this with a malicious grin not quite meaning to be cruel but rather to be bluff and hearty and masculine and to undercut the tension because everybody knew nick was a gone goose so nick could hardly turn down the invite he walked into a dark room a few minutes later to a batch of catcalls and hoots everybody had been working so hard three eighteenhour days in a row that nickbaiting was a treat for them all hey hero where you been hiding nicky whynt ya shoot the motherfuck when you had the chance i havent been able to touch my wife in three days and i am getting very very horny old boy nicky dont let these dicks turn you around you done good except for letting him get away that little minor detail yeah yeah he said in answer to his jolly tormentors just wanted to see if you clowns were as good as you say you are three days and you guys havent found your nuts yet ooooo brave words from the land of the walking dead all right gentlemen said howdy duty who had gotten himself appointed coordinator of the swagger manhunt lets close it down and watch go ahead hap okay guys said hap this is raw unedited tv tape courtesy of our good friends the assholes at cbs who make more money and do lots more damage than we do youll notice the time sequence at the bottom right of the screen thats blocked out for tv showings but very helpful for our purposes ive got it cued to thirty seconds before the first shot assuming and were still not sure there was more than one shot the television screen leapt to light and there was flashlight his goodlooking rather bland and characterless face knitted up in a slightly unconvincing mask of passion it was a tight shot only him and he was singing fulsome praise of this latino whod done so much to repair the damage between as flashlight put it our two great countries and had worked so tirelessly to effect reconciliation reconstruction and recognition and so flashlight concluded what a great pleasure it is to award archbishop jorge roberto lopez the highest award we have in this country for civilian accomplishment the medal of freedom the tape dropped back to a twoshot and the cleric in modest black with a beatific smile on his face comes up to the podium on the presidents right to take the presidents hand and to genuflect to accept the silky garland with its little hunk of gold plating around his fat neck he turns giving his back to the audience then bends as the president lifts to raise the thing over his thats it said hap fencl as the image froze what were gonna hear a lot of once the conspiracy boys figure out how to make a bundle on this is how come bob doesnt shoot when the president is talking and hes got an easy frontal or brain shot why does he wait till hes turned to his right and the latin guy is moving into the line of fire answers anybody there was silence but nick knew hap yes nick ah the reason is that a headshot is too far to risk from what five hundred yards out not because he cant hit a head at that range you can bet your ass he can but because the head is the most animated part of the body and most of the body movement begins at the head so the head is never really still and it moves so quickly because the neck muscles are so articulated and because the reaction time between impulse and action is nearly instantaneous so the heads a nogo at least for a pro but at the same time hes worried about body armor so he cant quite take a full frontal centerofmass shot see hes waiting for flashlight to turn slightly to raise his arms and hes going for a raking shot into the sleeve vent of the body armor he wants a translateral chest shot putting it into him right in front of the armpit on about a fortyfivedegree angle the bullet will traverse left to right expanding as it goes and it ought to clear out all the chest structures hed be dead in a second before he hit the ground was flashlight wearing body armor secret service wont say thats very good nick too bad youre a dead man somebody said anonymously in the dark there was some laughter and even nick had to smile okay lets get to the good stuff said hap brainshot time boys and girls on some twitch the archbishop lurched up as if a back spasm suddenly struck him and nick thought that hed been hit or something but no it just seemed to be the random play of events in a very small compass that for whatever reason instead of lowering his head to take the presidents garland he raised it and pushed his head into the kill zone where swaggers bullet hit it full force back right rear quadrant the moment frozen in the stillness of the videotape was staggering ripeness is all said lear though nick had learned it from joseph heller in catch when snowden died in the back of the plane but here it was again that message man was matter light him hell burn sink him hell drown shoot him in the head his head will explode the head seemed to disappear in a sudden flame of motion a smear across the lens as if the atoms were individually decomposing in actuality of course it was a caliber grain bullet hitting at about fourteen hundred feet per second breaching the cranial vault opening like a steel tulip inside veering crazily through the whorls and confusions of the august archbishops gray matter and blowing crazily out his left eye socket and in so doing spattering tissue into the horrified face of the president of the united states hes a complete rag doll the microsecond the bullet goes through him said hap there was a moment of almost holy silence as the mans death loomed in frozen grandeur on the screen its a little tough to tell from this angle hap but are we sure the president was the intended target jesus thats a dead center hit to me somebody said now i dont want that kind of talk howdy duty said asserting himself for the first time and quick to deal with the apostasy thats exactly the kind of nonsense that got started during and haunts us to this day yes absolutely the president was the target you can see the way the head rose into the line of fire but nick just sat there staring at the moment of death the brains like a breaking red wave emptying themselves in the face of the president who had not yet begun to react hed thought so much about shooting a person at long range it had been his life once before myra his vanity that he could do it do it well save lives become a hero and something now reached him that disturbed him he tried to fix on it to sift it out of the data but nick nick hey somebody poke nick hes sleeping oh yeah sorry whats up hap nick you did some sniper time on swat any way hes not shooting at flashlight ahh nick paused well nick asked howdy duty can you get an angle reading from the point of impact and the wound channel and trace it back to a source and make sure it came from that house no just got the report from washington they ran it through their big ballistics mainframe program and the best they can do is pinpoint a rough semicircle of about seven degrees and theres over nineteen buildings with windows opening onto the shooting site from there weve been over each of them though and the only one that had blood and a rifle in it and an empty shell happened to be the one where bob the nailer walked on a ninemil and took your smith hap said well thats it then said nick letting it slide knowing hed hoard his doubt at least a little longer rather than risk howdy dutys ire this early in it and hanging on to his career by a pubic hair okay lets go on said hap impelled by the force of the bullet the cleric now plunged forward and smashed into the president and the two went down in a terrible heap archbishop roberto lopez crashes into flashlight after spraying him with tissue and blood but by this time the bullet has exited and smashed into the wood of the podium slat hap continued to narrate where it will be recovered by our ballistic technicians too damn mutilated for a ballistics signature reading still one bullet two men down elapsed time four onehundreths of a second its a hell of a piece of shooting the drama continued to unfold now in real time in seconds secret service men of alpha security team pulling uzis from god knows where are surrounding flashlight so that no other bullet may reach him mere anarchy is loosed around the podium but the alpha guys stay very calm and completely purposeful hey these alpha guys know how to operate said hap too bad theyre such pricks came a jokesters voice the drama then seemed to devolve into pulsating patterns of light and color evidently a secret service alpha guy pushed all the cameramen back and for just a moment the world went all to blur when it came back a small knot of men is gathered around flashlight who is supine but trying to struggle to his feet archbishop roberto lopez is almost in his lap that head with its queerly deflated look as if it were a balloon and not a skull the secret service guys are dancing around then a medic comes atop the podium and they bend to let him in a few seconds later the world dissolves this time its under the torrents of air that the standby medical chopper radiates as it settles with lazy urgency out of the sky the camera shifts to it as paramedics and stretcher teams race over to flashlight and the alpha team screams shouts confusion it reminded nick of a pickup game of basketball all frenzy and nonsense and then he had it what was weird about the shooting could we go back to the hit he asked what are you a ghoul come on hap let me see the hit there was some grumbling but hap rewound the tape then punched play and the drama reinvented itself up there on the screen the lurch of the old man the sudden stunning boltlike arrival of the bullet the sleet of bone and tissue and nick was thinking about his own shooting i overcompensated he thought i knew the bullet traveling downward would drop farther thats the effect of the angle so i overcompensated missed high and hit myra now this swagger he knows shooting like he knows his own two hands and the smell of his own sweat he knows where the bullet will strike that means the bullet drift is going to be vertical hell hit high or low on a vertical range if hes shooting at the presidents armpit if the bullet goes too high it hits the president in the neck or head if its too low it goes into his ribs or hip but this shooting error was lateral it was on the same damn level as the presidents armpit for the man was kneelingbut it was a lateral error an aiming error which had nothing to do with the shots most difficult aspect the play of the downward angle over the long eight hundred yards to the target could a gust of wind have just nudged it off target he remembered that march had been an unusually calm day with the wind under five miles per hour it was possible but not probable it suddenly occurred to nick that the shooting error made no sense at all he would shoot over the president he would shoot below the president he would not miss to the right not this boy nick swallowed hed arrived at a place he didnt want to be it could only be that bob lee swagger was shooting for the archbishop all the way and then he realized what bad news this was for everybody currently the only theory available to unify the events was that that meanass sullen pissedoff dixie whiteboy swagger was shooting the president it made sense it held together but only if swagger were shooting for flashlight if swagger wasnt shooting for flashlighta dizzying realm of possibility opened up nick had a weird moment here as his whole life traveled its fuckedup way before him and he suddenly saw that he was about to diverge from the path because he now knew swagger was innocent and that the reason he saw compassion in the snipers eyes as he stood above him with the big smith was because the sniper was still by his own lights a moral man an honorable man a man who did not shoot the innocent and nick stupid and bumbling had been of the innocent nick it was howdy duty nick im afraid im going to have to ask you to see me sometime today all right oh shit thought nick the cow was not frightened of colonel shreck her eyes were placid and dull though huge there was something tenderly stupid in them the cow chewed her cud occasionally scuffed one hoof in the straw or bent her great gentle head down to seize another bunch of hay from her bale shoot her said colonel shreck hatcher kneeled squinted then found what he was looking for he raised a mm beretta and shot the cow in the chest hitting her square in a painted spot dobbler winced at the report even through the highdecibel soundproof earmuffs and he thought hed be sick though hed been feeling woozy since the event he forced himself to look back at the animal hed never seen anything die much less anything so huge and warmblooded but the cow didnt seem interested in dying shed twitched just once when the bullet drove through her and a tiny track of blood opened up from the black pucker of the entrance wound but her head came back up she continued to chew and to gaze at her audience benevolently of course she has one great advantage said hatcher rising she has no conceptual ability she cannot understand what has just happened to her swagger of course saw the gun and knew what happened thus his collapse and initial response to shock but physiologically thats it thats the shot on bob same range same ammunition same angle through the center chest dobbler studied the animal the animal appeared to study him back until he bored her then she lowered her head for another thatch of hay he thought he would puke he struggled to keep his focus but could feel the sweat running down his face dobbler watched as shreck stared at the creature the colonel seemed bent in some furious onepointed crusade to absorb all the life from the animal his dark eyes gobbling up her destruction with no remorse whatsoever only great curiosity she paid him no attention shes hit and the bullet has gone down through her thoracic cavity and exited the other side said thatcher but its not stopping her its not even irritating her this happens all too frequently you may recall the famous miami shootout of may where a creep named michael platt was hit ten times once through the lungs mostly with winchester mm hollowtips and kept firing long enough to kill two and wound five fbi agents i thought the point of a hollowpoint bullet said colonel shreck was to open up and rip the shit out of the tissue and organs it didnt open said hatcher if it had hed have never made it to the car much less dumped that fbi agent we know because paynes report says he saw blood on the back of the shirt it had to go through without opening up why didnt it open up shreck asked finally hatcher answered in our research weve found that most of the stopping problems with mm silvertip came with firstgeneration ammunition they first started manufacturing it in the midseventies the real bad stopping problems took place then subsequently they changed the circumference of the cavity and the composition of the copper sheathing the lead and since then the results have been much better up to about seventythree percent oneshot kills but timmons had to draw his ammo from police sources otherwise thered be reason to suspect some kind of frameup and we think the police issue was an older lot purchased back in but we had to go with police issue because if he used an unauthorized load it led to very dangerous ground we simply trusted him or payne who insisted on doing the actual shooting to place a mortal round if hed hit the heart it wouldnt have mattered if it had opened up and he missed the heart it wouldnt have mattered unfortunately he missed the heart and it didnt open up shit said shreck and why did payne miss the heart youd have to ask payne colonel shreck i did bear in mind sir said hatcher that in the expanse of the chest the heart is a fairly difficult target its much smaller and to the right of where people think it is i talked with him about anatomy but in the dark and the crisis of the second he hatcher let the sentence end youre a doctor dr dobbler whats the medical prognosis dobbler cleared his throat hed researched this swagger could die of blood loss or infection but its possible that the bullet just rushed through doing minor tissue damage and left him largely intact if he was smart enough to stanch the bleeding right away and clearly he was having been wounded before hell heal up and if he doesnt get infected hell be good as new in two weeks shreck looked as if he were going to laugh now said hatcher let me just show you by contrast a later mm of course said shreck this is a federal grain hydrashok with a post in the center of the cavity to help expansion i think you should see some dramatic results suddenly dobbler was nauseous he didnt want to watch the man shoot the animal and then talk about the weight of the bullet and the angle of the wound and the size of the temporary stretch cavity it seemed obscene to him it was killing after all not to any ends not to purpose or point but just to satisfy some arcane curiosity dobbler looked away outside through the barn door he could see the rolling virginia hills just a second said shreck dr dobbler would you mind paying attention dobbler smiled and turned his face to watch the bullet was fired she kicked an amazing burst of energy from so stolid an animal then her heavy head twitched once subtly her lines changed as she shuddered and her knees went as the bullet a ragged nova of hot metal ruptured her heart and she surrendered the great head slid forward and lay atilt eyes blankly open she was still in a dark and spreading pool of blood dobbler smiled weakly afraid hed lose face in front of shreck but thought for just a second he was all right then he vomited all over his clothes but shreck did not even notice instead he watched the animal die then turned to hatcher and said now at least i know what to tell them ahhh said howdy duty regretfully he looked up at nick over halfspecs his face haggard with fatigue hed been working like the rest of them eighteen on and six off and was beginning to wear a bit thin but he would be polite nick knew come on sit down nick nick sat down the gray light of the office turned howdy dutys skin the color of old parchment his eyes were lost behind the crescent specs he had a slightly distracted air oh nick what are we going to do with you nick didnt know what to say hed always suspected that he didnt prosper in the bureau because hed never been much at coming up with charming answers to rhetorical questions agents in charge tended to ask at awkward moments so as usual nick said nothing he just parked his considerable bulk into the chair breathing hard nick tell me about the charlie thing to begin with the secret service is making all kinds of trouble you know what an asshole that mueller can be well said nick swallowing as he began maybe i did screw up but jesus howard there were over sixty names on the charlie list and they were way down in importance the secret service guys themselves said that they wont admit it but they made it seem like it was strictly business as usual but i worked it real hard howard whats his name sloane he told me himself id done a good job i located most of them or accounted for them i recommended three be moved up to beta classification and they didnt like that one bit because it meant they had to do more work but you did miss bob lee swagger not really i picked him out and made inquiries i called sheriff tell in polk county to find out if hed had any recent troubles hed been sitting pretty off by himself they say the pattern with these guys is they begin to destabilize in the days before they make a hit there was no sign of that he didnt fit any pattern and his sheriff vouched for him also the only reason he was on the list was for that letter and the only reason the letter got him there was because it had four exclamation points four exclamation points it seemed like a safe call to me i cant say id make it any different way now all right nick i suppose you performed adequately we cant expect distinction twentyfour hours seven days a week nick i think i can save you from secret service because they want some bureau blood to let them off the hook it was really their operation and they got beaten they sure did but ive talked to the director and we feel our position is strong they could complain that we didnt do a good job on the charlies and we could complain that they were so poorly managed they couldnt deal with the charlies themselves mexican standoff and i think theyll back down now nick i have to say that arrest it was badly bungled i know howard i screwed up it looked so bad in the newspapers and it looks bad inside the bureau too were supposed to be able to handle situations like that i dont know what to say howard it was a desperate situation maybe i i just dont know howard nick you were in a desperate situation in in tulsa and you mismanaged that too nick was silent then finally he said howard i just want to be an fbi agent thats all i ever wanted well nickthe director has left this call to me nick hated the fact that he was begging but he tried to imagine a life without the one thing that mattered as much as his wife which was the bureau he had to live a life without myra now but he couldnt imagine one without the bureau please dont fire me howard i know i havent been sharp lately but i just lost my wife a few months agoit just hasnt been an easy time nick we need bodies on this thing im going to suspend you without pay for a week but it wont go into effect for three months then im afraid itll have to nick nodded it meant that within a month afterwards hed be rotated back to the sticks and hed never get out it had taken him years to get to new orleans but it also meant however provisionally hed be able to stay i suppose ill be transferred then nick you know how it works and im going to have to put a letter in your file like the other one yes nick i dont want to okay howard im trying to cut you as much slack as i can sure i appreciate it nick said sure i appreciate it you prick if youd have kept your fucking trap shut six years ago id have nailed that fuck right between the eyes and id be where youre sitting and youd be on your way back to tulsa youre still in the bureau nick i appreciate that howard but nick no more mistakes do you understand there cant be another slipup there wont be howard i promise chapter sixteen when bob crawled from the water just before dawn on the day after the shooting his head seethed with rage and flashing pictures and hallucinations his body was numb as the log under which it had floated and slightly swollen and soft from the long immersion he smelled of diesel oil from the barge scum that coated the surface of the river below new orleans he reckoned hed drifted fifty or so miles around him were scrub pines an infinity of them and boggy marshes a maze of them and dense interlocking cypress trees small things scurried and then went silent far off a bird made a strange and mournful sound a screech of pain then it went silent too youre going to die he thought there was nothing here but the sameness of jungle its merciless face and thered be men in it too soon enough hunting him youre back where you started only youre older and weaker he stumbled a few feet went to his knees when was the last time hed eaten must have been yesterday breakfast hed been shot twice used his last drop of adrenaline in getting out of there and floated in the sullen river for eighteen horrible hours slung upside down under the goddamn log only his nostrils flaring above the water so there it was eat or die didnt matter if the wound was infected or not if he didnt eat hed wear down fast and the jungle would feed off him in a matter of hours been in tougher fixes yes i have i do believe but he hadnt there was no chopper waiting to airevac him if he could just make the lz there was nothing but this jungle and outside it a whole world set to do him in it must have been a bit after dawn the air was very crisp and clean and smelled fresh as baby breath the sun was still weak it was feeding time he knew it soon enough then bob happened to feel something hard against his leg and realized the hardness had been there all night he slid the pistol from his jeans pocket it was a big stainless smith wesson automatic their new model no no by god it wasnt it was that fancy new mm the fbi had started using he wondered about the round hed trust his life to a having fired a hundred thousand cartridges in his time through a variety of colts but this new thing a mil he didnt know man without a gun has got no chance bob thought man has a gun he has a chance with a thumb as big as a brick he pawed the magazine release the mag fell out and he saw the agent had it loaded brimful with hollowpoints like little brass easter eggs down there he sneaked a look to see if the man had the chamber stoked and the gleam of brass from the seated cartridge answered him would they stand up under a soaking only one way to find out he slid the magazine back felt it lock and with a same brick thumb got the hammer back and locked he sat back wishing he had more strength to find a position or a trail some place to hunt from a good place to shoot from a brace anything he had none of it only the gun overhead the sun filtered through the dense tree cover thin not yet eight he reckoned the shadows were blurry or was it his eyes going was he sliding off into nothingness bled out like a deer shot quickly and not well he was hallucinating again strange at this time he thought of donny fenn and all the scary moments in the boonies and how at the real crazyass seconds donnyd begin to laugh a little a hysterical giggle donny boy youd be laughing today if you could see old bob and whats become of him sitting on his wet ass in some bog waiting on death or a creature but bob couldnt laugh he tried to settle back seemed like there was a dim memory of sitting in the rain a while back a whole night through waiting on tim the whitetail buck with the twelvepoint spread that was a long wet wait wasnt it oh that was a hunt he remembered the way tim came blasting out of the foliage like a ghost or a miracle and how the rifle came up to him and he fired and knew how well hed fired that was a night wasnt it hit tim above the spine with a bullet cast from epoxy must have weighed less than grains atomized when it hit the flank but the shock knocked the sense out of tim for a good five minutes he remembered sawing the antlers off nobody going to kill you to hang your head on a wall he thought go on boy git he remembered the creature leaping away when it came out of its coma full of juice crackly with life he laughed crazily they sure tried to hang my head on a wall then bob looked up and there it was late it was drinking late maybe so deep here in the swamp there were no men and so there was no fear bob didnt know he just heard the rustle of twigs snapping saw a flash of color it was some sort of ugly spotted pig bob watched it emerge from the dapples of the trees maybe seventyfive yards out it was ugly as an outhouse on a hot day and yet when bob saw it he almost cried for the second time in his life the first being when he was alone at nine and had gone off onto the hill after major benson had come to tell them his daddy was dead out near fort smith but bob didnt cry he made ready to shoot the damned gun was new suddenly it felt different than his old colt automatic as if it were fighting him squeezing his left hand around the right printing down on his right thumbnail with his left his elbows locked between his pressing knees as he sat in a modified isosceles fighting the tremors of exhaustion that nuzzled through his wrists and tried to betray him in their treacherous way front sight front sight front sight that was it that was the key the rock upon which the church was built you had to see the front sight with a pistol and let the target be a kind of hazy blur in the far distance otherwise nothing good happened at all front sight front sight front sight in the notch of the rear sight a frame he saw the huge red wall of the front there was only front rock steady big as gibraltar or mars bob bending into it with every last thing and the pig a kind of soupy blur its details lost in the distance just a splotch of movement against the stability of the greenery he hoped that damn cop had zeroed it well he hoped the water hadnt deadened the primers or ruined the powder in the case bob was so poured into the shot he didnt hear the noise at all or feel the recoil as the big pistol whacked back what he saw was the pig speared through the spine by the lead which entering its tough hide ruptured it hit and broke the spine the animal squealed as death closed it down then a spasm of fury rocketed through it it tried to climb to its now stunted and shaky legs but having a broken spine was unable to direct the last part of its body to obey then with a last quiver it went quiet bob got himself up still woozy still soaked he felt death in his own limbs stalking through his body hunting him but he walked onward dazed kept sane only by the smell of the burned powder that his nose picked up in the riotous odors of the swamp a familiar thing onto which he could lock he wobbled to the pig then collapsed as he reached it it weighed about forty pounds it was about three feet long it smelled of manure and offal its snout was curiously delicate as if designed by an angel its lashes fleecy at the closed slots of its eyes were also delicate like a childs the bullet hole was an ugly blister over the shoulder but there wasnt a lot of blood seepage it hadnt come out unlike the bullet payne had put into him which is why he had lived and the pig had not served payne right for using something tiny like a nine payne had broken the one true moral law of hunting use enough gun some day ill use enough gun on you payne swiftly he got out his case xx still secure in the watch pocket of his levis thanking god for a good case knife that would hold an edge all down the many years and thanking god also for his own stubborn ways that made a small knife as much a part of daily dressing as boots and socks turning the dead animal so that its soft belly was finally exposed he had a moment of crisis felt as if hed fallen out of his own body there for a second a wave of hallucination crashed over him he forgot everything but then it came back and he found himself with the knife and the dead animal and he butchered it swiftly bob wanted the liver which he found a treasure amid the gore and ripped it out feeling it hot because it was so soaked in oxygenated blood the liver was richest in nutrition and tastiest this side of a fire bob tore off a bite stunned at the intensity of the flavor and the sense of richness it made him dizzy it was so powerful he ate some more chewing ravenously amazed at how hungry he was how desperately he needed it he ate and ate until the liver was gone i am alive he thought then he heard the roar of a chopper and dropped a huey sped low above the riverbank blowing the trees left and right as it hurtled along theyre looking for me he thought with a wave of regret at the complications of his life then he picked up the carcass slung it over his back and headed deeper into the swamp chapter seventeen dobbler always found shrecks occasional absences frightening the customers here at ramdyne were tough guys like cops or soldiers or if not tough they were distant technonerd types and both groups looked upon the large soft psychiatrist with an attitude characteristic of their professions either contempt or indifference depending so the doctor tended to sit in his grubby little office when shreck wasnt around to act as his sponsor in this strange world the ramdyne offices offices wasnt exactly the right word were located amid the cargo terminals and warehouses of dulles international airport just south of washington dc they were a shabby warren of jerrybuilt lightindustrial units sequestered behind double cyclones that wore double spirals of razor wire guarded viciously by armed men the sign next to the guardhouse at the sole entrance said only brown exports without corporate logo or escutcheon it had a prosaic unexceptional quality to it and the guard who always looked fiercely at dobbler as if he never recognized him after a full year on the payroll went with the outfits bunker mentality dobblers office was a dingy closet unbecoming an assistant professor at a junior college in idaho with concrete floors and surplus wardroom furniture it looked like the office of a doomed teacher who never would get tenure and would live forever on the hook of his department chairmans whim everything in it was junk from the sagging bookcase to the desk scratched with strange initials to the ancient safe for confidential documents it even had bars at the window an irony not lost on dobbler the fluorescent light was imperfectly calibrated and threw shadows no matter how you sited yourself in it that is when it wasnt flickering wanly but it wasnt as if dr dobbler had the worst office colonel shrecks in another building was equally crummy it was just a bit bigger with a motheaten sofa near a window that yielded a vista of cargo planes taking off or landing it didnt even have a bigger safe but exactly the same beatup model as dobblers the doctor often wondered if it had the same combination dobbler now sat in his office trying to focus on the problem before him he found the silence ominous as if a spell had been cast by the freakish escape of bob lee swagger and that in fact was the problem dobbler now faced the last words from shreck had been simple doctor go back over the documents tell me where this asshole went dobbler answered tentatively as he always did yyou dont think hes dead of course not now ive got to go out of town for a few days said shreck try and let me have a report when i get back i have the utmost confidence in you before dobbler the material fluttered in and out of focus concentrate he instructed himself man on the run no friends where does he go where can he go who would have him he had the files of data assembled by research in its first evaluation of the subject and his own psychological reports breathing heavily he began to shuffle through them bobs life in the years before his recruitment seemed comprised of two things his guns and his long walks through the ouachitas he was hiding from the world dobbler thought feeling himself unworthy of it the detritus of bobs life spoke of no warm personal relationships at least not outside of polk county his only friend was that crotchety old sam vincent whod helped him sue the magazine if he were alive he might eventually try to return to polk county and maybe to sam but now on the run where would he head there was no indication no sisters no brothers no old marine buddies no women not a thing the man was too much like some kind of exiled warrior achilles sulking in his tent came to mind to need companionship of any kind even the financial records uncovered by a credit agency confirmed this pattern clearly bob kept his finances in control by iron discipline he could live off his fourteenthousanddollar government pension because his expenses were low and he had no creature comforts no interest in clothes beyond their function no travel or diversion there was no record of what hed done with the thirty thousand dollars hed received from the magazine in his outofcourt settlement he had a credit card a visa from the first national bank of little rock but the reason seemed to be convenience he could make telephone purchases of reloading components and shooting supplies thus saving himself time and trouble writing up orders he bought his clothes from gander mountain wisconsin his powder from midsouth shooters supply and a couple of other places he lived to shoot thats all and dobbler supposed he shot to live would he run to shooters this was an alien world to dobbler so he tried to imagine it then he realized that from what little he knew of shooting culture thered be no place in it for bob those folks tended to be conservative rural americans theyd have no sympathy for a man whom they thought had winged a shot at the president of the united states which left him with in several hours of close scrutiny he came up with nothing he looked around it was late in the afternoon the place was quiet there were no answers anywhere he was ready to give it up maybe tomorrow hed notice and then he saw it he looked blinked squinted looked again it was so little it was so much nothing it couldnt be it was a telephone billing on bobs december visa bill a place called wilheits in little rock the phone number was given it seemed familiar he rifled through the credit report looking for the other visa bills and found nothing untildecember wilheits quickly he found december wilheits the bill was roughly the same seventyfive dollars what was wilheits he called the number and waited while at t shunted the connection through dialing stations and off satellites and the phone rang sounding far away and then was answered hello wilheits cn ah hep you was how dobbler heard the little rock accent er yes um what do you sell please whut do we sell said the voice yes what sort of establishment are you were a florist son we sell flowers ah said dobbler hanging up now who on earth would bob lee swagger be sending flowers to every december a christmas thing but bob wasnt a christmas sort of guy jack payne was not a happy camper like the other two men who had been in the room at the time he was haunted by the resurrection of bob lee swagger since then jack had stayed clear of the colonel knowing hed probably have to answer for the blown shot but how could it have been blown well someone on the team had said the damn silvertip probably didnt open up thats all so it just went on through and old bob fought his way through the shock and was up and running he was a marine see marines are tough no jack thought there was something else it was his own rotten luck with a handgun in truth he hated pistols thats why he carried the cutdown remington because almost was good enough with six gauge doubleoughts at your fingertips in vietnam once his first tour jack just a scrawny corporal he had been on the way to the shitter and looked up in horror as a gook came at him with a bayonet on an old french boltgun and sheer murder in his eyes jack had left his carbine somewhere and pulled a and squeezed off seven quick ones as the little man charged crazily at him he missed all seven missed them all fell to his knees and waited for the blade what happened next was that from thirty yards some guy with a grease gun cut the gook in two literally into two pieces and jack lived to fight another day but he hated that moment because he had pissed and shat in his pants as he went to his knees knowing he was finished and too weak to do anything hey corporal youd best git yourself a pair of diapers his ateam leader had said to him after the firefight and the whole goddamn team erupted in laughter thats what he hated the most the fury of the humiliation and thats when he swore hed never carry a handgun again and hed never humiliate himself again but now swagger had humiliated him twice thats all right payne had told himself ill get me another shot at you and this time ill put two three maybe all six doubleoughts into you motherfucker some of these kids on the team think youre some kind of bullgoose macho motherfucker some kind of supercracker a dixie boy full of piss and leather not me swagger doubleought cut you down to your rightful size real good then jack snickered remembering i already started having my fun with you i killed your fucking dog a thousand leads a thousand nothings the man had just vanished nick now more a glorified clerk than an actual federal investigating officer sat in the office for twelve hours at a stretch and watched every single lead dissolve into wisps every report fizzle every trace turn up counterfeit the other men didnt like to be seen talking to nick theyd deny it of course but he noticed that when he joined a knot of kibitzers on the rare down minutes one by one the guys would peel off and hed be stuck facing a blank wall only sally ellion always said hi because she was too pretty and popular to run any danger of career contamination she once even told him she was sorry he was having troubles im sure it wasnt your fault she said im sure it was he replied i heard that you might be going to another office yeah well not for a while not until this thing gets done they need bodies now somebodys got to wash out the damned coffee cups but ill probably be heading out maybe not such a bad thing new orleans hasnt really worked out ill get a start somewhere else i know youll do well nick she said wherever you go he smiled she was a nice girl meanwhile the office pool was running odds of eight to one that bob was dead no man could disappear so completely from the largest federal manhunt in history leaving no traces at all especially a man who as reports developed hadnt a friend in the world had no network of allies no organization no peers the complete and absolute loner but meanwhile nick clerked and cleaned for the firststringers bearing his humiliation with as much dignity as he could muster and maybe it was while he was washing out the coffee pot that he had his bright idea dont do this he said to himself you are in deep enough trouble already man they are going to eightysix your ass out of here if they catch you and its so unlike you to do anything at all contrary to official policy butit was such a good idea and like all good ideas it was simple he couldnt stop thinking about the man hed found cut to pieces in the motel three months before the roberto lopez shooting it struck him as something more than coincidental that the man was salvadoran as wally deaver had told him even if his credentials and the bureau idd him as an eduardo lachine of panama city panama but one man had seen lanzman that was deaver in boston back when hed been a dea agent at the bush drug summit in cartagena colombia in why not fax wally a morgue id of the stiff and that way find out if he tried to think of what it would mean if a salvadoran secret agent had been murdered in new orleans a few months before the assassination of a salvadoran archbishop unloved by his own countrys regime but it gave him a headache and he went back to work the general leaned forward proposing a toast his white teeth gleaming his eyes radiant with joy to our friend colonel raymond shreck a very great man a truly wonderful man he raised his glass which was filled with an expensive wine the general was a sleek smiling man named esteban garcia de rujijo and at thirtyeight through great ferocity in a multitude of hardfought campaigns he had become the commanding officer of the fourth battalion airranger first brigade first division atlacatl of the salvadoran army his unit was nicknamed los gatos negros or panther battalion for their jetblack berets thank you sir said shreck in spanish shreck eyes hooded wore his old uniform with ranger tabs special forces macv lightning patch his corcoran jump boots glossy black the trousers bloused into them he carried his green beret under his epaulet the uniform still fit perfectly and its creases were razors the combat infantry badge dominated a chestful of ribbons including the distinguished service cross and the purple heart and the silver star with two oak leaf clusters all of which were his shreck and the general and a third man sat at a dinner table in a large museum of a house on two thousand prime acres in the hills just north of the seaport city of acajutla in northern el salvador the house was not the generals at least not yet it belonged to another man also named de rujijo the generals father it had been owned by the de rujijos since the spanish had conquered the region in the third man who was sitting next to colonel shreck was a small merry elderly gentleman named hugh meachum formerly of the central intelligence agencys directorate of plans and since his rude retirement from the agency in a fellow at the buddings institute of foreign policy in washington dc if the general was el gato negro then hugh meachum a connoisseur of pipes and wines and ironies was el gorrión the sparrow the general is very pleased with you raymond said meachum he should be you certainly saved his bacon yes bacon said the general who had been educated first at el salvadors national military institute and then at the national war college in washington dc and the command and general staff college at fort leavenworth kansas it is not an easy thing to kill a priest said the general not even a communist priest the general believes that archbishop roberto lopez was a communist said meachum he truly does shreck knew this was the sort of thing that amused meachum meachum often privately marveled at the sheer barbarity of these people they were capable of anything and it took a great deal of skillful handling to prevent them from going hog wild they were capable of killing in the thousands the general had killed in the thousands a most excellent operation said the general muy excelente the world thinks that a crazy american tries to shoot the president of the united states and accidentally hits this pious bystander and nobody knows its really justice reaching out to kill a communist priest he had a pockmarked face and a dark mustache he was dressed in evening clothes including a red plaid cummerbund he wore a highpolish stainless steel colt mm delta elite in a shoulder holster shreck had noticed its ivory grips when the general had bent to pour the wine it was an expensive operation shreck said cheap whatever the cost and ohsovery necessary said hugh meachum that archbishop was going to get the panther battalion investigation opened again and he had the presidents ear too and how very very embarrassing for many people that would have been it was wonderful said the general tell me though colonel shreck the great shot that brought this communist priest down a great shot no a great shot yes said shreck who do you have who could make such a shot what a shot it is truly an amazing shot it was said shreck he himself wished he knew who hit that shot whoever he was the guy could shoot maybe better than bob lee swagger shreck looked over at meachum who only twinkled as if hed had a bit much to drink i would someday said the general lifting his wine consider it an honor to shake this mans hand so would i thought shreck we will convey your sentiments of course said hugh meachum it was muy excelente said the general perfecto number one shreck almost said yes except for the asshole who got away but meachum had warned him not to raise the subject the general was somewhat touchy shreck took a quick glance around the baronial dining room of the de rujijo estate outside in the twilight a vast garden undulated over rolling land down to a pond a perfect oval inscribed into the earth so that the setting sun would reflect dazzlingly off of it at twilight beyond was the jungle and beyond that the sea a gleaming band some two miles or so away you should know colonel shreck that for us it did not go perfectly oh said shreck but not to worry oh my said hugh meachum he took another sip of wine a traitor yes a traitor shreck nodded waiting thinking oh shit what now who learned of our arrangement and fled messy said hugh meachum very messy certain people will not be pleased not to worry the general repeated and why not sir asked shreck the traitor was betrayed himself he was hiding in panama when he finally thought it was safe he flew to new orleans to the fbi but we were waiting do you remember the wonderful electronic surveillance vehicle your organization provided to our intelligence service affirmative said shreck with this we tracked him we made certain it was our eduardo and we eliminated him in a manner that communicates to all who know of such matters our seriousness of intentions shreck nodded and now i drink said the general to my brave compadres and to the glorious future of our two nations hear hear said hugh meachum fuck you thought shreck the next morning waiting for the helicopter that would take him to the airport for the jet back to the united states shreck stood in the meadow before the great house and looked at the sea it was a gray day windy and moist with a chill in the air surprising for the tropics the chill made him think of the mornings in korea when hed been just a kid and all the times hed sworn in korea that no matter what happened to him hed never be cold again in the morning but he felt cold colonel you are all right it was general de rujijo now in his camouflages with his black beret the highpolish colt automatic hung in a shoulder holster under his left arm i am fine sir said shreck you look under the weather colonel no sir not at all good i have a little present for you from my very own archives he snapped his finger and an aide brought over a briefcase the general reached inside and pulled out a black plastic box that shreck recognized as a videotape cassette i record all my battalions operations said the general for training purposes this is a copy of the action on the sampul river you should find it educational how well our troops mastered their lessons shreck had an impulse to smash the mans skull in but he smiled grimly and took it from him i have many more said the general you may have that one yes sir thank you sir the general smiled with courtly dignity saluted and when shreck returned the salute he turned and walked away shreck looked at his watch the chopper was late nothing ever happened on time in this goddamned country colonel you seem especially morose today of course it was old hugh who was never quite as drunk as he seemed even if at eleven am he had a gin and tonic in his hand and a pinkish hue to his face that asshole just presented me with a tape of the sampul river job i guess the point hes trying to make is that were all in this together like it or not if he goes down the tape reaches somebody important and we all go down the general is a practical man it makes me sick that a motherfucker like de rujijo thinks hes got us he reminds me of some of those shitass gook generals in their fucking jumpsuits who made it out in seventyfive with a couple of hundred million bucks in the sack raymond ive always appreciated your tact you never say what you think do you i dont get paid to think mr meachum i didnt go to yale like you did we both know that of course not well the general the general has his uses hes a dreadful man a war criminal most certainly a great importer of la cocaína but he and he alone was not responsible for what happened with the panther battalion troops on the sampul river we made that mess too you colonel too you were there those were your trainers in the field and if we are to be responsible adults we must clean it up that didnt really satisfy shreck of course it was too easy we did what we did he said in perfect awareness of the consequences and the risks and the costs we did it because we believed in the long run it would save far more lives than it took indeed we did that after all is the sort of calculus they pay us for isnt it but that same principle extends to this last operation which you implemented so well in new orleans it costs us two men an intellectual bishop with a surprisingly intractable moralistic streak and a beatup war hero whos a complete gun nut if we dont use those men and somehow the archbishops will prevails and it comes out about panther battalion and who did what and why then the left and the right in this bloody little country will never ever get together there will be no treaty the fighting will go on the thousands will continue to die come on mr meachum thats not what worries you what worries you is that the lefties might win here even as communism is crumbling or has crumbled all over the world and weve kicked ass bigtime in the persian gulf thats what sticks in your craw the old man smiled one of his mischievous meachum smiles then faded behind a mask of remoteness well raymond believe what you will and for whatever reason you wish but agree with me on this one sound operating principle that this man swagger must be found and destroyed well get him speaking of which i had an idea the electrotek state of the art is it not you know it is it seems a shame to let it sit up in new orleans until the general figures out how to get it back through customs it occurs to me how very useful it might be to you in your quest jesus said the colonel yes i thought youd be pleased you see raymond even though you dont think so we do take care of our own we always have we always will and id destroy that tape if i were you i will said shreck looking at the goddamned thing in his hand chapter eighteen he drove through brightness there was brightness everywhere the sun was a blaze a flare the white sand picked it up and threw it back he drove squinteyed because he had no sunglasses he drove straight on because he did not want to stop to rent a room knowing his face was the most famous in america he lived on candy bars and twinkies and cokes from desolate gas station vending machines and thanked god he had had a couple of hundred bucks in his wallet he drove through the pain and the anger he just committed himself to driving and he drove now it was hot he was in desert the spindly cacti that played across the low rills looked as if they could kill him in some religious part of his brain they looked like crucifixes though of course he was not a catholic but some sort of baptist back when his daddy had been alive ahead the road was a straight shimmering band in the heat mirage rose off it in the light and dust devils swirled across it onward he drove he held right at seventy just five miles over the speed limit he was in his third stolen car a mercury bobcat but always before he stole a car he switched its plates with another vehicles that was an old trick hed heard about on parris island from some tough young black kid probably now long dead in vietnam it was strange from the long wet haul across the swamp hoarding cartridges hunting to live taking only the surest of shots then when he was down to his last he came across something like civilization he threw the gun away and nabbed a car and then a long eighteenhour driving stretch that brought him to desert ten hours in texas new mexico was shorter he was now in arizona texas was long past though it had been a long long stretch in texas he knew he was almost there and what was there maybe nothing maybe this was it but there was no other choice hed thought it out no no other place to go that would not get him caught because theyd be looking for him everywhere but here there was a chance he came over a rise a little town in the desert a spread of buildings with bright tin roofs glowing in the sun lay just ahead thered be some kind of law here too but he didnt care far off he could see the purple crests of mountains but for now just this spread of buildings in the desert he slowed the town came up fast ajo ariz the sign said pop he drove through shielding his eyes against the dazzle bank strip mall convenience store two gas stations one main drag what looked to be some tract houses where a lot of water had produced what passed for green a mcdonalds a burger king another gas station ajo elementary school and then yes finally sunbelt trailer park bob pulled in drove all this way for such a scruffy little place huh maybe a hundred trailers maybe a hundred palm trees it all looked the same to him he almost lost it right here at the end some pain fired up behind his eyes and his whole body felt itchy or patchy as if hed come down with a terrible skin disease the entry wound hurt something terrible a low throbbing against his nipple where the bullet had driven through him am i going to make it he wondered he drove up and down the little streets of trailers and saw people out of cartoons fat americans in shorts women with their hair in curlers lots of sullen rude little children i must look a sight he thought but nobody noticed they were all sunk into their own dramas then he saw her name on the mailbox followed by rn her profession he knew the address from memory all the letters had been returned unopened placed in a slightly larger envelope the flowers every december around the fourteenth she probably just threw them out she never sent a note of thanks yet she had never moved she had not changed her name or made any attempt to become who she wasnt she just wouldnt let him in he was the rotten past and it carried too much hurt bob looked at her place the trailer was shabby but well tended with trim little window boxes with flowers in them that was a womans gentle way the trailer was brown edged in white trim plastic neat very neat and suppose she was not home but the car was there what had to be her car and the name was hers just as he knew it would be suppose there was a man there why not she was a woman didnt there have to be a man but he didnt think there would be he turned off the engine and managed to lurch to the door he knocked hed never seen the woman before only her picture but when she opened the door he recognized her instantly hed always wondered what she looked like in the flesh all those times off in indian country looking at that picture she had been a young beauty then and now she was a notsoyoung beauty but she was a beauty the face was a little too tough some wrinkles but not too many the eyes behind reading glasses were gray and miles beyond any kind of surprise the hair was blond but just blond the lanky tall woman before him looked at him with eyes that stayed flat as the desert horizon she wore jeans and some kind of a pullover shirt and no makeup and had her hair pulled back in a short ponytail she held a book in her hand with a bright cover some kind of novel yes she said and he saw a little shock cross her face he had no idea what to say hadnt talked to women for years sorry he said sorry to bother you maam and sorry to look so bad my names swagger bob lee i knew your husband in the marines a finer young man there never was you she said and then again you a sudden grimace as she bit off the word he saw her tracking the details his scrubby face matted with dirt his filthy shirt with the blood stain now faded almost rosecolored the eyes bloodshot the rank smell of a man beyond hygiene she probably saw his absolute defenselessness too he knew he was simply throwing himself at her he felt himself begin to wobble my god you look awful well i got the whole damn government after me for something i never did ive been driving for twentyfour straight hours i came to you because she looked at him some more as if to say boy this had better be good because he said that he told you all about me in those letters well that was the best i ever was and if you believed what your husband said to you when he was in the middle of a war maybe youll believe me now when i tell you that what theyre saying about me isnt the truth and that i need help in the worst possible way now thats my piece you can let me in or you can call the police one way or the other at this point im not sure i could tell the difference she just stared at him will you help me mrs fenn i havent got another place to go or id be there she eyed him up and down finally she said you she paused i knew youd come when i heard about it i knew youd come he went in and she led him to her bed and threw back the cover and the sheets he collapsed ill move the car around back she said and that was the last thing he remembered as he slid under bob dreamed of payne he dreamed of that instant when hed seen solaratov fire and payne had said his name and hed turned and the gun muzzle exploded the bright flame lighting the room the noise enormous and the sensation of being kicked as the bullet drove through him he dreamed of his knees buckling and the terrible rage he felt at his own impotence as he hit the floor it played over and over in his head the flash of the shot the fall the sense of loss as he hit he had the sensation of screaming finally he awoke it was morning judging from the light he was freshly bandaged his arm in a tight sling against his chest he was clean too somebody had sponged him down he was undressed with his good hand he pulled the blanket close about him feeling even more vulnerable he blinked swallowed realized suddenly how thirsty he was his legs ached his head ached there was also a bandage on his arm and some pain yes hed been hit there almost forgot about it the details swam at him the punctured holes of the acoustic ceiling all neat and in rows some curtains and how the bright sun streamed through them from some sort of porthole the room he was in was small and dark except for the sunlights beam next to him on a table was a pitcher filled with ice water he raised himself and poured a drink and swallowed it in one long gulp how do you feel she had slid into the doorway oh well i feel like i might live a little bit how long have i its been three days jesus you slept you screamed you cried you begged whos payne you kept yelling about payne payne oh lets see a fellow that pulled a trick on me why do i think there arent too many men that have pulled tricks on you maybe not but hes one of them the papers say youre a psychopathic killer a crazy man with a rifle they think if youre not in new orleans youre in arkansas or dead some people think youre dead he didnt say anything his head ached i didnt kill the president the president i wouldnt kill the pres it wasnt the president didnt you listen to the radio maam ive been in a swamp for a week shooting one animal every two days to live in the cars hell i just drove well it wasnt the president they say you aimed at the president but you hit some archbishop i never missed what i aimed at in my life besides with that rifle and then he stopped thats what donny said and thats what i believe but they have evidence fingerprints the tests on the gun that sort of thing well maybe they arent as smart as they think they are maybe im not so far up the tree as they say a bishop my god you really dont know either that or youre the best liar ive ever seen i wouldnt shoot a priest i wouldnt shoot anything i havent shot to kill in more than a decade bob shook his head glumly shooting a priest he thought and then he thought thats what it was all about thats what it was always all about and then he thought and they had me birddog it for them figure out the best way work it out for them and then they used it against me for some priest then a thought came to him he took a deep breath say was there anything in the papers about my dog oh she said you dont know they killed him they say you killed your dog what they say and what happened are two different things he said but it hurt him that people could say such a thing of him he watched her watching him the bastards kill a great old dog like that oh the sons of bitches its amazing you are the most hunted man in america and your first question isnt about yourself but about a dog and when hes dead i can tell youre really upset that damned old dog loved me and i wish id been a better friend to him he never cut out but stayed to do his job he deserved more than he got so does everybody look you should get some rest what youve been through the physical stress the blood loss it would have killed most men i know some indians it wouldnt have killed but i dont know too many white men who could have gotten through it he slept again though this time without dreams when he awoke she was there too he ate a little then dozed off and the third time he awoke she was still there just staring at him what time is it time its tuesday thats what time it is you slept eighteen hours i dont feel as if ill ever walk again oh i think youll make it you were very lucky the bullet went right through you with very little damage you were smart enough to plug that entrance wound with a clump of plastic wadding that probably saved your life ive been pumping you full of penicillin to preclude infection what are they saying about me now oh theyve gotten around to the psychiatrists and the psychologists because they have no real news theres a lot of theorizing going on about motive your anger at your father for dying how that became your anger at the president your anger at not becoming a big hero like do i have the name right carl hathco hitchcock carl hitchcock yes things like that its just a lot of talk they dont know the first goddamn thing my daddy was a great hero and i never cared for medals he didnt and i didnt talks cheap youre certainly right about that sergeant he stared off bitterly the mention of his father unsettled him people had no right to bring his father into all this you cant let it get to you she said theyve turned it into a circus but they always do these days he looked back at her i have to thank you what youre doing its no i dont need thanks i knew in a split second you couldnt have shot at the president or that archbishop if that was in you donny would have seen it all the years back he would have sniffed it out bob couldnt look at her hearing such judgments put baldly into language had the weird effect of shrinking him he felt small and wan and selfconscious he had to tell her the truth if he told you i was some kind of hero let me set you straight i spent ten years drunk and i used to beat on the only woman who ever loved me but also i let myself slide into bitterness that was maybe the worst i let them get to me and make me less a man a puzzled look came across her face who oh you know who theyre always around smart boys have all the answers always telling you whats wrong and why what you done you should be ashamed of it but worst of all i was stupid i let some smart boys come into my life and turn me around real smart boys they knew all my weaknesses got real deep inside where i thought nobody could i dont know how they knew to get inside me like that turned me around made me a fool christ made me the most hated man in the country well now i seem to have survived all that and so now its my turn i need to stay until im better and stronger and have figured out another move im sorry to have brought all this trouble to your door no other door was open to me so im asking you please let me stay and mend a few weeks maybe a month and let me study on my problems figure what the next step is i cant give you much but thanks will you consider it she looked at him hard then her face lit up in a smile that just cracked him in two jesus she said its so nice to have a man around the house chapter nineteen newly promoted detective sergeant leon timmons was drunk and he was high he was sailing he was floating he felt so good hey payne hey damn boy we we got it made huh payne snorted they were in big sams on bourbon up on the stage a buxom woman shimmied to payne she looked like an animated piece of beef on a hook in a jersey warehouse damn timmons said damn boy she all girl eh payno shes all girl said payne shes a girl and a fuckin half wooooo said timmons his eyes lighting up like headlamps payne took a long swallow of dixie beer it was the only thing he liked about new orleans and he was glad to be just about out of new orleans somebody put another beer in front of timmons huh said timmons leon honey said the waitress gintlemin over thar said thanks to the man what almost shot the man what almost shot the president timmons raised the bottle in salute to his benefactors who appeared to be a crowd of dentists from dayton they applauded in the red wash of light from the overheads then went back to hooting at bonnie anne clyde and her smokings up there on the stage youre quite a hero said payne damn betcha you know payne aint yet heard whether old president whatshisname gonna have me up at the white house hell that old boy ought give me a ticket to the town with my name written all over it that he should said payne you saved his life man you stopped bob lee swagger from blowing him up and you almost nailed bob the nailer the great sniper himself thats right said timmons who by now pretty much believed hed actually fired the shot he told payne the story again in excruciating detail with a few embellishments thrown in payne listened dully finally timmons said you know i might even be the nra police officer of the year you ought to think about selling your story to the movies bub ahead of you there payno got me a agent already out in hollywood a very big guy we gonna make a potful of money you dont need no agent you already got a potful of money caint have too much money said payne aint no such thing as too much money ummm said payne timmonss eyes went back to bonnie anne clyde he licked his lips his face had the hard set of a man whod seen what he liked and liked what hed seen i believe you could get yourself that girl said payne seems to me she ought to be pleased to spend some time with the hero cop of new orleans who almost shot the man who almost shot the man who well you know i believe you are right said timmons with a selfimportant twitch of his head he beckoned the manager over quickly he told him what he wanted be right back the guy said whooo think im gone be in the hot spot tonight said timmons eagerly pussyorama leon wall to wall and floor to ceiling said payne the manager came back after bonnie left the stage to be replaced by miss suzie cue and her eightballs okay heres the deal he said she says yeah sure anything for detective sergeant timmons only thing is see she has the boyfriend mean nigger motherfucker so what she wants is um discretion quietude nothing to rile ben cause ben whack her upside the haid he catch her with another man okay said timmons so how we work it out back at midnight hes a fireman goes on duty at eleventhirty so you meet her out there she takes you to her crib you git your windshield wiper fluid changed but like good my friend ben aint the wiser she done bagged a celebrity and the old world just goes humptyhumping along oh i lak thet said timmons greedily you goan have a time said the manager a weaselly little ratman with a pencilthin mustache so payne and timmons sat through a couple of more sets trying to put the dixie brewery out of business or at least get it to working nights as if they were a pair of navy bosuns mates on shore leave for the first time since the sixties timmonss elaborate hair which bent in strange ways as it flowed off his ample heroic brow gleamed with mousse he was set for a big night meanwhile payne just sat there sinking into himself further by the time it was nearly midnight timmons was extremely drunk payne got up pointed to his watch and timmons lurched obediently to his feet bulling his fat and sloppy way over all set he said hornily then lets go big guy said payne pulling him down the narrow aisle and out to bourbon the street had filled it looked like party time in hell college kids from ole miss northern tourists large groups of sailors a few aristocratic types in blue blazers and khakis with their sallow nearly fleshless women in tow all seethed and bucked along the narrow concourse there was smoke everywhere up and down the street lines had formed some to get into the strip joints or the transsexual shows some to buy tshirts in the dinky souvenir shops some to get into the fancy restaurants like antoines or arnauds a few disconsolate wallflowers peered down from the balconies overhanging the scene now which way we go asked payne surveying the turmoil i cant believe im skulking around to avoid riling some big nigger shoot said timmons no sense gittin the boy upset when his old lady be handing out the sweets for free maybe you wanta little old taste after i finish how long you be maybe twenty seconds haw i can ride a mare like that half the damn night well thanks ill pass number two in the saddle aint for me they ambled through the raucous crowd were jostled by sailors payne hated sailors from the army where you were supposed to hate sailors and he sort of felt like a fight he wanted to drive one of his fat fists into the dumb girlish face of some aviation candidate over from pensacola and watch the boy collapse spitting blood and teeth but he just pushed on the night was blue the moon was full over the low pastel buildings of the quarter it reminded him of a jungle city felt like saigon no gooks though lots of niggers lots of fatboys and pretty girls lots of action no gooks he remembered the sense of war and doom and whatthehellwedietomorrow joy that he had so loved when he was a lean and dangerous young forces sergeant in the nam floating on amphetamines just back from a long crazed month or so in the fuckin boonies taking frontals payne sighed swept by melancholy the whole world seemed to be here on bourbon coursing down the narrow street all hot to trot seething to get fucked except for him he stood apart jack payne was different he did the hard things next to him timmons was aquiver with sexual tension it was said that he could visit any brothel in new orleans and have himself serviced mightily so friendly and helpful was he to certain people but there were always new experiences and sensations so he was all hotted up she a girl and a half he said again she sure is said payne now where the hell we goin up here turn right then behind the restaurant you turn left and we head down the alley shell be in back where the dancers park you sure know this town know it well that i do said timmons almost singing with anticipation he was a happy man the crowd thinned as they turned off bourbon down toulouse and then saw the alleyway a small gap just the width of a car between the old brick buildings they turned into it it smelled of old garbage and piss up ahead however there appeared to be something of an altercation it was difficult to make out but it looked as if a large black male was beating on a small white male i do believe said jack payne that thats a crime isnt it oh shit said timmons he reached under his jacket and from the highhip holster withdrew the famous beretta and advanced at a coplike gait yelling halt police goddammit boy yall stop that payne watched him go with something that wasnt quite sadness for he truly detested timmons but out of some sense of camaraderie the two had shared a lot after all and each had come to recognize the other as a man who walked the same side of the street goddamn i say stop shouted timmons he fired a shot into the air and then rushed in harder a little surprised that the black man hadnt cut and run as was customary he stopped short when he saw that the black man had a pistol of his own which had come from nowhere now wha timmons began when the first bullet hit him in the throat and the second a split second later under the left eye they were onlys from some piece of junk that wouldnt shoot accurately over ten feet the range was seven timmons died clawing at the small hole in his face which spurted blood like a broken pipe the black man ran by jack payne pausing only to wink it was morgan state as he was called from the unit paynes second in command a great shot a cool hand with a lot of incountry time behind him good man in a gunfight then he was gone the tourist was crying and bleeding from the beating but otherwise unhurt as had been the plan for an innocent witness was the fulcrum the sirens began howling and in a few minutes the first cop car would be here payne melted into the dark she had brought the magazines all the newspapers everything that she could find or acquire in ajo without making a big fuss it was ten minutes into the reading that bob found the mention of mikes death there it was in print somehow that made it official bob put the magazine down slowly and stared out the window he could see the bright desert light the hot flat blue of the sky an endless cruelty of needles spangling the low rills he just sat there most of the morning mourning mike and trying to figure who would kill him then of course he had it to get his rifle from the trailer of course theyd have to shoot mike mike wouldnt have let them in he would have stayed on station come hell or high water and if they drugged him that would leave traces he read the sentence again evidently aware that after his deed he couldnt return to care for the dog swagger shot the animal once in the head with a gauge shotgun and buried it in a shallow grave all right he thought feel sorry for him later you have some work to do but the pain of it amazed him he realized in a tiny part of his mind hed been harboring some kind of illusion until now he saw himself back at the place and old mike come up to nuzzle him to press his sloppy jowl against him and gaze up with those dumb adoring eyes all right he thought you killed my dog now i got some work to do so that i can settle up he read slowly without hurry each article from the earliest julie had been able to find which meant the most inaccurate to the very latest nothing showed on his face he sat on his bed and read it all straight through then he read it again he saw himself laid bare penetrated turned inside out he was fair game for them all everybody had a theory an idea a notion he realized he was no longer his own property his private self had been taken from him forever they had it right but wrong too terribly wrong they were looking at him from such a twisted angle swaggers navy cross bespeaks his aggressive nature and his reckless will to kill and precurses the tragic events of march time said it was the second highest award his country could give him and hed saved a hundred lives those two days in the an loc valley they made it seem like a crime violence is inbred in the swagger clan his father earl swagger destroyed three machine gun nests one morning on iwo jima and returned to violent encounters in law enforcement climaxing in a bloody shootout where he killed two men but died himself off highway near fort smith they turned his old daddy who only did his duty to country and state into some kind of mentor in murder nothing about the lives his dad had saved in giving up his own against jimmy and bub pye that terrible evening there was a paragraph recounting his lawsuit against mercenary magazine which had put a picture of him on the cover and called him the most dangerous man in america it told how sly old sam vincent had shaken thirty thousand dollars out of their pockets and warned all those gungho books to stay the hell away but then time dryly remarked it is doubtful that swagger could win his case today he shook his head at all this wondering what could twist people so where do these people come from how do they learn things like this is there a school that teaches them what gives them the damned right to just take over your life and bend it any which way they please they hadnt missed a damn thing theyd pried everywhere the inside of his trailer was photographed his books were listed the writers found it amusing that among the loading manuals and the classic works on rifles and shooting such a violent man had poetry by siegfried sassoon wilfred owen and robert graves though it was noted that the works were only bitter war poetry there was his gun rack in loving detail the weapons cataloged and judged by reporters who seemed disappointed to discover that he had no assault rifles as they called them his rifle range was diagrammed his two victories in the arkansas state ipsc championships were probed and he saw schematics of the shot he had supposedly taken in new orleans from st ann into louis armstrong park the madness of that second was broken down and analyzed its physics and ballistics choreographed in infinite detail its trajectories laid out in dotted lines to little xs that marked the strike of the bullet all of it convincing all of it wrong he saw stills drawn from the videotape of what went on at the podium the fall and twist of the man hed supposedly hit the archbishop of whom hed never even heard the completeness of it blew him away theyd been so careful theyd set it up so perfectly and worst of all theyd known him so well not these damn reporters who didnt know a thing but them the agency boys whoever they were theyd known him perfectly it was as if theyd lived his life or gotten in his brain you look so hurt she said these people they knew so much about me he said its scary how careful they were not that they took the time but that they knew so much they knew how my mind would work he thought back to the moment when hed been truly hooked when they came up with a trophy he couldnt say no to the russian sniper solaratov who he now realized probably didnt exist it was so perfect they knew how desperate hed be then he discovered from newsweek that the guy hed jumped coming out of the house on st ann street was named nick memphis and he was from the fbi now here was something that twisted in his imagination memphis memphis whered he heard that damn name before it hung there tantalizing him until he remembered after a bit memphis was the joker in tulsa whod missed and hit some woman his was the archetypal botched shot the sniper who fouled up and he bob back in maryland had recreated the whole thing in front of the fancy boys while they were gulling him along with their accutech stuff he wondered if this memphis were a part of it then he remembered the stunned surprise of the man the slack dumb look on the wide face his squirming the easy way the mil came out of the holster when he reversed on him and he doubted it if he were one of what bob thought now merely as them he guessed that this nick memphis would have been ready and waiting besides he wouldnt have left his car with the door open and the key in so helpfully there right outside on st ann street there was a picture of the guy a blurry thing snapped out front of the new orleans fbi headquarters agent memphis who missed collar hurries to car the caption said it was the same man equally disturbed this time with a grave and somewhat embarrassed look to his face you screwed up and now these people are going to nail you for it you screwed up almost as big as i did he thought bob read on looking for answers but there were only more questions chapter twenty here i am nick thought in arkansas he was sitting around the temporary bull pen in the mena arkansas holiday motel wading through the oceans of paperwork that attended the task forces relocation from new orleans to polk county yet at the same time managing not to grieve too overwhelmingly for the passing of leon timmons dropped by a mugger in a new orleans alley two days or so ago he wished it didnt please him so and he wished the publicity hero cop slain in freak crime would go away because his own incompetence was a part of the story you sure you didnt smoke poor leon there nick asked the ever mischievous hap fencl you know in blackface with a little throwdown gun the others had laughed they couldnt mourn the braying timmons either whod made the bureau look so bad but nick just smiled grimly and stayed on station as the operations prime goat outside the window the green and thunderous ouachitas rippled away toward oklahoma in the late afternoon sunlight he returned to his document a witness sighting report from the new mexico state police a motorist claimed hed seen bob the nailer big as life tooling down the highway in an merc that was the common element in the sightings as if bob would be so bold to bull on through in broad daylight sure his courage and his determination would get him through these people were imprinting their own sense of bob on ambiguous events and coming up with the strangest stuff the phone rang across the room and somebody else got it hey nick its for you nick turned to the phone nick memphis nick its wally deaver a little burst of excitement went off in nicks chest wally christ how are you you got the pictures yeah said wally and nick didnt like the tone in his voice its not him he asked quickly thats not the guy you talked to in cartagena thats not eduardo lanzman of the salvadoran national police shit nick thats the terrible thing of it i wish i could say one way or the other i wish i could just tell you buti dont know i was only with eduardo during the meetings which lasted maybe a day or so two days max and a bunch of us went out to dinner had a few drinks i cant say i knew him well we exchanged cards you know the way cops do now these pictures yeah nick death doesnt do anybody any favors maybe this is the same guy maybe it isnt it could be it might be maybe it is butmaybe it isnt you didnt have the passport photo it didnt look a goddamned thing like him what about any corroborating evidence nothing it all checked out at least as near as we can tell you know i cant get budget to go down there and the salvadorans they say they dont know him at all except that this is through our formal liaison with them which is run by the state department which means its got to go through so many layers yeah thats why i bailed out nick so many layers look nick to be fair its a pretty dead horse without corroborating evidence i mean in good conscience i couldnt go before a grand jury and yeah sure i understand great but tell me this it could be just maybe just somehow at the outside okay nick yeah yeah it could be great wally but nick dont bet your career on it sure said nick i wont but he realized he already had she was rebandaging him you must be a very tough guy sergeant swagger looks to me like there isnt a weapon made they havent tried out on your hide youre a oneman proving ground they had some fun with me maam i count what four gunshot wounds old gunshot wounds that is as opposed to the two new gunshot wounds which resulted in three holes the hole total comes out to five six youre a piece of swiss cheese sergeant i was only hit three times twice the first tour none the second then the bad one the bullet in the hip that ended the third tour they had to glue and wire the whole gizmo back together again dont know how they did such a thing i thought i was set for the wheelchair my whole life and that one old hole isnt a bullet what is it youre not going to believe this its from a curtain rod oh now theres a new weapon your wife i presume and ill bet you gave her very good reason he laughed my aunt my mothers sister a sweet woman i was helping her in the farmhouse i was eight she lost her balance and the curtain rod she was hanging fell and she fell on top of it and it went through my side it didnt hurt much bled a lot didnt hurt much ill bet that was before my daddy died the year before it was a happy year i remember now let me ask you how long before you think ill be able to get out of here the longer im here the more danger im putting you in another few weeks dont worry the neighbors have seen men live here before ive been around the block a few times myself he just nodded blankly this didnt please him though he didnt want to face it how long has it been she said since when he wondered you dont even know what its called anymore you know with a woman woman female oh that i dont know a month a year ten years not ten years more than a year im not sure you could live without it that easily i had other things to keep me busy i dont believe you he paused considering it i didnt want the complications someone said simplify simplify ann landers no he said earnestly it was some old guy called thoreau he went and lived by himself too as i understand it anyway i wanted to simplify no wants no needs no hungers only rifles crazy as hell now that i think of it so you went off and became henry thoreau of walden arkansas julie said i was at my best with a rifle in my hand i always loved rifles so i decided to live in such a way that the rifle would be all i needed and i succeeded were you happy up there in your trailer in the mountains without any people i didnt know it then i suppose now that i was i was raised and then trained not to think a lot about how i feel it was twilight of the third day since hed been awake the sun suffused the room with an orange glow the quality of light was almost liquid and held everything it touched in perfect serenity her face had acquired a grave look in this fantastic light and he loved the way she had of slyly making him see how ridiculous he could be she seemed like some kind of angel to him so radiant a savior that he could not hold her strong gaze and instead looked out the window to where the mountains stood like a savage old bears teeth on the rim of the earth he remembered looking at her picture in the boonies donny always had it with him why is it men like you always have to be so alone she asked why do you want to live by yourself and contrive situations under which you can go against everybody to prove how smart and tough and brave you are bob had no answer you see you make it so terrible for us she said for the women because normal men want to be like you they learn about you from movie versions of you and they try for that same laconic spirit that hemingway stoicism they manufacture themselves in your image but they dont have the guts or the power to bring it off so they just exile themselves from us pretending to be you and to have your power and we can never reach them are you aware that donny was scared every single day he was so scared he was no hero he was a scared kid but he believed in you it doesnt matter if he was scared he did his job that made him a man that made him as much man as there is id rather have a little less man who is alive now and could sleep with me and be father to the children i never had and never will have his being a man didnt do me a hell of a lot of good its the same craziness that makes these poor indian boys cut each other up on saturday night what do they get out of it i wonder it cant be explained he said it can be foolish as all getout yes maam it doesnt make much sense but i was just taught to hurt no man except the man who hurt me and mine i have no other star to steer by that and to do my duty as i understand it if i followed those two rules id be okay it was so quiet youd have thought it was the last second before a nuclear bomb was to go off ending life on this earth but instead through the metal walls of the trailer there came the shriek of a child something came into her eyes and onto her face that hed never seen before it was pain and i suppose the joke is none of us care about that kind of man the kind that you want to be what we want is the kind that would stick around and be there the next morning mow the grass bring home a paycheck that kind of man and i see how funny that is now she said her anguish suddenly palpable you come in here and i care for you patch you up and hide your car and get myself so deep into this i can never ever get out and never ever have a normal lifeand you dont care you have to go off and be a man after a time he said i didnt just come here because i had to i came because i wanted to a long time ago in vietnam when donny fenn showed me his young wifes picture i had a moment where i hated him for having such a woman waiting for him a part of me wanted him not to make it and wanted to have you for me but that passed when i saw what a damn fine boy he was and how he deserved the very very best and he had it i see that now she touched him a woman hadnt touched him in years really touched him so that he could feel her wanting in it maybe no woman had ever touched him like that it had been many years what do you want from me sergeant she asked i dont know he said it makes going back to it hard truth is i never ever stopped thinking about that picture and the fine woman donny fenn had waiting for him thats why you kept writing i suppose it is and youd just send em back unopened i knew if i opened them i was lost are you lost now no i dont suppose so i know where im headed i cant stop it straight into catastrophe and i dont even want to stop it he drew her to him in the kiss there was an extraordinary sense of release he felt himself sliding away down a drain surrounded by warm urgent healing liquids he thought hed slide until he died he was also overwhelmed by smoothness everything about her was smooth she was smooth everywhere hed never imagined that a person could be so smooth the explosion so long in coming seemed to build until it could not be held back and bucked out of him in a series of emptying spasms he was falling through floors toward solid earth each one halting him for just a splinter of a second and then he fell through to another one and then another he fell and fell and fell stunned at the distance of the fall and how far it took him from himself my god he said oh my god she said the days passed she was on the day shift and during it he stayed in the trailer and read what she had brought him from a trip to seven bookstores and every newsstand in tucson he told her to get everything and she did he read it all the events of two weeks then three weeks then four weeks ago he read about the kennedy assassination about other famous assassinations he made copious notes and worked steadily trying to find a line through the material when he learned that the hero policeman of new orleans leon timmons had been killed in one of those stupid pointless urban accidents shot by a mugger during an attempt to prevent a crime it didnt surprise him he just breathed heavily timmons had been a link of course he had to die these boys were sealing themselves off leaving no possible leads into their organization they were pros this bothered him but it also relieved him it meant he didnt have to go back to new orleans for now there was nothing in new orleans but where would he go he didnt yet know one night nbc news did a special on it he taped it on her vcr taking notes he watched it over and over the diagrams the interviews the speculations but particularly he watched that terrible moment when the bullet came shrieking out of nowhere and seemed to blow the president from his feet while it had really just been the force of the other man the archbishop roberto lopez who had gone into him as the bullet opened in him and destroyed his brain bob thought it was a great shot over twelve hundred yards from that damn church steeple shooting into a very complicated sight picture no matter how good his scope shooting at a downward angle lots of problems to solve and you solved them all oh my oh my but youre a good boy he thought not but five maybe six men in the world could hit a shot like that or have the perfect confidence to risk everything on making it bob realized the shooter was the key the whole plan all the elaborate seduction of himself the manipulations the subterfuge all of it rested only upon the fragile vessel of confidence that this shooter could make that shot hell of a shot bob thought he thought of the man up there in that steeple behind the louvers just waiting just gathering himself could i have made that shot bob wondered he wasnt sure it was right at the very edge of what he could do with a rifle whoever he was he was a shooter bob remembered the superb neckturneds hed run through his rifle when they were gulling him on in that accutech thing in maryland those were precisionmade rounds everything else about accutech was a con but the rounds were the real thing whoever made them knew how to sling a cartridge together for worldclass longrange accuracy it wasnt something many men knew it took you into the realm of micromachining of tolerances so fine most tools wouldnt register them of actions worked like the inside of watches of rifle barrels so polished and perfect they were jewels themselves almost it was a rarefied part of the shooting world again only a few dozen men in the world knew it and the rifle itself where do you get a rifle so tight that you can count on it to send a grain caliber into say four inches from twelve hundred yards youre talking about minute of angle at over half a mile he knew a master gunsmith could build a rifle technically capable of such a thing if a human could be found to get all that could be gotten out of it then he remembered the model hed fired at the accutech place the last one late in the day when hed fired the exercise that had more or less been the duplicate of donnys death with a model he still yearned for a rifle with a stock so dense and rigid it felt as if it was manufactured from plastic and an action so slick and a trigger so soft you could breathe on it to make it fire he remembered number that was such a rifle there couldnt be but one or two or three or four out of the millions of model s that winchester made that were that fine who would own such a rifle then he remembered that somebody told him a man had won a bunch of thousandyard championships with that rifle and as he thought he began to puzzle the one aspect that had so far evaded him the piece that was somehow wrong it was the bullet if they were going to hit the archbishop theyd have to assume the police would recover the bullet and that the bullet would have the imprint of the bore it had been fired down as irrevocable as a fingerprint they couldnt know the bullet would be mangled that was a one in a thousand chance why wouldnt this perturb them it would screw up their entire plan when the bullet didnt match the bore in bobs rifle the whole ruse would collapse somehow theyd figured a way to beat it somehow he had figured a way to beat it the bullet he thought the mystery of the goddamn bullet just as tantalizing in its way as the famous kennedy assassination mm that had passed through one mans body another mans chest and wrist and yet was undamaged and unmistakably bore the imprint of lee harvey oswalds bore it was as if the two mysteries were mirror opposites of one another or different sides of one coin but they had bullets he thought they had bullets from my rifle hed provided them with sixtyfour bullets fired from the bore of his rifle in maryland he sat back bob shhh bob what are he held up a hand to quiet her then it was gone dammit what oh i then he had it it might be possible hed never heard of anyone doing it and there was no reason for anyone to do it butyes it was possible you dig a fired bullet out of the sand scored with the imprint of a bore but otherwise pristine and possessing the same ballistic integrity as a new bullet you can reload that bullet into a h h magnum shell a much longer shell with a much greater powder capacity and therefore a much longer range youd have to protect the bullet somehow and this puzzled him until he remembered an old technique called paperpatching by which a fellow could wrap a bullet in wet paper before he loaded it on a shell the paper would harden and form a sort of protective sheath the trick was you had to fire it down a slightly larger bore maybe a but even that was so simple rebarrel the rifle with a custom bore and refire bobs bullet down the bore the paper patching protects the ballistic signature then burns off in the atmosphere bobs bullet fired from this other rifle arrives to do its terrible damage oh you were a smart boy he thought butif you were so smart how come i had to birddog it out for you i was your legs wasnt i that was part of it i wasnt just there to be used as a dupe but i did the thinking the seeing the planning why why couldnt you do it why couldnt you go to the sites yourself and see what i saw one day he drove to tucson and concealed behind his new beard and sunglasses stopped in a rummy old gun and pawn store in the mexican section of the town didnt even look at the rifles that were on the wall but went on and found in the back as usually these places have a big pile of old gun magazines guns ammo and shooting times a long though tattered run of the american rifleman the mags were of little use to him being far too full of pictures of new guns but there was one that was useful accuracy shooting which was about benchrest shooting those boring technocrats who worked on rifles so fine they could throw bullets in the same hole all day long he himself had subscribed since the late seventies but these were earlier from the midsixties benchresting was the r d lab of all shooting if you were at all serious about the game you had to bank your time at the loading bench and the shooting bench all other things stemmed from it if his boy learned his stuff anywhere he learned it in benchresting the magazine he learned had begun as the newsletter of the first american benchrest shooters club which started up in the early fifties in upstate new york following on the work of men like warren page harvey donaldson and p o ackley in the twenties and thirties they were loaded with tabular matter with long and dreary accounts of shooting matches of years ago obscure names of great shooters and obsolete calibers like the and the sharpe and hart he bought them all and that night he began to read them when hed read them all he found more and read them too he haunted the secondhand shops looking for old copies when he found them he read them looking for something but what it was he couldnt say ill find you you old bastard he thought for he assumed his quarry was old only old men could shoot like that for its a dying skill not practiced by the young much there was only one younger man who could have made that shot but he was an illusion bob tried to put it out of his mind because it spoiled things for him its not t solaratov he said to himself its not it cant be in the evenings they made love they made love for hours sometimes he felt like a piston that just kept on going and finally several times after hed fallen through the last of his floors and lay there as if every atom in his body was at rest he felt himself yielding to the fatigue he couldnt move a thing god she said you must have saved up all that time at walden pond he snorted i seem to be doing okay ill say she said they lay there breathing their way back to earth the terror of her was that she carried in her the seed of possibility in her he saw an alternate life it occurred to him that he didnt have to live in solitude hating the world and that he didnt have to give himself to his rifles like some kind of mad jesuit didnt have to live in a little trailer off in the misty mountains and face each visitor with mistrust the world was full of things that could be he had a flash of them together somewhere just enjoying each other no complications somehow it had to do with water he saw them at a beach maybe myrtle beach south carolina or maybe outside biloxi or galveston or some such anyway sand water sun and nothing else in the world what are you thinking of she asked you almost had a smile on your face what was it he knew if he told her he was lost there would be no turning back from the softness he lay there and the temptation to give in rose and rose in him he wanted to let it swallow him up he could feel himself disappearing in the wanting something from the marines thats a lie she said sure i was thinking how much i like this its a life i could love but i have to tell you squareup maybe it was a mistake maybe it costs me too much or gives me too much to hold on to i have to be able to let go of things its like im bargaining i have to be able to walk away from the deal at any time elsewise i can never win i have to be willing to die at any time or i cant ever win any man in a war will tell you that you must be willing to give up your life at any chance if youre thinking about whats at home you lose your edge she looked at him with those gray calm eyes i was right i knew give me a taste then pull away go off on your crusade she almost laughed i wish i could hate you bob you are a true and deep son of a bitch but hating you would be like hating the weather no point to it at all im sorry there was never a better time it was the best it was special another time or two and id never leave no thats a lie youd leave i know your type you always leave youre right he said id leave i have to she found this one a laugh you are a bastard bob nodded not much passed on his grave face when i think it has to be tomorrow so soon yeah its time ive got some ideas ive got something of a plan even i just never thought it would be so soon the sooner i leave the sooner i come back youre lying again bob youre not coming back youll be dead in a week more than likely he said its a shaky plan but its the only one i could come up with but first ive got a couple of things to do and whatre they she said trying to show no pain ive got to dig up my cache in the mountains where ive got thirty thousand dollars and some guns stashed so i can pay my own way and defend myself and then he said ive got to bury my dog chapter twentyone shreck never walked through doors he exploded through them like a grenade blowing them nearly off their hinges as he blasted through bent forward his gait rocksteady and determined dobbler looked up at the noise and shreck was already on him having crossed the ten feet from threshold to desk front in about a half a second and no more than two paces colonel shreck i feeling rousted as if by a bull on a snap inspection dobbler made a clumsy attempt to rise but the stern man motioned him down impatiently im running late dobbler i just got in my god colonel are you all right tired exhausted jet lag you really should take your shoes off and walk barefoot on the carpet and doctor id asked you to consider swaggers disappearance can you summarize your thoughts for me of course of course said dobbler nonplussed shreck had never crashed into his office before almost always he served at shrecks summons dobbler began to babble through his discovery of the strange florists bill in little rock his initial dead end when he learned that the florist kept no records and his latest initiative which was to ask one of the technonerds in research to run a computer search through the memory of the ftd databank if he could get into the system in hopes of locating that elusive destination to which bob had dispatched his flowers but halfway through he realized that shreck wasnt focusing thats very promising but i want some feeling of whats going on in his head whats he going to do oh said dobbler somewhat taken aback at being denied the compliment he expected well payne says the fbi has now moved its base of operations to arkansas his home area they believe hell head there what do you think oh he will said dobbler vaguely why do you believe that because he has to do what we expect and still beat us dobbler smiled thats really whats going on now bobs vanity his desire not merely to survive but to triumph to punish us for our delusion of superiority he must now prove to us who is the alphamale shreck nodded intently suppose the fbi takes him alive what will he be able to tell them ah i doubt he will be taken alive hes in a very volatile state the pressures on him are incredible he but if he is if he is it may make him insane they wont believe him of course the trap is too tight too well constructed it may actually destroy his mind i dont know if he can function under those circumstances shreck followed this carefully then he said all right good thats very helpful why thank you colonel shreck said dobbler pleased its good to have a harvard man on the staff dr dobbler because i can count on you for consistency you are full of shit always completely thats a gift dobbler dobbler was stunned i you stupid asshole dont you know a thing about how mens minds work or swaggers kind of man dont you see the fucking joke in this you see we planned his death but maybe we gave him his life we have engaged him he is back among the living and hes got himself a war to fight and all his skills and talents may be fully deployed thats the terrible thing the longer this goes on the more he enjoys it the stronger he gets and hell love it he should pay us for it were giving him more fun than hes had since the war it was morning of the last day she got up at four and made breakfast so that it was ready when he awoke at five but he wanted to make love so soon after last night and what she had thought would be the last time so the breakfast waited it tasted wonderful when they got to it then he showered and she dressed his wounds jesus but arent you a studpuppy she said ive never seen multiple trauma gunshot recovery so fast the arm wound was the ugliest a raw welt at the outside of his left bicep about three inches above the elbow but it was just bruised and burned meat that would eventually heal without complication the entrance and the exit wounds to the chest had resolved themselves into quartersized scabs that would ultimately pucker into scar tissue it doesnt hurt i can handle it i just bet you can bob had let his beard stay he was a tall sunburned man with a thick shock of blondbrown hair and a powerful chest his eyes were hard and small his mouth was a jot of concentration he was a man in blue shed gone into a gap store in a mall in tucson and bought with cash three pairs of blue jeans and three pairs of black jeans waist length and ten blue denim work shirts and had washed them all shed also gotten a pair of brown nocona boots size double a width and two dozen pair of white socks at the pickandsave it was all loaded in a duffel bag in the back of his stolen car bob bob took a last swig of coffee you know you could just stay here in time wed move we could always be a jump ahead of them a small smile came over his taut features sure but i wont you know if i could walk in right now and say to them hey youve got the wrong boy and they take a look at some things theyve missed and say damn swagger youre right i still wouldnt do it because that just means im off the hook and thats not enough i got some idea what its like to live with debts to pay and no way to pay them well this time i do mean to pay them in full he turned looking at her obliquely and she saw an odd and powerful light in his eyes she saw too that he was no longer the man hed been a month ago that desperate bloody halfcrazy fugitive whod arrived on her doorstep she didnt know this man this was the bob that donny had loved so focused you felt his power even now sitting in the bedroom as he buttoned up his shirt now he scared her a little julie you listen here when im gone i want you to scrub down every surface in this house with ammonia because its the only thing that will take off fingerprint oils throw out all your dishes and glasses and silverware now you know what you have to do yes she said run through it again tell me in five days i drive four hours in any direction to any pay phone i can find then i call long distance to uh the number is threethreeone fourfivetwo sixseveneightthree and i do my lurleen accent low trashy the kind of girl elvis used to pick up in tupelo bars before the ed sullivan show he smiled then i ask for memphis agent memphis yes theyll test you theyll ask you what the dogs name was and it wasnt pat like they put in the papers it was mike i wasnt hit once like they said but twice youll have to tell them that i know all that then i tell him what you told me yes then i hang up and drive away how long on the phone no more than two minutes dont forget to stop and have lots of change for the phone you should have at least ten dollars in quarters all right then you drive back here i cant begin to think theres a chance in hell theyd ever track you you dont know about me you never heard about me i dont exist nobody will know and then the fun part she said bitterly you get killed the fbi kills you in some little arkansas roadhouse maybe but i have a few cards up my sleeve oh bob the sun was coming over the eastern rim of the desert now and it bled through the sky for just a moment the room itself seemed soaked in blood blood everywhere red and glinting and wet and black but blood most of all in the narrow eyes of bob lee swagger she shuddered and tried to think of other things nick it was howard and he didnt sound pleased uh yes howard would you come in here please sure nick left the bull pen and headed into the little office out of which howard was running the operation nick howard did not ask him to sit down not a good sign nick just what is it youve been doing ah well you know mainly monitoring the reports on bobs movements as theyre routed here from washington and coordinating with the local officers and keeping contact with our surveillance teams sited in the area and monitoring the readiness of our quickreact teams you know howard trying to stay alert and keep our readiness high and ive just had a very irate call from ben prine in dc the head of cointelpro yes he says a request originated from this office concerning access to bureau files on a private security firm called ramdyne over my authorization i didnt authorize anything do you know about this nick wasnt an adept liar a tide of phlegm rose in his throat and he was stunned at his own sudden loss of confidence and clarity of thought it was only to save you time howard i know youve got your big picture to worry about so i just routed the request through your office with your nameuh its just a kind of he ran out of words howard glowered at him what do you think youre doing nick what game are you playing nick bumbled into a confused account of his investigation of the eduardo lanzman affair the source whod told him lanzman was salvadoran his idea that a hightech electronic eavesdropping van may have been used his clumsy discovery of the mysterious ramdyne firm that seemed to have a line on such expensive equipment he rambled on semicoherently about the coincidence of a salvadoran agent maybe being killed by the salvadoran secret police only weeks immediately before the suspiciously accidental murder of a salvadoran archbishop despised by certain elements of his own regime but he saw that he wasnt making much progress with howard i tried all the usual channels and came up with nothing like nothing so i tried to show some initiative and he trailed off lamely nick said howard a deep sadness coming over his bland face im very disappointed in you why didnt you come to me with all this well howard actually um i did and you said nick we have an openandshut case on bob lee swagger we have means motive and opportunity we have some circumstantial ballistics evidence we have witnesses including i might add yourself nick what on earth are you doing whose side are you on howard theres something ive been meaning to tell you about the ballistics im wondering if its technically possible to all right nick this is how things fall apart junior agents running around on their own not reporting to authority unauthorized leaks to the press its the beginning of the end of bureau discipline which is the beginning of the end of the bureau howard i ramdyne youre right is very connected to our cousins in langley among half a dozen other secret agencies they do a lot of things we cant afford to do officially sometimes these things dont look so good sometimes theyre ambiguous sometimes they do little bad things to prevent big bad things their secrets are very closely held if you pick at them or uncover something out of context it can lead you exactly where you shouldnt go and cause all kinds of problems for all kinds of people do you understand that yes sir nick youre not supposed to see the big picture other people do that youre supposed to do the jobs we give and do them well let us connect the dots you catch the crooks yes sir nick it pains me to do this id thought perhaps after your screwups in the past youd turned over a new leaf and i might have been tempted to forego your suspension but you havent im removing you from this detail youre to fly back to new orleans immediately and begin your suspension sorry it has to be this way some years ago you messed up i thought youd worked hard and overcome that mistake but you keep messing up nick youre a loose cannon youre not a team player you want too much you want it too fast nick realized hed just gotten blindsided it hit him with a force he hadnt felt since myra died all the way through nick you insist on doing things your way if youd bumped swagger up to the alpha category if youd taken him prisoner if oh nick youve done so poorly weve tried so desperately to help you and now you pull this on us im sorry howard blurted nick stunned i didnt know it was so serious i was trying to do a thorough job and i nick thats all i have for you i want you nick it was hap fencl leaning in excuse me howard he said but i have a woman on the line who swears she knows where bob swagger is and insists on talking to nick for christs sake fencl blurted howard shes probably just another she says he had an arm wound we hadnt released that information there was a long pause finally disgustedly howard gestured to nick to pick up the phone its line fourteen said hap nick memphis fbi can i help you mr memphis came the voice like a bad countrywestern song though somehow theatrical and a bit phony mr memphis bob lee was with me and he was my man fer a time but hes gone now who is this nick said this aint nobody she said but i seen your pitcher in the magazine and if youre the johnny whats got to catch bob lee then git yourself ready cause hes a coming when he left here today should be there in three days of hard driving hes gone a little crazy you know i begged him not to go how do i because he said his dogs name was mike not pat like it said in the newspapers another trap to weed out loony callers nick took a deep breath made a signal to hap to indicate it was time to get going on the trace he says hes coming home to bury his dog said the woman gonna bury his dog dont care who hes got to kill to do it i dont hurt him mr memphis he aint hurt nobody then she hung up the secure phone rang shreck looked up at the men in his office get out he said after they left he picked it up shreck hello raymond the old mans voice sang how are you today mr meachum you dont care how i am what do you want i wanted you to be the first to hear the good news ive heard from a friend that the justice department has just alerted the state department to inform the salvadorans that it has formally decided against reopening its inquiry into the panther battalion atrocity the archbishop is gone and theres nobody to pay any attention to it at all this did cheer shreck well thats something yes it is of course general de rujijo and his colleagues and peers will be delighted certain people in certain agencies in this town will breathe a good deal more easily the past will be allowed to die we can go on from here its the first day of the rest of our lives youre to be congratulated once again colonel you made the impossible happen extraordinary thank you mr meachum only that one loose end and its a very tiny one were on it mr meachum excellent said the old man i knew i could count on you okay said howard now i want snipers on those two buildings do you see put them on duty at four am tonight i want them there all day tomorrow even if hes not supposed to be in till the day after you can never tell yes howard said hap fencl well put em up there good boys nick hes the best shot no not nick nick stays with me do you hear that nick yes i hear it said nick still clinging to membership on the task force by his fingernails his exile to new orleans forestalled by the prospect of action they were standing in front of the new redbrick polk county health complex which contained the county morgue the body of mike the dog had been removed there and now rested inside it was a bright afternoon and the green ouachitas glared down at them they were about a mile out of blue eye just off of route where it neared and turned into mena traffic hummed down the road and i want shotgun teams on standby say fourman units ready to go secured in the installation yes howard said hap uh what load do you want them carrying doubleought buck or deer slugs hmm said howard the boys like doubleought because it doesnt kick so much and you dont have to make an exact shot placement and howard with those deer slugs you got a caliber chunk of lead moving at one thousand six hundred feet a second and if you should happen to hit a civilian christ the hoot from the newspapers hes probably not going to be wearing body armor said howard all right go with the doubleought howard do you want to coordinate with the sheriffs office hap asked old tells getting pretty edgy as it is no i dont think so this is our operation this is a federal warrant and well serve it well alert the sheriff after we make the apprehension nick yes howard said nick standing there disconsolately next to howard in the small knot of agents just outside the lobby nick i want you to stay at the command post to handle the communications or do you want to ship out today no howard ill hang around until but howard had already turned away from nick i also want us to have people in the morgue and people on the floor and in the office i want an observation post up near the snipers iding everybody who pulls into the lot if we get a positive will you green light asked hap yes there was a quiet moment green light pull the trigger shoot to kill without warning it was a rare operational condition i want to take him here in the lot not inside we could get ourselves in some hostage situation or god knows what if he gets inside said howard this man is very dangerous he could take down half a dozen men in the blink of an eye and suddenly im looking at more dead than miami howard said nick knowing it was futile he had me dead to rights in new orleans with my own pistol when the smart thing was to drill me and he passed on it he hasnt been found guilty of nick you are really disappointing me yeah nick said hap howards right gotta tag the guy if a clean chance shows nick nodded bitterly but what if hes innocent then he realized it didnt really matter anymore all right hap you get the men out and sited very quietly i dont want a lot of action on this its possible bob has sympathizers in the community and hell be getting advance reports howard hell also scope out this place before he moves in said nick thats how he works hes very careful youll want to be real careful how you hide these people this guy can smell a trap a mile away nicky were pros too remember said hap hey well do a real nice job he wont know what hit him nicky if he shows nick you come with me said howdy duty i want to see the administrator here and get all this cleared before we move in i may need your diplomatic skills nick and howard went into the lobby waiting room a bland governmentgrim office that smelled of newness and plastic the place was only a year or so old where beige furniture stood against beige walls and one bearded geezer was up at the desk jawing in deep arkansese with the girl there howard led nick to the counter and they waited politely in the otherwise empty office as the hillbilly or mountain man or whatever he was carried on bout the damned government or some such and the girl listened with half an ear and half a brain and kept saying but the papers arent ready yet she was just letting him blow some steam and after a while he seemed to settle down and stepped aside and howard pushed his way to the counter pulling his identification and announcing himself as deputy director utey federal bureau of investigation it was only then that nick looked up into the face of the man theyd rammed aside and behind the blond beard and under the deep tan realized he was looking into the gray eyes of bob the nailer chapter twentytwo nick was fast bob was faster dont you do it son he said the colt automatic a blue blur as it rose from nowhere and locked onto nicks chest bobs voice was dead calm dead serious nicks hand had flashed to his own smith his fingers were wrapped around the shaft of the piece a very good speed draw in fact by bureau standards but he was dead by a clean threetenths of a second if bob so chose nick put his hands up hey what howard said you boys just relax young lady you relax too i came only to get my old hound mike and no man should have to die for so silly a thing as a dog thats been dead a month or so right memphis there was a weirdly cheerful crackle in his voice the girl behind the counter sat back and her eyes got big as eggs howard meanwhile was still not quite with it who howard its him its swagger he beat us here no he set us up isnt that right you older guy dont you do anything stupid even if you do look stupid gun out left hand reaching around set it on the counter just like the kid here mr swagger there are federal agents all arou just do it old man theres a good boy it stunned nick how calm bob was howards big model came out went onto the countertop delicately young lady pick each one up by the barrel and put em in that wastebasket over there she did as she was told shaking all the way now young lady i want you to lie down on the floor over there by the wall and curl up with your hands over your ears you just stay there if you hear shooting you just stay there youll be fine if you just stay there the girl a blonde with a murky face did just that sinking to the floor swagger said howard give it up you wont make it out if we dont get you today well get you tomorrow we have a thousand men on this you just shut your mouth sir said bob now yall come with me smiling like were old pals you being just a touch ahead remember i can put the third of three bullets into each of you before you feel the first two now lets go were headed back past three halls then turning to the right then you memphis youre going to tell the man there a dr nivens i believe how its time to give up on the dogs body and send it on to washington for further tests you pick it up then were going to walk out to my truck and im going to drive off and nobody has to get hurt over a damn dog fair enough swagger we have six eightman reactive squads in the area we can have a swat team here in three minutes we have choppers and dogs youll never get it done its over you shouldnt have come back i came back to bury my old dog and nobodys going to stop me now lets get going the three of them walked stiffly through the swinging doors now up here to the left you boys put him in the human morgue thats proper because hes a better man than most men ill tell you they reached the morgue here we are memphis dont fuck this up like you fucked up tulsa you hit the first time pork nick blanched his shame yanked up out of the past on him how had he known yes it was nivens the county coroner whod done the autopsy on the dog uh dr nivens my names nick memphis fbi nick said nick drew out his credentials and the three of them faced the runty little doctor weve uh weve decided to send the dogs body on to washington for further testing and oh god bob jesus dont shoot the doctor had recognized bob even as nick was talking so bob pulled the colt out and said now dont do anything stupid doc i just come to get my damned poor old dog give him to this young fool here but in the face of the pistol the doctor simply surrendered he was one of those natural victims eager to give up he went to his knees and blubbered at bob not to shoot him because he had three children a mortgage a sick wife wheres the dog dammit bob asked the doctor mumbled something about number and bob gave nick a shove in the direction of the drawer marked nick ambled over to it he had a colt agent snub in a ballistic nylon holster strapped to his ankle in accordance with the new bureau reg that permitted backup guns in units with highcontact probability but the problem with an ankle carry is its awkwardness hed never get to the piece get it unstrapped get it into his big hands and find a shooting position before bob had shot him several dozen times but he knew that howard had a piece on his ankle also and he was afraid that howard now furiously ashamed to be taken so easily and caught up in the drama of a collapsing career might lose it and go for the piece and get himself and probably everyone else in the room killed nick slid open the drawer it was cool inside the dog wrapped in a human body bag was light enough he hoisted it fine said bob watching him watching the doctor watching poor howard now bring him over here swagger give it up said howard before somebody innocent gets hurt now sir said bob courtly as ever you just mind your own business and nothing sudden will happen to anybody alls i want is to bury my dog suddenly they heard sirens colonel it was one of paynes men an excop and hed just caught up with shreck in the corridor yes its jack in the electrotek in arkansas hes just monitored an fbi report from outside blue eye to the effect that theyve got bob lee swagger caught in the polk county health complex theyre just this second bringing in their swat teams and snipers and the state cops and the local cops are pouring all kinds of stuff into the place shrecks eyes acquired the color of ball bearings i want you to get to operations and bring it up off the shortwave on loudspeaker ill be there in a second and clear the room i want to hear this one without a lot of asshole chatter from the teams yes sir all right said shreck he felt nothing no elation no dizzying blast of happiness no relief he was a professional but in the tunnel that was his mind he had just a split second of pleasure it was about to end he raced toward operations all right said bob gesturing to howard and the doctor yall lie down on the floor keep your heads down and dont try anything foolish you chubby youre coming with me bring the dog abruptly they stepped through the swinging doors leaving the stunned victims in the morgue hold it bob commanded he positioned himself next to the doors and two seconds later they blew open to reveal howard with his little on a rampage and bob simply clipped him between the eyes with the hard butt of the in a kind of insolent backhanded swat sending him down to the floor with a thump his little revolver clattering away wasnt he the stupid one he said laconically to nick who watched the whole thing in astonishment now this way bob directed with his as the sirens grew louder outside you got every swat team in six states on your ass said nick pork youre here to carry the dog so why not just keep that mouth buttoned up everywhere they ran through the building they encountered frightened people who melted away with shrieks or faints but no officers howard hadnt gotten any men into the building yet and probably wouldnt until the evacuation was complete nick felt his colt agent jostling in the ankle holster but he still had no good shot at getting it out not with the eerily aware bob shoving him down the hallway toward god knew what where we headed he asked shut up pork said bob suddenly the loudspeakers boomed through the hallways ladies and gentlemen the fbi requests that you stay in your offices theres evidently a felon loose in the complex jesus nick said they got you now a state police car whirled down route from mena toward the health complex siren blaring blowing by the electrotek van which had been discreetly parked at a wayside stopover behind the police car came another and another a helicopter churned overhead in the van a scrawny excop named eddie nicoletta and called eddie nickles said his ass is grass but jack payne didnt say a thing he just sat there listening to the orchestration of the law enforcement units over the radio intercept nothing showed on his mean little face the radio chattered on command i got three state teams coming in okay good victor michael five i want you to work em around back and coordinate with our sniper post tenfour command are we green light thats a negative victor michael five we have a federal officer as a hostage i repeat we have a federal officer as a hostage ill call the shot if it goes to it but suppose we get him clean ah well have to get back to you victor michael five said the command voice fuckin feds said nicoletta they take over and then they dont know what the fuck their policy is i remember this time working narc when shut up nickles said payne then he turned to pony a panther battalion communications technician really named pinto and asked they getting this back at dulles loud and clear the salvadoran said i tell you man with this stuff you could start a radio station another chopper roared down the road i want to be there thought jack payne suddenly a yearning going off in him like an inflating balloon but he sat tight dont touch that dial he said bob stopped to pull on the padlock of a door marked engineering only magically the lock popped open they stepped into a little closet there was a grating on the floor and bob bent to open it beneath nick could see a metal ladder thats our ticket out pork get your ass and a half down there and then go to prone on your belly legs and arms spread you make a stupid move ill have to dump your bones here sad for a big boy like you to have to die over a dead dog nick struggled down with the dogs corpse he could sense bob above him the yawning bore of the always locked onto him the man carried the gun lightly easily as if hed been born with it at the bottom nick looked up and there was bob the gun on him obediently he went to the floor as bob clambered down pulling the grate shut after him this way now he said nick had to admit it yes he was impressed bob knew the layout of the place cold hed left the woman up front to call the cops because he wanted lots of commotion and chaos he figured he could get out but he couldnt make it with the dog so hed had to wait until a strong enough man showed up who could carry mike while he bob negotiated the obstacles recon remembered nick a good sniper always recons the area before he operates he never goes in blind he knows where everything is he plans escape routes evasion maneuvers always has a plan at the end of the narrow tunnel they came to another ladder this time bob went up first back against the rungs the gun on nick nick followed covered the whole way and had trouble lugging the dogs body up the ladder but bob didnt help him a bit finally grunting heavily he was up damn dog is heavy he said you ought to try humping a seventypound pack in the boonies in ahundredtwentydegree weather pork said bob now shut up this part might be tricky they were in another closet close in the dark outside it they could hear motion the staticky crackle of a radio the low murmuring of serious men hold on to that dog whispered bob then he pressed open the door they were in some sort of garage a good seventy yards from the main health complex building outside nick saw three state police cars set up to form a perimeter around the building cops were crouched behind their wheel wells aiming shotguns or scoped rifles but bob and nick were outside the perimeter now we go out here we walk we dont run about a hundred yards to where you see a generating shack around back theres a red pickup thats where were going you make any sudden moves son and you know whats waiting for you yeah said nick so lets do it they walked out into the bright sunlight and didnt look back the damn dog was getting even heavier nicks arms ached he watched as the generating shack wobbled closer wondering when the hell howard would shake the cobwebs from his skull and figure out what was going on and order his snipers to green light the two walking men the bullets would sing out and since the guys didnt shoot worth a shit at any range over seven yards he knew hed get blasted what made it worse was the sense of commotion rising behind them two or three new choppers arriving while all the sirens in the world seemed to be sounding as if it were some kind of state police convention in little rock but they made it to the shed and behind it found the red truck put the dog in back said bob who had opened the cab and pulled out a shortbarreled lever action carbine an actual winchester now get in pork youre driving and i got this little rifle on your butt he spat a leisurely gob into the dust jesus now were just going to drive on out of here like nobodys going to notice theres maybe five hundred men out there by now were going out the back way and up the hill what back way there is no back way i think youre going to be surprised son now get going keys in the ignition and ive got this damn poodleshooter on you suddenly there was a helicopter hovering overhead whipping up a brisk curtain of dust and beating the trees back you in the truck came the loudspeakered voice out or well fire shit said nick punch it said bob feeling extremely mortal nick punched the truck with a stunning leap the vehicle took off blowing up its own curtain of dust as it zoomed along the perimeter of the fence the shadow of the chopper stayed with them sirens rose from around the sides of the building a fleet of squad cars emerged plunging like a cavalry charge across the grounds at them now left left shrieked bob but there was nothing left but cyclone fence in operations the men sat quietly faces grave nobody looked at anybody else from the bank of communications equipment they could hear the drama playing itself out all units all units i have suspects in red pickup inside the wire perimeter goddamn thats him i swear goddamn this is command this is command all units stay in position i want state police in pursuit do you read victor michael five get after him are we green light are we green light only if you get a clear shot all units suspect is armed and dangerous but hes got a federal hostage is hostage expendable you must not let suspect get away thats imperative all units jesus said one of the operations guys whoevers on command just said go ahead and drop their own guy if they have to the feds want this boy bad not as bad as i do thought shreck left screamed bob himself reaching over to shove the wheel nick felt the truck swerve and before it there was a steel fence post and he knew it would stop them and hed end up wrapped around it but the post went down like a snowman yanking with it twenty feet of fence nick knew instantly it had already been cut through that bob had laid the whole thing out hours ago and now they faced hill nick didnt need instructions he pressed the gas and rocked backwards through the gears and the truck bucked and clawed its way up through underbrush until it felt like a rocket ship ascending toward gravitys release it seemed almost vertical he waited to slide back felt the truck fighting and fighting and fighting then amazingly they were over the crest of a ledge and on a dirt road go go you sonovabitch swagger was yelling woooeeee left those old boys way back there indeed the police cruisers and the fbi cars didnt have the gear ratios to make the incline nick could see one or two of them stuck halfway up and the others paralleling his course at ground level but the choppers were everywhere two three now four of them darting like predatory birds you wont shake the choppers he yelled you just drive pork you let me worry about that bob commanded he actually looked a little happy a shot tore into the hood of the truck with a clang oh fuck theyre shooting nick said but bob squirmed half out the window and brandished the carbine and instantly the choppers fell back gutless bubbas he said sliding back in they tore down the high road at eighty dogged at a distance by choppers and behind them rose state police cars their lights flashing the squad cars gained go on boy hit it push this damn thing or ill have to dump you at hundred miles per its pushed dammit i got the pedal on the floor theyre gonna get us another mile or so boy thats all this distance narrowed appreciably over the next few seconds as the state police cruisers rocketed down the road much faster than the truck could hit in the rearview mirror nick could see the offside man in the lead car slide a pump gun out the window and try to find enough of a sight picture to fire as the car drew nearer but the road bucked too hard and the dust was too thick okay boy get ready shouted bob shes coming up now nick looked at him in horror and watched as his hand snaked out gleefully seized the wheel and gave it a hard yank to the right nicks foot reflexively shot to the brake but it was too late the truck careened at sixty miles an hour off the edge of the road and back down the mountainside through the windshield the world tipped crazily and turned to instant vegetation as branches and tufts of high grass whipped at the truck it rocked savagely as it plummeted downward now and then feeling about to launch itself in a gutsqueezing heartcrushing thrust through the air then the wheels touched down again and the truck tore through the underbrush nick fought the wheel for some semblance of control he saw trees again and heard himself screaming and then he lost it the whole thing flipped the windshield stretched and shivered and seemed to liquefy as it turned to silver webbing in the instant before it shattered pouring a torrent of glass atop him he felt himself careening and the smell of dust and gas filled his ears amid bolts of pain as he banged his head hard against the door pillar and then they were still it took nick a second or two to realize he was alive he heard the ticking of the truck and shook his head touching it tasting salt as blood ran into his mouth his eyes shot open he lay half in half out of the vehicle which had come to a twisted rest in a tangle of trees at the end of the long plunge down the mountain up top he could see the police cars halted and a couple of troopers guns in hands edging down the steep slope a chopper hovered above and then another one swooped low overhead its roar deafening nick turned and watched as a whole cavalry charge of police cars roared across the flatland at them still a good three minutes distant where was bob he blinked shook his head pulled himself free his hand shot down to his ankle and he unlimbered the agent where was he then he heard a grunt and looked back through the cab to see bob lifting the body bag with mikes corpse out of the truck bed there was blood on his face too and when he got the body to him nick saw him pause there was a tenderness in him nick would never have wired into his bob lee swagger profile then bob spun and began to lurch away nick had him stop he thrust out the cupping it in two hands as he thumbed back the hammer he had its cylinder primed with glaser safety slugs at this range the birdshotloaded bluetips generated seventythree percent oneshot stops goddammit freeze nick boomed again he lurched forward blinking blood from his eyes and feeling himself begin to tremble like a child in the cold rain without a coat he set himself against the canted hood of the truck locking his elbows sliding into a sight picture it was a good hold he had bob center mass in the notch of the rear sight and the nub of the front bob himself blinked away some blood as he studied on this new situation put the dog down and your hands behind your neck and get to your fucking knees swagger you do some speed stuff on me and i swear to christ i blow your spine out these are glasers hell pork bob said if you were going to shoot me itd be done by now then the sonovabitch winked at him and he turned and began to amble off dog under one arm winchester carbine under the other shoot him nick ordered himself the trigger was a curse against his finger he yearned to expel it to end all his failures but shooting a man takes one of two things an overwhelming fear of ones own death which nick did not have in the least or conviction it turned out he lacked this component as well he didnt miss vertically he missed horizontally nick found himself thinking as he stood there watching bob run away bob got to the field and shot across the meadow a hundred yards or so to what nick now saw was your picturepostcard country cemetery under a tall stand of ancient trees hard by a doddering wooden church he watched as bob vaulted the stone wall and there among the teetering blackened gravestones set the dog down in what must have been a perfectly sized hole already cut from the earth and snatched up a shovel that must have been part of the master plan with seven strong strokes he heaped dirt upon it in the next halfsecond hed scooped up the winchester carbine and headed into the church nick heard the cars closing in now but they would not make it bob was inside the church and suddenly out the door skeedaddled a class of black children running desperately even as the first state cruiser arrived and its occupants magnums and shotguns aimed and cocked took cover behind it then came a second a third and then ten more then twenty a whole caravan of lawmen was at the church in less than a minute ready and waiting when the last occupant emerged a stooped black gentleman they got him nick thought someone was screaming in his ear you didnt shoot you had him goddammit the voice said he turned it was a toughlooking state police sergeant behind him his buddy radiated contempt at nick ill have to pay for that one too goddamn said another state policeman holding aloft bobs as he found it in the cab its fucking empty nick heard a bullhorn demanding surrender there was just one second of silence then the sound of shots rose against the sky and nick turned in horror the lawmen were shooting gas grenades into the church he watched as the heavy shells sailed through and the cottony white fog began to steam through the broken windows a tendril of smoke leaped out and a flame and then another from another window and the church began to burn jack payne stood outside the van with his binoculars overhead a tv news helicopter zipped by and shortly a tv news van came screeching down the road toward the mass of flashing lightbars and the howl of sirens jack could hear the troopers over the radio intercept from inside the van shit its going up that dry timber is he coming out dont see a damned thing im gonna thats a negative victor michael thirtythree you stay put and keep those eyes open anybody seen the goddamned feds theyre coming charlie at that moment four black cars raced by jack hellbent for the church but it was too late jack watched the smoke floating upward in a lazy column through the glass he could see the flames wow it was eddie nickles beside him shit they burned him up man hes all fucking toasty now shut up said jack he didnt know why he felt like hitting the younger man chapter twentythree shreck watched the church burn when it was burned to the ground he hit rewind and watched it burn again and each time an earnest television correspondent repeated the news breathlessly behind me is the funeral pyre of the notorious attempted presidential assassin bob lee swagger whom arkansas state police officers and fbi agents pursued to this bucolic spot after his dramatic attempt to kidnap his dogs body despite the lawmens requests that he come out swagger opened fire on the officers a tear gas canister ignited the old structure into conflagration the church has been burning for two hours now in the morning officials say it will be cool enough to sift through the ashes for the body of bob lee swagger shreck saw holocaust the flames gobbled the structure from the roof downward they danced madly through it issuing a lazy smeary column of smoke he hit rewind again it was dark in the room three or four of the men from jack paynes operations unit were in the room and dobbler making a rare appearance outside his celllike little office had slipped in too play it again said shreck the tv people in blue eye on rumors of federal activity and monitoring the police channels on the radio had gotten there efficiently they had it from a variety of angles from a helicopter it looked like a funeral pyre shreck could see the church standing in the devotional ring of police vehicles a little to one side of the copse of trees and the old graveyard it throbbed with flames nobody could get out of that alive somebody said in the dark man hes fried then shreck spoke its nothing until they find the body and issue a forensic report until then its nothing but he watched it again the flames billowed orangely as they ate through the old building standing in a meadow in the lee of mountains on a bright and beautiful arkansas day i think its over sir somebody said i think we can chalk it off then why would he do something so obviously stupid for a dog this guy was a prick but he wasnt stupid but he was obsessional said dobbler in the dark the dog mattered to him it wasnt stupid to him to us yes to swagger it mattered so much he was driven to come back ill buy it when they bring me his teeth said shreck his eyes went back to the television he hit rewind hap found him the next day here here he is goddammit he called after lifting the air filtration mask the men wore to protect their lungs from the clouds of ash his words carried to the twenty agents and fifteen state policemen on hands and knees who sifted and pawed through the remains of aurora baptist while a hundred yards away like gawkers at a carnival midway the reporters were kept in check by three more cops and a rope line the cops and agents gathered around nick pushed his way through the crowd his head ached from the pounding hed taken and he was afraid his stitches might not hold but he had to see what was left of bob lee swagger was not pretty bobs face had burned away and the hideous fleshlessness exposed his teeth which had been blackened with the rest of him in the blaze his spine had curled it looked like an apache bow drawn perhaps shrunken a little much notched the rest was loose body parts black as sin disconnected from each other one of the agents went away to be sick nick standing amid clouds of ashen dust in the hulk of the old church pushed his mask off and saw what had happened in extremis his last moments of life on earth as the incredible heat consumed him bob crawled to the altar the fire consumed him and spat out his bones he had done his duty he got that damned dog buried it was so important to him it was important enough to die for was that nobility or sheer craziness hard to read and that was somehow pured bob swagger and that done there was nothing left to do what all his armed and dangerous enemies could not do a single tear gas shell fired into the rafters of the church had done in seconds fitting no too much pain death by fire wasnt transformation it was as agonizing as crucifixion with nails driven through every square centimeter of your skin hell of a way to die someone said creep or no creep hell of a way to die whos going to bodybag him not me said nick first and loudest he had wanted to see the whole thing played out to the end knowing his own end or the end of his career was near there was nothing of the reliquary here for him the bones of saints being really just bones made him queasy he stepped out of the ruins of the church nice to be on solid ground again instead of shuffling through ash and firerotted splinters of wood he stood off to one side while others came to see and wondered if this was how it was in when they got dillinger and everyone had to come and look and dip a finger or a handkerchief in the great gangsters blood the reporters sensed the discovery and became restive nick could see them surge forward and strain at the rope it was howard over there who quieted them with the news nick watched the network reporters cluster around him then looked and saw that the photographers had finished and now the guys from morgue had gotten what was left of bob into a plastic sack at least they had the decency to put him on a litter rather than carrying him like a halloween bag to the coroners van feeling suddenly wiped out nick thought how nice it would finally be to be done with it all he had zero money because it had taken every cent he had to keep myra taken care of and soon he would have no job but hey he was alive he was then he saw something that made him sick he walked over to the graveyard what the hell are you doing two black men were digging up the dog that bob had buried while two cameras blazed away and two tv reporters posed in front of them i said what the hell are you doing the black men just looked at him foolishly do you have permission to dig here this is states evidence now chief said one of the reporters coming over to him nothing to get excited about were just doing our job youre fbi huh so what does it feel like now that public enemy number one has the microphone was pushed at him and nick saw the camera coming onto him he also saw howard rushing over to take command a stricken look on his face nick howard was calling nick you arent authorized to do press at this point mr baker ill have to ask you nick turned the microphone was still there big as a fist right at nicks nose and the reporter who nick now saw was wearing considerable makeup and whose hair was lacquered into frozen perfection was asking him quite earnestly how it felt when he watched the church burn nick no he heard howard as his fist traveled a short distance maybe ten inches and caught the talker square in his pretty mouth nothing had felt quite so good in months the clown bumbled fearfully backward spitting teeth leaking blood and the whole contingent of press guys quivered back making room for him now gone to complete savagery nick turned onto the digging men and screamed at them to get the hell out of there and they scrambled away so there he stood for just a second all his enemies vanquished look at me ma top of the world top of the world then howard had him and several others pulled him back and were on him including one state policeman who was handling him more roughly than was necessary yeah youre tough with reporters the officer spat but yesterday when it counted you were pussy and with that he gave nick an immensely powerful shove that sent him back a few feet completely stripped of dignity it occurred to nick for the first time how the cops must hate him he hadnt worked it out having spent the night in the hospital after various stitchings and x rays but yes hed had a shot at bob and couldnt pull the trigger three minutes later it was state policemen whod closed on bob fully armed and one of the most dangerous gunmen in the world had he wanted to bob could have filled arkansas with state police widows even with that oldtime cowboy carbine nick goddamn cool it cool it hap was whispering in his ear as he held him in a tender but firm embrace damn what has gotten into you jesus you punch a reporter you could get busted for assault and these arkansas state boys aint exactly your fan club you know yeah yeah said nick with phony surliness as the cop slowly walked away daring nick to have a go at him meanwhile howard had taken over with the reporters trying to explain how nick was overextended he just felt totally whacked even breathing seemed too hard if he could only sleep for a couple of centuries and then wake up and put the pieces together it might make some sense howard was back howard didnt have a vocabulary for anger being by nature a conniver and a facilitator rather than a brute but he was mad nick could see it in the tightness of his eyes and the straight flat hard line of his little mouth howard im sorry i hadnt really figured how stressed out i was i really didnt memphis thats it thats the end i am formally relieving you of duties as of this second you are off this case and off this team get back to the hotel and pack and shower ill have somebody drive you to the airport you take a plane to god knows where i dont give a damn ill have you formally notified when the review board will meet but as of now you are officially suspended without pay pending the outcome of the boards decision howard i want memphis shut up your involvement in the case has been a disaster its my biggest mistake now just get the hell out of here i want you out of here sure howard sorry i only wanted to be a good fbi agent sorry i blew it nick turned and went to his car he was feeling woozy he thought he might be sick hap was standing there too nick let me drive you i dont think youre in any shape to drive i think its a little postaction stress syndrome kicking in i just got fired hap i know nick im real sorry can you get me to the airport after i shower i mean sure nothing going on here but finecombing the ruins and waiting for the coroners preliminary report they didnt talk much on the way back to the motel nick showered quickly threw his clothes into a bag and was ready to hit the drive to little rock in twenty minutes he actually fell asleep on the way as they were heading toward the airport entrance there was a to new orleans hap awakened him he slept on the flight back too and arrived around seven the airport was almost deserted and there was no one of course to meet him he walked down its empty corridors to the street and took a cab home it cost him nineteen dollars there was nothing at home he felt the emptiness without myra keenly he tried not to feel terribly sorry for himself because he still had his youth or at least a little of it and he knew he was well liked and had it in him to be a good police officer though possibly not at the federal level just not cut out for the big leagues he thought morosely he got himself a beer from the refrigerator and drank it while he watched cnn but it didnt taste like much on the tv it was the same stuff and they even had the dogs body being removed from the grave by the two black men there was a closeup of its body bag halfdeflated that he had carried from the morgue to the truck that strange mad day hard to believe it was only fortyeight hours ago it seemed to belong to some other geological era and now this said the cnn anchorman a stern commanding black man who would have looked comfortable on the bridge of a destroyer fbi forensic technicians have confirmed from dental records the identity of the body found in the ruins of aurora baptist near blue eye arkansas as that of bob lee swagger the marine hero who allegedly shot at the president of the united states and killed the archbishop of el salvador and has been for five weeks the most wanted man in america the cause of death was a selfadministered gunshot wound through the roof of the mouth and into the brain as the flames closed in so nick thought you put the gun muzzle in your mouth and pulled the trigger it was fitting that no man had brought bob the nailer down but himself by his own hand sealing his secrets off forever well nick said to nobody in the empty room except the clock the anchorman and the can of beer we put him away hooray for us julie fenn held herself tight and somehow got through the day there was still a wisp of a hope or a prayer or something some little thing she drove home through the fiery radiance of the arizona twilight clinging to it but that night came the evidence of the dental report and that was the end that was that and somehow she got through the next day too it wasnt easy but she was a strong woman and she had plenty of years of practice holding things in but enough was enough she called in the next day and said she was having family difficulties and would have to have a day or so off dr martin said that was fine he understood though under his voice there was a layer that said he didnt she couldnt care dr martin was twentysix he needed julie a lot more than julie needed him who would run the clinic if she didnt so she sat in her trailer and tried to cry she found she could not cry in some way or other she had moved beyond crying she could not weep and she could not feel relief it had always been possible from that first second the knock on the door had come and shed pulled it open to see a man whod haunted her dreams whom shed loved and hated through twenty long years of nights that her whole life could be pulled apart she could have been arrested for being an accessory after the fact or something like that at the very least thered be that horrible kind of modern fame where every creep in the world thinks he owns you and has a right to your inner life and you see the same bad picture of yourself in a thousand newspapers and none of the people trying to talk to you or take your picture give a real damn about you youre just that weeks meat but to know that wouldnt happen now that dead men tell nothing and indict no witnesses offered no solace at all she just wanted bob her henry thoreau with a rifle the funny way he had said he went and lived by himself too it had cracked her up that little proud squeak of knowledge about a new england transcendentalist from the worlds best manhunter so nice to have a man around the house she turned on the television because the news was on nbc tom brokaw looked earnest and troubled tonight he was telling bobs story for the umpteenth time the tragic story of the marine hero who was the son of a marine hero and had gone tragically astray in his bitterness and yet who had died with such quixotic grandeur that a little part of everybody had to admire him it was the dog angle that would propel bob to incredible national celebrity if he could be in his current state as americas most wanted man even more celebrated and so brokaw concluded the tv cheap irony tone coming into his syrupy voice a man of violence who allegedly killed a bishop has died to commit an innocent animal to a final act of dignity other stories came on dog lovers had gathered a petition to make certain the dog was buried where bob had meant to bury it there was an interview with some general in the salvadoran army taking pleasure that the archbishops murderer had paid the ultimate price but somewhat upset that he was acquiring such a patina of sainthood for his kindness to a dead animal when hed actually killed the animal himself and then the archbishop he was asked about the panther battalion massacre and he said they were making good progress on that investigation next nbc flashed to blue eye and showed an interview with sam vincent a lawyer and he wondered why the fbi and the state police had to go and kill bob since no one had proved in a court of law that bob was guilty but the reporter kept wanting to get back to the dog the dog the dog how much bob had loved the dog oh said sam finally yep i spose he did but bob had a damn practical streak and if the dog were dead i cant for the life of me figger out why he went and did such a fool thing the old man blinked into the camera he werent no fool said sam vincent and you can put that in the damn bank then he spat into the dirt and walked away it puzzled her too and she turned it over in her head that night trying to make sense of it it was a sleepless night once she drifted off and came awake an hour later in the dark with her head racing with memories bob bob lee she called into the darkness there was no response she heard the ticking the random noise the sound of a car on the road and far off in the desert the cry of a coyote but there was nothing else or was there she felt something a presence or maybe just a sense of being watched she shivered and reached under the bed to the smith wesson camp gun but nothing came of the feeling that night nick sat in front of the tube the whole damned evening drinking more and seeing nothing around eleven not drunk but slightly blurry he ambled to bed that night he had a dream involving bob lee swagger and myra and somehow also that terrifying crash down the mountainside with the green branches beating at the windshield until the windshield went then he saw the door post as it came forward and hit him in the skull myra he screamed in his dream myra i didnt mean it when he got out of the cab and reached for his little he saw bob lee swagger and myra dancing on the green grass myra was barefoot and lively as a country tune her whole face radiated pleasure stop or ill shoot he screamed the little pistol tight in his big hand then he fired in the dream he fired just as surely as in real life he had not and myras back spurted black blood and she went down crying nick you killed my spine you killed my spine and howdy duty was there telling him what a terrible job hed done how hed wrecked his career and bob was dancing away into the flames nick sat up blinking he was covered with sweat someone was screaming it was himself after that he had trouble getting back to sleep though he may have dozed some around dawn he finally awakened for good about eightthirty in the morning dissociated and hung over his head ached he needed a shave this was life after the bureau another pointless day stretched before him he had no will to go on but he decided out of habit to shower and have a cup of coffee then he put on a summerweight suit and a white shirt just as if he were going to the office i will go to the office he decided he had a desk to clear out farewells to be said and there was some paperwork to be attended to it was the one place that made him happy and though the happiness it gave him now was phony he realized he could not deny it all right ill go he thought have to anyway sooner or later might as well be now nick drove downtown and parked in the usual lot and went upstairs by the usual elevator god it was so familiar he couldnt believe hed never do this again he walked in through the foyer and the door marked govt employees only and down the corridor in all the offices people were already busy clerks filed or worked at computer terminals secretaries typed special agents bustled about importantly nick knew the rhythms of the place knew exactly what the mens room smelled like and which of the three people who tended the coffee machine made the best coffee and when the supervisory agent would be in and how long he took for lunch and what happened when he came in and what happened when he did not and who was testifying in court that week and who was not he knew the fastest way out he knew where the rifles and the ms were stored for swat usage he knew who was designated swat team leader on the reactive team that week it was a rotating duty he knew who was new to the office and who was due to be shuffled soon and who was producing and who wasnt and subtly different who was thought to be producing but actually wasnt and he loved every damn bit of it he entered the big room where the agents sat at their desks in a police station it would have been called a squad room but here it was simply known as the bull pen it was surprisingly empty today because of course howdy duty had drawn primarily on new orleans agents to staff the big stalk in arkansas nick went to his desk took his key out and opened it on a normal day this was when hed take off his pistol and put it in the upperright drawer today he had no pistol instead he opened the big central drawer so little to show a few files from cases hed vetted for others a few pencils a few notepads that was it it was so empty ahead of him tacked on the burlap of the cubicle wall was a picture of myra taken five years ago it was an extreme closeup and she was smiling in the sunlight you couldnt see her disability she looked like a bright pretty young woman who had her whole life ahead of her on the desk itself was the annotated federal code and the huge green federal bureau of investigation regulations and procedures plus assorted carbonized forms for reporting incidents for logging investigative reports for filing for warrants and a small pile of pink message slips which riffled through quickly revealed nothing at all worth noting nick he looked up it was a guy named fred sandford another special agent nick didnt know him well he hadnt made the trip to arkansas hi ya fred hey just wanted to say was real sorry to hear how it went down out there for you im sure there was nothing you could do i just did my best he said and it didnt quite pan out wanted to tell you my brother is a police chief in red river idaho you always were a good detective nick i could give him a call maybe hes looking for someone ah thanks im not sure at this point im going to stick with law enforcement too much hassle for too little satisfaction and too little money sure got you if you change your mind i appreciate it fred really i do im thinking about going back to school getting my masters and maybe taking up teaching something nice and quiet sure whatever you say with that he was alone again he took the picture off the wall retrieved his abortive lanzman file hoping that one last scan might reveal a pattern where nothing else had but it was another big zero the reason why that poor guy was whacked in that motel room near the airport so horribly all that time ago would remain completely unknown ramdyne or no ramdyne somebody else got away with it too bad you were trying to reach me and somebody put a big finger on you with about a million bucks worth of electronic gear and its just going to fall through the cracks like seventyone percent of the crimes in this country and there isnt a damn thing i can do about it haps secretary an officious woman named doris drabney came by next there was no sympathy in her eyes or face but then there was no sanctimony either there was simply nothing youve got some paperwork to sign she said in spite of himself nick was slightly frightened by her you mean about the um the suspension yes please stop by my desk on the way out and she turned and left nick watched her march off there was something rigid and jointless in the way she moved she was one of those people whod just let the bureau sink into her life until it filled her whole personality until it became her personality she was a lifer in the worst possible way so gone in the life no other was even possible well he thought that wont happen to me god knows what will but that wont and suddenly he was out of things to do he looked down at his meager cardboard box of belongings then he looked around for a friend a colleague someone to embrace or to give him a look or to signify that he was still loved or hell that he was still alive but everywhere in the office the other agents seemed preoccupied a kind of hush had fallen over them yeah sure i get it he thought he went to find doris drabney sitting stiffly at her desk yes yes youve got lets see youve got to sign this and this andoh yes this numbly he signed the forms one had to do with his government credit union account one had to do with his geico insurance policy which would cease to be in effect thirty days from today and one required a formal acknowledgment that he was being placed on indefinite leave without pay pending a meeting of the review board in re his case blah blah blah is that it thats it youll be notified of the hearing im history he thought and your last paycheck is being held until you return the pistol what nick that smith wesson model you lost during the incident of the speech that was government property remember you filed a lostlineofduty item report and it was turned down i sent the response to you in arkansas youre being billed for the pistol its four hundred fiftyfive dollars he just looked at her its probably an ingot mulched in with bob swaggers bones he thought or somewhere in a soggy swamp or in some ocean somewhere wherever bob had been before he died he turned to leave oh and youre supposed to see sally ellion in records too ach sally she was a slight pretty very southern girl with what people all called personality shed had a hundred boyfriends in her time and was always dumping one for another and then the new one hed always liked her somehow even if she scared him a little bit what on earth could she want now what for i havent the slightest so it came down to this last thing he went to find the young woman who of course was on break and had to wait for half an hour feeling stupid and preposterous until she came back from the cafeteria at last she hove into sight beaming pep with a small roll in her shoulders as she walked shed probably had a date every night in her life nick thought her saturday nights were one long festival she probably dated quarterbacks and shortstops looking at her he sank a bit deeper into his depression hi uh sally uh someone said nick hi did i keep you waiting gosh im sorry those fingerprint techs they just wouldnt let me get out of the cafeteria great hed been hung up here like a fish on a line howards newest trophy for the office to admire while those lazy clowns were trying to make time with sal well anyway she went on i have this thing for you it just came in today where have you been i called out to arkansas yesterday and they said youd gone but you didnt check in last night uh i sort of awarded myself a night off you know a little r and r for a job well done shhhhh she said dont say that out loud someone might hear you and not realize you were joking im beyond hurt at this point anyway whats up i really have to well its only partially official i wanted to say something to you i just wanted to tell you how much i admired what you did with your wife how you stuck with her i think thats neat not many men would have done such a thing oh said nick taken aback oh well it seemed like the kind of thing you sort of had to do thats all you know i dont like to quit on things i like to stick with them thats all stubborn stupid but stubborn just like a mule she laughed well she said thats neat not many like that lots of people just quit on you ummm nick grunted having run into a conversational brick wall and splatted against it yeah ummm anyhow she said after a minute when it became obvious first of all that she wanted him to say something like gee why dont we go out for lunch or a drink sometime and second of all that he didnt begin to possess the vocabulary for such a thing anyhow i thought you might want to know it came her eyes were bright and sweet she was so pretty it angered him that she should be so pretty on the last day of his career and she was just prattling on about things he didnt understand nick blinked huh you know dont you remember the last time i talked to you he couldnt begin to put it together again in his head you wanted that file from washington but they wouldnt send it because you werent cleared he remembered asking her about it in the hallway at some point or other yeah well i put you in for the clearance you put me in he asked incredulously but that needs a supervisors signature and uh i mean oh mr utey signed it he wasnt sure what it was and anyway he was so busy i dont think he cared and you were his righthand man and everything it suddenly occurred to him with a stupendous flash that sally ellion was so busy being the offices favorite girl that she hadnt caught on quite yet to the fact that hed gotten the sack she smiled again and you got it the clearance uh huh he said not quite sure where this was going and so they just authorized a printout i just got it from the printing room she handed him a thick sheaf of computerprinted paper it was marked top secretsenior supervisory personnel only nick looked at it it was the ramdyne file chapter twentyfour shreck alone in his office now was surprised how little elation he felt it reminded him of the way it was when he came off a hill in korea in when he was seventeen years old not relief not guilt just simple numbness he knew it was classic postcombat stress syndrome depletion emotional and physical and as you recharged you went into a kind of torpid state but it had only happened to him that one time in korea because he was so new to it in all his other operations as they wound into the triumph or bitterness but always survival hed felt incredibly lightened charged made whole again this fucker swagger had really gotten under his skin a tough guy a dangerous guy just the sort of guy who could bring it all down when the phone call finally came it was something of an anticlimax dobbler had managed to meet the bureau contact without difficulty and was handed the actual forensic lab report complete with x rays from then on dobbler just babbled to shreck couldnt control himself spoke too plainly dithered and yammered too much but the gist got through the x rays checked everything was fine bob was dead it was over shreck felt some lightening of feeling but not much he was not a man of many pleasures only duty and mission were pleasures but this really was his finest triumph he thought maybe hed go shoot sporting clays this weekend maybe hed buy a new car but mainly he wanted to the secure phone rang he looked at it for a long second before picking it up shreck it was hugh meachum colonel we have a problem lancer clearance necessary if you are not lancer cleared immediately return this file to its jacket secure it and return it to its point of origin you must notify the lancer committee if you have encountered this file in an unauthorized method nick looked at it dumbly in his years in the bureau hed bumped into a few strange commands but hed never hit this one before he blinked but the warning would not go away there it was big as life all caps booming out at him he felt extremely guilty practically from birth nick had obeyed rules signs orders directions speed limits legal technicalities everything yet at the same time the illicit thrill of what he was about to do was giddy and sweet even if it brought his breath from his lungs and made his head ache where hed smashed it against the truck door he sat in his basement it was well past nine and after waiting all afternoon hed at last come down the stairs turned on the overhead light and settled into an old lawn chair the air smelled of moisture and wood and oil the bare bulb wobbled slightly there was no other sound lancer he thought taking one more deep breath lancer he knew that in their many years of uneasy operational coexistence the bureau and the agency had many times bumbled into each other and sometimes under strict control at least in theory the agency would do something that was technically in violation of the law thus the lancer committee had to be that elite group in high bureau quarters that was kept informed of these transgressions and made certain that no bureau operatives moved forward aggressively to apprehend the perpetrator thereby blowing an agency scam or endangering agency personnel thats what he guessed the lancer committee to be and as he looked at the early documents before him he could see that the lancer committee had quite early on declared its power lancer advises no further action in this matter national security interests are at stake refer to annex b was one of the first such decrees dating from when agents in los angeles had uncovered a warehouse full of fifteen hundred armalite rifles headed for the presidential guard of the then obscure country of south vietnam perusing the material nick saw that the warehouse was owned by something called ramdyne security with an address in miami he whistled he knew the armalite was the early name for the rifle that was later called the m when it was adopted by the united states army and marine corps whoever could get armalites in such numbers before they were officially adopted a knew they were going to be adopted and b put some big money up front who would that be only one answer so that meant ramdyne was cia or did it as he paged through the documents lancer advises no further action in this matter national security is at stake refer to annex b suddenly began happening all over the place ramdyne security and lancer committee had a very busy time of it in the late sixties and early seventies the imprimatur was showing up on air america shipments from bangkok to manila and not for envelopes nick guessed ramdyne security had a contract to import swedish ks to something called the special operations group sog up near the laotian border ramdyne security bought ten thousand surplus m carbines from the republic of taiwan and shipped them to phnom penh cambodia for unspecified use ramdyne security imported two thousand pairs of hiatts handcuffs to the saigon police force ramdyne security shipped fifty obsolete t trainers to the cambodian air force ramdyne grew and grew and prospered as the war expanded but by the mid to late seventies the action had moved elsewhere riffling through the material nick was fascinated to see that ramdyne had connections in the middle east for example it served as a conduit for the shorty ms that showed up in the hands of israeli commandos at entebbe and for much of the sophisticated electronics that was the specialty of the israeli air force who are they nick wondered because he saw at a glance that although just about everything that ramdyne did was conceived in such a way as to advance american interests it also involved large sums of money for equipment training or expertise in in war well not exactly what ramdyne sold was something that although it was the essence of war wasnt war itself and it certainly wasnt standard military doctrine no it was something different a purer distillation of a governments role on earth ramdyne sold force that was it guns torture interrogation police methods financial transfers avionics whateveralways force the way in which an unpopular government stays in power or a shaky one consolidates its power or an isolated one fights off enemies several times its size ramdyne had no neurosis about the use of force but who was ramdyne it couldnt quite be the agency too much money too shady nick could see how ramdyne could help the agency in its aims without ever truly becoming the agency there would be a strange relationship between them one would feed on the other but who was ramdyne the only clue lancer ever offered was tantalizing ramdyne info contained in annex b lancer told one bureau request which is most top secret and for dispersal on a needtoknow basis only annex b again thought nick damn would i like to get my hands on annex b ramdyne began to move into central america in the early eighties lancer advises no further action in this matter national security is at stake refer to annex b it appeared on a shipment of fléchette munitions on the way to guatemala city presumably for use by contras in the war against the sandinistas a crate full of fléchette bombs had accidentally broken open at kennedy airport in new york it was at that time illegal to export fléchette munitions as they were one of the bestkept secrets of the war the plastic darts didnt show up on x rays so doctors couldnt operate to remove the shrapnel so the wounded didnt heal so the sandinista medical infrastructure was theoretically stressed out the box under the guise of medical shipments was being exported by ramdyne security next was a shipment of interrogation electrodes cattle prods whips truncheons and pr batons for pakistan but customs had intercepted the material in new york and alerted the bureau lancer advises no further action in this matter national security is at stake refer to annex b the shipment was being sent by ramdyne security of st paul minnesota nick memphis turned the page and then he came up against ramdyne at its classic and at last he understood it was ramdynes involvement with the elite hunter battalion of the salvadoran airborne rangers nicknamed los gatos negros and so it was that nick memphis saw what ramdyne was selling it was he realized something more than force or if it had just been force in the beginning it had transmuted into something else he read about panther battalion and he began to cry it was a fine gay day dobbler hadnt been out in ages in decades hed been a hermit a vampire living only on artificial light and information but now he was outside for the first time since the events in new orleans and the sky was filled with woolly clouds and an orange smear of sun settled toward the horizon it was the magic hour just before full twilight when perfect clarity washes the world clean of its blemishes the doctor breathed deeply enjoying the sweetness in the air he let the sun caress him he was walking along the lip of bank that flanks the jefferson memorial in washington dc around him like soldiers at parade rest a thousand japanese cherry trees stood heavy with leaf the water was deep gray and calm in the distance he could see the lincoln memorial another temple to a dead president and in another direction the washington monument that blank white spire but dobbler was not thinking of dead presidents and their roman temples or obelisks nor of cherry trees he was not thinking of the setting sun or the pulsating traffic or anything at all like that though he enjoyed them all he was thinking of teeth glorious glorious teeth teeth that never lie that cannot lie that are incapable of deceit for he had them now in his briefcase and would not let them go he had survived the teeth were not actually in the briefcase of course what lay inside were bob swaggers dental x rays taken from his dentist in blue eye arkansas and forensic x rays of the blackened jaws found in the ashes of the aurora baptist church as taken by the sublimely gifted technicians of the federal bureau of investigation crime lab in washington dc not a mile as the crow flew from where dobbler now trod but neither the doctor nor colonel shreck had trusted the technicians they had waited patiently until the right time and then the colonel made one of his magic phone calls to someone dobbler didnt even want to know who and dobbler went to washington hed just gotten the two sets of x rays and a more formal examination awaited them back at ramdyne but he couldnt wait hed stolen into a public mens room and pressed the two plastic membranes against the fluorescent lights one by one he had chalked off the similarities yes yes there were three fillings on the lefthand side in the second molar the canine and the incisor yes the first took the rough configuration of a star the second was smaller shaped roughly like an hourglass and the third looked like the map of sicily then there was the same slightly collapsed left lower jaw where three teeth for some unknown architectural reason had sadly collapsed inward just a bit with the middle one slightly twisted those were the major parallels and he could see about a thousand minor ones in fact you could lay one x ray over the other and though the scale was slightly off it was obvious that the same mouth had been photographed that was it a man may lie to his psychiatrist his doctor his wife his employer to god and to mom but his teeth tell all they cannot lie they yield all secrets they confess they are unambiguous so dobbler had called colonel shreck and then wandered across the mall and over to the tidal basin it was time to enjoy life which suddenly seemed mudluscious with possibility the whole world beckoned offering its pleasures to dr dobbler he was purely sheerly happy dr dobbler dobbler turned at his name stunned that anyone knew him and saw only a gray sedan unremarkable and in it a man who was also unremarkable but tough and coplike whom he recognized from ramdyne dr dobbler colonel shreck sent us they need you but dobbler raised his briefcase as if to protest and ward them off see its in here he wanted to say its over the evidence that its over finally is in here we got some big problems said the man and dobbler read fear in his eyes it was technically the fourth battalion airranger of the first brigade airranger of the elite acatatl division but everybody called it panther battalion nick read on in april of the unit some men a tough blooded junglewarfarecentertrained elite of the salvadoran armed forces had been pulled from frontline antiguerrilla duty in the mountains for an intensive course in psychological warfare techniques because at the time the press was especially suspicious of the presidents wild popularity in the wake of the persian gulf war it was being extremely vigilant and cynical about american military aid to foreign countries so the contract couldnt be taken on by certified american military or cia special operations people through an elaborate scheme of diverted funds this ramdyne outfit had gotten the contract and for a month in an isolated jungle area ramdyne operatives veterans of some of the gaudiest special operations in history had schooled the young latinos in interrogation techniques population control intelligence gathering ambush and counterambush sniping and countersniping a whole crash course in the dirty nittygritty of lowintensity warfare but there was a weird chemistry loose in that encampment unconfirmed reports insist read the fbi investigation which was forwarded to the senate intelligence committee but never put on the record as being too sensitive that american trainers exhorted these young soldiers with voodoo rituals thoughtcontrol processes and animal sacrifices that went well beyond the range of normal professional military training the file identified several of the trainers and as nick gazed at the abstracted dossiers he saw nothing that surprised him the trainers were drawn from the various american elite units that had fought secret battles all around the world since the war in vietnam the honcho appeared to be an exgreen beret lieutenant colonel named raymond shreck of pottstown pennsylvania a heavily decorated veteran of korea where he had been the youngest master sergeant in the united states army at nineteen an early green beret whod helped train the bay of pigs volunteers in the early sixties when he was a young major and a heavyaction threetour nam vet until in hed been courtmartialed for torturing suspected viet cong agents somehow the agency had taken care of him he joined ramdyne the next year his numberone man was master sergeant john d jack payneo payne of new york new york a former special forces noncommissioned officer also with an extraordinary combat record in vietnam after the war however he had trouble readjusting to duties was nabbed in an elaborate scheme to defraud the px out of several thousand dollars and in lieu of a jail sentence and a dishonorable discharge took an early retirement in ill bet youre a couple of tough pricks thought nick so maybe payne and shreck pissed off the way their careers had gone bellyup with their extraordinary records in combat and their flatout willingness to go all the way were the true authors of what happened next but there were other authors as well there was the increasingly hysterical rightwing fervor of the government of el salvador there was a stunning leftist victory where a battalion of government troops had gone to sleep without putting out perimeter security and got badly shot up the next morning losing twentyeight men all of them in front of american network news cameras there was the pressure from washington for results results results something to show that american policy was working and there was the anger the fear the bravado of panther battalion itself on june panther battalion was airlifted from its secret mountain training camp into ocalupo valley three hundred miles away to conduct operations against a wellestablished guerrilla infrastructure as the panthers so called because of their black and green striped jungle fatigues and their black berets moved into the village of cuembo they came under sporadic sniper fire from a tree line flanking the village the commander brigadier general esteban garcia de rujijo sent a reconnaissance squad into the village moving through the village square the recon squad was caught in a clever crossfire two automatic weapons killed every single man the guerrillas then mutilated the corpses and moved out it was the village of cuembo that felt the full rage of panther battalion later but unconfirmed reports insisted that american training officers accompanied panther battalion into cuembo but this was never proved what is beyond dispute is that within the space of two hours on the afternoon of june panther battalion killed over two hundred men women and children they were herded to the banks of the sampul river and there machinegunned by the panthers automatic weapons dead children floated in the sampul for days he made a face and blinked realizing that either out of rage or horror hed begun to weep shaking he turned to the last page no it wasnt the famous annex b which was presumably locked up somewhere in the national security office or the pentagon or fbi headquarters or out at langley but it was something quite interesting nevertheless it was an export order for an electrotek amsat lcl series directional electronic intercept vehicle on consignment to salvadoran military intelligence cleared by customs as delivered by ramdyne it was the kind of thing that could enable men in it to listen to a desperate man in a hotel room call fbi headquarters in new orleans and ask for one nick memphis and then go in and hack him to death with axes lancer advises no further action said the stamp national security is at stake refer to annex b it was a war party shreck the hardlooking black man who was called morgan state and the serious hatcher were waiting for him colonel shreck i listen to me dobbler i need a fast assessment try not to get this one wrong shrecks face was hooded and taut he looked like the statue of a violent medieval german knight in the armor room of the metropolitan museum of art that had briefly fascinated dobbler when he was a child just before swagger was killed he spent some time in that truck with an fbi agent now what i have to know would he have talked as we break the incident down they were not together more than four minutes all of it highly stressed is it possible that during that period of time swagger could have told the agent something convinced him of certain things ah said dobbler stalling for time but then no no its not probable swagger was a private taciturn man we saw it here and he couldnt have trusted anyone and he couldnt have known who it was hed have picked up no its not likely possibly he passed him something said morgan state but colonel shreck there was no direct link to us we operated under dummy institutions and left no trail what could swagger have known the colonel nodded imperceptibly may i ask whats happening dobbler said tell him shreck said to hatcher weve learned from a friend that an fbi special agent named nicholas memphis the agent swagger kidnapped has requested access to the fbis ramdyne file its exactly the sort of thing that lancer is supposed to protect us from and somehow stupidly incredibly by one of those bureaucratic screwups that happen the transmission was authorized he has the file he knew swagger and he has the file good lord said dobbler a cold stab of fear coming into him could he go to the press or to a politician or to it doesnt matter said shreck impatiently turning to morgan state get payne tell him we want this memphis taken interrogated and all his secrets removed then payne can kill him chapter twentyfive the phone was ringing nick stopped drying his breakfast dishes and went to pick it up yeah nick uh yeah the voice a females had a familiar lilt to it nick its sally ellion in rec sure hi whats up nick youve got me in so much trouble she was whispering oh the file i didnt know you were on suspension ah yeah yeah it was crummy of me not to tell you im very sorry it wasnt honest behavior i just had this damn case i was really hot to clear i thoughtoh it was so stupid i thought in my time off id just be able to concentrate on it nick ive got a directive to return that file by special courier instantly oh jesus i hope youre not in any trouble i have to have that file back you werent even supposed to leave the building with it yeah but since i couldnt stay in the building i couldnt read it there could i anyway sally im very sorry to have disappointed you im done with it ill leave in ten minutes and have it back to you in an hour okay and could this be our little secret i mean the fact that i actually looked at it oh yes it has to be i cant tell them you left the building with it please hurry im on my way nick showered quickly and put on a gray suit in a strange way it pleased him to have some mission in life even if it was only to deliver the file hed been turning over what hed learned in his head he remembered the strange message the man who may have been the salvadoran secret policeman eduardo lanzman had crawled into the bathroom to leave for him rom do was the message in the blood in the split second before it was obliterated possibly the beginnings of the words romeo dog which was earlysixties army radio code for the letters r and d and the bay of pigs invasion force call sign in r and d ram and dyne ramdyne it was almost something but it was still nothing why didnt he write ra dy why rom do what was there about the radio codes of the bay of pigs if it was from the bay of pigs he shook his head feeling an ache begin in it somewhere he now believed that he had an indication but no legally constituted evidence another matter entirely that this ramdyne was in some way involved in the murder of eduardo lanzman and possibly the murder therefore of archbishop jorge roberto lopez he knew hed ventured into very hazy areas the vaunted wilderness of mirrors where it was possible to lose your bearings in a second and become so riddled with paranoia that nothing made sense anymore everything in him told him to back off it was none of his business but the ideathose guys running around on their own special mission who watched them who paid them shreck payne the others to whom did they give their accounts to some lancer committee who founded them where did they come from in the year suddenly rich and influential enough to get the deal going with fifteen hundred armalite rifles who were they annex b would tell him ive got to get annex b he told himself but what the fuck is annex b there he goes said tommy montoya in the van thats my little nicky jack payne watching through the scope as nick memphis walked from his little suburban house to his dodge and climbed in just grunted take him now payneo asked tommy no theyre expecting him let him return the fucking file then well nail him on the way out what i want is someone in his house hes got to have a piece in there if it aint a piece hell have a kitchen knife or a razor or something i want it lifted well use it when we chill his bones out after our little chat jack man its no sweat i can do the house said one of the other team members yeah pony thats fine you do it well wait on you you dont want to tail him asked mr ed the driver nah let pony get into the house and pick out a nice toy no prints now pony you got that sí jack sure got it okay go to it son pony stepped out of the back of the electrotek surveillance van parked a discreet distance down from memphiss house jack watched him go he was dressed like a workman he went to the house knocked on the door then blandly went around back hell get in said edwards always called mr ed i seen him do locks hes like a fucking genius with locks great said jack it was true pony was back in thirty minutes his trophy was a little parkerized colt agent payne wearing plastic gloves popped it open and gently plucked one round out ooooo he said glaser safeties looking at the bluetipped bullet nested in the brass case and imagining the clusters of lead suspended like bunches of grapes inside the jacket these nasty suckers make instant spaghetti he said oh nicky said tommy montoya you in the shit now my friend hi i shhhhhh she whispered her small pretty face knitting in anger put it there she commanded in the same conspiratorial whisper yeah sure he set the box with the ramdyne file on her desk and backed away she didnt look at it directly he just stood there and could feel the sense of furious betrayal radiating off her neck which was all he could see sally im and finally she looked up her face was compressed with pain she was trying to show him how much hed hurt her hurt her he didnt even know her the abrupt envelope of intimacy somewhat befuddled him it occurred to him suddenly that this pretty idiotic girl conceived herself as being in love with him one of those crush things nurtured from afar down through the months he could not have begun to engineer such a turn of events and now that it was here it embarrassed him he felt as if hed trounced on a fragile secret thing of hers he felt unworthy but also irritated hey i never knew i meant anything to you do you see did you have any trouble she finally asked i mean getting back into the building no no you know its funny even though i dont have an id or anything they just let me back in you know whats his name paul on security he just waved mildly like he has every day for the past four years i guess some people didnt get the word ill say he let the silence sit between them for a while trying to figure out how to deflate it im sorry he finally said i should have told you this case was tantalizing me though it had nothing to do with my screwups of the last two months i just hated to let the goddamn thing die even if the career was shot you handed me the damned file i just didnt have the strength to walk away from it she swallowed im sorry for what theyre doing to you im sure its not your fault ahh it is i thought i was so smart and i just kept blowing it look i have to get out of here before i get you in any trouble youll be okay i think so as long as i get it back to them by tomorrow and i have to sign a form saying it never left the office so you have to lie for me yes see im great luck for women look sally it was a crummy thing to do i apologize could i i dont know make it up would you like me to buy you dinner or something i have a date tonight sure i understand okay im sorry again now ill get out of i dont have one tomorrow night oh uh well then um can i pick you up in front of the building here at say six maybe well go down to the quarter and get oysters before it fills up with tourists six she said and dont worry about the lying its no problem thanks sal thanks a lot it was a glorious day out nick walked through the tall buildings of downtown new orleans he had nothing to do and nothing but time to fill so taskoriented all his life he suddenly felt buoyant exhilarated he thought he might walk on down to the quarter now have a nice lunch then head on back to the house and take a nap he felt cured of his depression he had a date with an attractive girl he was still young enough he knew people hed be all right hey maybe this wouldnt suck so bad after all he had enough money to get through another couple of weeks or so live a little nick dont have to be a feeb grind your whole life maybe sally would find him attractive maybe she wouldnt if it happened it happened but a world had just opened up amazing how good a womans smile can make you feel it was at this moment in his ruminations he was lost in the shadows of the tall commercial buildings and jostled by the anonymous lunchtime crowds that he heard his name called nicky hey nicky nicky he turned to see his old snitch tommy montoya broadcasting latino animal magnetism his neck swimming in gold chain tommy he called tommy damn im glad to see you hey i was going to call you hey you got a moment i got some stuff i want to ask you sure nicky no problem man nick stepped toward tommy and in an instant three other men were on him crushing inward roughly hey what the they went for his arms he thrashed thought he caught one with an elbow in the face but as they crunched in upon him all their huge weight just pressing against him there came the prick of a needle through his suit coat into his lower back and suddenly his legs lost their purchase on the earth he lurched forward through swirls of light and had the vaguest idea of sleep and surrender while he knew he was falling he seemed to fall for quite a while and had only the vaguest impression of a van pulling up nick awoke in darkness on the dirty floor of the van he could hear the sawing of crickets and somehow he sensed a fetid overhanging jungle atmosphere he tried to sit up but handcuffs had him manacled his head felt as if someone had hydraulically pumped six tons of plastic waste in through his nostrils payneo hes come to oh great hi ya nicky how ya feel man that sodium pentothal hits like a fucking truck dont it who the fuck are you just working stiffs sonny get him up right payneo the name payneo it was so familiar rough pairs of hands lifted nick a flashlight beam hit him in the eyes his head throbbed he could make out the shadows of four men you know what weve been talking about how fast youd see things our way and cooperate with us im of the opinion that a good scout like you would see the error of his ways and come clean tommy here says youre going to be a stubborn motherfucker giving us grief the whole night long but you know what nick it dont matter we got plenty of time and no other place to be and remember this everybody always talks nobodys a hero tommys a piece of shit nicky i always liked you you piece of shit nick yelled oh nicks a tough boy aint he said the heavyset smaller man nick could see a tapestry of blue ink embossed on his thick arms he remembered the ramdyne file payneo youre payne right the green beret you were at the massacre on the sampul river man you must be real proud of yourself you piece of shit oh nick nick nick that was a wonderful job of work we killed two hundred communists that day so that fat assholes like you could rest in your fat little country not a thought in their heads he laughed an awful laugh nick thats what we do you know thats our job payneo you oughtnt to tell him oh we can trust nick with all our secrets cant we nick nicks one of the good scouts right fuck you payne said nick liberated by the drunken freedom of the drug still in his system you let me out of these cuffs man ill tear your fucking heart out your specialty is machinegunning kids i read the file let me tell you motherfucker id like to match you against an fbi swat team instead of women and kids in a river wed teach you something you didnt know about rock and roll motherfucker nick was really screaming payne laughed tommy laughed nick looked beyond him and saw the darkness and the stillness of the louisiana bayou god knew where they were miles and miles beyond civilization there was no help or mercy he saw his own car parked just outside he knew what that meant it meant they would kill him in some way made to approximate a suicide and the car had to be there to explain how hed gotten out there now nick this can go hard or it can go easy whats it going to be either way its fucking curtains for me sucker not necessarily said tommy when we make you see how were operating in national security you may even want to join us we do what has to be done you better be fucking glad somebody in this fucking country is were like the fucking roman centurions man we keep the barbarians away isnt that right payneo hes got that right shitasses like you always say youre doing something for the country youre the barbarians motherfucker then nick spat in paynes face something awesome and rhinolike flared in payne even in the darkness nick could sense the surge of naked rage at that second payne wanted to rip his eyes out but he regained his professional control and wiped the phlegm off his forehead payneo said one of the other guys he aint gonna volunteer any info paynes eyes narrowed yeah shit youre right that stretches it out but its fastest up front so shoot him up nick felt his jacket sleeve being shoved up oh nick have we got a tongue loosener for you he felt the prick of a needle its long slide into his vein and the odd largeness as whatever was injected into him filled his veins okay nick just relax let it happen tommy said nick tried to fight it its very sophisticated stuff phenobarbitalb an advanced compound state of the art for cia interrogations go ahead fight it the more you fight the more you talk nick felt nothing then he felt everything lights were going on then going off he felt his will shredding he felt it going away in his weakness and terror he yearned only to please now nick came the voice from very far away nick nick nick tell us a story got the tape going pony its on nick howd you first hear of ramdyne nick tried to find a way to resist but the point of it seemed quite ridiculous why not give them what they wanted everybody did i i thats right go on i was on surveillance with the secret service prior to flashlights visit um one of their agents mentioned that ramdyne exported the big surveillance rigs to central american governments and id been looking for some way and with that he was gone he talked and talked and talked he couldnt shut up it just came out of him it was like a purging all the information hed stored all his doubts about bob lee swaggers guilt all his fears his terror worst of all of his own inadequacy it all came out of him he talked for days for years in the end he wore them out he beat them by talking it was dawn the crickets had shut up even he outtalked the crickets outside the sun was rising turning the day pale and green outside nick could see everything was green it was a wild driven craze of green a dangerous green they were near a river or a swamp there were trees everywhere the road was a dirt track he was tired he was so tired now all he wanted to do was rest but they had him up i just want to sleep he said nah you want to go to the bathroom right said tommy nah i wanna sleep shit walk him around okay you got it all payneo hey can you think of anything i left out this guy would sing the birdies out of the sky now ah let me see let me check the list its all checked off its all on the list okay you know the drill tommy hes your buddy you handle it pony you stay with him well leave you here you wait till he pisses meanwhile i gotta get the tape back asap you got it payneo still crushed by the drug nick could at least put it together he had no will and he had no pride what are you gonna do to me he asked what do you think fuck said payne you crossed the line you been amessin where you shouldnt a been amessin and now the boots are gonna walk all over you someones still got to do the hard thing you little shit you didnt have to find out about it it was your choice but now youre the hard thing kid national security at risk lancer committee requests no further action be taken refer to annex b nick quoted but the irony was lost on them the two of them got into the surveillance van and drove away nick watched as the van disappeared down the dirt road leaving a skirt of dust in the empty air nick looked around it was quite a beautiful place actually completely deserted but a kind of river basin where the swamp momentarily yielded to a broad yellowgreen meadow a few hundred yards away the trees were dense and the land looked soupy here in the fragrant morning the land was solid his car was parked over there and another one nick turned tommy and the other guy were eyeing him balefully he twisted on his cuffs they would not give he could run but to where there was no place to run to this is all wrong he said i havent done anything it aint about doing things wrong its about knowing too much its how these things work man its how they always work said tommy you want a coke or a cup of coffee we have a thermos nicky no nicky i hate to tell you you aint no superman youre gonna have to piss sooner or later its the nature of the beast whats with the pissing he asked you got too high a concentration of phenob in you you piss it gets down to levels where it cant be spotted see thats why we got to wait sorry about it enjoy the morning just relax it aint gonna be nothing easy for you to say nicky i seen a lot of guys check out and my time will come soon enough so lets just get through it as quickly and easily as possible dont cry or beg or nothing fuck you im not going to cry or beg usually they do said pony usually they do nick waited until his bladder betrayed him it had to finally he fought it but then tommy said hey why put yourself through that it aint gonna matter much really i mean is it so finally he said it have to go undo my hands no can do pard you know that pony undo his pants for him dont touch him let it be natural god he hated them it was the little touches of solicitousness the softly remorseless way in which they did their job pony young and muscular and vaguely latino undid his pants he was able to urinate himself dry a last long dying are of life in the bright morning light in the blazing green of the swamp okay he finally said fuck you get it fucking over with they zipped and buttoned him up and led him down to the river it lapped against the mud a dragonfly flashed in the sun big and prehistoric like something liberated from a million or so years in amber nick was pushed to his knees he felt a belt being strapped around his waist then his left arm suddenly wore a new manacle something attached to the belt jesus they had equipment for this thats how thought out it was how perfect they had a drill theyd done it a thousand times something was thrust into his hand his fingers recognized the familiar contours of his colt agent he tried to pull the trigger but it wouldnt budge they had something wedged under it he felt a binding of tape being wound about his knuckles locking the small pistol in his grip hold his head back pony tommy said pony grabbed nick by his hair and pulled his head back it fucking hurt you motherfucking pricks he screamed god dont do this to me dont do this to me tommy christ please i was your buddy no nicky you was just a fed man i cant cut you no slack i got my job to do man nick heard a click behind him and the first set of cuffs came away freeing his right arm but immediately it was ridden into submission by the full force and thrust of tommy montoya at his right okay nicky dont fight me over in a second please dont do this nick begged okay nicky up we go the man forced nicks arm upward in an arc curving the hand toward nicks temple his own hand was his enemy nick fought with all the strength he had but the two men stood over him in postures that put the complete physics of leverage on their side he saw his hand rise toward his head guided by both muscular arms of his murderer it was clear how it had to go the arm would rise until the muzzle touched his temple then tommy would pull whatever hed wedged behind the trigger a ramdyne improvised suicide replication plug part number from the ramdyne catalog available to your friendly secret police force no doubt and crush nicks trigger finger the gun would blow nicks brains out hed be found in the weeds by the river his hand locked around his own pistol his own car close at hand thered be no other physical evidence theyd thought of everything it was so fucking professional nick strained against his own hand oh jesus oh christ dont do this just ah almost there dont fight it goddammit dont fight it and the gun rose and rose until at last nick felt it touch the fragile shell of his temple it felt like somebody pressing a penny against him through his strained peripheral vision he could see tommy laboriously working on the gun getting his own gloved finger half into the trigger guard making ready to pull the plug watch yourself pony tommy said warning his partner to steer clear of spatter ive almost got it ah tommy montoyas head exploded the sound of the report reached them across the river a cloud of angry white birds rose as one in clattering agitation rudely bumped from their perches by the rifle shot nick freed of half his constraint turned to the other man pony who stood still stupefied not getting it but nick got it youre dead motherfucker he said and at that precise instant the second bullet found pony center chest blowing through his heart he pirouetted to the ground the destroyed heart spurting blood as he fell the birds cawed and seethed in the air the wind rose and whistled nick sat back his arm ached he wanted to throw away the pistol but couldnt because it was taped to his hand he figured the key would be somewhere on these two clowns he looked around and saw a man wading across the river he was tall and rangy and tan beardless now in blue jeans and a tired blue denim shirt he wore a baseball cap that said razorbacks on it he had harsh gray squirrelshooters eyes unmirthful focused unafraid his mouth was grim he was quite tall he carried a fatbarreled remington rifle with about a yard of scope atop it he carried it like a man who knew a little something about rifles he walked up to nick mornin pork said bob the nailer chapter twentysix nick looked at him with lovefilled moronic eyes youre some sorry sight sonny said bob chained and trussed like a coon in a bag after a hunt those boys were about to have your pattycake butt for breakfast nick watched him go over to each of the bodies and search them for keys and papers he plucked two keys out of the late tommy montoyas pocket and came back over to take the cuffs off nick goddamn he said in disgust these boys even had a rig for phony suicide he stripped the tape from nicks fist nick kept looking at him stupidly while he freed the little colt agent it fell to the earth swagger bent and picked it up youre not going to shoot me with this little bitty gun are you pork i couldnt be sure the last time dumbly nick shook his head here dont lose it now come on boy weve got to get these two pieces of human shit into the water and more or less sanitize this area you dont want the louisiana state police on your ass do you i sure dont no sir ive seen enough damn police to last me a century with that he laid his rifle down on the hood of nicks car and bent to one of the two bodies as he bent nick saw that he had a colt automatic wedged cocked and locked into his jeans in a high hipcarry holster the pistol was a custom job with low mount sights and neoprene combat grips it was the sort of pistol a man who has thought a lot about pistols might carry as were the three spare magazines in sparks mag holders on the other high hip bob pulled each of the bodies to the lip of the river and launched them with no ceremony at all they sailed sluggishly out into the current held afloat by the bladders of air trapped in their clothes each man trailed a slick of blood were going to make some damn gators happy today thats for sure bob said now come on boy dont just sit there like a toad on a rock get a move on but nick had lapsed into some kind of poststress letdown and was incapable of operating rationally he just stared at bob eyes wide open mouth agape while bob went to the mens station wagon finding nothing to interest him he turned the key gunned the engine drove off the dirt road aimed at the swamp stepped out of the car and bent over and with one hand gave the gas pedal a goose the car took off with a squeal blew through some weeds sloshed into the river and disappeared under the surface in a commotion of bubbles and oil stains he turned now your car sonny cant leave evidence ill buy you a new one some day okay nick watched him repeat the ritual and his little dodge once the pride of his life disappeared in the black quiet water okay boy take a last quick gander police up anything that doesnt belong come on boy just dont sit there like somethings got a hold on your pecker do something shit you are some kind of lazyass yankee dead dick by this time nick could get himself up but he didnt answer and he left it to bob to do most of the checking okay time to take the freedom bird back to the world they walked a half mile down the road and found a white pickup pulled off under some trees nick still silent climbed in carefully bob drew a rifle case out from behind the backseat wiped down and inserted his remington then climbed into the drivers seat put your seat belt on dammit he said im not having you crash through the damned windshield nick stared ahead not registering anything as the swamp gave way to fields to crops on they drove through louisiana in bobs white rattling pickup leaving the bayous and new orleans miles and miles behind finally bob asked hungry theres a goddamned sandwich behind the seat and a thermos of coffee im all right said nick they were his first three words an hour later just past the arkansas line they stopped at a diner by the roadside in a town called annalisle need a burger said bob hungry he got out of the car and went in nick watched him walk he never looked back his eyes kept straight ahead his shoulders gunnerysergeant erect his bearing precise nick stirred himself at last and followed bob was sitting in a booth at the far end by himself a girl came and they ordered a burger and coffee for bob and scrambled eggs for nick nick spoke at last thanks that was fantastic shooting i had to wait till the light was on them properly bob said i wanted to shoot out of the sun i was afraid the damn birds would take off and tell them where i was but it worked out how do you throw a bolt so fast practice son ive done some rifle shooting over the years i saw you die i saw the flames at the church i was there when they found the body son the closest i came to dying was when i walked away from you and you had that bitty little colt you were the only man that had me that day i dont id been there over three days the body you found belonged to a sad old boy named bo stark dead by his own hand in a garage in little rock and buried in the aurora redemption baptist graveyard by myself and the reverend mr harris last year a few months before all this started but the dental rec bo went to my same dentist doc lemieux night before all that at the health complex i broke in and just switched his x rays with mine easy as you please because doc lemieux just has pasteon labels on the files old bo finally did somebody some good in the world even if it was a few months after he departed it the flames you were in i wasnt in anything memphis as that church burned i was twenty feet below it and a hundred feet to the west in a limestone cave drinking an rc cola and eating a moon pie theres a trapdoor under the altar built back in the days when some people ran runaway slaves up north until they were burned out by some bad old hill boys heard the stories myself from my granddaddy i knew the church would burn i knew it would collapse i knew reverend harris was raising funds to build a new church everybodys happy now you boys especially if you found a body youd not be likely to keep digging through the damned ruins jesus said nick i am a very careful man pork jesus said nick again i had to have the freedom to do some looking into some matters being dead was the only way i could figure and so ive been looking into things and then i decided that i needed help only man i could trust was you because youd had a chance to kill me and didnt so i was going to pay a visit on you at your house only when i got there i saw a fellow driving out in your car he was one of the fellows i saw on a shooting range in maryland some months back was payne there yes thought so said bob that boy gets around payne shot me in new orleans payne shot my dog in blue eye sooner or later time will come to settle up between the two of us the girl brought the food nick found he was ravenous so who were they bob asked do you know nick took some pride in his answer he thought if anything this might impress bob lee swagger its an outfit called ramdyne an agency front i figured agency only agency works that professionally no theyre not agency theyre something else but maybe invented by the agency in the year certainly under the protection of the agency certainly useful to the agency but theyve become something of their own and they take pride in their professionalism and their ability to do the right thing the hard thing motherfuckers ill tell you that been in some shit while you were fighting they were all over nam selling torture instruments and guns to the secret police you got any names for these boys you know payne exgreen beret master sergeant the head man is an exgreen beret colonel toughlooking guy fifties hooded eyes seen some shit in his time ive never seen him his names shreck saw a lot of combat but he was courtmartialed in for torturing vc suspects i can believe that ive met him hardcore the whole way but ramdyne predates shreck he may run it now but it was there before him itsits somehow connected to other stuff i dont quite know what they were up to do you bob laughed i got some ideas so tell me tell it to me all youll never have a better audience all right said bob lets get some coffee to go and ill tell you as we drive they paid for the food and coffee and went back to the truck bob pointed the vehicle north and began to talk beginning with the visit of the men from accutech all those months ago and nick was right he was a great audience he was all ears bob talked for more than an hour and a half now and then nick would interrupt with a question the ammunition in maryland it was accurate beyond factory standards beyond any standards better than my own whoever loaded it knew a thing or two about precision reloading for accuracy do you know who it could be oh i have an idea or two he moved on to other matters why didnt you know you were being set up in new orleans i mean you knew there was some other game going on that they werent quite what they said they were youre right i was a goddamn fool i think i wanted that russian shooter that t solaratov so much it blinded me id been thinking about him for so many years not knowing who he was only what hed done but just dreaming about going up against him so i got careless and i got greedy its killed more than one man and it sure as hell nearly killed me was there a solaratov does he really exist i sure dont know what i do know is that these boys must have studied me like a bug on a pin for a long long time thats how smart they were they knew how to get inside and turn me like a key burns my ass even now thinking how stupid i was and how those smart boys played i feel like ive been raped from the inside out they probably had a psychiatrist run a study on you cia is heavy into psychiatry now its doctrine and theres a lot of cia doctrine in this ramdyne on the subject of his recuperation bob would say nothing other than that a friend had helped him but nick put it together he knew it was a woman the woman whod called him with that fake countrywestern accent about his ordeals after the bloody escape from new orleans bob was not eloquent yep he said thought my hash was salted many a time but somehow i kept going nick had a funny moment here calculating how he and bob had been weirdly circling each other through this whole damned mess how many times theyd moved through each others wakes he shivered i have to tell you if you ever get caught i cant be of much help if these guys have been as professional as you say they wont have made any mistakes that setup in maryland itll be it is said bob that was my first stop after i died all those signs of that place are gone the trailer that was their headquarters towed away turned out they just took out an option to buy an old shooting club property put up twentyfive thousand dollars then let it lapse its back for sale now didnt surprise me much yeah and on the other hand the forensic and ballistic evidence against you is overwhelming ive read the bureau lab report they got your rifle with your fingerprints and your reloaded cartridge andthe bullet they couldnt read the markings because the bullet was mangled and yeah i saw that in the papers thats why they havent done any shooting tests on the rifle yes if they get to court they dont want to say they tried but couldnt get a match it makes them look bad in front of a jury i get you but they have a very sophisticated test that analyzes the metallic residue left in the gun barrel and it said positively that the bullet that hit the archbishop was consistent with the metallic residue thats going to be hard to beat i figured out how they did it or how it could have been done he explained the concept to nick okay said nick yeah i understand same bullet slightly larger bore paperpatching butyou have to find some way to convince a jury the jury wont be able to follow something that technical theyll just look at the neutron analysis test and mr swagger you are one screwed turkey bob nodded they did a very careful job on me but just maybe nobodys quite as clear on all this as they think let me tell you right now nick said your best course is to hire a good lawyer i can call the bureau and we can work out some kind of deal with my evidence and but bob was just looking at him son i dont think you understand these boys killed my dog im telling you this is the twentieth century you just cant go to war on people not in america and that kind of attitude will now you listen here memphis even if i could walk out on this thing now as a free man i wouldnt those boys would scatter and slip into new identities or whatever it is they do wed never catch them theyre too damned slick theyd have gotten away with it and in a year or so when it was cool theyd be back in business what i mean to do is tether a goat and draw them in theyll think theyre hunting the goat but the goat is hunting them and whos the goat im the damned goat the only thing is this goat has teeth this goat bites now this is hard hairy work memphis theres going to be some shooting and some people are going to die it wont be pretty and well be all alone it is a war i didnt start it but by christ i mean to finish it now pork tell me are you in or are you out nick thought of the piggleam in paynes eye and this ramdyne with its willingness to do the hard thing and he thought of how hed been brutalized and he thought of how confident and smooth and big these guys thought they were and he thought about how theyd committed a war atrocity and gunned down women and kids and he thought about how hed been dying to get back on a swat team okay he said im in something hard and metallic flickered in bobs eye like the shine of a brass cartridge as it catches a glint of light before the bolt locks vaulttight behind it now what asked nick ive got some great ideas about annex b it seems to me hold up there pork first thing is were going to see a man about a rifle chapter twentyseven partial body found in bayou proclaimed the cheerful headline go ahead said shreck read it dobbler squinted the partial body of a man was found floating yesterday near spencerville lafayette parish sheriffs deputies said the victim who has been identified by fingerprints as tomas garcia montoya of mcdonoughville was evidently the subject of an alligator attack as his body from the chest down was missing cause of death however was listed as a gunshot wound to head montoya a cuban émigré had listed his occupation as consultant but was known to police and other new orleans law enforcement agencies as a paid informant he was years old deputies speculated that he may have also been a victim of the escalating drug warfare in the states rural parishes in a struggle for control of the citys drug routes between oldline mob interests and newcomers representing the cocaine cartels of central america montoya was shot in the head by a heavy caliber rifle bullet only a largecaliber center fire rifle bullet does massive damage like that said lafayette parish coroner robert c ladoyne this man was shot judging by the wound channel and tissue displacement by a hollowpoint bullet of caliber or more parish deputies said it may represent the coming of a new kind of professional killer to the parishs drug wars mob boys favor the silenced from close range said deputy ed p st etienne the colombians like little machine pistols and fire a hundred bullets into their victims this boy is something entirely new hes not new to us is he dobbler said the colonel no said dobbler swallowing how on earth hes dead we saw the dobbler snapped the colonel look at me dobbler looked into the colonels forceful dark eyes and felt the full might of his wrath tommy montoya was a freelancer we used when we operated in the south he was with nick memphis now hes dead sniperdead that means one thing and youd better get used to it fast all right comprendez amigo dobbler swallowed miserably yes he said i see swagger is alive how why i dont know i dont even give a fuck because it doesnt matter what matters is this new reality hes teamed with the one man in america outside the proper circles whos seen our file so right from the start he knows more than anybody whos come after us before he looked hard at dobbler in case you dont get it doctor we have a war on our hands this motherfucker wants to track us down and blow us away but what were going to do is blow him away first are you listening here dr harvard psychiatrist no bullshit we have to get close put the muzzle against his head and blast his brains all over the landscape or hell do it to us the colonels glare was unsettling dobbler swallowed what do you want me to what i need from you is an idea how theyll operate their relationship hows it going to play out will they get along will they fight do they make a good team ah said dobbler unprepared ah bob will be the strong one hell dominate the younger man the younger man is no problem bureau trained hell be orthodox and plodding no swagger is dangerous because of the unconventionality of his mind hell come at us out of instinct brilliantly improvising madly hell where will they head bob will head home if he was in new orleans to meet or rescue memphis then hell take him to the ouachitas its where hell feel safest and the sense of safety is the chances of us making an interception are nil not in his territory all right said shreck leaning forward let me ask you a question have you ever hunted hunted good god no i mean its sobarbaric a faint look of distaste came across dobblers face unintended yes well you put all that aside now you just became a hunter its your job to work out a way we can lure this tough old boy and his new pal into ambush hunt him dobbler you dont have to kill him well take care of that but you have to hunt him dobbler nodded apprehensively and he noticed something hed never quite seen before he swallowed shreck is scared some days later nick memphis was in a contrary mood now what the hell is this he said why are we i think i liked you better when you were baby googoo and you just looked up at me with your mouth open now you wont shut up talk talk talk like a woman now dont say nothing here you let me do the damned talking got that i dont want you explaining something to this old coot and putting him into a coma there was no give in bobs voice as he looked through the dustspackled windshield at an extremely spacious ranch house on a spread just outside of fort supply in western oklahoma you better you just smile boy this old man isnt going to want to give up his information easy to strangers but he knows more about what he knows about than any man alive come on now bob got out of the truck he wore a straw stetson and had found a gray jacket to go over his denim shirt suddenly he looked strangely like some kind of cowboy royalty i still dont button it pork youll see an old lady sat in a rocker on the porch at the top of the stairs she just watched them come made no gesture of welcome she fanned herself it was hot and dusty out and the sun lurked over the hills behind a gassy spread of clouds howdy maam bob sung out whachew want the old lady asked see the colonel colonel dont see nobody these days hell i have me a line on a pre in once owned by a famous bad boy thought he might be interested hes got enough guns no such thing as enough guns maam ill beg your pardon for saying so the woman eyed him suspiciously then got her weary body up and yelled inside rate rate you in there fella out here says he gotta line on a well shoo him in then honey came the call from the dark interior bob walked in and nick followed the room was large the man who owned it had at one time or other killed every creature large and dangerous that walked upon the earth and now the heads of his victims looked down upon their slayer who was a plump man in his seventies sitting in an eames chair reading a copy of nick blinked doublechecked to make sure but yes the new york review of books he didnt rise the beasts stared from the walls most of the furniture was wooden and sleek and expensive and indian blankets and pottery were all over the place and so were books hundreds and hundreds of books and rifles nick had never seen so many rifles and so many books in one place before and who might you gentlemen be asked the fellow he removed a blanket from his lap to reveal a sixshooter high chromed sevenandahalfinch barrel and he had merry clever eyes there wasnt a morsel of fear in him anywhere nick had never seen a man who had less fear names bob jennings from over in arkansas do some trading in fine firearms this heres my associate named nick well mr jennings i must say i know most of the fine gun dealers in this country having spent much money in their abodes cant say ive heard much of you im new to the business sir said bob just starting my reputation but you know that fellow the fbi killed that bob swagger that bad boy took that shot at our president and hit a poor cleric instead that old boy yep heard of him well he had a pre rebarreled with a douglas and restocked on a piece of english walnut by loren eccles of chisholm wyoming it was serial number which means it came off the line in about a fine rifle he was a man who much loved fine rifles i just believe he was some say if hed have meant to shoot the president hed have hit the president well who can say now it so happens that his property will eventually come out of fbi impoundment and it so happens that his father earl had a sister named letitia who happened to be my mother bob lee was my cousin though i hadnt seen him in years an ornery soul if i recall from childhood now as his only living relative it so happens his guns will therefore come into my possession and knowing how you treasure the model i might be persuaded to see it come your way the shrewd fellow looked bob up and down and then lit out with a cackle and a yowl i think i see a family resemblance he said my aint life just full of surprises and since no man alive knows more about the model i cant think of a better man to receive that rifle sir than colonel rathford marin obrien author of the classic rifle the premiere big game hunter of this country and our greatest living expert on the model rifle winchesters best it sounds like a piece id be interested in lord knows ive spent lots of foolish money on interesting rifles if i didnt have so many damn oil wells i might not be such a spendthrift but im too old for women and i tired of killing some years back so interesting rifles and the folly of new york intellectuals are my last remaining vices and what would the price be sir ill not insult you with talk of money said bob ill trade you that damn rifle even up for information thats all i want some talk they say a man who asks for little is always meaning to take a lot maybe they say that sir and maybe its right but i know bob lee swagger thought you were a great american and hed be pleased to have one of his rifles come to rest in your collection and hed consider it an even bargain and a good swap all right then boy ask your damn questions what i know that could be worth that much properly authenticated that gun would easily go fifteen thousand dollars at the big las vegas show is mighty interesting to me the tenth black king obrien looked at him his hard eyes gleaming with sudden insight he glanced briefly at nick found him uninteresting then returned to bob what the hell was going on nick was thinking hell boy said colonel obrien the tenth black king is a damned mystery dobbler could no longer stand his office the walls seemed to press down on him and his mind had ceased to operate he had sat there for hours trying to think of ways to get at bob and he had come up with nothing so now he was wandering around the ramdyne complex ducking now and then when a would scream in on the flight path to dulles he knew that sometimes his unconscious could solve a problem if he did not let his conscious deal with it directly it just happened under the surface so to speak he prayed for such a leap in insight now but he only saw blue sky airplanes and crummy buildings hed come at last to a large corrugated shed toward the rear of the complex it bore the sign operations motor poolno admittance to unauthorized personnel why did he enter because it was there no one stopped him as he slid in and in the darkness he blinked to adjust his eyes he found himself in a garagelike structure of some size in the center of which a number of men were bent over benches working intently the odor of gasoline grease and some kind of chemical solvent filled the air like a vapor he heard the click and snap of metal parts he smiled at one of the workers who just worked away contemptuously he saw then they were working on guns machine guns or assault rifles complicated dangerouslooking they were snapping them assembling them greasing them goofing around with them and there were bullets too crates of bullets and some of the men were fitting the bullets into magazines they all looked like barbarians they were wild boys yardbirds the same breed of tough scary trash that had frightened dobbler into russell isandhlwanas comforting ministrations some had crew cuts some ponytails all had tattoos and bad teeth and the guns he could tell they loved the damned guns there was so much electricity between the men and their weapons it was like nothing hed ever seen how they adored them the guns dobbler thought well said colonel obrien id guess you think you might find that damned rifle and make yourself a half a million dollars friend id bet youre chasing a mirage i think its buried in some unknown hole with its poor last owner bob couldnt tell him hed fired the damn thing in maryland last january now you know that the ten black kings were ten extrafine model target rifles in the model known as the bull gun with a heavy extralong barrel that the company planned to put out as presentation rifles in the year these ten rifles serial number through were stocked from a trunk of black american walnut from a tree that had been felled in salem oregon for some odd reason the wood in the tree really was black that is it was so old and dense it was almost like ebony the completed rifles were so lovely that someone came up with the name black kings to describe them ive handled several they are beautiful rifles believe me the rifles were then presented to the usual great men and now rest in various museums around the world except for the last one serial number in the thousandyard caliber h h magnum said bob you have it son this one was presented to an employee art scott whod for many years been winchesters expert marksman art was a wonderful rifle shot hed won the wimbledon cup and won the thousandyard match at bisley in england and won the nationals at camp perry and had been the nra shooter of the year several times he may have been the best shot this country ever produced until that man in vietnam came along you must mean carl hitchcock said bob thats the boy go on colonel bob said what happened to the tenth black king you didnt say in your book you said someday the tragic story of the tenth black king will come out but for now as it is unfinished i will not begin it well its a sad story the tenth black king was the only one of the ten that was regularly used in competition its action had even been specially milled from a new swedish steel so that it was mighty strong and could stand up to the heavy powder loads the thousandyard shooters burn up it was used not only by art who was in his sixties by that time and had lost a bit of his edge but by his son lon lon scott was a lovely young man handsome and fair a yale graduate a shooters shooter he had his whole life before him hed been accepted at harvard law school in he had everything including the tenth black king and his fathers inherited fund of shooting knowledge learned from growing up in a shooting family a fatherson thing quite holy in certain precincts do you shoot young man now and then said bob its not as simple as point and pull the trigger you know so i hear said bob well anyway in lon scott finished fourth in the national thousand yard rifle championships at camp perry the season was over he had a few of his loads left and he and his dad went out one afternoon to shoot them up but you know the curse of the rifle when you think youve mastered it itll punish you for your vanity reach out and destroy everything youve ever earned or made in your life a rifle can be a cruel and vengeful slut one of those stupid accidents where the basic law of safety treat every gun as if its loaded was violated a targetgrade trigger very delicate one of them putting the rifle in the case the safety not off but not quite on either art scott accidentally shot his son in the spine paralyzing him forever from the midchest down sentencing him to a lifetime in a wheelchair the boy was in the hospital and in physical therapy for two years all that hed wanted for himself and that art had wanted for him was gone a week after the shooting art used the same rifle on himself blew his own brains out in the family cabin in vermont the boy lost everything in that seconds carelessness his legs his life his father what happened to him when he recovered he didnt destroy the rifle youd think he would wouldnt you but he didnt because he believed that the firearm was simply a tool and it had no guilt but he wasnt untouched if anything he set out to master it for about five years in the midfifties he gave himself up entirely to the discipline of the rifle and became one of the premiere thousandyard shooters because he could still fire from the prone of course won the championship in and he was a great benchrest shooter too but i wonder what can it do to a vital young person to have his life twisted so terribly by a bullet nick silent all the time they had been there finally spoke up i think i know i was married to a woman accidentally paralyzed in a shooting if you were a good person like my myra you become a better one but if you were bad fundamentally bad it can turn you black and horrible i used to talk to the doctors when i took myra in for therapy once a week they once told me that there was nobody more bitter than a strong firm man exiled into a metal chair forever bob said is that what happened to lon scott oh i wouldnt want to say said the colonel thats between himself and god what did happen he gave up he disappeared no one knows where he went but he was a genius all right he was one of the first to enter the world of microaccuracy he was the first for example to see the importance of neckturning for precision reloading to get maximum accuracy in his last year of competitive shooting at the national bench rest championships at lake erie ohio he shot a threehundredyard group that measured minute of angle its been surpassed in the last few years now that the equipment has gotten so refined but it stood for over thirteen years the longest single accuracy record in american history and that was the last time anybody ever saw him there must have been rumors said bob oh the usual nonsense that he was this or that more likely he just went off and got on with the rest of his life nothing dramatic thats all but that rifle today hell it would be worth a half a million dollars id bet you said lon scott was a genius i suppose he might have been he knew how to get the most out of a rifle ill say that he warren page p o ackley pop eimer a few others well colonel obrien i thank you youve done me right well ill see you get bob the nailers rifle you can bet on that now that old bob the nailer hes another interesting case cant figure how a boy like that would go so wrong maybe he was used by bad people well id like to believe that hate to see a hero brought low ever read othello gentlemen dont read plays said bob i read it in high school nick added lamely well old bob reminds me of othello a great soldier a good man twisted played with used by an iago for some dreadful purpose that play was a tragedy one of mr shakespeares finest just like poor bobs life an american tragedy well said bob dont believe mr shakespeare had much use for happy endings but the bob lee swagger i knew all those years back he may have been as stubborn as a goddamned mule but he wasnt a fool either so maybe somehow itll work out for him goodbye colonel well i hope so boys said the colonel with just a hint of glee in his voice because im too old for tragedy i like a nice happy ending too as they drove away nick found himself increasingly agitated finally he let it all spill out what the hell was that all about why did we drive three days to id read in the records of five great shooters in the late fifties lon scott just happened to be one of them i had to tie one of them to that damned black rifle i figured if anybody could give us a line itd be that old man but what did we dont you get it yet boy these boys they didnt just want me to use as a dupe no sir i had to go to all the shooting sites and birddog them out i had to read the angles i had to figure the positions i had to test the winds i had to set it up for them now why the real shooter would want to do that himselfunless he couldnt the sleep ive lost thinking this one through why couldnt he he couldnt because hes in a wheelchair remember i was his damn legs nick bolted upward of course we just learned the name of the man who shot roberto lopez in new orleans dont you see dammit everything these birds have done has turned on one damned thing and that is that they had at their disposal a worldclass shot they wouldnt have set up the operation they set up if they didnt have a man who could hit a standing target at twelve hundred yards like he did in new orleans thats fantastic shooting arent but seven maybe eight men in the world whod have the confidence to take that shot but none of this is worth a damn in a court of law nick protested and we have no leads on where this lon scott is if hes even alive nothing that old man couldnt tell us a damned thing about where this crippled sniper was we ought to be looking for annex b thats where you are the most contrary man i ever met if someone handed you a glass of free beer that was ninetenths full youd cry over the missing tenth listen if i have a name i can dog him out shooters will know of him its a small world the shooting world hell have left tracks youll see and when we find him we find them they drove away down the bumpy road chapter twentyeight dr dobblers fingers were black with newsprint he sat alone in his office late at night turning the pages concentrating he was surrounded by piles of magazines some slick and gaudy some amazingly primitive but he had after much investigation settled on this document as his road map to bob lee swagger it was cheaply printed on newsprint and its ink soaked into his fingertips the words were often semiliterate almost always utilitarian the type packed together inelegantly without reference to any modern theory of layout as if the men responsible were just trying to crush as much information in as possible the pictures often murky and sometimes indecipherable it could have come from a different universe dobbler turned one of the flimsy pages feeling as if he were sinking deeper and deeper into strangeness tokarev military tu free ammo each bangers distribution americas best colt distributor offers you the colt gold cup ten each or more ea subscribe now to machine gun news special introductory price paragon makes it easy to buy ammo marylandhoward county weapons fair november the gun cellar prices are lower in the cellar machine gun conversion videos and on and on it went for pages the publication was called the shotgun news though shotguns were only a small part of the news if it shot or related to shooting or documented shooting you could find it in the shotgun news the urtext of the subculture dobbler was fascinated guns everywhere of every shape and form and description for every taste and wallet they could be so cheap and so expensive so demure and so awesome so ridiculous and so sublime he wondered about the men who worshiped them with such ardency whose lives were bounded by their complexities or liberated by their possibilities what was there to see in all this well passion for order for one thing so much of gun culture was about parts units systems things fitting together there were whole institutions that existed merely to sell parts of obsolete weapons so there was a puzzle aspect to it a sense of bringing order to chaos power the damned things were so absolute in their meaning that yes there had to be the lure of power but beauty also some of them he was stunned to discover were strangely beautiful he especially liked one called a luger and another called a new frontier single action and freedom or at least the illusion of it by the narrowest of definitions to dobbler freedom was essentially intellectual but he supposed that to someone in a more primal world it was physical freedom of movement freedom from harassment freedom from being messed around with outdoor freedom and a man who holds a gun in his hand must feel it passionately no government can rule you absolutely yours is always the last option and masculinity nothing soft and feminine about guns they were too direct too brutal the phallic business so provocative to freudians didnt seem to him to be very helpful if these guns were penises their purchasers were too selfoblivious to know or care and then again data to him a gun was just a gun but to some of these people it was obviously an endless font of information a history a set of specifications an involvement with a company usually a corporate entity a connection to certain traditions a whole hierarchy of meanings that yielded yet more meanings and had to be deciphered like some runic code to shoot wasnt enough there was something almost borgesian about the labyrinths the damned things conjured in the imagination the clock ticked away and the pages fled by and after a bit he ceased looking at the display ads from the gun wholesale places but instead fascinated looked to smaller fry the columns and columns of classifieds where more oblique needs were addressed it

discount gun books all shipped free great new book winchester an american legend wilson colt encyclopedia ii cochran discount gun books po box nescopeck pa it was somewhere in here lost amid the lists of old guns new books and reloading components and magazines for pistols that hadnt been manufactured since world war i that something began to tick in his mind they hid deep in the timber after disappearing down many remote lumber roads it was a small oneroom hunting cabin built years ago a rustic place of logs and wooden roof bob swiftly shot three squirrels with a mini then set about to skin them for the stewpot is there anything i should be doing asked nick just dont get in the way said bob now i think we should memphis dont explain anything to me all right nick fuming and pissed at himself and at bob had never known anybody so used to silence and so uninterested in conversation so hidden behind an impassive face but it wasnt the impassivity of relaxation that was a complete illusion nick now saw like some kind of mask to keep the world away while its owner shrewdly calculated moves two jumps down the line where are we asked nick ouachitas said bob nobodys going to find us here unless we want them to ah said nick um what are your thoughts on what we do next bob just went on skinning the squirrels i havent figured yet well ive been thinking said nick uhoh said bob i still think the damned key is annex b now where is annex b well its got to be in washington in fact everythings in washington i think thats where we ought to go we can do some nosing around maybe get a line on it then he had nothing to say after the then now dont you think they might figure that out bob asked well said nick one thing i know in a war you dont go where they expect you that earns you a body bag well thenwhat we lay up here a few more days till the buzz dies down we both need sleep ill kill a deer tomorrow so well eat good then ill figure something look i have to tell you as a professional criminal investigator of twelve years experience we just arent young mr pork memphis i am not a fancy government man i only studied at the university of vietnam i dont know anything about investigating anything but i do know the key to this damn thing is a rare rifle that has been used at least once in mortal circumstances and i know its owner is one of the best shots in america and one of the great ballistic technicians as well as having spent almost forty years in a wheelchair and i have a funny feeling that he works for this ramdyne thats the only card i got so its the card im going to play now let me think on it go for a walk or something but dont get lost i dont have time to go looking for you well maybe ill do some thinking too thought nick consigning himself to be the only one to press against the mysteries of annex b dr dobbler licked his lips nervously swallowed a time or two and then knocked on the door yes colonel shreck yes come in doctor dobbler stepped into shrecks office to find payne and the colonel bent in conversation what is it doctor ah i have a a plan the colonel looked at dobbler russell isandhlwana used to look at him like that more with pity than anything else in some ways russell and the colonel were the same man they just took what they wanted and dobbler knew that he desperately wanted to please them both all right said shreck waiting for more bob is too sharp and suspicious to be taken as we had hoped hes always watching we must beat him on his strength which is patience we must put something before him so subtly that not a man in a thousand would notice it but we must put it there and let him sniff at it and go away sniff again and go away reconnoiter and rereconnoiter until he has at last satisfied himself that the way is clear we must nurse him in slowly never being greedy draw him in with utmost care and discipline being as ready as he is to disengage if conditions do not favor us we must be more patient then and only then shreck was impatient thats wonderful now tell me how yes sir said dobbler all right here it is am i not certain that somewhere in the secret files of this organization there is access to a man who does the shooting really there has to be a shooter an excellent shooter after all somebody took that shot in new orleans shreck thought about it but didnt commit himself then he said go on this shooter i guarantee you would interest bob he would fascinate bob bob is probably already theoretically aware of his existence and attempting to puzzle out a name for the man and a location and certainly bob noted the rifle such a man used after all didnt he use it in maryland during the recruitment stage yes my thought is that in the subtlest possible way we put the shooters name before bob and what way would that be theres a publication called the shotgun news that comes out three times a month thousands of custom or rare rifles are advertised through classified ads in each issue as well as other items reloading stuff parts surplus clothes ammunitionand books this was a surprise to me but its true these men who love guns somehow are driven to record and document their love theyve created a whole other literature a parallel literature and just as mainstream culture is riven by ideological differences between left and right so is gun culture though it isnt really left and right so much as traditionalist and progressive anyway a common thread is guerrilla publishing selfpublishing if you will i was fascinated to see a book on japanese military rifles being sold for thirtyseven dollars through the mail imagine that someone so fascinated by japanese rifles that he goes to the trouble to write a book a catalog more i suspect anyway he goes to all that trouble and then there are actually people out there mad enough to send thirtyseven dollars through the mail for get to the point goddammit yes im sorry why not a book a selfpublished book on the history of that particular rifle bob used in maryland published by some obscure researcherdevotee in some small town as advertised in a small item in the shotgun news bob would see it i guarantee you and he would think hmmmmm heres somebody who knows about this rifle and its background maybe in his researches he came across a clue that will lead me to the next step and so he would approach this obscure researcherdevotee he will have to and in that way we lure him to a remote place and a mountaintop payne spoke up for the first time you want to drive him up a mountain so theres a point where he cant get any further hit him with a lot of men yes drive him up then hit him with a lot of men more men than he can handle so where we going get a lot of new boys said payne let me work on that said shreck they were sitting outside the cabin well after dark it was as if bob had flown off into the ether nick realized hed never quite known the meaning of the word concentration before there was no concentration like the concentration of the sniper nick was afraid almost to speak to him bob sat by the fire simply staring into it the fire crackled and blazed sending small flares out into the night its light playing across his taut lean face his eyes were steady lost in the middle distance meanwhile in his solitude nick tried to zero on annex b how do you get at something deep in the fbi files especially when you have been suspended by the bureau and your only source into its computer system has been compromised but he was convinced that if he could just find some orderly logical methodology it could be done perhaps some computer hacker could penetrate some damned high school kid they were getting into things all the time or maybe if he went to someone like hap fencl laid all this out in a nice orderly fashion maybe hap would bypass the dreaded howard d utey and go to even higherups and that waybut even as he was conjuring the bubble of this fantasy it burst on him hap wasnt as bad as howard but he was howard in a way old bureau inflexibly wedded to the ways of the bureaucracy however individually decent completely unable to get his mind to consider violating its mandates you couldnt go to hap unless you had annex b already nick snorted suddenly that used to be me now look at me camping in the woods locked in a private war against a shadowy spook agency that was half official half not annex b thats where the answers lay he was sure of that annex b would give him the answer somewhere in the dark an animal skittered and howled the fire had burned low and across from it bob still sat hunkered and remote lost in his own head he wished he had myra to talk to shed have an idea or at least be willing to hear him out he missed her goddamn he missed her a lot memphis he looked over bob was staring at him harshly huh yeah memphis you willing to do some hard work i mean hard dirty boring crap work the kind nobody likes to do anymore can you give me a week of it twelve eighteen hours a day nick gulped that was his specialty his only talent to lean against something not with great brainpower but with sheer dogged will until he or it broke apart yeah sure then nick saw something hed never seen not at all not in all their hours together not in the aftermath of the swamp shooting not in the long talks on ramdyne and the world they lived in in the firelight bob the nailer smiled then i got him he said his war eyes totally focused hes mine the boy who pulled the trigger i own his ass the martyred president sat in marble wisdom on his throne surrounded by doric pillars and the rubbery thumps of two hundred pairs of athletic shoes on the floor shouts and screams bounced off the cavernous arch of the dome an eighthgrade class was visiting the lincoln memorial any semblance of order had long since broken down and there had never been a semblance of respect the youngsters tore about barbarians said hugh meachum from around the stem of his pipe amid a haze of smoke they have no sense of decorum at all do they the old man was miffed shreck said nothing there should be a way to surgically remove and store childrens tongues as soon as they learn to speak said hugh then when theyve graduated from college and distinguished themselves in the workplace they could file a petition to have their tongues reattached i dont think thats feasible mr meachum said shreck dammit colonel dont humor me i hate it when i am being humored now you called this meeting i take it the news is not good people wont be pleased colonel im telling you frankly they wont be pleased now what is it a teacher sped by harassed and exhausted in pursuit of a knot of seething kids an end we thought was tied off said shreck it just untied itself meaning said hugh taking another deep draw from his pipe the aroma of gin hung over him meaning that bob lee swagger is not dead hes very much alive and hes hunting us that means hes hunting all of us hugh shook his head reached into his pocket and came out with a flask drink colonel no sir hugh took a quick tot it seemed to do him some good all right you must find him and kill him surely you understand that weve got a plan its clever it looks promising yes yes but i have two problems only two one is easy the other he let it trail off all right number one number one is manpower i dont want to take any chances i want a lot of men he can kill twenty or fifty and i want fifty more there to take him down i cant recruit anew there isnt enough time god colonel you cant expect us to provide you with men good heavens the risk is no no i have men theyre just not here i need approval at a high level to fly a hercules in from down south and land without customs interference that can be arranged cant it surely your associates can prevail on something so minor theyll fly in do the job and fly out theyll be incountry for no more than a week i swear no one will see them hugh considered i suppose it could be arranged and who are you bringing in colonel shreck i need good hard men men whove been in battle mr meachum the only place i can get men of that quality fast enough and in sufficient quantity is from el salvador hugh looked at him thats right said shreck im bringing in the counterinsurgency company from panther battalion the one we trained its their mess were still cleaning up let them go up the mountain after bob lee swagger god said meachum all right i suppose it can be arranged youll get me the details at the right time and whats number two shreck paused swallowed this was the one he didnt like he knew he sailed into dangerous waters here go on go on said hugh impatiently my people never saw him said shreck we have no idea who he is or what he did we only know that he can shoot better than any man on this earth and we know he isnt mobile because he had to work from bobs report and couldnt handle it himself and we had the sense that he was once famous in a way or at least public so there has to be history there and we examined his rifle we know that it was used to win championships hughs eyes flashed over at shreck among other things it was used for he said the security was important indeed crucial there are things you dont need to know i told you i would handle that part of it that it didnt involve you or your people didnt i now what on earth can this be about colonel our plan needs bait this swagger is a difficult antagonist but he has weaknesses he had a weakness for a soviet sniper he thought shot and killed his best friend my staff psychiatrist dobbler put that together and it worked mr meachum it got us swagger on a platter but we couldnt keep him there obviously now dobbler thinks that swagger will have somehow sensed the other shooter and will find him as provocative as he found the russian i want to put him before swagger it neednt be complicated but it must be authentic i want a sense of him i want his cooperation as bait yes well not physically but well need name history background accomplishments that sort of well for your information he and i go way back we went to school together in fact his life has beenremarkable colonel his identity is the one secret i hold most precious if we dont get swagger hell blow us away mr meachum hugh considered ill have to ask him he said i couldnt think of doing it without his agreement chapter twentynine they pulled up outside the house it was a quiet twilight in syracuse new york nick wore a suit a white shirt a tie all recently purchased from bobs cache of nearly thirty thousand dollars that he wore in a moneybelt bob had bought a suit and tie too he looked almost civilized nick turned and faced the house and took a swallow oh my nick suddenly said we are finally here this was the hardest thing and it had placed a large ball of ice in his stomach bob just chewed on a toothpick looked ahead through the windshield of the rented buick got to do it memphis nick exhaled four or six lungsful of air just kept blowing the stuff off as the melancholy crept through him i cross this line i may never get back you dont cross this line they may kill you on the wrong side of it doesnt help much said nick not the way i was raised the line was the felony line it had haunted him since bob had laid the plan before him but it was the only way this is it yeah fraid so no other way to get what we want and get it fast look at it this way these bad boys from this ramdyne outfit probably going to blow you out of your socks in a day or two anyway what difference does it make then bob smiled at him again okay said nick he knew that so far in his adventures hed done nothing illegal though hed stretched the elasticity of the law considerably this was different he was about to represent himself as a federal agent when he no longer was one it violated federal code and it carried three to five though if he ever went over on it he knew hed be out in six months maximum unless somebody was really mad at him but he also knew hed never work his side of the street again okay said nick again lets do it and to hell with howdy duty this is your duty said bob they knocked on the door and a little girl answered nick took out his identification hi he said my name is nicholas memphis and im a special agent of the federal bureau of investigation may i see your daddy please honey she ducked in and in a few seconds a grave thin man in a cardigan appeared yes he asked running a hand through his hair mr porter im nicholas memphis special agent of the federal bureau of investigation my associate special agent fencl sir nodded bob have i no no sir said nick fast but if our information is correct its from this address that you edit and collate and send out accuracy shooting the newsletter of benchrest shooting porter swallowed uh yes thats correct im an insurance executive but ive been benchresting fifteen years i inherited the editorship ten years ago a labor of love really i lose time and money on it but ive gotten some good friends out of it and had lots of fun yes sir we understand mr porter said bob were looking for a man who may be involved in several shootings oh god said porter and our information suggests that he was at one time one of the leading benchresters in the country oh no said porter benchresters arent like that were not talking about you know survivalists aks that sort of thing these are just tinkerers who love to play with their completely useless rifles and loads and shoot tiny groups gosh they just sit there and shoot and cuss thats all its the most boring thing you ever saw its enormously challenging to do but to watch it its our information is pretty good mr porter you know theres always one or two in any group who can give it a bad name god its so harmless porter said id hate to have the damn newspapers to get ahold of something like this and say you know that benchresting was training for sniping or some such mr porter the last thing wed ever do is talk to the press you can be sure of that what wed like to do is examine your subscription list this is an older man he was active in benchrest shooting back in the late fifties and we believe that if hes a subscriber hed almost certainly have been one for a long time as we understand it the publication began as a shooting club newsletter right back in the early sixties thats right youre looking for a name no sir almost certainly hes living under a pseudonym but we have several other characteristics and if we get a set of names from you we can compare them to other lists and look for correspondences we can assure you your information will be held in strictest confidence and i suppose if i said no youd get a subpoena mr porter said nick this is a friendly visit not a hostile one if youd like to call a family lawyer and have him come over and advise you that would be fine we can wait no no said porter no come on in would you guys like some coffee thank you no sir said nick porter led them through pleasant rooms until at last they reached his study where an ibm pc and an epson printer stood on the desk the room was heavily lined with shelves and nick recognized many standard texts of ballistics many reloading manuals but also crime and punishment portnoys complaint and the great war and modern memory all books hed planned on reading sometime on one wall hung a series of the typescript covers of accuracy shooting i went to the computer two years ago porter said it was getting to be too damn much with the pasteup i can do each issue in one operation now and ive got loads of volunteer help and my wife helps with the typing its great fun weve loved every second of it yes sir said nick bob hung back letting nick do the talking great nick thought im in so deep now theres no way of ever getting out now i have twentyseventhousandfivehundredodd subscribers mr memphis do you want me to print out a whole list or something sir is there any way you can break it down by chronology that is early subscribers that sort of thing first subscribers were quite convinced that our man would have found out about you early and been one of the first subscribers hmmm said porter you know i dont think i could run a program to shake it out that way ive set the whole thing up to run alphabetically whenever i get a new subscriber i add him to the list and the thing just inserts it where it should be i see how did you get your subscribers mr porter asked bob well ive taken out classified ads in sgn and in the slick gun mags and of course theres a subscription form in every copy of the magazine no i mean originally when it was first started that first year what was that howd they start it off well as i understand it it was started informally as a newsletter of match results and now and then a small technical article the men were all driven to communicate what they were working on and people who were just interested in the sport or the experiments or what have you began to ask to get on the mailing list and i think they first started selling subscriptions yes it was after the newsletter became an actual magazine those first subscription requests say the first thousand any idea what became of them oh lord did i throw them away i got all that stuff from old milt omahundro who used to put it out god i no i think ive got some old cartons out in the garage could we see them sure this way and he led them out into the garage where against one wall a pile of cardboard boxes stood oh lord i just dont mr porter said bob tell you what if you get me some coffee like you offered before this young man said no id be happy to go through those boxes for you and ill make damn sure its as neat when we leave as it is now fair enough well thats the best offer ive had in weeks said porter bob and nick got busy and it was bob who worked the hardest taking off his coat and folding it neatly he threw himself against the task with that same thorough intensity that always numbed nick hed pause to take a sip of the coffee now and then but mainly he just plunged ahead hed make a good cop thought nick who had never been outworked before it was in the last box and it was bob who found them the first thousand or so subscription forms to accuracy shooting now yellowed with age many were simply letters that had had checks enclosed and still bore the imprint of a paper clip or the punctures of a staple some were index cards or postcards only a few were forms it was a box of old memories crumbling into dust hard to look at it and think that something so utterly banal a box of forgotten letters and forms might hold a key to something so monstrous as the shooting of archbishop roberto lopez in new orleans ill be said porter that takes me back awhile id forgotten all about those didnt even know i still had them sir said nick what wed like to do is write you out a receipt for this material then return it to you when weve completed our investigation oh i dont know if id have found them i might have thrown them out myself why dont you just take the damned things and if you lose them so much the better yes sir but id be happy to write out the receipt no you just go on and go ive got work to do the next day shreck drove alone down through virginia and into north carolina following complicated directions there in the shadows of the blue ridge mountains just over the state line he turned down a private road for perhaps a mile until he came to an electronic gate he got out of the car and pressed the buzzer on an intercom system yes came the voice my name is shreck he said all right came the voice the door slid open and shreck got in and drove for another two hundred yards sitting in the shadow of a sixhundredfoot hill was a handsome ranch house rambling bright and open shreck had always lived in apartments almost monastically but he had a moment of awe when he saw the spread it was beautiful and if he ever had a place this is the sort of place hed have whoever this guy was he had money he parked and got out a cement ramp led up to double doors the house had no steps shreck walked up the ramp found the door open im in the shop came the call over the loudspeaker shreck walked through the house through its wide doors past the sun deck out back he could see the rifle range the white targets lodged against the base of the hill at last he reached the rear of the house and stepped through another wide door a man who looked ten years older than he was sat curled in a wheelchair and was very carefully turning a single brass shell in his hand as he worked it with some kind of metalworking tool a keylike handle that embraced a brass cartridge case locked in a vise hello colonel shreck hello mr scott lon scott wore his gray hair short and neat above the long face and aquiline profile of a blue blood his eyes were dark and ropes of veins showed along the muscled ridges of his forearms and hands but his body was horribly twisted the spine bent like a bow his dead legs awkwardly spindled beneath him he couldnt exercise his body so it had acquired a packing of fat and his stomach bulged under his belt once beautiful he was now grotesque shreck tried to let nothing show on his face but he knew a trace of horror had crept into his eyes and he knew scott noticed not very pretty is it thats what a bullet in the spine can do to a healthy growing boy colonel turn him into a geranium im sorry sir i just dont worry i can handle it now my friend hugh meachum said you had some bad news for me lets have it colonel you dont look like the sort of man who pulls his punches yes sir said shreck its a loose end a detail that wont go away new orleans the man we were using as our asset the marine yes he was supposed to be dealt with by some freak he survived a pointblank chest shot must have missed his heart by a hair and now hes back teamed up with an fbi agent this marine a good man the very best as good as you are i understand youre quite the warrior better but you have a plan thats correct its our feeling that hed be unusually responsive to something from shooting culture for example he may have identified the rifle of yours that he used in maryland its our idea to put an ad in the shotgun news for a book of some sort a privately printed volume as is common in the culture on famous target rifles or shooters or some such and if he sees it hed want to approach the author and we nail him why do you need my permission well sir in this business we find that as close as we can come to the authentic when we fabricate the better off we are we cant just make stuff up weve got to build a legend that he can verify himself from other sources this is a very careful man and thats why we needwell information as well as permission lon scott nodded my past my family that sort of thing yes sir scott seemed to have a funny moment here it was an odd shiver something between a shudder and a snort as if he almost laughed or almost choked my father he finally said my poor old father yes sir i see said scott following intently there are alternatives said the colonel who had now with much effort mastered the blank look in the face of lons infirmity we can hope to ride this out while swagger and this fbi agent peck away at us our tracks have been hidden well butbut theyve consistently surprised us eventually they just might stumble onto something and possibly by that time it would be too late my theory of war has always been aggressive offensive operations i was once called a meat grinder but i believe you ultimately spare lives by responding aggressively lon listened raptly only stopping momentarily to hawk up a wad of brackish phlegm from somewhere in his throat to dribble it into a spittoon that the colonel had not until then noticed there are risks of course the first is that we must feed him your name i understand your privacy is important to you my name has not been in public print since i stopped bench resting in the early sixties im sure im forgotten now it frightens me of course its such a small thingbut of course it opens up the faint possibility of inquiries that might lead to associations and linkageswell who knows pandoras box these things take on a life of their own yes sir its just that i feel theres no other way swagger would see through everything else hed nibble us to death for years wed be stuck we must eliminate him or everything will be gone scott sighed melancholy seemed to overtake him too my my my he finally said after all these years yes sir and i suppose if this man isnt stopped he puts hugh at risk as well yes sir said colonel shreck well i owe hugh a considerable debt colonel shreck hes a great man how long have you known him since sir when we were training the bay of pigs invasion force in guatemala hes watched over my career ever since thats hugh he takes responsibility he cares he lets you become what your talents allow without him id have lost myself in my bitterness i made a deal with hugh meachum and its paid dividends to both of us im with you whatever you say whatever you require im yours yes sir thank you sir as i say mr scott your name your family his well you know youve certainly hit the jackpot there my father was a famous man a celebrity back in the thirties the story of what he accomplished with the tenth black king and what it led towell it would make a great american book and in the shooting world his name even to this day is instantly recognizable yes ill get you some things that youll find helpful thank you but i want something from you in return yes sir i want in all the way if im bait then let him come to me to me here well go all the way ill do my part this place is perfect remote access to a mountain everything you need your boys can drive him up bone hill he gestured over his shoulder and shreck could see the blue ridge foothill out back its flanks covered in scrubby vegetation its knob bald thats where hell die atop bone hill this was exactly what shreck had been playing for once again the great lon scott had hit the bullseye thatll make it much easier sir shreck said now what asked nick weve got over a thousand names here one of them may be phony the pseudonym of a man who disappeared himself close to thirty years ago how are the two of us going to winnow them down he can change a name memphis he can change an address an appearance a way of talking one thing he cant fake he cant fake legs memphis looked at him bob crouched in the halfdark of the motel room his face lost in shadow nick had to admit it yes it was very neatly thought out elegant perhaps but he had to take it a further step is there some kind of register of handicapped persons i dont know about i mean we cant call a thousand men whose addresses from thirty years ago we have and ask them if theyre paralyzed there is we break it down by state get a list for each state then you call each states department of motor vehicles you call and you find out who on the list has a handicapped license plate state computers ought to be able to shake it out real fast damn shouted nick goddamn right yes yes then in fifty phone calls weve winnowed the thousand down to just a few how many can there be and we can check them out thats it pork id bet a dollar against tomorrow one of those men will be lon scott be nice to find out how come hes been hiding all these years and how it was his famous rifle ended up in the hands of an outfit that kills important people for a living nick began calling the next morning in a rented loft space in downtown syracuse near the university as soon as the phone company got the phones hooked up using his federal identification code number which authenticated him to the supervisory personnel he was able to begin the computer searches in six states in a couple of hours but it was exhausting excruciating work and nick was astonished to find in himself something hed never allowed before dreaminess he saw himself on the road he saw himself somewhat like bob free beholden to nobody it occurred to him could i invent my own life instead of allowing the bureau to invent it for me hed been a man of many masters and eager to do their bidding now he considered that he could be his own master meanwhile bob took the calls that came back on the other line agent fencl fbi hed say trying to subdue his arkansas twang yes sir but agent memphis is on another line may i take your information please ill see that it reaches him yes maam yes could you spell that please yes and is there an address thank you very much youve been very helpful it took three days in the end they had seven names that is seven men who were among the first thousand subscribers to accuracy shooting and who had been issued handicapped license plates by their state department of motor vehicles sometime between and today wow said nick all that work for seven names now if i were in the damned bureau alls id have to do is call up the offices in the states of these guys and have them check them all out id get reports back in thirty minutes but i suppose our next move is to individually check these seven guys out yep of course i dont know what the original lon scott looked like but i do know that he dropped out of sight in and hasnt been heard from since so seems to me one thing we ought to find out is how old these boys are and we can reject anybody who wasnt at least in his twenties in and we can reject anybody who wasnt already crippled in maybe thatll get it down some no wait a minute said nick no were going at this wrong look think about it this way the guy were looking for the real lon scott has one distinguishing characteristic that is he has a new identity now the classical way in which you build a new identity is to take over the identity of a child who was born on or about the same time you were but who died in the next few years see nobody ever correlates birth certificates with death certificates so you get the name of a child who died a few years after he was born from a graveyard or an old newspaper obituary then you write to the state department of birth registration and say youre him and you get a copy of his birth certificate then you use that as the basis of the new identity right it was right bob nodded for the first time looking almost as if impressed go on he finally said so we call the counties in which the seven names reside we call the death certificate registries and we find which of the seven has died and if we find one of those to be the case then we know that somebodys resurrected the name to use as the basis for the new identity and wouldnt that be our man bob looked at him long and hard then he said you finally said something worth listening to though you explained half to death now get busy the ad runs today said dobbler in the books and magazines section of the shotgun news just a few lines heres the copy he handed it to shreck art scott american shooter the true story of the fabled marksman of the thirties who won the national thousand yard match four times in the thirties and forties and twice more in the fifties with his famous tenth black king model h h magnum complete with pictures drawn from family archives and load data postpaid or order from james thomas albright po box newtsville nc visa mastercard it doesnt even mention lon scott said shreck it cant too obvious it has to be subtle if its obvious hell smell a trap and never come close hes made the connection to the tenth black king i guarantee you you cant force these things he almost shouted forgetting to whom he was talking shreck just took a pace back how do we know hell spot it he asked we trust him he might not find it right away but as he travels hell talk to people who will have seen it he will find it that i guarantee you and hell obey the instructions in the ad the phone number reached through several blind linkages an answering machine in ramdyne headquarters the message they hear simply tells them to leave visa or mastercard numbers and to give their addresses said dobbler so they leave their voices on the tape now this is very important you see we have the taped interrogations of both memphis and swagger memphis recorded in the interrogation in the swamp and swagger during your discussions with him back in maryland so weve made a voice scan and reduced their voices to an electronic signature which is in turn coded into a computer every call we get is automatically filtered through the computer and it is instantaneously checked against the vocal signatures when we get a match it lets us know and then and then we reel him in slowly ever so slowly trusting our instincts and our reading of swaggers character we reel him in and destroy him its like hunting a predator with bait the bait is the researchor its his illusion that he can get out of this and somehow clear himself shreck nodded it is clever he conceded dobbler looked at shreck and realized that for the first time he wasnt frightened of him for almost a week there were so many times they were close that it made them almost halfcrazy they spent the days on the phone in the syracuse loft and after the close of business hours in the last of the western states theyd come out and go for a walk get something to eat just stretch and decompress they made an odd couple the tall thin middleaged man who had a way of holding himself in the thicker friendlier younger man hair blond and thatchy eyes brown and warm whose gentle bulk hid considerable strength they almost never talked as they walked and ate they seemed comfortable in the silence then one night bob asked about the chair whats it do to a person the chair at first nick thought he was asking about the electric chair and thought somehow in his fbi career nick had seen an execution or two but then he realized bob meant to touch on something hed said at colonel obriens chair wheelchair ah it sucks i think i hated it more than she did because it was my damn failure my damn guilt sometimes at night id lie there listening to her breathe you could see the damn thing in the moonlight it was like it was laughing at you suppose you were in it suppose your own daddy had put you there and then blown the top of his head off in grief what would that do to you i dont know said nick well dammit think about it give me an answer i have to know why this bird did what he did hell bitterness i suppose it could cripple you so bad youd hate the world that didnt happen to her of course she was too special and decent but to someone else i suppose it could easily lead you to guns to feel the power in them that your body was deprived of the gun could complete a paraplegic it could make him very very dangerous but there are so many killers in this world who arent crippled whats so special about one that is bob just looked at him rather sadly you still dont get it do you pork get what come on wed best be heading back more phone calls tomorrow but as the time passed the chance of the great breakthrough seemed to recede all the calls had been made sometimes two and three times in ever widening circles theyd tried to match death certificates against the seven names patiently hunting through counties and then states somehow however the connection seemed to evaporate as they drew near to it suppose well just have to drive out and find each of these damn guys and eyeball em and go from there bob said he was looking at the current issue of the shotgun news which hed just picked up on a newsstand as he did every other week irritating nick no end it was such a dirty little rag full of close print and murky black and white pictures of surplus guns the rag bob called it with a snort of joyful contempt it didnt even have stories just pages and pages of gun deals you know im really beginning to wonder if pursuing annex b might not be a more reasonable course at this point working with sally ellion there still might be a way to get into the bureaus computer bank shes very smart she likes me i think you just want to nail that nice young gal pork why dont you admit it no shes a nice girl i just the phone rang agent memphis mr memphis im susan jeremiah in the clark county north carolina registrars office oh yes right i remember i talked to you some days ago about the seven names thats right and you couldnt help no sir but i got to thinking on it one of those names on that list was a james thomas albright and there was no james thomas albright on my list of deaths for the years through no thats what you told me but i got to thinking there was an albright a robert parrish albright who died when he was two in right here in clark county i see said nick the names being so similar i just got curious and couldnt stop thinking about it so i went and checked our names registration you know with a valid birth certificate you can petition the court to change your name legally of course and i was stunned to discover that in june of a robert parrish albright of this county petitioned the court to change his name to james thomas albright the request was granted and nobody had ever bothered to check the changed name against the death certificates no one knew that the real robert parrish albright had died in nick swallowed he felt as if hed just looked behind a veil someone had very carefully put in place years back for him it was one of those queer powerful moments when an investigation out of so many loose threads and blind paths and false leads suddenly connected into something a small powerful jolt blasted through him thank you mrs jeremiah thank you so much and then he turned to bob trying to seem laconic i found him he said oh yeah said bob yawning james t albright of north carolina hey i found him too he held up the shotgun news the dumb bastard wrote a book the suspense was murderous all those phone calls from all over the united states it shouldnt have amazed dobbler that there were so many of them but it did hello my name is walter murbach of sherman oaks california i am very interested in the book about the tenth black king my visa card number is there were dozens like that and in a week or two the dozens permutated into hundreds over calls were received all of them earnest none of them according to vocal signature bob or nick memphis i dont think its working said shreck it will work said dobbler i know bob bob has been my project for close to a year i know him this is the only way shreck grunted displeased and so they waited and so another day passed and another and dobbler was at home in his apartment paging through back issues of the american rifleman when the phone call came dobbler dr dobbler its the phone watch operations officer we think weve got a positive id on a phone call we received approximately seven minutes ago the computer analysis makes it an almost perfect match to memphis what name did he leave ahhe left the name special agent nicholas memphis federal bureau of investigation yes this is special agent nicholas memphis federal bureau of investigation calling for mr albright we have reason to seek an interview with lon scott who was the son of art scott and wonder if mr albright has any information pertaining to his whereabouts the number is fourfourtwo threeonetwo threeoheightoh i should add that refusal to cooperate could be actionable under federal statute nicks voice spun itself out of the tape recorder congratulations said shreck now give me some sense of how we play it thank you colonel dobbler said secretly very pleased now um as to operating principles theres only one and i cant press it too forcefully at no point until the ultimate moment must we seem aggressive bob is abnormally attuned to aggression he lives in condition yellow never completely at rest always scanning the horizon for clues his radar never goes down and when he senses threat it sets his bells off nothing must be forced no one must stare nothing must be elongated no hints of trap must be given we must operate totally without selfconsciousness now whos going to call him you are said shreck the phone rang oh my said nick answer it said bob oh my said nick again it had been almost a week since theyd made the initial call go on said bob agent memphis nick said picking up the phone yes this is james albright i was told to call you in a phone message last week i only played the tape today i whats this all about yes thank you for getting back to me said nick as officiously as possible its come to our attention that youve published a book about art scott the target shooter yes i knew art years back i saw him shoot one of his last championships he was a wonderful we have reason to suspect that a rifle owned by mr scotts son lon may have been used in a serious federal crime the tenth black king do you know where it is ah said nick a little taken aback no no we hoped you might know where it is i wish i did that rifle would be worth tens of thousands of dollars today well were trying to locate lon scott who seems to have vanished thirty years ago now theres a mystery for you wish i could help you hmmm yes your ad says you have some of art scotts personal effects i have all his shooters notebooks his notes on reloading the results of his experiments many of his medals and ribbons but nothing personal well a couple of diaries which i never paid much attention to i see mr albright its imperative that we locate either lon scott or his remains its my thought that in his fathers effects there might be information useful to us perhaps i could send a team down and examine the materials thats all you want hell why didnt you say so sure come on down be happy to let you see the stuff thank you very much the man on the other end gave him directions and nick said hed see him in two days thursday at ninethirty mr albright said that was okay by him he wasnt going anywhere not bad said the colonel did i slather on the oldboy business too heavily dobbler wanted to know no said the colonel his shrewd eyes narrowed in concentration you brought the family in then backed out of it you established your distance from lon scott what they think theyre getting is another step in the link and not the final step now all we have to do is wait theyre coming in the waiting was hardest on payne man of action thus without orders he seconded himself to central virginia and the ramdyne training facility the men of panther battalion his old compadres under arms had arrived on its thousands of acres to prepare their assault on fortress bob there he watched as the lean young troopers worked on the assault plan he watched them deploy having moved off their mock helicopters move up the hill that was a close duplicate of bone hill under heavy automatic weapons suppressive fire and assault its summit where bob would be alone with no weapon other than the colt automatic he was known to favor even brigadier general de rujijo had come along on this mission is it not too much sergento he asked payne this is one man no it was a logical question with a base of full automatic suppressive fire plus the fire and movement elements pouring out lead as they progressed upwards payne had calculated that over ten thousand bullets would be hurled at the summit in less than two minutes for one man he must be el grande hombre said de rujijo he aint that big a deal payne said my boys could smoke him but still he took great pleasure in the display the bullets soaring raucously upwards and blasting against the summit had literally torn it to shreds there was no place to hide or survive on that mean ground it was the land of the sucking chest wound and the exit hole six times as large as the entrance the plan was simple three platoons from the counterinsurgency company of panther battalion close to men all heavily armed with israeli galil assault rifles in mm were to be deployed at a small deserted airfield some two miles from lon scotts house their presence completely unknown to the target and no hints of it allowed to surface when bob made his approach whosoever was playing lon not yet determined would activate a signal simply by removing his hand from the wheelchair grip and thereby allowing a photocell to be stimulated by the light no buttons to push no anything the four choppers with eight men apiece would be airborne in seconds and deploy for the assault within two minutes four minutes later the choppers would return with the second load of men then repeat until all men were on site the debarked troops as well as the men from ramdynes own action unit would converge on the house frontally bob upon seeing the extent of the trap would almost certainly depart the back by the pool and the rifle range and discover only bone hill six hundred feet of scrubby pine gulches washouts and switchbacks up top of which was a bare knob the sniper would almost certainly choose to climb it up hed go until there was no place to go chapter thirty lon insisted and lon could be stubborn and willful and infuriatingly impossible to budge mr scott i cant have it shreck said we have extremely competent people for this sort of thing its not for you its far too dangerous its my house im the bait he said so ill be the one the second he sees you in that wheelchair hell know who you are fine it makes no difference suppose he shoots you then ive had a full life considering my limitations ive had a wonderful life if it happens itll happen but it wont happen why not this marine hes not like that he couldnt pull his pistol and execute a man in a wheelchair no matter what crimes the man in the wheelchair has committed and no matter that he himself when he hears the helicopters landing will understand that hes a dead man he still wont do it i know him i knew his type among the southern shooters before i lost my legs my father was a lot like him no he wont do it hes sick with honor shreck had to concede that scott was probably right no less a bob lee swagger expert than dobbler had given his acquiescence to scotts decision but shreck himself was curious about it he looked at the misshapen man whose handsome skull now lolled idiotically to the left as its owner had momentarily lost control of it why what do you gain from it lon smiled from his wheelchair and shreck shuddered lons even distant icy gaze bore into him outside he could hear the hammers and crowbars pounding and ripping as a work detail from tiger battalion tore down the wheelchair ramp into the house finally lon scott answered i want the chance to look him in the eye i want to share the moment with him i want him to see me and know who i am and what ive done with what i was handed i want some eye contact with him and see what electricity transfers between us in those last seconds when he knows hes doomed the great bob lee swagger whos killed so many times we should have this moment together bob and i we are at the top of our profession shreck thought it would be quite a meeting a summit of professional worldclass killers each strangely courageous all right mr scott but dont do anything foolish dont get cute with him you let him come in you remove your hand from the light cell and you hide panther battalion will be here in seconds and we waste his ass thats all its about killing him before he kills us fine the surveillance was extremely soft men without radios who had been instructed to stare at nothing to make no eye contact but just to hope that what theyd been sent to see would arrive they were established at various roads into the area at coffee shops across from shopping malls at restaurants and it did happen late that night a rented red chevy pulled into the parking area outside the danville sheraton and from the darkness on the roof of the big boy across the street a ramdyne spotter watched as a tall lanky man got out stretched in the bright pool of the fluorescent light then went into the motel office he came out in a bit and moved the car then he and another man husky and blond walked up the outside stairs leading to the secondfloor balcony that ran the full length of the building and into two adjacent rooms the spotter watched as they came back out to the car and was able to follow its passage a quarter of a mile to the pizza hut then he called headquarters within ten minutes the electrotek surveillance van pulled up discreetly across the street you want me to try and get a tap into their rooms asked eddie nickles nah said payne not quite believing it was happening nah we dont even know if its them but it was the chevy pulled up and parked and payne watched as bob lee swagger big as life got out of the car two hundred yards away hed recognize that lanky walk anywhere with its faint hitch in one leg from the wound so long ago hed studied it for weeks and dreamed about it for months jesus if he had a rifle with a good night scope with infrared he could do bob right here as he ambled with his buddy toward the stairway up to the secondfloor balcony place the dot in the center of the back and squeeze blow his spine out it would be over in the space of time it took the bullet to eat up the yardage but the only thing he had was his remington sawedoff in the custom rig running down his left side under his fatigue jacket its him asked eddie nicoletta yes goddammit payne said sharply shit man they look like they dont suspect a thing man we could do it payneo you me the guys hit him hard and fast kick in the fuckin door you let fly with your doubleought i empty a clip then its over man were fuckin home free plus were heroes you think he dont sleep with a piece cocked and locked one tenth of a second after youre through that door youre dead the guys a fuckin champ and you know it now shut up and let me think he turned to the electrotek technician can you put the directional microphone beam on their room no problem said the man if theres not a lot of white noise in the air well get em big as day suddenly the door to the young ones room opened and he went running down the balcony and began banging excitedly on swaggers door fuckin guys excited payneo hurry up payne said to the technician swinging the long foamcovered boom the technician sighted in twisted knobs bring it up said payne and get the tapes going two voices began to crystallize over the babble as the man worked his digitized control panel more promising really im telling you yes it was memphis emerging out of the background noise i dont know swagger now the voice was bellclear its drawly arkansas rhythms stretching it out look listen to me on this just once okay bob was silent she said shed brief me on the organization of the computerized files and the code word structure thats a start at least its better than chasing this wildgoose hope that theres some information buried in diaries thirty years old memphis i dont like going in without a backup gun around listen to me bob please just this once if we can get annex b it gives us names not names like payne and shreck those are the upfront guys annex b gives us the real powers the people who dont carry the guns but figure it all out and give the orders names addresses its the only way well take these guys down otherwise we lose bob i have to go to her and try and get her working with us again there was something that sounded like a transmission breakup but then it came to payne that swagger was sighing i hate going into any place blind he finally said its an old man who wrote a book about a shooter who died in the fifties you dont need backup what you need is a little patience youre going to have to sit there all afternoon and read those diaries maybe youll come up with something maybe you wont but that was your idea not mine meanwhile ill get down to new orleans and meet with her and well have some idea of what were up against thenthen we can go to the bureau with the evidence we can get indictments we can bring them down we can save our own lives we can bring it off but bob just repeated hate to go into any place blind no backup hes a cautious bastard isnt he said nickles scary son of a bitch thats why he dont make mistakes said payne i called nick was saying i can get a cab to drive me to the richmond airport i can get an eight am flight to new orleans and get there by ten the conversation trailed off finally bob said shit meet me back here at noon day after tomorrow and be careful dammit be careful you wont have any backup either im just going to new orleans said memphis radiant with delight sounding like a man in love christ said eddie nickles do we follow him payne studied on it then he said we aint got enough guys we can always nail this fucking weenie kid no swaggers the one well stick with swagger and nail him tomorrow dobbler was alone in his office it was late past eleven and he thought maybe hed try to scrunch up on the sofa instead of going home then tomorrow well tomorrow would take care of tomorrow bob would go up the mountain panther battalion would go up the mountain but dobbler knew he was too excited to sleep his mind was abuzz with possibility he looked at his watch again only seven minutes had passed since time was crawling he decided to work he sat at his desk looked at the bob swagger folders before him one for relationships and another for southern heritage and another for parents and still another on shooting yet he could not bring himself to open them what was there to be learned at this late date then he looked at his inbasket funny he hadnt noticed it before a brown interoffice envelope what could it possibly mean he hated interoffice mail it always equaled trouble he had an impulse to throw the thing in the wastebasket sighing he opened it anyway it was a good thing he did in the command tent by the deserted airfield seven miles from lon scotts place shreck was almost asleep when the call came it took him a while to quite understand what dobbler was raving about but then it came through yes they tried for weeks and weeks to get into the ftd computer network and finally they did anyway they ran a program to dredge out all the ftd shipments what are you talking about dobbler flowers flowers bob has sent flowers to someone once a year for ten years anyway a guy in computer services they got into the ftd system at last we thought it was a dead end but he kept trying he got into the system he managed to break the code for the little rock florists he called out all their orders he broke it down by dates and every december eleventh for the past ten years a shipment has gone to a woman in ajo arizona roses i colonel shreck there is a woman in swaggers life its the only woman he knows its the woman he loves her name is julie fenn its his great friend donny fenns widow ajo arizona shreck repeated thinking finally he said good work dobbler then he called an aide go get payne he said chapter thirtyone payne left before dawn having booked a am flight from richmond to tucson by two the whole thing struck him as pretty fucked up bob would probably be finished well before that time what was the point the woman was irrelevant by then but he would not question colonel shreck as he drove off the men of panther battalion were up and making ready for the day payne knew this part of the ritual the preparation for battle hed done it himself perhaps a thousand times in the last twenty years he could feel the tension in the soldiers and also their coarse energy and eagerness to get started in the darkness men cursed and jostled tightly or laughed cigarettes glowed a few men coughed a few shivered but it secretly pleased him to be leaving as no man ever had except the gook who got inside the wire with his rusted rifle and bayonet bob had scared him hed shot the fucker in the chest seen the blood fly watched him go down and then hed gotten up hed tracked them hed dusted two boys in the swamp he was a major massacre waiting to happen it frightened payne knowing that he was not capable of what bob had done as the camp disappeared behind him payne discovered a sense of release let these tough kids go against bob lee swagger theyd get him because they had no respect and did not know who he was or care what he had done to them he was just another gringo that was what it would take to finally get bob lee swagger stupidity and overwhelming firepower superiority but he knew swagger would get more than a couple of them bob awakened at around ninethirty and showered slowly taking his own sweet time the men in the surveillance van kept the directional boom aimed on his room and heard only the sounds of the shower the easy noises of a man preparing to encounter a relatively benevolent world for the first time there was no sense of urgency or despair no track of fear he left the room at tenfifteen checked out of the motel threw his bag into the trunk of the rental car then moseyed into the howard johnsons and had a nice breakfast two eggs scrambled three pieces of bacon toast and jelly he bought the danville courier and read it at a leisurely pace the directional boom in the van discreetly parked two hundred yards away behind the pizza hut stayed on him the whole time maam could i have another cup of coffee why sure nice day sure is now let me think did you take cream and sugar with that no maam black is how i like it it took him close to forty minutes to eat then he stepped out in the bright sun a tall powerful man in jeans and a denim workshirt with a corduroy sport jacket with pearl buttons put on his sunglasses and climbed in to be off bravo six this is bravo four the package is on the way said the observation team leader into his radio the package is on the way sitting in the operations shack next to the millersville airport where four blackpainted huey helicopters waited shreck received the message grimly general de rujijo have your sergeants get the first four squads onloaded the slicks he said the latino officer grinned his white teeth glowing he turned and barked in spanish men began to deploy to their ships in seconds heavily armed faces blackened with paint rifles at the high port festooned in gaudy belts of ammunition for the heavy automatic weapons black berets at a rakish tilt with a shrieking whine the choppers coughed to life and the rhythmic beating of their engines and the roar of the dust their rotors sucked from the earth became a part of the drama it is a good day for a battle i think said de rujijo my men are very anxious they will make me proud i know and now we have this thing finished shreck nodded but said nothing he looked at his watch it would take bob about a half an hour to drive the last thirty miles to skytop he picked up the phone and dialed lon scott hello mr scott hes on his way half an hour all right how do you feel i feel fine are we set i guarantee it the report says hes expecting nothing except some old papers good said lon scott im curious to meet him dont be curious sir just help us kill him when he comes in the door you take your hand off the photocell in two minutes well have the first four squads thats twentyfour heavily armed men there in ten minutes therell be more than troopers ringing the hill dont mess with him let him run clear oh i understand said lon headquarters had never been so deserted dobbler felt as if he were alone in the building nearly everyone else was so caught up in the drama they were either down there in north carolina with colonel shreck and panther battalion or had gone home dobbler also had the odd sense that people were peeling off slipping away to new lives rats deserting a ship that sort of thing dobbler was finished typing he was afraid that in the excitement of finally getting bob his own contributions to the project would be overlooked so hed sat down and typed a long ninepage memo detailing as modestly as possible his own role in the bob lee swagger episode after all it had been considerable he had designed the mechanism by which bob had been initially trapped he had designed the mechanism by which bobs second life had been terminated and he had found the woman to whom bob turned he was doing so well here it was wonderful and now it was only a matter of waiting he checked his watch saw that it was midmorning and knew even as he stood there that bob had to be on his way into the trap he decided the report was too important to leave to ramdynes indifferent internal mail system he walked through the deserted corridors and crossed into shrecks building he tried his office door it was locked damn dr dobbler what oh you surprised me it was one of the security guards uh i have to leave this report in colonel shrecks office do you have a master key dr dobbler he dont like nobody in his office the colonel himself just called he needs the report dobbler was amazed at his own assertiveness he knew his confidence was growing but he hadnt been this assertive since before the arrest the mans weak eyes blurred in confusion he could not meet dobblers authoritative glare in seconds the security man had yielded opened the room and allowed him in ill wait out here till you leave the guard said no ill close up i have to get some papers too yes sir said the man in some confusion dobbler went in in a strange way he didnt dare turn on the light he also felt strangely excited he was violating shrecks space albeit harmlessly but the experience felt titillating but the room was as unimpressive as always it seemed to have no personality whatsoever the colonel kept his eccentricities if he had any at all under the tightest of discipline there were no pictures on the walls the desk was bare there were no loose papers about the place had the scrubbed nearly antiseptic sense of the professional military to it in the dim light dobbler could see the whorls the buffer left in the wax on the linoleum floor those sweeping circles catching and reflecting the light were the only evidence of spontaneity in the place dobbler set the report down on shrecks barren desk the colonel could not miss it it was time to leave but he didnt want the experience to end he hadnt felt this powerful in years his eyes hooked on the old wall safe behind the colonels desk he had a massive stab of curiosity and mischievousness the safe was exactly the same as the one in his office which he rarely bothered to lock he wondered about the combination could it be the same too looking around for just a second to make certain of his isolation he walked to the safe and spun the dial he pulled nothing happened he laughed of course not how stupid he turned and turned back and gave the handle another tug it popped open the observation post was concealed on a hilltop a mile away from the entrance to skytop young eddie nicoletta had drawn the duty because hed been with payne on the observation mission in blue eye and had eyeballed him through a scope he was sitting in a hole about four feet deep and looking out a small viewers slot in some ersatz bushes just inside a ridge line before him was a celestron an eightinch surveillance telescope state of the art fortythree pounds of schmidtcassegrain optics that could be dialed up to which is where he had it now it was tiring peering through the aperture of the lens which was seated at right angles to the tube itself a huge fat wad of curved steel atop a squat tripod nickless head hurt and his neck ached the celestron was trained on the road running into the place called skytop and a bit of the ribbon of macadam of the twolane highway that ran by it now and then a truck or a car would materialize out of the wobbling foreshortened perspective seem to assemble itself out of pure bolts of light and purr through his range of focus jesus a mile away and you could see faces it was said you could read a newspaper at a hundred yards with one of these things and nickles believed it but every once in a while he just had to look up to keep from losing his mind what he saw then was the halfmile dirt road up to the house itself though he couldnt see much of the rambling onestory building beneath the trees it was enough to tell that it was goodsized the house of a man who was well off or better behind it was a swimming pool some cement walkways to what appeared to be a shooting range why cement nickles wondered and beyond that dominating the property what they called bone hill bone hill was heavily forested about halfway up its three hundred feet or so of bulk but then it gave way as it steepened to coarse grass and scrawny trees its top was bare except for the grass and a few stones strewn about thats where hell go eddie nickles told himself when the first chopper arrives and the greasers with their combat gear come crashing out thats where hell go hell go up hell run up and hell run and run and pretty soon therell be no place to go nickles got to see it all happen that pleased him bravo four bravo four you there goddammit it was shreck ah sorry colonel yeah im here nothing much going on keep your goddamn eyes open nicoletta he ought to be here any minute now yes sir said nickles he put his eye back to the eyepiece and watched as a cocacola truck lumbered down the road out of the bright nothingness then the road was quiet minutes passed he saw the roof first emerging over a crest just a flash then it was clear heading down the road just as they said the red chevy theyd been driving last night with a single looming steady silhouette cut off behind the glare of the windshield his tension growing nickles watched as the face assembled itself from flecks of light as the car moved into the focus zone a pair of hardset eyes a taut jawline a sense of steadiness at a mile away bob the nailer still scared him hes here nickles shrieked into the handsfree mike forgetting all radio procedure bob the nailers here bob stopped at the turnoff to skytop and got out of his car he took a look around what he saw was miles and miles of lush north carolina landscape rolling hills a few rills of hard rock a universe of green it had been a hot dry fall and although it was october the leaves hadnt begun to turn yet he took a deep breath as he looked around and his trained eyes probed and saw nothing the sky was an intense blue untainted with cloud the sun was high it seemed as if the day had stalled somehow calm and guileless bob took another deep breath climbed back into his car and went down the road between a double line of swaying poplars to the house he pulled up on the gravel patch that awaited visitors he went up the stairs and knocked on the door its open came a call from deep inside come on in agent memphis thanks said bob walking into the wide hall and into a sunny beauty of a room lined on one wall with floortoceiling books the open sliding glass door at the rear gave way to a small jewel of a swimming pool he could smell the chlorination in the air and beyond he saw the slope of a large green hunk of hill mr albright he called what he heard next was an electric purring then a man in a motorized chair emerged my name isnt memphis said bob i dont believe it is i believe its bob lee swagger bobs eyes beheld the man calmly he saw the powerful shoulders the long arms and the deformed body soft and twisted and mulched and locked in its chair and the legs spindly and bizarre and i believe youd be lon scott yes i am bobs hand slipped back into his jeans without hurry he had the out thumb snicking off the oversize safety it was now cocked and unlocked two pounds of trigger pressure away from the shot that would be the end of lon scott but scott was still evidently unarmed you wont shoot me no matter what weve done to you i still dont believe youre the kind of man who could shoot a cripple in a chair cripple for a cripple that was a right smart shot you hit in new orleans mister you dropped that bishop at fifteen hundred yards it was fourteen fiftyone i rebarreled the black king to and saboted one of the rounds you pumped into the bank in maryland behind grains of imr bob raised the pistol and put the front sight on the middle of lon scotts swollen belly he wondered if he shot whether pus would come out it was like aiming at a tumor or a larva or something he took about a half a pound out of the trigger but scott didnt scare it was as if he really didnt give a fuck if bob pulled the trigger or not its over when i saw your face i took my hand off the chair here and uncovered a photoelectric cell that sent a signal even as we talk theyre on their way lots of them pulling that trigger doesnt mean a thing you want to take me hostage go ahead theyll shoot right through me into you bob put the pistol down he heard the roar of the helicopters outside leaves began to shake under the pulsing of the rotors and vibrations filled the air as the birds swooped in to offload the first squads of killers it reminded him of the nam the swift arrival of the choppers the deployment of the men the merciless closing in upon the prey it was the classic airassault tactic bob said lon scott over the noise theyll be here in seconds and once those latino cowboys show up with their assault rifles theres no stopping them let me save you let me give you a new life were the same man bob flicked the safety back on the colt slid it back into his jeans then smiled dont kid yourself wormboy im a soldier youre only a murderer and because of what youve done every man who ever loved a rifle is a suspect in his own house i know who you are and you aint seen nothin yet then he turned and raced out the door dobbler looked inside the safe its contents were prosaic he saw a handgun some kind of automatic there was a wad of bills and a passport and drivers license both fake the colonel had made plans for a fast getaway prudent enough preparation for a man in his line of work and that was it no family jewels no dark secrets nothing remotely incriminating dobbler was somewhat disappointed hed expected a bit more he replaced the passport and the license and felt his fingers bump against something he withdrew it it was only a black plastic videotape cassette unmarked dobbler stood in the darkened office he could hear each tick and sigh in the building but no human activity he stared at the cassette tempted a bit afraid he looked over and yes the big sony tv was still at the table on one side of the room a vcr underneath it on the shelf he walked over and inserted the cassette his finger trembled as he pushed play bob dashed through the open door to the pool and saw three of them they had just come around the side of the house at a hellbent pace safeties off fingers cupping and tensing their galil triggers they saw him they were fast the rifles came upbob fired three silvertips in what seemed a burst but was really three aimed shots unleashed in three tenths of a second the gun flicking from recoil to sight picture to recoil to sight picture at a speed too quick to measure he killed two instantly with centerchest hits dead before their knees gave and they toppled the third hit in the throat began to bleed out spectacularly all over the cement then bob hardly having paused to fire cleared the deck of the pool fell into the deep underbrush and began to thrash his way toward the hill when he reached the incline he paused just long enough to shuck his jacket hit a fast combat reload on the colt he climbed through loblolly and stunted pines clawing his way over ground cover and tufts of dried grass the trees were not tall here and now and then hed run a dangerous trek over open ground behind him he could hear the choppers ferrying in more troops this was a big operation they were throwing everything at him now and then a shot would come arching toward him and one hit close by lofting a cloud of dust and fragments he winced but kept climbing at one point he paused for a quick recon they were searching for him with binoculars but he knew they would wait until they had all the men there could ring the damned thing before theyd move up the hill in coordinated maneuver thats how hed do it at any rate and he knew these cowboys were pros he looked and thought he could see movement the troops assembling into their squads under the cover of the trees the house was visible below and lon scott in his electric wheelchair was talking to somebody in jungle fatigues by the pool they were pointing up the hill bob could not make out the other mans face but he guessed he knew who it was he turned the hill was steep here and he was almost out of cover then there was a last hundred feet up the bare ground to the summit he slid the colt back into the holster the summit was a bare knob standing out against that blue pure sky sweat raced down his face into his eyes he blinked now he had to move this was the worst part the open part would they have snipers would they have a guy with a good rifle a steady hand who could down a running man at six hundred feet time to find out bob touched the green grass and took a deep breath and began the last pull over the bare ground to the hilltop thinking lots of men have died on hilltops there he goes said lon whose eyesight like bobs was still extraordinary shreck picked him up in the next second a man running desperately up the scruffy hilltop he brought the binoculars to bear and through their magnifying lenses saw a tall angular figure racing agilely up the last few feet to the top of the hill i could have hit him said lon it doesnt matter said shreck hes finished now its all over now a few shots rang out from lower down the hill as various panther battalion troopers having a view of bob threw their rifles to their shoulders and squeezed off rounds the bullets struck near him and at one point they thought they saw him falter but he regathered his strength and launched himself over the edge out of sight general de rujijo shreck barked de rujijo who had been standing next to his rto and two junior officers came over smartly whats your situation colonel we have all one hundred twenty men on the ground now im only waiting for a confirmation from my second platoon on the other side of the objective that they are in position then ill move my assault troops up in two elements and in a few minutes ill bring enfilading fire to bear move my final assault team up and bring you this mans head i just want his corpse said shreck he turned back to scott weve got his ass now i wonder what hes thinking about said scott it would be very interesting to know what such a man thinks about at such a moment shreck said i was once on a hill waiting to die you dont think about much you think about how you wish you could get another day thats all but this son of a bitch is probably thinking about how many of us he can take out before we nail him well i have one last thing for him to think about general de rujijo was suddenly waving at him colonel shreck the ring is complete shall we move out one second said shreck he turned to scott i want to send this bastard to hell knowing all the bad news colonel shreck said scott you shouldnt let it get personal hugh wouldnt want it to become personal fuck hugh said shreck its always personal he raised the bullhorn bob lay atop the hill he was extremely winded below about four hundred yards or so he could see the house scott in his chair and some officers and several junior officers standing around the pool men moved through the trees below suddenly there came a voice vibrating through the air bob lee swagger bob lee swagger you know who i am swagger i wanted you to know before i send the troops up to get you that we found your woman in ajo arizona shit bob thought i sent payne payne will kill her she may be already dead swagger sat back from the rocks he heard whistles as the troops began to move out payne had no trouble at all it went so easily the flight to tucson the rental car the hour or so drive to ajo he found the trailer without difficulty he parked and went up to the door and knocked when she answered he said nurse fenn yes she was the kind of woman that payne had never had hed had whores all the world over listless women with shriveled tits or young and stupid and poor and desperate having sex with them was nothing it was like doing yourself and in time payne lost interest in either unless he was drunk this one was classy somehow it enraged him that bob had once had such a fine woman and hed had nothing like her arent you the one who was with him he asked im not sure i you know him bob lee swagger tried to kill the president in new orleans her face lost its color she was not a liar i are you with the police no such fuckin luck lady he said and pulled out the remington cutdown as he stepped inside standing he felt his force overpower her he advanced driving her to the wall and stood against her squashing her the huge gauge muzzle against the flesh of her cheek what is just shut up and listen your goddamned boyfriend is alive in case you dont know but now hes dead i mean really dead now you just sit down and cool it or goddammit ill kill you myself just shut your mouth and do what i tell you i dont shut up now were gonna hang tight for a time dont you try nothing believe me i aint like any guy you ever met and if i have to i will shoot you in the head and walk away from it without looking back i understand she said swagger cant help you now he said some boys got him on a fuckin hilltop and they aint got no mercy in their hearts she looked him in the eyes then she said hes been on hilltops before you fool dont you understand it yet he loves hilltops its where he belongs the images were grainy hard to make out soldiers burning huts people running every which way all of it caught in the jumpy illframed haste of the inexperienced cameraman dobbler swallowed then he saw colonel shreck and jack payne and a third man a latino officer in a black beret with mirror sunglasses all wore exotic camouflage uniforms and were heavily armed they were conferring over a map dobbler hit fast forward the images hurtled by at warpspeed made ridiculous like vaudeville the soldiers were burning the huts and it looked like the pictures hed seen taken in the ukraine in where the ss men had burned the villages as they retreated but it was so different because these soldiers were young and strong and having so much fun as the tape rushed along the troops left the village and seemed to head down a slope the camera panned and he could see what had drawn them the village people had escaped to the water they stood in the torrent of the river but were blocked at both ends by small knots of soldiers with machine guns they stood shivering in the water he could see that they were mostly women and children dobbler watched as the hard young men walked to the waters edge his finger went off fast forward in real time he saw shreck and the powerful latino officer in discussion he heard shreck say tell them to get it over with then lets chopper the fuck out of here no rapes just finish the job and lets evac the hell out of here general the general gave an order and the camera shifted back to the water no dobbler screamed in the office no but it did no good the machine gun bullets from los gatos negros tore into the people in the water kicking up foam and blood knocking them down no dobbler repeated over and over no no no bob heard a voice i didnt think you were going to make it up that damn hill old man nick memphis said bob swiveled on his belly and saw him slithering toward him pork i have a spry step or two left in these old bones said swagger now wheres my memphis in his black fbi swat uniform with the mini slung over his back pushed a long canvas satchel over at bob swagger unzipped it reached in then with a flick of the wrist sent the guncase scuttling through the dust as he unsheathed the remington v with its leupold scope his finger snicked off the safety as he drew the rifle to him knowing it contained five m mm match cartridges each sporting a grain sierra boattailed hollowpoint time to hunt he said chapter thirtytwo shreck was listening to general de rujijo i have all my men placed now colonel shreck and im going to give the signal to move out good said shreck lets do it de rujijo turned to his rto and reached for the telephone mike to bark orders he was a vivid powerful man in slimeandmud dappled jungle fatigues face lean and leathery eyes sealed off behind the reflective surface of his sunglasses black beret pulled low uzi slung rakishly across the front of his camouflage tunic bright black star on his collar shreck saw what happened next very clearly the general was speaking decisively in spanish when the bullet hit him eviscerating the lower rear of his skull just above his spine and tunneling through to blow his jaw off the spray flumed across shrecks face shreck blinked as the jawless apparition with the blank eyes toppled forward just three feet in front of him he felt a stab of shock and in less than a second crushed it to death by sheer force of will and experience he understood that the next bullet off the mountain was aimed for him he dropped and pivoted executing a neat half gainer off the pool deck badly spraining a wrist but getting himself out of the line of fire the second bullet instead struck de rujijos aidedecamp a young major in the center chest the third bullet tracked the now fleeing rto man hit the radio ripped through it destroying it and carried into the soldier himself pulling him down to die of shock and blood loss lon scott saw the three soldiers die in less than two seconds and he watched shrecks swift exit from the kill zone he fell into spastic panic so intense it almost killed him there on the spot in a split second he had recovered hit the toggle on his wheelchair and spun quickly too quickly because he was leaning forward from the shoulders and he realized hed blown by the center of gravity he jerked back but it was too late the chair spilled pitching him on the cement of the pool deck anchored by the deadweight of the useless lower half of his body he was helpless he heard the shots mounting the fear in him went berserk aghhhhhhhhhhh he screamed bob lay in the classic prone smoothly sliding the rifle around on a hard flat sandbag that nick had lugged up to the hilltop along with the rifle and lots of ammunition he brought it to bear on the glade of trees where most of the panther battalion troops had assembled and were momentarily confused by the sound of the shots he laid his cross hair upon another officer talking into a radio mike and tagged him in the chest he swung the rifle just a millimeter as he rocketed through a bolt throw and shot another man he cocked fired cocked fired cocked fired he killed five men in seven seconds then pulling the bolt open grabbed five brass shells from the case six inches from his rifle and rolled them into the breach slammed the bolt home in the perfect o of the scope he became the crucifier he laid the cross wire of the lens on the forms cowering before him twelve times their normal size twelve times more confused and frightened twelve times more desperate for leadership and he began to destroy them they seemed so innocent it was so easy they died without protest or awareness that he had come to nail them but he didnt care he hunted yelling men sergeants and platoon leaders heroes and blew them away he shot for center body and in the jump of the recoil he could still see that instant deflation that signified a hit if he saw a man he hit him if he only had a head to see he shot that and when he hit a head it snapped back brokenly leaking and wrecked he shot fast to break the charge he knew if they did he was history that was their only hope to move up the slope aggressively under the doctrine of maneuver and fire taking casualties in the dozens but closing for the ultimate kill but not today these boys had lost their stomach for carnage in the first few seconds when his bullets unerringly picked and took out their heroes a brave corporal slithered lizardlike to a fallen rto and bob broke his spine an automatic weapons team tried to maneuver to the left to set up a suppressive fire bob gutshot the gunner and when the loader tried to pull the weapon from his stricken hands bob shot him low in the abdomen a private stood to shame his comrades into the advance bob rewarded him with grains of hollowpoint delivered at two thousand feet per second come on you fuckers he yelled hoarsely as his system loaded itself to the hairline with adrenaline it was the an loc all over again a valleyful of nva and he was there on his lonesome to take them out in the circular universe of the scope some men quit they just settled back and waited in the trees for him to find them others fled racing across the road their rifles abandoned a few tried to move up toward the cover of enfilades or arroyos but by now his eyesight was verging on the supernatural he was into the zone the rifle so a part of him that it felt organic he could not remember ever not having the rifle not having a world of targets he slipped into craziness the snipers twisted identification with an angry god and he shot faster and better still he shot through the heat and the mirage and when now and then a ragged volley of shots rose toward him he was incapable of caring let them come let them all come lon scott lay with his mouth on the cement listening to the relentless cracks of the rifle dry and far away it was astonishing with what speed the man could fire in the trees now and then lon would hear a scream or see the thrashing of someone mortally hit he knew it was only a matter of seconds before thered be a lull in the shooting and bob would swing on back to pot him with his strong arms he tried to pull himself along hating the mutilated thing that was his body hating his father for doing this to him all those years ago hating his life for the strange paths it had taken he began to cry he had thought he was ready to die but he wasnt he was terrified help me he screamed but no one helped him oh please dont let me die he prayed suddenly he heard footsteps some fool ran across the naked cement bent to him and with incredible strength hoisted him over his shoulder the man ran lon bouncing and clinging the two of them vulnerable to bobs whimsy for what seemed an eternity but they made it and with an animal leap the man jumped from the edge of the deck to the cover in its lee lon banged against the bony shoulders and rolled off oh christ he said to his savior oh christ that was the bravest thing i ever saw in my life colonel shreck merely said no and pointed to the top of the hill thats bravery that sonovabitch then they heard the sound of a helicopter when the helicopter arose from behind the tree line its hatch door bristling with guns and began to swoop toward him like a hawk homing on some prey bob simply pulled himself from his belly to his knees and found the braced offhand position his right or strongside elbow held above the level of the scope as if his arm were a guy wire to brace the rifle he saw the pilots white face blurred behind the windscreen in a split second when the bird pulled from pitched forward to shield the canopy by the whirring of its rotor to pitched upward to shield the fliers by virtue of the armor of the nose cupping them from beneath he fired fuck you he thought fuck you all the bullet hit low in the plexiglas windscreen through the scope he saw the sudden quicksilver of fracture smearing the glass and behind it the mortal squirm of a man hit badly and slipping into shock bob threw himself down reset the rifle on its bag and began to engage targets downhill where a group of men whod broken to the right as he was attending to the helicopter were skipping around the base of the hill and he took them down like skeet one two three and four coming dry on the fifth he was rolling five new cartridges into the remington when the pilotless chopper slid back into the trees gnashed violently as it fought them then gave up as it whirred to the earth in another second it had detonated throwing a fountain of oily flame high into the sky the brilliance of the flash momentarily drained the color from the day and the bright green trees bob didnt notice he was looking for targets come on he was thinking come on fight me i want to fight some more shreck sat with his back to the action beneath the deck level of the pool in a niche by the walkway out of the house breathing hard from his run with scott scott wheezed noisily and might even be weeping but he took no notice seven feet of reinforced concrete protected him from the fire he was safe he breathed hard trying to work it out from the shooting and then the explosion of the helicopter he read the course of battle he understood now that bob had been a step ahead of dobbler and had somehow found lon scott on his own hed let them think they were luring him in when he was luring them in he tricked them into the killing ground where the odds were to his advantage high ground protected shooting and a world of skittish leaderless targets before him the shooting was dying down now on the other side of the summit nick watched them move out of the trees they were a good three hundred yards out without a scope on the mini that was quite a shot for a but if he had to defend an entire horizon against an infantry company with a single semiautomatic rifle he knew that hed do better to hit them early than to let them get too close where they could carry the crest in a single rush he could hear bob still firing on the other side now it was his turn he was also in the classic prone aiming through a tuft of ragged bushes that he had artlessly pulled and thrown together into something like a shooting blind he was breathing hard but he felt surprisingly calm he could still hear bob laying down fire but he had no idea what was going on over there carefully he drew the rifle to him found what he took to be a spotweld let his bones hold the weight of the piece and squinted through the peep sight until it no longer existed he saw only the body of the leader behind the wedge of the front sight he hoped hed hit something this time front sight front sight he told himself ordering his pupil to contract until it was as clear as a dollar bill and behind it the target was a blur why this worked he didnt know but it was the essence of shooting he willed the trigger to break and somehow it did the gun bucked the sight picture was gone an empty shell popped away and when he returned again to see what could be seen what could be seen was nothing goddammit gimme that gun you missed again you jerk bob yelled in his ear and yanked the mini from nicks grasp he threw it to his shoulder and cracked off the rest of the magazine all twentynine shots the shells popcorned from the breech a bright cascade of sunlit brass below them on the far side of the trees they could see the survivors of panther battalion running raggedly for the far crest line theyre way out of range for that gun said nick oh yeah well not for this one he retrieved his remington threw the bolt and rammed it home bob was breathing heavily his face looked crazy with fury his eyes shrunk to hard glaring kernels he was blinking a bit strangely his face was smeared with greasy smudges from all the gunsmoke hed breathed and his hands and shirt were almost black he kept blinking crazily jesus said nick again let em go theyre running theyre broken whats it prove he aint broken said bob gesturing savagely to a hill a mile away theres a goddamn spotter over there donny seen the flash of his lens hes been glassing us all along you know your ballistic tables no well a goddamn drops about eighteen feet at a thousand yards winds about five miles an hour im gonna hold eighteen feet high and a mite to the left for the wind drift he dropped to prone found his spotweld and his shooting position then he cranked off five shots in four seconds flicking the bolt and ejecting a shell each time that ought to fix him now come on donny nick gaped at him huh are you all right come on donny i want to see what we bagged i have to find out what they did with my woman bob my name is come on boy weve done enough for today time to get out of the zone and with that the sniper headed off the mountain his rifle in his blistered hands to the copse a mile away where theyd stashed bobs truck two days earlier nick went running after eddie nickles thought hed bleed to death his celestron was shattered a bullet having drilled it through its wide lens and rattled through its insides it was nothing but a tube full of broken shards he himself had been hit twice once high in the head a glancing shot without penetration he thought and in the leg a ricochet as he cowered shitting and weeping in the split second after he saw the tall man through the scope suddenly spin to zero on him he knew hed never get out hed be gone before help arrived there simply wasnt much help left hed watched bob shoot the motherfucker and shoot and shoot he knew what that meant hey asshole he looked up to see the man himself he was attended by a beach boy with a crew cut you killed me he blurted i doubt that sonny from the looks youll recover that is if youve half a heart dont shoot me i just sat here and watched was payne here no no they sent payne somewhere they sent him to get your girl goddammit bob said theyll do her swagger these guys theyll do anybody this guy shreck runs the outfit he can do stuff like that bob seemed to think this over was shreck here yes if he isnt dead and i dont think he is you tell him to leave the woman alone if he wants me ill tell him where he can find me but hes to leave the woman alone or so help me christ whats gone before

its bad we didnt get him he led us in payne listened numbly to the details yeah he said finally in two hours no sweat he put the phone down your unlucky day honey he said watching her face my orders were to kill you if they got swagger i was just going to walk away and say i did but they didnt get him he got them your boyfriend killed fortyfour men today honey and that means you and i got bad trouble payne had to laugh swagger wasnt good he was beyond good he was so fucking good it was scary he could hear the fear in shrecks voice fortyfour men dead including nine of his best guys whod climbed aboard a chopper in an attempt to get some firepower on bob from a new angle and had been rewarded with a flaming death then dozens wounded panther battalion spread all over north carolina all kinds of cops hanging around drawn by the smoke from the burning chopper the whole thing a complete fuckup lets go where are we going east your boyfriends gonna wanna meet you we need you for that you got a job to do for us and if i dont then i cap you here you want that you just drive with me in the desert chopper picks us up ferries us to an airfield where a private jet has us in a few hours no

dead you know that payne laughed the bitch had some edge theres lots of blood between him and me honey lots of it and more to come but i got one thing he wants and that makes me a god to him she looked at him i got you bitch deputy director howard d utey of the fbi was known far and wide in his own organization and several others in the federal security sector as the man who got bob lee swagger this reputation had not done his career any harm in fact his recent promotion to the dd level and the fine corner office he now occupied on the fifth floor of the j edgar hoover building on pennsylvania avenue in washington dc was largely a result of the successful manhunt moreover the image of the burning church ingrained in the national subconscious was a lesson to those who would trifle with the security of the president of the united states a lesson provided by the federal bureau of investigation and not the secret service which had provided no lessons everywhere he looked all was serenity he had nurtured contacts carefully over the course of his career worked diligently extracted maximum performance from those beneath him formed relationships with powerful men shed himself quickly of those who couldnt perform and most important knew the difference instantly between those who could and those who couldnt he was careful to have men under him who were not quite as bright as he and he particularly understood the dangers of talent which was that while it was capable of producing spectacular results it was just as apt to go off by itself to nurse obscure grudges or lick psychic wounds after gross expenditures of energy talent wasnt consistent or loyal or pliant enough to be trusted howard deeply hated talent and made certain that none of the men who worked for him ever had any talent hed driven seven talented men out of the bureau and only one had stood against him the idiot nick memphis once so bright and brimming with enthusiasms carefully betrayed at each step of the way and yet stubborn in his refusal to leave the bureau but now he had nick at last it was the hearing suspended agents are given two months off without pay and then are asked to present themselves at a certain time and place to defend their records most understand that their careers are over and quietly turn in resignations in exchange for good recommendations some fight the inevitable at the hearing but howard had always prevailed but nobody had ever done what nick had just done nobody simply ignored the suspension hearing simply didnt show added to everything else even subtracted from everything else it alone was cause for dismissal howard didnt hate nick he looked on him as a young man who just never learned the lessons of the team in tulsa nick had blown his shot all those years ago by refusing to acknowledge howards control and look at how it had cost him and that poor young woman he ended up marrying then in new orleans nick had screwed up and screwed up again it was as if hed learned nothing from the hold that had been put on his career he still thought he could do it his way by his instincts his talents and his guts a supervisor cannot run a welloiled professionally disciplined unit under such circumstances now howard looked at the separation order before him he had merely to sign it as had three supervisors on the hearing board that nick had ignored and nick was gone he never enjoyed this part he was not a cruel man who relished his power what he relished was the system itself and his own mastery of it he believed that what was in his best interest was also in the bureaus best interest nicks greatest sin was that he couldnt be a team player he couldnt get with the program poor nick doomed to be an outsider a loser his whole life howards pen poised over the document he paused just a second then ah mr utey he looked up it was his assistant yes robert ah robert was distinctly uncomfortable which was strange for what had recommended robert was his complete passivity robert had no personality whatsoever howard liked that in a man go on robert youll recall that strange shootout in north carolina yesterday yes who could not recall it some drug war thing fortyodd men killed wounded latinos babbling of ambush and slaughter a dea task force down there trying to shake it all out well sir they found over fiftyfive mm shells atop that mountain yes we just got the lab report latent prints got seven good completes and four partials the computer spat them out a few minutes ago sir i thought you should know immediately howard still didnt see where this was headed at his level he was no longer responsible for onsite investigations wasnt that bob mattingly over on the bureau dea liaison committee sir uh the prints check out positively check out how yes sir theyre bob lee swaggers howard looked at him he let nothing show on his face he felt a little something rise in his stomach there must be some mistake swagger is dead and buried we idd the corpse through forensics everything was all sir im only telling you what the computer said i see and sir there was a rental automobile recovered at the site yes more bad news go on it was rented by nick memphis oh christ thought howard nick came awake in the cab of the truck when bob nudged him hed been dreaming about sally ellion of all things sally was laughing at a joke hed told her there was something about sally he really liked it was but he blinked awake somewhat chilly aware of the jounce of the truck the gray air of dawn he wasnt even sure when hed fallen asleep time to get up nick said bob yeah he said you want me to drive no sweat no said bob were almost there and its almost time nick looked around he saw that they were headed up the access road toward an airport terminal in the gray distance a small jet was getting ready to take off what you got a job to do what are in twenty minutes youll be on a united flight to new orleans be in by seventhirty what the hell are you talking about annex b you been explaining it to me for a month and a half now its time to find the goddamn thing but but nothing these birds have someone a woman who helped me once goddamned wonderful woman the best they got her and theres nothing i can do but stew and they know it and they like it it gives them all the goddamned leverage but when it comes to meeting time i got to have some leverage or shes dead theyll use her to get at me and theyll blow me away and then theyll blow her away and then they go on with the rest of their lives happy as pigs in a bath of shit you got to get me some leverage nick thats all there is to it nick swallowed i i dont know if its hard maybe its there or maybe its in washington or maybe its nick youve been explaining to me how i was doing this all wrong im man enough to say youre right i was a fool all i managed to do was get some people killed now its time to let a professional work ill step aside you go get this annex b nick looked at him he tried to think but its probably in washington its buried in some computer file in washington that only people on lancer committee can get to with special performance and he stopped himself the words rom do formed in his mind it all came back to rom do the message that eduardo lanzman had left him all those months ago on the day that his wife died eduardo lanzman had come to see him but think about it he told himself he wouldnt have just come thats whats been haunting me he wouldnt have just come with some crazy story he was a pro pro enough to know hed been made pro enough to try and protect himself from electronic eavesdropping as per the latest agency hot tips and pro enough to know hed have to bring something along something i could use to go to higher people and stop the assassination he must have i dont know but we didnt find anything on his body maybe his killers took it no whyd they chop him to get him to talk but he was a tough bastard who believed in one thing nick memphis of the fbi whatever he had he hid it between the plane and the motel room he hid it and he told me where he left me a message rom do romeo dog rd ramdyne nick huh nick were here the truck had stopped he looked and yes they were there remember said bob you be back by the first sunday in november you meet me at the cabin in the mountains the day before hunting season the most absurd document in the world shreck thought he looked at dobblers report on his desk a glance had told him that it was selfserving bullshit dobbler was hopeless shreck was waiting for the doctor to show up there was work to do and not much time left his session with hugh had not gone well hugh was capable of being extremely uncivil and in this episode he hadnt disappointed shreck he was a vindictive bitter old man who raved about legacy about heritage about responsibility he was enraged that the colonel had endangered poor lon after all lon had suffered and now lon had to give up so much when the colonel told him that lon seemed happy even excited about the whole thing and was treating it like some mad adventure and was quite happily nailing silhouette targets at a thousand yards in central virginia it still didnt sit well with hugh you two yale boys certainly go back a long way the colonel had thought i wonder to what hugh finally wondered frankly if he could do a damned thing for the colonel anymore shreck had told him he didnt want anything the situation had resolved itself to a three or fourman play in arkansas some two weeks hence and that he would prevail or die and that would be the end of it nothing would come out thered be no embarrassment lon scott could go back to obscurity the colonel held the trump card the woman with the woman hed be able to manipulate bob in ways previously impossible they could chopper lon scott into any point in the mountain range and set him up to handle any longdistance shooting chores and payne probably the best small unit man the special forces ever turned out would be along for the close stuff he himself had two wars worth of taking frontals as well as twenty years running outfit ops and hits then they had the devious dobbler masterminding things hed proven his worth they needed only one thing firstclass topographic surveys of the ouachitas satellitequality layout of the mountains hugh fumed but in the end he saw how little of him was required and how protected he still was when he realized he knew just who to call he relented now there was little to do except wait lon would be prepping the shot hed have to take payne watching the girl and he and dobbler working on the tactical and psychological maneuvers it was just a period of waiting staying calm bringing it off colonel shreck came the voice over the intercom one of the operations people who hadnt died in the chopper crash yeah said shreck i cant get any answer from dr dobbler and ive called three times no one has seen him since he logged out two nights ago at midnight thank you shreck looked at the document before him it was some time before it occurred to him that it meant that dobbler had been in his office but only thirty seconds after that when he discovered that the videotape was missing from his safe now what have we got utey asked his assembled people getting himself appointed the head of the bob lee swagger task force had not been an easy job but somehow demanding returns on favors granted and offering still more favors uncounted favors in the future and working fast off the tip hed managed it and gotten his old team in place and was now staffing the first meeting in new orleans sir said hap fencl heres how it shakes down they found fifteen discarded cartons of lake city m mm match ammunition atop that mountain lot b they managed to track it by that number to a surplus outfit called survival inc in tuscaloosa alabama august fifteenth i went over there myself yesterday morning they sold a thousandround case of the stuff to two men tall rangy guy midforties very quiet and heavyset blond guy crew cut who did all the talking they couldnt positively id bob but the salesman gave me an absolute total yes on nick memphis nick nick nick said utey howard said hap is there any possibility nick is working very deep cover for someone on a higher level i cant believe nick would go renegade on us nicks a good bureau guy bureau to his bones and even deeper howard considered carefully you never can tell he said he loved it more than it could love him based on his performance and thats where the trouble starts love can turn to hate just like that i cant believe anything bad about old nick he was true blue a square shooter this disturbed howard couldnt have men on the team whod made an emotional connection to the quarry go ahead mr fencl he said stonily these shotup salvadorans they tell a strange goddamned story it was guys from this panther battalion outfit you remember all that stuff about that atrocity last year that the cia denied any knowledge of but they say this time they were working cia going after a big communist agent for the cia and they ran into superman or rambo or whatever they got their booties kicked and thats all they say and brother is the agency keeping mum on this one umm said howard was cia involved with panther battalion somebody asked hard to say another agent said our files indicate it was a contract thing with an outfit called ramdyne which handles a lot of agency funny business without involving the agency directly but theres not much about ramdyne you ask and all you get is a reference to lancer committee which is our liaison committee with cia you cant tell about some of these outfits who pick up and deliver the agencys garbage for them sometimes they get so far out there they lose their bearings or maybe they never had any bearings to begin with so anyway said hap we got these central american commandos thinking theyre after some commie and running into bob the nailer at the top of his game on somebody named james thomas albrights farm and nobody has seen hide nor hair of james albright and there is zero i mean like no paper on albright no records no nothing guy was handicapped too dea swears there isnt a direct drug connection but boy it sounds druggie to me so whats bob doing making war on a bunch of greasers or what are they doing making war on him who told them he was a commie who wants bob dead who knew he was alive we sure didnt the agency could the agency have been gentlemen said howard working swiftly to cut off the apostasy i dont think pursuing the central intelligence agency or its affiliates is going to get us anywhere our first priority is the capture of bob lee swagger before the news gets out that hes alive it would be humiliating to us if this became widely known when we take him thats when we can go public with it is that understood howard if the agency began hap mr fencl please said howard some murmurs noddings grumbles now suggestions sir one of the men said the last time bob was in a jam he went back to blue eye and the ouachitas most men would have the sense not to try it a second time but this guy he believes in things he believes in home and knowing the territory if hes going to play a game dont you think hed play it on his territory yes said utey he would he paused all right he said im ordering the relocation of task force swagger to mena arkansas well set it up as before mr fencl i want you to handle liaisons with sheriff tell of polk county and the arkansas state police mr bryson you establish contact with milt sillito over at dea because well need all the information from their loop and mr nelson i want you to supervise the swat equipment and locate air support through the forestry department poor nick said hap i hope he hasnt bitten off more than he can chew the only thing he ever wanted to be was an fbi agent chapter thirtyfour nick sat at gate in the new orleans international airport at am on a tuesday delta flight was arriving from mexico city as the passengers began to emerge and disperse into the terminal he stood up and joined them trying to see with another mans eyes what would he think what would he notice how would his mind work eduardo lanzman if you were eduardo lanzman you got off this flight six months ago you saw what i am seeing now you were a pro your eyes scanned left and right up the hall and down the hall you were scared you had something in your possession that could kill you and you knew you were being hunted this was it this was your break for freedom and your desperate attempt to save the life of archbishop jorge roberto lopez and why even if you are a secret policeman you were raised a catholic this killing of an archbishop is it going too far or perhaps you lost somebody on the sampul river that day cut down by panther battalion in the redrunning water no matter what would you see nick walked with the passengers through the terminal then another question hit him why wouldnt you call me from here why wait until you get to that motel as he thought about it an answer formed because lanzman thought he was safe he hadnt been made he was all right he read the crowd and he read the signs and he thought everything was fine it was a straight shot it was no problem nick let his imaginary trip through the head of eduardo lanzman carry him across the main concourse and out to the taxi stand by the street it was not particularly busy you want to get this over with youll just take a cab straight into the federal building right youll ask to see me if you have to wait youll have to wait thats all nick hailed a cab yeah uh you know where the federal building is sevenohone loyola street downtown sure man hop in nick climbed in the cab sped away new to the big easy the guy asked no said nick trying to concentrate he watched as they left the airport sped along the access road toward i the big strip of federal highway that transects the shelf of land between the big river and lake pontchartrain upon which the city is built along the road there was nothing it was featureless nondescript a little parcel of anonymous america as they took the ramp and began to sweep toward a merge on the rush of i nick could see the gaudy parade of motels over on the right down veterans memorial boulevard stop he hollered huh stop dammit i said pull over what the the cabby a bald black guy with a gold tooth fumed but he obeyed his name nick could tell from the hack license pinned to the right sunshade was jerry niles now what just shut up for a second nick sat there the cab had slewed onto the shoulder and cars whirled by toward the city ahead no he thought he didnt get this far because if hes going to the palm court motel you cant get there once you get onto i youve got to make your mind up before you take the ramp buddy shut up said nick what does that tell you that tells you he made his pursuers on the access road was afraid theyd nail him on the road and made a snap decision to hunker down before they could do so it also meant he knew exactly how desperate they were that they would be willing to risk some kind of terrible public scene to stop him pros prefer to work in private they only go public with wet business if they have no other choice unless theyre colombian drug scum back up and head down veterans boulevard hey mister i cant back up and theres a fifty in it for you okay but if a cop comes i am a cop said nick reflexively then wished it were still true the driver backed up the ramp executed a kamikazelike and managed to get them after some honking and screeching headed down veterans the palm court was the third motel past the turnoff pull in here said nick the driver obeyed you want me to just wait a minute nick sat thinking hes been made he knows theyre close whatever hes got documents a microchip photos whatever hes got to dump in some place that he can recover dump it go into the motel before they spot him get a room near the coke machines in case theyve got electronic penetration capacity call nick memphis and then wait he doesnt know theyve got an electrotek he doesnt know theyll hear his call he doesnt know that when the knock on the door comes and he says whos there and the answer comes nick memphis hes letting his own death squad in no matter nick thought the key thing is hes got to hide his package something else came to nick eduardo youve been hit now youve been whacked by guys with axes theyve cut your fucking heart out but somehow jesus man you had a set of balls on you somehow you crawl into the bathroom and on the linoleum you write a message in your own blood no not the name of your killers but something else you write rom do whats it mean whats the message rom do i want you to go back to the airport where you picked me up and then repeat this journey you kidding i am not okay pal hope you got a big expense account the cabby swirled the vehicle around and returned to the terminal dont stop just follow the same route nick watched the scenery roll by along here you were made he thought you looked up you saw a car following you that wasnt a taxi you hit the panic button you saw them maybe reading their profiles through the windshield or maybe recognizing the vehicle but it had to be here along this dull limited access road with no escape no place to hide not even a place to stop they reached the parking lot of the motel again okay pal shut up said nick he sat there trying to think rom do rom do he looked around for rom do but the only words he could see from the parking lot were inside the cab jerry niles it read in caps up there on the sun visor dobbler felt absurd here he was among country types in the very small and rude town of blue eye arkansas a few hours west of hot springs there was nothing friendly about the place what had happened to the famous american smalltown hospitality people looked at him sullenly it was one of those onehorse places a scabby peeling town square around a confederate monument a banner floated above the main street proclaiming to all the world the bucks are stopped here hunting dobbler shivered he felt trapped in this godforsaken nightmare sealed in by the mountains everywhere he looked towering claustrophobically over the town the mountains scared him heavily encrusted with pines and on this rainy morning shrouded in mist they looked as if they could kill you he didnt want to go up there but he had to thats where bob would be dobbler really had no idea what to do with the cassette in his briefcase he knew the only safety lay here that is if he could find bob lee swagger no one else could stop them that was the irony in america with its fbi and its hundreds of police forces no one could stop them except bob lee swagger the man with the rifle if these people knew anything they werent talking especially to an outsider like him in his lumpy suit with his eastern beard they probably thought he was gay hed better watch himself high school boys might beat him to death with shovels or festoon him in a dress and drag him behind a pickup truck through town to the boundary of polk county but he had to have a plan there had to be a plan he had thought he might go back to the nownotorious bob sites the burned church bobs own stillsealedoff trailer eight miles out of town or the polk county health complex where bob had so flummoxed the fbi and ramdyne but when hed visited all these places that morning hed found them returned to banality their brush with glory and the national media completely over maybe guns were the hook he had gone to a gun store on the edge of town and tried to start up a conversation this was a big mistake the owner looked at him as if he were from mars and asked him rudely if he wanted to see something or what that one he said nervously the man took a large rifle off the rack opened the bolt and handed it over it was very heavy is this like the one bob lee swagger used dobbler asked the old mans eyes narrowed then he allowed sir in these parts some folks dont think bob done what they all say he done they say if bob had taken a shot at the president wed be havin ourselves a new president now that rifles a savage in thirtyoughtsix are you serious about buying or do you just want to cuddle on up to it and pretend youre bob lee swagger this hostility had frightened dobbler he handed the rifle back and fumbled his way out of the shop now it was three hours later and all hed done since was to wander around foolishly wishing to hell he knew what to do i know hes here he thought this is where hed go hed have to go dobbler looked up into the mountains they all looked the same to him menacing it reminded him of his first glance into the yard at norfolk state the terror and vulnerability he felt he resolved to develop some steel he resolved to be courageous he determined to go up to the mountains yes to go up there and somehow face the man he had to face tomorrow dobbler got into his rented car and drove back to the motel feeling utterly beaten he went to his room realizing hed wasted his first day entirely and that it wouldnt take shreck and his goons long to figure out where hed run to he had no place else to go he got out of the car and walked to his room he fumbled with the lock and stepped into darkness he wished he had stopped to buy something to eat feeling suddenly feeble he turned on the light hello little buddy said bob the nailer believe you and i have some talking to do he was afraid shed have a date or a car pool arrangement or something but nick was lucky as he sat parked just across the street from the federal building on loyola at pm sally came out of the building alone crossed the street went into the payless parking garage and emerged three minutes later in a gold honda civic he followed her into the traffic trying to remember where she lived or if shed ever said he simply latched on behind as she headed out i east until she reached the lakeside then followed the sign that pointed the way to gentilly woods he watched as she stopped at a fillasack when she came out a few minutes later with two plastic bags he decided it was time to move sally hey sally he dashed across the parking lot to her but when she heard his voice and he saw suspicion flee across her pretty face he knew in a second he had no chance at all of pretending hed just bumped into her nick are you trying to get me fired what are you doing here you followed me you followed me all right yeah i did well youre lucky i didnt have a date i know that youre the most popular woman in new orleans i keep forgetting nick youre in a lot of trouble you could get me in a lot of trouble you havent told anyone ive been talking to you on the phone hold it right there you havent exactly been talking to me on the phone when you want something like a top secret government report then you talk to me on the phone when you dont want anything then you dont have the decency to give me the time of day and why do i think youre here

a quarter yes give it here then sure what i do have a date ill go break it oh um hey with who norm fesper that guy hes a defense lawyer for christs sake oh come on you can do better than that i just did she said walking away to make the call they kept her locked in a room in a quonset hut the room smelled of rust and old paint but it was warm and dry she had a television they brought her food three times a day bland nutritious institutional stuff they brought her magazines and someone changed the linen every third day between eleven and twelve and then again between three and four they took her for long walks across the empty rolling fields she could see mountains in the distance she had two guards both were dour latino men who avoided direct eye contact and treated her with what might be called gentle firmness she was a practical woman she understood that hating them was pointless where are we she asked are we in virginia or maryland i know its somewhere in the east they would not answer but she knew it was the east because it was turning cold she had forgotten the cold living all those years in the desert but now the cold insinuated itself into her life crawling down the black wool sweater theyd given her to wear over a jumpsuit or into the bed when she slept there was frost on the window when she awoke and the days were hard and crisp the sky aching blue finally she was brought before a man there was no mercy in his eyes he looked like a deputy sheriff shed once known whod shot three men over his career here at last she understood was someone worthy of her anger where am i why are you doing this to me were not doing this to you ms fenn your friend bob lee swagger is doing this thats bullshit this is bullshit its all bullshit bob lee wouldnt do anything to hurt me im not here to argue with you about that bob lee swagger is a traitor and a murderer we have to apprehend him he is a danger to his country more bullshit bob lee swagger would never do anything to hurt his country he fought and bled for it for three long tours in vietnam he was wounded terribly for his country he was in a hospital for over a year for his country he loves his country the man waited patiently for her to finish he became an assassin and a spy bent on destruction he must be stopped well use you to stop him its our duty to this country i dont know who you are or why you think you can do this to me but when i hear the words duty and this country in your mouth i want to puke i think youre just a mob of gangsters and what youre trying to save isnt the country but your own asses youre here to help us stop him thats all we care about at this point im telling you this on good faith because i dont want you to hate me i want you to be willing to cooperate with me and with your country youre not my country i am your country he said im the part of your country thats willing to stand up for what must be done for what is necessary mister if you think you can get the best of bob lee swagger then youre just another fool wholl end up in the ground it was sheer bravado of course and even as she said it she wished it were true and prayed that it were true and knew that it couldnt be there were so many of them this horrible leader the little creep payne with his tattoos and beady scary eyes and all the robotlike latinos and some white trash all with guns all with attitudes it was a mob a manhunt a posse who was bob lee swagger to stand up to all this anger he was just a man she knew and she knew what happened to men they were going to take him from her how did you i still have some friends in this place mister they told me some eastern cookieboy was asking questions then he lapsed into barren silence they drove for what seemed hours bob pushed the white pickup far into the mountains they drove ruthlessly up dirt roads slithered through puddles and blew through fog banks and crawled along the edges of cliffs now and then they passed a rundown old trailer or some dilapidated cabin once a shaft of sunlight pierced the gloom and dobbler had a sense of vista he looked and saw a roiling green wilderness of mountain forest and ravine he shivered a terrible place dobbler at last said you you killed a lot of men a few days ago well they were fixing to do the same to me i know all about you ive been studying you for months i remember you bob suddenly said from that scene in maryland you just looked at me mister i could tell what a specimen you thought i was you thought i was some kind of special wild bear or something you are an amazing man youve been pursued by one of the most ruthlessly efficient intelligence organizations in the world comprised mainly of excia people and exmilitary youve destroyed them they may kill you yet but effectively youve already won and they know it too youve beaten them bob spat out the window mister he said its not over till i put your colonel shreck in a goddamned body bag and his pal payne too and get my girl back and clear my name now why the hell are you here two reasons really because they have to be stopped and because youre the only one who can stop them you been cashing their checks for a mighty long time a little late to come up on the right side of the game dobbler held out his briefcase what ive got in here is a tape that shows what they do i didnt know what it was i thought it was all spy plots greater good calculations trying to work to save the country and i guess i was into denial do you know what that is i know more than you think yes you do of course you do and yes you would know denial anyway i i looked at the tape that was the end of the denial whats on the tape the doctor paused auschwitz in the jungle at she said the dinner part was over youre really trying ill give you that and it was a very nice dinner youre a very decent guy i always knew that but you want your numbers dont you youll make me pay for a couple of hours with you ive got to do you the favor right ah have i been pushing it i mean did i bring it up well we got through your year of law school and my broken engagement to jack fellows and why i quit the kappa house at ole miss the same week i broke up with jack and how long its been since youve been out with a girl we got through all that just fine but about six minutes ago i think it was my crush on sam hawks the high school fullback yeah thats when the meter was up and you had paid me all the attention you were going to pay me now its ab nick all business nick thats what the women call you all those years with a crippled wife and you never even looked at any of us men like you dont grow on trees ill tell you that now lets go and get your numbers all right ab nick sure he paid the check and they drove down to the federal building now what is it im looking for okay i want you to run municipal taxi drivers licenses two ways first by numbers im looking for numbers with a sequence of r o one one one space d o something like that wow thats not much okay and then i want names from the licenses i want all the names that start with either rom or do and all the names that start do and end rom and variations on romdo or dorom nick what nick what on earth i think a guy trying to reach me with something left me a clue i first thought it was the name of an organization but now i see thats all wrong he was trying to tell me how he hid what he hid for me and the only place he could have stashed it was in the cab that brought him to his death so he either memorized the drivers name from the hack license over the right half of the windshield on the visor or the license plate number as the cab drove away see he had to have a way to id the cab so i okay okay ill try i cant promise anything she leaned over abruptly and gave him a kiss on the cheek what was that for he said for being a pain in the ass she said then she got out and went into the building nick waited and waited twice a cop car prowled along the street and flashed a beam onto him but his bland white face and coat and tie spoke the esperanto of class to the cops and they let him be the streets were otherwise deserted he knew up there in the office the skeleton crew was on the fbi never sleeps all that stuff and he could visualize her hunched at her terminal the low buzz of the office at quarterstaff the sense of restfulness and ease that comes on the graveyard shift hed worked it himself his first year in the office and was aware how lulling it could be at last she emerged but he could tell by the tentativeness in her body language that her luck hadnt been good no home runs he said when she got in nick i tried and tried theres not much to go on yeah well youre right did you get anything well first off the license number idea doesnt pan out at all it seems that cab plates are all numerical there arent any letters in them dont ask me why so there arent any license numbers beginning with an r dammit thats right i think i even knew that once maybe it was an or a and the number sort of fell apart but she trailed off okay one down what about names did you get any names she sighed and handed him the printout he opened the door just a bit to bring on the dome light its not great its not even promising there are two first names and one last name that begin with rom in which the other name has a do in it shit said nick stricken feeling like an idiot nick dont take it so hard ah christ i just but he couldnt finish he looked up the deserted street he looked down the deserted street another failure he looked at the names the list read romney donahue roman doheny dorly robards and that was it oh jesus said nick in despair its no good he groped you got me exactly what i asked for butwhy would he only write down part of the first name and part of the last name i just dont he trailed off the connection to lanzmans dying message rom do suddenly seemed vaporous well he thought it was an extremely long shot but he still ought to look them up check out their cabs and what are these other names well just to be on the safe side i got all the cabbies whose first names begin with either r or d and whose last names begin with r or d that was my first field of discrimination just in case your copy was wrong or it wasnt i saw it i saw it sally the guy wrote it in his own blood as he was dying on a linoleum floor i saw it in the linoleum on the tiles and then watched as it disappeared when nick stopped talking he stared at the list nick nick are you all right nick whats going jesus christ he said he pointed to a name on the list suppose the blood ran together in some spots it connected letters that shouldnt be connected and suppose he died before he finished i dont look sally look he was writing a name but the last two letters joined together at the top the blood ran across a crack in the tile and bridged two letters and he didnt finish nick had one of those weird sensations you get once or twice in a career when it all comes together an n and an i at the end of the first name they ran together and it formed an m and he wrote the middle initial and then he couldnt quite finish the last name but here it is he pointed to it on the list roni d ovitz it said sun cab co st charles avenue it was a magnificent workup shreck acknowledged the defense cartographic agency had created a masterpiece represented in multicolored plasticine topography were the many heights and levels of the ouachita range the gaps the valleys the enfilades it stretched for twenty feet almost six feet wide on the relief map dappled in green for forestation exactly as the satellite had recorded it the mountain range had been resolved into a maze of elevations they were all there black thorn winding stair poteau mount bayonet hard bargain valley what do you see mr scott shreck asked the man in the wheelchair hunched forward his keen shooters eyes devouring the landform represented before him space he said i want space lots of space itll turn on some sort of transfer we have the woman theyll have dobblers treasure theyll want to trade well want to trade well use the girl well draw them to us with the girl dont worry about it said lon give me the shot and i guarantee you i will make it mr scott said the colonel pardon me for not being polite but being polite isnt my business youre about to go against a combat sniper you dont have any mobility shit you dont have any legs you may have to take fire to return fire under fire andyour disability he can move if it comes to that and you cant and what happens if were hit or have to retreat there you are out there paralyzed on the ground with no help nobody will come for you theres nothing for you except death scott met his stare for what seemed the longest time the handsome head and shoulders on the collapsed body and the dead legs even now shreck hadnt quite grown accustomed to it do you know colonel shreck youve given a cripple a chance that no cripple ever had he smiled almost ruefully youve given me a chance to go to war and to test myself against the very best youve given me the chance to be complete if only for a few seconds shreck said i dont know who you are mr scott or what the hell youve done but ill say this for you youve got a set of balls on you at sun cab it turned swiftly to anticlimax first came the news that roni d ovitz an israeli émigré had been shot in a robbery two months ago and though only suffering a flesh wound had quit the taxi business and was working as a counterman at his brotherinlaws tcby franchise in a suburban mall but his cab was still the property of sun cab and a quick check of the records located it now on the road with another driver the dispatcher faced with two people with earnest faces and fbi identifications didnt hesitate an instant he ordered the cab in and it dropped its fare in the french quarter and got to the garage in about ten minutes so whats the beef charlie fed beef these two fbi agents they hey i didnt do a damned thing i thats okay pal said nick in his calming voice this isnt about you its about the cab that buggy is bad luck somebody shot roni ovitz through the neck and before that a guy named tim ryan was fuckin killed and but nick wasnt listening okay he thought youre in the backseat of the cab you know youve been made youve just got a few seconds what do you do the trunk how can you get to the trunk you cant get to the trunk under the front seat no the driver would see you and whatever you stashed hed dig it out a few seconds later nick said excuse me to sally then went and climbed into the automobile a ford fairlane he sat there his eyes closed smelling the odor of the old and sodden upholstery the stench of a hundred thousand other unremarkable passengers the tang of gasoline and oil and he supposed one other coppery whiff in the air the whiff of fear roni ovitzs fear tim ryans fear and for surely by the time they reached the motel lanzman knew he was quite probably doomed lanzmans fear oh you were a cool one nick thought you held together to the very end whatever it was that motivated you patriotism faith machismo whatever it was it was strong and beautiful stuff oh you were a man my friend an hombre oh yes you were his fingers had of their own accord fallen to the seat where blindly they probed and pushed at the juncture between cushion and back there was a gap there when the yielding cushioning was peeled back you could slide a document through nick got out of the car turned leaned in and pushed his hand through he gave a mighty tug and yanked and the seat lurched forward on hinges underneath it lay a tapestry of western civilization and its contents candy wrappers cigarette packs combs pens quarters and tokens two playing cards a business card and a rolled wad of some kind of heavy paper nick said sally at his shoulder pointing is that it nick picked it up he unrolled it carefully he saw immediately that it was on some sort of lightsensitive paper that made it impervious to photocopying and even as he unscrolled it he thought he watched the type dilute in clarity an hour in the sun and this baby was history no one could duplicate it except maybe the geniuses at the bureaus legendary forensic documents division the cover letter was written in spanish addressed to somebody named general esteban garcia de rujijo of the fourth battalion airranger first brigade first division acatatl salvadoran army it was signed by a hugh meachum no affiliation given it said as best as nicks clumsy spanish could understand that the mission as outlined orally in their last meeting was being undertaken by the extremely efficient organization with which the writer was certain the general was familiar and that it was to everybodys best interest that the business be completed as quickly as possible the writer also took the liberty of enclosing some background material highly sensitive most secret so that the general could rest assured the very best professional people were handling the job and that therefore he was not to make any attempts himself as that would completely undermine the cause in whose service they all labored so diligently nick lifted the cover letter to examine the document itself it was annex b chapter thirtyfive when he wasnt shooting lon was studying he began with rote memory he divided the map into one foot squares and attempted to commit each to the files deep in his brain he worked everything out slowly one step at a time with plodding thoroughness he sat there in the field headquarters hut in virginia in his wheelchair and just stared and stared at the miniaturized plastic mountain range spread out on the table before him rocking back and forth on the fulcrum of his belly after memorizing the material so perfectly that he could see it in his dreams he began to look for firing lines he needed a certain distance height a good vantage point the light behind him no cross breezes plenty of camouflage one by one he tested sites against his cluster of requirements finding and discarding possibilities when he worked no emotion showed on his face it was a wintry yankee face iron as new england the face of a man who knew death because he was himself mostly corpse finally days into the study he beckoned to colonel shreck here he said i found it his finger touched a valley deep in the vastness of the ouachitas far far from the town of blue eye shreck bent to read the inscription where the blunt finger marked it hard bargain valley it said dobbler was astounded at how banal bob found him he had presumed with no small amount of vanity that bob would find him fascinating would ply him with questions would in some way admire him using bob as others had used him dobbler had unburdened himself in one epic purge like a megacouchsession letting it all pour out his sins his fears his weaknesses his guilts he even blubbered as he confessed while secretly admiring his own performance but bob had just looked at him all squintyeyed what do you want dobbler demanded when he was done tell me and ill give it to you bob regarded him without much interest dont you trust me dobbler wanted to know it doesnt matter a lot why dont you ask me more questions youve talked enough youve talked too much dont you want to know how shrecks mind works about the relationship between him and payne dont you want can you tell me how to kill him uh no then you dont know a thing that interests me but theres so much more you think what you told me is so important but it doesnt matter a spoon of grease to me unless it can give me an advantage in a week or so meanwhile you save it for memphis hell listen to you i just want you to stay here and dont wander off you hear youre just another problem i have to solve that was the beginning then bob went out with his rifle for several hours leaving dobbler cabinbound bob didnt have to tell him that to wander off was to die in these remote regions in the cabin dobbler was always cold he shivered from dawn till dusk threw wood on the fire if you dont stop using up that goddamn wood im going to make you chop it your own damn self bob had said testily and sat there sinking into misery unmoved by the showy blaze of autumn that was exploding like napalm bursts all around he hated the filth of it also the lack of a toilet and toilet paper the same socks and underwear day in and day out he hated his own smell and wondered why he just got dirtier and bob somehow seemed always immaculate then one night late the door burst open dobbler bolted up in sheer terror sure theyd been discovered by one of the colonels raiding parties but it was a large angry young man with a thatch of blond hair and a rumpled business suit who seemed to be wearing four guns under his coat this would be memphis the doctor surmised and indeed it was he smiled anticipating someone more in his world than bob whos this sorry sack of shit nick wanted to know says hes one of shrecks men hes come over to our side because he didnt realize these boys were nazis he has a tape over there with the massacre on it who the hell are you mister are you working for shreck my name is david dobbler im a graduate of brandeis university and harvard medical school im a practicing psychiatrist although some years ago the board removed my certification he was the smart boy who looked at me like a bug on a pin back in maryland pork jesus christ as i told mr swagger i recently discovered that the acts of ramdyne were not as i had been informed in the national interest but rather the adventurings of a rogue unit naturally i felt thats all shit mister said memphis who had the policemans gift for locating weaknesses swiftly and exploiting them greedily you must have found something out that you thought shreck would kill you over and he probably would yes he would i have evidence of a massacre evidence snorted nick the world is full of evidence visual evidence on tape bob pointed to the cassette which lay haphazardly on the mantel he says they filmed it terrible things dobbler said women children in the water the machine guns the laughing soldiers the commanders the americans you have this shreck on tape nick said astounded yes and little jack payne as well giving the orders guiding a salvadoran general its all nick turned to bob jesus just maybe that would do it it would certainly suggest a motive for killing the archbishop and with a motive we could get the investigation reopened and other things might come out bob thought on this for a second then he said hear him out see what hes got im getting out of here for a time you two geniuses of education jawing away like piglets in the slop could give me a serious pain in the eyes it took time but nick and dobbler fierce adversaries at first soon enough found their common ground bob himself disappeared with his rifle and as the two of them were talking there came the faroff sound of shots when he returned he regarded them without enthusiasm nick rose and came at him now what have you got cooked up memphis bob asked its all here nick finally said with what hes got and what ive got we can put them away we can clear you but bob just went to the cabinet where he stored his cleaning rod and equipment and began the laborious greasy job of scrubbing down the bore of the rifle in his remoteness it wasnt so much that he offered a counterargument but that he communicated his displeasure by his stoicism and the hard look on his face nick pressed on bringing a trophy out for all to see annex b this is it he lifted the green bag of documents hed found under the cab seat in new orleans it turns out that annex b is simply the bureau abstract of the agency file on its contract outfit ramdyne except that all the names and dates and pertinent memoranda are included the facts are what we knew from the bureau file itself it was started in right after bay of pigs who started it my bet is that it was founded by somebody who was formerly with cia who was actively involved in planning the invasion but who got the ax when the invasion failed does that add up dobbler said yes bay of pigs was weakness failure lack of nerve they hated weakness of course said nick neurotically and i can see how to them the bay of pigs was the beginning of american weakness of committing to something then changing your mind beginning to equivocate beginning to undercut and finally dooming your operation to failure by your own doubts ramdyne was about following through about seeing the course the name even comes from bay of pigs said nick ramdyne large r large d it has no meaning except r and d which a guy i used to know said computed out in army lingo sixtytwostyle to romeo dog which was the call sign for the second battalion of twentytwentysix brigade at red beach the force that got cut off chopped up and captured so calling it ramdyne maybe thats somebodys way of commemorating the past and setting course for the future that sound right to you doc they were zealots dobbler said they were true believers they had a sense of building from the ruins like hitler i suppose it guided them to god knows what bob just sat there listening to the pitch running the rod with its bright crown of bronze bristle and its dank lubrication of shooters choice through the bore guide and up and down the rifle barrel bob we can put them away in a jail there can be a happy ending there can be justice hes right mr swagger terrible wrongs were done but the world can be restored to order and some of us in this room theres a provisional salvation for us too you can be at peace bob looked at them harshly its just words he said in vietnam we had a saying dont mean a thing thats what this is it dont mean a thing he put the rod down removed the delrin bore guide from the action and began to scrub at the insides of the chamber and the receiver with a blackened toothbrush giving the weapon his full attention its all here nick exploded or most of it i dont quite know what mission first got them together in the early sixties thats lost to history and the early stuff is mundane when they worked for the agency as a cover organization for shipping illegal cargos to various hot spots in the world it gets interesting in sixtynine when this nutcase shreck was recruited after the army sacked him with the mission of building an operational and training arm he seems to have created a kind of greenberetforhire unit these boys saw some action no shit africa in the early seventies lots of time in the mideast in the late seventies and eighties and lately lots of time in central america whenever some tinpot country had a job that needed doing but not the capacity ramdyne could field an operations nastyass team but never so nasty as with panther battalion on the sampul river last year they talk about that much doctor nothing they had perfect professional discipline i didnt know until i saw the tape and the job on the bishop they said he was a secret guerrilla and that he was working to sabotage the peace process he had to be stopped so that peace could be achieved he was an enemy of peace nick leaned toward bob this is the key part two hundred civilians most of them women and kids all wiped out but it wasnt a mistake thats the secret of the sampul river its what this thing has always been about they did it on purpose he had bobs attention now heres the killer nick said heres the only thing in annex b thats worth a damn its what puts shreck payne and all the ramdyne yoyos in the chamber when they drop the little pill he handed it over to the doctor its a note from shreck to name obliterated notice how the big guys protect themselves dated may sent through us diplomatic pouch from the embassy in el salvador read it to us doctor dobbler cleared his throat eyes only xxxxxxxxxxxxx washington dc re panther bn training operations ocalupo salvador general de rujijo agrees that punitive measures must be taken against the peasant population but finds that his soldiers drawn from the same population are reluctant on the scale we have conceptualized my training cadre has isolated two platoons of panther battalion and we seem to be making real progress in bringing them to the proper level of willingness will be moving onto sampul river district in june and commencing counterinsurgency ops that area anticipate sanitation program to commence that date signed raymond f shreck there was a moment of silence you see said nick some genius in an office somewhere wants to get the guerrillas to the peace talks but theres no pressure on them nothings happening theyve made some kind of deal with the rural population so he dreams up this idea send in some crack troops line up the peasants and blow em away it was a massacre ordered up out of a catalogue atrocity one each od summer issue number murderrus the point being to scare the peasants so fucking bad theyll never help the guerrillas again the guerrillas have to come in and make powwow and heres the worst part it worked hes probably even proud of himself he did the hard thing he made the world a better place and it only cost two hundred or so women and kids thats ramdyne isnt it doctor i mean thats classic ramdyne the hard thing said dobbler yes they could have done that yes thats what the tape shows anyway said nick with the tape and annex b shrecks dead the whole fucking program is blown out of the water and anybody who sailed on the ship that includes the bureaus lancer committee who bought the national interest bullshit hook line and sinker goes down with her down to the bottom bob just nodded grimly theres only one problem said nick this file was sent to the general prior to the operation against the archbishop it was meant to keep him from going hogwild and boy the stink its going to make when it gets out man itll make watergate and irancontra look like tea parties but maybe itll get you off the hook and maybe it wont bob was done with the action he took an aerosol can of gun scrubber and began to blow compressedairdriven solvent into the trigger mechanism with a sharp wet hiss it doesnt matter said bob heres the plan said shreck very simple its how we bring bob into scotts kill zone scott says he can deliver the oneshot kill at ranges no man not even bob can guarantee hell take it at between fifteen hundred and seventeen hundred yards a mile perhaps hes operating at the very edge of the envelope where not even bob has been before and thats our advantage this is how we do it payne leaned forward to listen scott goes in independently about a day in advance of our arrival hell never hit blue eye so nobody will see him or even know hes there and no one will believe that a man with his infirmity could penetrate so deep in the wilderness hell go in by chute a halo job high altitude low opening the night before landing in hard bargain valley nicoletta goes in with him and well drop an atv nicoletta will be his legs and get him up to the ridge and dig him a spider hole meanwhile our end of the operation takes the form of a barter we have the girl bob has the cassette the woman will mean more to him than the cassette to us we make contact with him just as he said in blue eye well offer him the woman for the cassette payne wanted the woman too well offer him the woman and a fresh start the colonel continued well tell him that we can set it up so that hes no longer a marked man he can have his life back he can have the woman hell seem to accept but of course itll be a lie hell make the exchange then count on his skills to double around and kill us from afar but he cant do it until the woman is safe thats the key we have to preempt him how do we set up a swap payne asked we tell him that were worried about his ability to pick us off at long range we cant give him that opportunity we tell him that at hours on november third well fire a flare in the sky a red flare he makes a compass fix on it and has one hour to make it to the site when hes there he finds a flare pistol he fires an answering flare so we know hes in position we fire another answering flare again he has an hour to reach the spot again he finds a flare and lets us know hes arrived in that way we bounce him through the mountains he never has time to get set up because hes got to stay on the move to get to the site so that he can fire the pistol so that we fire our flare pistol we maneuver him into hard bargain valley he should be exhausted and desperate in the middle of the valley we wait for him hell feel safe there because the closest shooting range is well over fifteen hundred yards and he knows nobody can hit at that range he cant hit at that range plus how could we get poor old crippled lon in to even attempt such a thing at one hundred yards distance he sends over memphis with the cassette we send over you with the woman when i see the cassette is all right i simply press a button on my watch that emits a high pitch of noise that lons radio can pick up hearing the signal lon takes bob down from fifteen hundred yards you and i shoot memphis its over the woman payne thats a stupid question yeah said payne nick looked at him for just a moment the way he processed information somehow got fouled up and then he realized that indeed bob had said what bob had said it doesnt matter he exploded are you kidding it does matter youre innocent this whole thing has been about your innocence not because its you but because thats how the system works the innocent go free the guilty go to jail thats america thats whats at stake bob put down the cleaning implements pork this here thing isnt about getting me off a hook its about something else i got a woman who did me good who is now paynes playtoy i got a dog that stuck by me when no one else would and ended up in the ground i got a country that thinks anybody who fought in vietnam is some kind of crazy sniper who shoots at the president and any man who owns a gun is a crazy man those are debts that have to be paid first off and then theres the goddamn tape and that letter i dont want that goddamn thing playing on the tv like a movie and all those reporters getting rich and writing books off that letter for years to come no sir not by me not if i have breath to stop it you have to let the cards fall where they the cards fall where i put them and heres where i put them plain and simple were going to zip the bag on those boys and save that woman and then ill deal with the other thing agree with me or get out of here julie first shreck and payne second and nothing third got that nick looked at bob sitting there stolid as a rock he felt like geraldo rivera interviewing wyatt earp and wild bill hickok at the same time there was no bend in bobs furious rectitude his nutty conviction that he would do what he had to do jesus you are a stubborn bastard bob he said your only way out is with this letter and the tape and play it my way or dont play it thats all got that if i dont believe youre on my program ill ship you out of here you can go back to new orleans and that little girl and let me take care of the mens work nick didnt have to think a second he was in always had been had to see how it would finish hed given himself to this strange bird and so he elected to stay the course not that he had a real choice sure he finally said its fine well do it your way i havent told you everything said dobbler and now i will they both turned to look at him what makes shreck such a powerful antagonist one of my duties at ramdyne was to interpret tests he had once been tested when he went to work there the psychologist then was an idiot and didnt understand but the results are clear shreck is more than a sociopath hes one of those rare men who is simply not afraid to die who in fact wants to die payne is the same way you see thats why they are so frightening most men care about life in the end most men always act out of selfpreservation but these two dont care and wont act that way its a function of selfhatred so passionately held that its off the charts another pause then bob said you know doctorman you must come from some pretty soft places to find that so remarkable you could be describing one half of the worlds professional soldiers and both halves of its professional criminals truth is i used to be one of those boys didnt give two hairs about surviving now i have something to live for now im scared to hell ill die will it cost me my edge he almost smiled one of the few times nick had ever seen anything so gentle play across the strong hard features of his face sure is going to be damned entertaining to find out isnt it bob said chapter thirtysix nick said hed do it bob was stern no funny business no heroics you play hero you kill us all do you understand yeah i understand i can handle this i know you can im just telling you whatever they say you agree you listen hard and you agree nick climbed into the pickup and drove down the mountain in the dark it was a wet shaggy predawn and tendrils of fog clung to the hollows and valleys for nick it was like driving through some halfremembered land from his childhood as if dragons lurked in the tall pines and the deep caves many switchbacks and crossovers later he came to flatland farmland and a highway passed the burned church and then drove on in to the town of blue eye itself which even in the rain looked festive the sun was up as he arrived the bucks are stopped here the sign still said fluttering over the town square bright shiny pickups and recvs lined the street rifles visible hanging in the racks in their back windows everywhere nick could see men proud in their blazeorange camouflage tomorrow was the first day of deer season nick parked and pushed his way through the crowd which seemed to have been drawn to some epic pancake feed put on by the kiwanis or jaycees the boys were talking rifles and loads hunting techniques telling stories of giant animals whod soaked up bullet after bullet and then walked away there was a common anticipation and a sporting crowds fever in the air all agreed that what with a moist and succulent summer the arkansas whitetails were everywhere it would be everybody said a great year for a venison harvest but nick melancholy as always with the approach of action ignored all this went to the square and sat himself down on a bench near a statue of some ancient confederate heerow in pigeonshitgreen copper there he slumped a glowering figure in jeans and a rough workmans coat his beretta in a speed holster upside down under his left arm not three inches from where his right hand just happened to fall he sat and he sat and in time he had no sense of it at all a man came and sat with him it was very smoothly done but then everything these birds did they did smoothly they were professionals memphis yes good there said the man can you see her no said nick see the plymouth voyager van the back door is open shes sitting there can you see her he could she was a lean middleaged woman handsome and composed dressed in a sweater and jeans and with a grave look on her face there was something stiff in the way she sat sitting next to her was payne he remembered payne from the swamp and the jaunty relishing way he had interrogated nick and got him ready to die and he remembered payne from annex b payne of the sampul river yeah i see them do you want to talk to her no you have the cassette the cassette you bet but weve got more than that i also managed to dig annex b up oh said shreck theres enough to send you and payne to the electric chair three times man theyll deepfat fry you to a crisp shreck laughed not this time sonny now you know how this has to happen we need that cassette swagger thinks the woman is important and we both know bob has a stubborn romantic streak dont we nick turned he looked at raymond f shreck for the first time he wasnt disappointed he thought of the word tough and imagined it carried out to some science fiction degree shorthaired steady and strong the colonel looked like a hardball round in flesh he was all blunt force hard eyes sitting ramrod straight not a tremor or a line of doubt anywhere about him you know if it were up to me and i was still with the bureau id bust your ass so fast youd leave your teeth in the street shreck smiled sonny people have been trying to kill me for nearly forty years theyre all dead and buried and im still here so dont try to scare me its a little late in the day for that he was wearing a trebark camouflage suit and a blazeorange baseball cap that said in gold sans serif across the front american hunter and damn proud of it his eyes met and held nicks as forcefully as an assault and it was nick who finally looked away tell swagger if he crosses me i kill the woman kill her dead cut her throat watch her die walk away ive got tons of money and a thousand new identities i can slip into im home free at any second if i want to be but you want that cassette and those documents frankly i dont really give a shit about the documents but the cassette does have my face on it its the only absolute record of my appearance life could be difficult if it got out but the people i work for will be excited about the documents so bring them too or i kill the woman now this is how we play it nick listened intently as the colonel laid out the plan at the conclusion shreck handed over a map a geodesic survey of the high ouachitas with the start point laid out and a mm brass flare pistol we dont want the nailer nailing us we have to see him moving so we know he isnt setting up somewhere above us to take us down from eight hundred yards maybe youll have a guy to nail him nick said no way we cant nail him because he may not have the cassette and annex b with him hes got insurance ive got insurance mutual deterrence it kept the world alive for fifty years ill set it up so the final exchange is in the wideopen spaces way beyond any rifle range uhhuh and when the exchange is made we walk away its over were out of business but so is he he has his woman and his freedom the feds think hes dead he can have his whole life back if he lets it lie hes had a hell of a war but the war is over now its time for him to go someplace in montana where beaucoup deer and antelope roam and just shoot and fuck all day long toward late afternoon of that same day a banal van left a motel and drove to a civilian hangar at a small airport twenty miles south of little rock it contained three men one of them was eddie nickles and another was a dour figure with the head and shoulders of a greek god and a broken body who sat alone with his rifle in a wheelchair in the back he spoke to no one it made eddie nickles nervous if bob scared him this guy scared him too especially in that he wasnt even whole he had the aura of death to him that was for sure he was like a butcher or an embalmer guy fuckin scares the shit out of me nickles said to his companion one of the morose survivors of panther battalions assault on bone hill another lad whod lost his sand at the hangar they pulled up next to a dc glistening silver arkansas central airlines it said in green art deco print under the windows a double cargo door had been opened two thirds down the fuselage toward the tail nickles got out went over and conferred briefly with the pilot then he leaned into the open cargo bay and saw the atv a threewheeled honda with soft fat studded tires for gobbling up the rough land and steep inclines of the wilderness it had been staked to a board with heavy yellow rope a bulky pack that he knew was a cargo parachute was lashed to it everything okay chief he called to the cargo master still checking the rigging thumbs up bud said the man nickles went back to the van sir im going to load you now he said dont touch me get the ramp down and stand aside yes sir nickles pulled the ramp out of the van he stepped back and watched as the man leaned over and took the blocks out from under his wheelchair tires then he forcefully rocketed himself to the edge shot down the ramp and headed to the plane the man wore a black baseball cap and had smeared his face with black and green paint he wore black boots and a black and green camouflage tunic the rifle encased in a plastic sheath against the damp weather lay in his lap he had a browning hipower pistol in a black shoulder holster okay nickles yelled up to the cargo master we need the winch now the crewman swung out the device and with an electric purr the wire descended from its pulley bearing a hook i have this harness for you sir said nickles the man looked at him and nickles recognized with a stab the fury and humiliation in him to be that helpless among all these robust men but uncomplainingly the man slipped it on and cinched it tight his jaw trim his eyes set he adjusted himself to the indignity of being loaded aboard the plane like a haunch of beef lon was free he fell in darkness feeling the wind pounding at him for just a second he was a boy again stalking the hills of connecticut twenty miles west of new haven with his father the sun was a bronze smear the earth leaped toward him then with a thud his chute opened rustling in the wind like a sail he remembered sailing when he was a boy on the sound his father had taught him to sail those had been wonderful times hard bargain valley hit him with a bang he lay in the grass he struggled with the harness and the chute fell away he sat upright he could see the atv a few hundred feet away its chute plump in the breeze that coursed along the valley floor but no sign of nickles he looked at his watch it was almost five and suppose nickles had killed himself in the jump his parachute hadnt opened hed hit the ground at eight hundred feet per second lon laughed after all the planning hed gone through in his life wouldnt that be a final joke he looked around alone on the floor of the valley to the east he saw the ridge sweeping and grass covered to the west a line of trees as the elevation fell away toward the forest below he saw other mountains too it was completely quiet except for the popping and snapping of the chute on the atv sir he turned nickles was approaching him from the south with the rifle in a sling over his arm where the hell have you been my chute opened early and i carried about a half mile away lon realized the boy had panicked not trusting the altimeter device rigged to blow the chute out at six hundred feet and had pulled the emergency ripcord but it didnt matter now okay get the atv rigged collect the chutes and lets get the hell up the ridge yes sir payne woke julie fenn early in the back of the van around four yet when they drove through the dark town the streets were crawling with men on the first day of deer season the animals would be stupidest and least wary and the hunters were moving into the woods to be in position by sunup for that first shot you just keep your mouth shut payne told her you got another day then its all over for you and you get to go home but he was lying shed seen the other mans face she knew that doomed her there was something secretly savage in his eyes he could look at her and talk to her and plan to kill her all at once but she had difficulty concentrating these days she wasnt sure what the drug was she guessed it to be something in the amobarbitalb range a powerful barbiturate that had the additional effect of eroding the will theyd been gradually increasing the dosages too until on some days she couldnt remember who she was or why this was happening always so tired all she longed for was to go back to sleep and wake up back in arizona very occasionally she wished she had something to fight them with but they had taken her only weapons they sat her in the seat behind them and drove the van up high mountain ridges down dusty roads passing hordes of other fourwheeldrive vehicles watching as men clambered out in the glare of the headlamps snorting plumes of hot breath in the night air their rifles glinting and jingling as they headed out for their stands and after a while the hunters thinned and then ceased altogether they drove on endlessly she looked up dreamily her head resting on the cool pane of the window the stars above were bright like pinwheels of fire the air brisk and magical she could lose herself in them totally she felt herself drifting through them and only the sudden sharp bounce of the tire on a rut in the road jerked her back to the present with effort she fought her way toward a consideration of her circumstances she wanted to kill them she wanted to see them die smashed into the earth but it hurt to hold that thought in the front of her mind for very long she felt the idea break loose from her brain and begin to drift away until it could no longer be grasped or recognized but just as it seemed to disappear forever she had one last instant of clarity i hope youre there bob she thought i hope you make them pay were here said payne this is as close as we can get by vehicle to the first checkpoint its about two miles and weve got a few hours yet no sweat no sweat said shreck now lets suit up the two men got out of the van and payne slid the cargo door open inside the woman sat passively while payne bent to the floor where two kevlar secondchance ballistic vests lay he retrieved one and handed it to the colonel thanks said shreck they slipped their coats off and pulled the heavy vests on securing the snaps heavy as shit said payne but itll stop goddamn near anything including a rifle bullet said shreck he fastened the last snap and said get the woman payne stepped back inside julie sat there limply a vacant look on that beautiful face come on sweetie time to play with the big boys pulling her by the arm he was again amazed at how light she seemed and compliant now after the spirit shed shown in arizona she seemed to be in another gravity or something you could launch her in a direction and shed sail on out in that direction until she was stopped or bumped into something god if bob the nailer knew what shreck had done to her but bob wouldnt be knowing anything after a few hours okay he said all set fine said shreck shreck had his rifle out it was a bland little marlin lever gun with a scope he had on his baseball cap and an expensive camouflage outfit and he looked for all the world like a prosperous hunter in case they should run into forest rangers or park service personnel though that was highly unlikely they didnt like to come into the forest on the first day of deer season unless they had to shreck led though the vests were heavy and the ground was rough and they were climbing it wasnt hard and they pushed the woman along when she dragged behind eventually the sky turned orange and the sun rose it looked to be a clear day with one of those high piercing skies sweet blue the wind brisk and moist and pure first day of deer season thought payne a good day for killing a shot rang out far away a crisp rolling echo somebody had drawn blood it was a good omen all right said bob last chance for questions any questions we did it all a hundred times yesterday you forget it all yet dobbler and memphis looked at him nick was grave stiff but determined bob saw that marine look that donny fenn look that said hey i dont want to be here but i dont see anyone else hed be all right dobbler was something else he was on the edge of panic bob could see him lick his lips stroke his chin his eyes shifting nervously this was all new to him he was cherry would he hang tough or bug out bob didnt know and he didnt like the gamble but he had to play with the cards he had dr dobbler no memphis this is so chancy i still that it is you have a better idea you should be on the rifle not dont you worry nick bob you know what i did the last time i know what youll do this time the whole thing turns on my youre the man who found annex b youre a goddamned fbi agent one of the best you can do it youre the war hero not me no such thing as a hero you forget heroes nick this is about doing the job and coming home you do your job and you come home i swear it but you dont you worry about me none of your business about me i got what i signed up for okay okay nick said sullenly the doctor tried to say something but the words caught in his throat hey doc said bob in three tours in vietnam ive been in some scrapes its okay to be scared shitless dobbler cracked a wretched smile if russell isandhlwana could see me now he finally said i dont know who he is but hed crap in his pants that i guarantee you said bob he winked actually happy and they set off okay said shreck hours set payne lets do it sir its going to be a long day fire the first flare payne lifted the flare pistol pulled the trigger felt the crispest pop and watched as a red arc of intense light soared overhead caught on its own parachute then began to drift flutteringly to earth in twenty seconds it was out in thirty seconds it was down they walked to the little silk chute and the blackened sulfurous husk of the burnedout illumination round leave a round there said shreck a green one payne threw a brass flare round into the furls of the parachute now we move to our next position theyve got a long hard climb to make this one and we dont have very far at all in fact we should be able to watch them come they pushed the woman along and walked the crest of the ridge it was easy moving because the ground was clear and stony and the air bright they covered a mile in fifteen minutes then plunged downhill for a swift half mile there nestling in a grove was a canoe that payne had planted days ago he righted it plunged it into a stream and the three climbed in propelled by paynes powerful strokes they made three miles in the remaining time then hiding the canoe they came to another ridge payne bent into the underbrush pulled out a lank rope and yanked it tight so that it coiled and slithered under his tension like an awakening snake it extended halfway up the ridge to where it had been pinioned into the stone at that point payne had dangled another rope from still higher on the ridge all right mrs fenn you just pull yourself up as you climb youll find its much much easier than climbing unsupported at each stage payne coiled the rope and hid it when they reached the crest none of them were even breathing hard the telescope said shreck theyll be on the ridge soon enough payne pulled a case out of his pack and unlimbered a redfield regal vi spotting scope with a zoom lens mounted it to its tripod and bent to its angled eyepiece jacked the magnification up to maximum and found a clear view of the ridge across the way all set colonel shreck well theyre late this early in the game and theyre late theyre losing it they had a long pull they had four miles over two ridge lines with a stream to ford theyd only just now be making it finally with three minutes gone over the hour deadline the green flare rose and floated down all right fire quickly dont give them any time to rest payne fired a blue flare into the air and in the last moment of its arc he saw a figure come straggling over the surface to take a fast compass reading just barely made it bubba he thought a few minutes later three figures were visible on the crest line two miles away magnified sixty times they were still ants but recognizable ants and it became immediately obvious what the difficulty was it must have been bob out front he looked as if he could go for another ten years too bad they dont make a twomile rifle motherfucker payne thought id have a snipe at you myself the middle one would be the younger guy memphis he remembered memphis memphis wore an fbi raid jacket and its initials almost yielded their individual meanings before collapsing back into blazeyellow blur memphiss face was lost behind a mask of camouflage paint but his body language looked stolid and determined the problem was the third one jesus it was dobbler face painted like a commando or not he was still recognizable by his pansy body and that prissy lack of strength in his flapping limbs its dobbler payne yelled colonel shreck for christs sakes they brought dobbler along and he dont look happy dobbler had gone to his knees and his mouth was open payne imagined he could hear the ruckus even two miles away i can see hes yelling jesus i can just hear him i cant make it i cant go on why did i ever do this that kind of candyass shit let me see said shreck payne moved to let shreck at the scope swagger you fool said shreck with a contemptuous snort as he watched you should have shot him eventually they saw the other two get the abject figure to his feet i wonder how long hell last said shreck payne would shoot dobbler just as he knew shreck would if you aint up to the field you die that was all that was the rule he himself had shot a captain once whod fucked up so bad in an acamp fight and was weeping piteously in the bunker hed bet shreck had done it too but not bob bob was a secret pussy he didnt have what shreck had and what payne had he couldnt do the final thing he couldnt get it done thats why now at the end when it came down to balls and nothing else hed lose dobbler finally gave up around one oclock it was surprising that he lasted that long they saw it happen having extended their lead and now sited themselves on another ridge for a checkup look colonel shreck look shreck bent to the scope and saw what payne had seen a mile and a half away dobbler had quit he lay in the high grass clearly begging for mercy memphis appeared to be the angry one they saw him try and pick dobbler up but dobbler simply collapsed dobbler would not rise and giving up had its dire implications who would come back for him shreck knew these two wouldnt in two hours theyd be under the gun of lon scott dobbler would perish in these mountains though he couldnt know this now hed wander winding down further each day maybe hed be lucky and run into a party of hunters but they were so deep in the fastness of the ouachitas now that prospect seemed unlikely if he stays hes dead said shreck and if he goes hes dead said payne bob appeared to have disengaged he stood away from them unmoving as memphis did all the screaming finally shreck could just barely make out through the scope that he was saying something then he turned and walked away shreck watched memphis bend quickly to dobbler the yellow letters of his fbi raid jacket flashing as he opened it to peel his own canteen from his belt and hand it to the man then he turned to run after bob shreck payne and the woman had achieved hard bargain valley from the southwest coming across a screen of trees and over a little creek they were more than an hour ahead of swagger and memphis though in the hours since dumping poor dr dobbler the two pursuers had closed the gap considerably it had not been an easy approach for no roads lead to the valley and it must be earned by several hours of desperately difficult hiking over rills and hills and gulches up stony mountainsides through dense trees and then a splurge of yellow openness a mile wide at its most open it is one of the largest flattest geological phenomena in all of arkansas a virtual tabletop in the middle of the mountains at one side is the ridge that could be said to overlook it although its not high and it doesnt afford much in the way of observation on the other side is just a forest which leads downhill eventually to a valley and then to another mountain not even the deer will roam on the flatness of hard bargain valley because they are creatures of the forest and feel vulnerable in the open so it is predominantly the kingdom of the crows who wheel overhead on the breeze like bad omens i want us to be on that side said shreck well have the meet in the dead center fifteen hundred yards from the nearest shootable elevation where is he asked payne snipers made payne a little nervous even snipers on his own side oh hes up there you can count on it shreck said tersely lons mood had darkened he sat alone in his spider hole fifteen hundred yards from the flat yellow center of hard bargain valley on its western rim he suddenly felt cursed it had begun as a lovely day but a few hours ago a huge red buck had pranced down the ridge in front of him he remembered the deer hunts of his boyhood before his father shot him it filled him with a kind of joy on impulse he brought the rifle to bear on the buck the animal was about paces out gigantic in the magnification of the unertl lon put his cross hairs on the creature and felt a thrill as he played with the notion of making the creatures beauty his own by extinguishing it forever the animal a bearded old geezer with two stubs where his antlers had been sheared off in some freak accident paused as the scope settled upon him it turned its magnificent head and fixed two bold calm eyes upon lon it appeared not to fear him at all worse it had no respect for him this enraged him in some strange way he felt his finger take three ounces of slack out of the sixounce trigger until the animal lived only on the stretch of the thinnest of hairs the buck stared at him insolently as if daring him to go ahead and shoot he knew this was impossible the animal could not have seen him but haughtily nevertheless the old creature cast its evil eye on him until he became aware of the pressure in his trigger finger and the beads of sweat in his hairline he slackened off the trigger the animal spluttered threw his beautiful redhazed old head in the sunlight then trotted away with an aristocratic saunter as if to snub him and make him feel unworthy yet he was strangely agitated be still he told himself its nothing but he could not get it out of his mind the hours had passed now moodily he scanned the far ridge of trees in search of human motion he had glanced at his watch for the thousandth time it was well past three and time for the action to begin ah there there he made them through the spotting scope as they came out of the trees and began their slow trek across the open space to the far side though at this range it was impossible to make out details or faces he could read them from their body types the tall one was shreck the stumpy one hunched and dangerous was the little soldier payne and third was the woman the tethered bait he watched them walk across the field and set up below him now their faces were distinct but they could not see him then suddenly commotion the two men both stood and looked and pointed yes there is was just as colonel shreck had promised though a bit late a yellow flare barely distinguishable in the bright sunlight floating down behind the ridge line he saw payne fire an answering flare letting the pursuers know their next move and upon what field the game would be played lon flexed his fingers and tried to will his body to alertness as he slid in behind the rifle once again he touched the radio receiver that would receive the bolt of sound that meant shreck was greenlighting the shot he touched as if to draw on their magic the h h magnums laid out before him tapering brass tubes close to four inches long glinting their heavy cratered noses stolid and somehow faintly greasy now it was merely a matter of waiting the buck was forgotten at last he thought only of the hellacious long shot he had to make that no man had a right to make that he knew he could make hed made them before all right payne said shreck as they languished on the far side of hard bargain valley this is the easy part get her ready yes sir said payne he turned to julie okay honey he said just this one last little thing she looked at him with drugdumb eyes there wasnt a flicker of will or resistance in their glassy depthlessness a stupid halfsmile played across her mouth payne shucked his pack and reached into it there he removed his cutdown remington semiautomatic shotgun it held six gauge shells in doubleought buckshot each of which contained nine caliber pellets it was possibly the most devastating closequarters weapon ever devised in less than two seconds it could blow out fiftyfour mankilling balls of lead with an effective range of fifteen yards he walked around behind the woman you just relax now he said this is nothing dont worry about it she looked as if shed never worried about anything in her life setting the shotgun down momentarily he plucked a roll of black electricians tape from his pocket with swift and sure motions he unstripped the end of the tape planted it squarely in the middle of her forehead and began to run loops of the tape around her skull drawing them tight she whimpered as the greasy stuff was yanked tight about her head cutting against her eyes so that the vision was destroyed between her lips so that her voice was stifled and across her nose so that the breathing was impaired and around her hair where its adhesive quickly matted to her skull but he said there there its nothing baby its nothing having constructed a snare of tape he then brought the little shotgun up and began to unspool yet more tape wrapping it crudely about the barrel and fore end of the piece entwining the womans head and the gun in the same sevenyardlong constriction until both were joined then he cut the tape he reached down with his left hand and engaged the pistol grip of the weapon inserting his finger in the trigger guard he felt the tension in the trigger colonel shreck shreck took the spool and continued the ritual of the binding until paynes hand was almost one with the shotguns pistol grip and trigger in a solid gummy nest of tape shreck bent and jacked the shotguns bolt and both men felt the shiver as the bolt slid back lofted a shell into the chamber then plunged forward to lock the shell in you know what to do yes sir said payne in case of trouble he was to blow the womans head off then swing the shortbarreled weapon and blow away whoever stood against them at the same time he was untouchable no bullet could penetrate his vest and a head shot would produce either by spasm or by the weight of his fall the blast that would destroy the woman nobody was going to play hero with payne boobytrapped to the woman like this it wasnt going well these arkansas types were closemouthed clannish and not terribly interested in helping still the reports that reached the headquarters of task force swagger now in the basement of the sheriffs office were persistent if vague two hunters off on a preseason scouting hike had watched through binoculars as a stocky man had laid and moored coils of rope to a ridge deep in the ouachitas they didnt move any closer because through the glass the guy had looked as tough as a commando and no they probably couldnt find the place again anyway maybe just some other hunter said hap laying in ropes to get up that ridge in the dark on the first day of the hunting season ummm was all that howdy duty would commit himself too then someone swore hed seen a lean blond man talking to sam vincent the lawyer who had sued the magazine on bobs behalf he was bobs oldest friend demidaddy and hunting buddy of years gone by the man could have been bob the nailer and the talk took place on a high road miles off a main highway that the observer a postman had just happened to breeze by but sam vincent was a wily tough old bird and he knew the law as well as any man alive now sir the old lizard had said to utey leaning forward and fixing him with what was known as the chaireye for sam as a state prosecutor in the fifties and sixties had sent thirteen men to the electric chair you know a damned sight better than i do that i caint be compelled to cooperate unless i want to and no subpoena and no threat of government harassments going to change that im too old to scare and too stubborn to budge if i seen bob lee swagger and aint told you ive committed a federal felony so essentially and here his shrewd old eyes knitted up youre asking me to testify agin myself against the constitution young feller and against arkansas state law code d see conyers v mercantile trust you got that howard got it indeed but assigned a tail on sam no such luck within the hour an injunction arrived from the third district court of arkansas the hon justice buford m roubelieux presiding requiring the government to show cause for assigning surveillance upon a distinguished eightyoneyearold citizen like sam vincent and issuing until such compliance could be met the next available court date was july a cease and desist order under penalty of law that had been the low point there hadnt been any high points until today just now when the phone rang hap answered it spoke for two minutes then said ill call you right back howard looked up two of the other men watched as hap shot over to howard they gathered round maybe this is nothing i dont know said hap but i just got a call from a guy in the national forest service says three hunters at three different times this morning saw military flares being shot into the air deep in the ouachitas somebody in trouble asked an agent more like a signal somebody else said but no fires started said hap the service ordered up a couple of flybys out of their spotter planes but there were no fires and the flares seem to be coming from different locations spread over about a twentymilesquare area howard concentrated on this who would use flares in daylight who would even see a flare in daylight unless they were looking for it it had to be a kind of signal did they get a location he asked well theyve had several but the forest service guy says his people plotted it out on a big map theyve got and the direction is largely trending north by northwest okay said howard toward what toward anything theres a big flat nearly inaccessible valley way up there they call hard bargain valley said hap its way the hell off the mainstream the forest service says hardly any hunters go up there because the deer much prefer the lower forest land its flat and barren and almost a mile across howard thought hard bargain valley okay he said lets saddle up full swat gear call the field i want the chopper to pick us up in ten minutes hap call the forest service back and tell them we need a guide to get us to hard bargain valley there said payne seeing them first the two figures had emerged from the trees across the wide valley shreck looked at them through his binoculars but they were too far off for details their faces were green like commandos he snorted he thinks hes going to a war he said to payne payne stood up and gingerly drew the woman up off her haunches now honey he said you walk real slow dont you trip or stumble or youll be history she moaned then made a noise through the tape shut up mrs fenn said shreck damn shes come out of it you should give her another injection i cant said payne not taped up like this look lady said shreck i want you to know this is the end youve only got another few minutes we make the swap and off you go with your boyfriend thats a security arrangement the gun isnt even loaded under the bonds of the tape her eyes tightened in terror he ignored her and signaled to payne to get her moving haltingly the three of them began to walk across the wide field it had turned into a lovely sunny fall day about fiftyfive crisp and clean around them like waves were the ragged ridges and crests of the ouachitas now brilliantly ablaze in color the snipers breath came in soft spurts he was trying to keep himself calm for what lay ahead it was time to shut down it was time to get into the zone he felt his body complying he had known it would he trusted it he watched his target exactly where it was supposed to be in the most obvious place it wasnt even an ant but a speck the dot over an i hed never hit at this range before but he wasnt scared this was a shot hed owed himself for a long time it was time to get it right his eyes were dilating his ears sealing off his breathing going softer he was sliding into tunnel vision where the concentration was so intense that all other cues in the world dropped away and respiration bled to a hum he pulled the rifle to him no time now to think of it he could not allow himself to be aware of the instrument because he had to be beyond the instrument his will was the instrument now he slid behind the scope finding the spotweld where cheek and gun joined while his fingers discovered their place by slow degree that was the secret to make everything the same simplify simplify to make of oneself nothingness to slide into the great numbness beyond want and hope to simply be he was beyond computation he knew the range he knew the angle he knew the wind he knew the bullets trajectory and velocity he knew its drop and how it would leak energy as it sped along he had accounted for all this and he now engaged his target through the bright circle of the scope even magnified the man was a small a very small object hardly recognizable as human just a squirming dot he watched the tremble in the reticle as he willed himself through minute subverbal corrections not thinking so much as feeling it was very very close now dont blow it he ordered himself not this time nick breathed out a little lon scott was just where bob had said he would be beneath the crest line where the osage had been crushed by an allterrain vehicle as it delivered him he was in a spider hole only his painted face and the rifle barrel visible at a hundred yards shreck put up his hands no guns he shouted no guns or the woman is dead you got that each of the two men raised his hands pirouetted slowly to show that he wore no visible weapons then let his hands stay high you got the cassette and annex b bob raised the knapsack he was carrying right here he yelled back okay you bring the stuff when i authenticate it well release the girl you see how weve got her you make a funny move you look funny you do anything stupid you get unlucky and trip anything anything my friends and shes fucked paynell do it you know he will only chance shes got is our rules youre calling the shots bob said now just take it easy with that damned shotgun payne slowly and warily the two men approached hands held high and stiff at last shreck faced bob the nailer big as life who stood but six feet away and he looked him in the eyes he looked as calm as a pond on a summer day hello colonel came a familiar voice shreck looked to the other man the young fbi agent only it wasnt the young fbi agent even though he wore a black fbi raid jacket and baseball cap and greenish paint on his face it was dr dobbler shreck looked back to bob realized in a flash the game had changed he pressed the button on a unit on his belt sending a shriek of radio noise that would signal scott to fire there came the sound from far away of a rifle shot the shrillness of the beep somewhat surprised lon and he saw the cross hairs dance a tiny jig and come off bob so soon he thought he exhaled half a lungful of air and gently as a lover squeezed the reticle back onto bob center chest and began to draw the slack from the trigger and nick fired and in the split second the rifle jumped and the scopepicture blurred he called it a hit he looked back quickly in recovery the bullet had struck lon scott in the head it was the brain shot blood seemed to have been flung everywhere by the impact lon sagged back and slid into his spider hole only the rifle was left to show nick in his own spider hole in the vastness of hard bargain valley threw the bolt and tried to bring bobs remington to bear on the party of five in the open a sudden wave of weakness thundered over him jesus he thought you just hit a thousandyard shot he started to tremble the woman screamed but payne pulled her down twisted her to brandish the shotgun and didnt panic bob said to the colonel my boy just tagged your boy youre all alone the colonel was calm maybe a halfsmile played across his mouth at some not so secret level he was a happy man it doesnt mean a thing swagger he said thinking quickly now let me tell you whats going to happen nothings changed only thing we want now is out were going on a nice slow walk out of here with the woman and with the cassette and the documents you follow shes wasted so dont you try a goddamn thing you put the gun down you got that ill kill this fucking woman said payne you know i will i got the gun taped to her head i swear ill blow her away now you back off bob dropped the knapsack only his hand wasnt empty it held a remington semiautomatic shotgun cut down to pistol grip and sawedoff barrel nicks second mandate was shreck he disengaged the rifle from lons spider hole and brought it to bear on the five figures five hundred yards to his left goddamn he could only see the tops of heads the action had come to play in one of the subtle folds in the earth that ran across the valley floor and his targets were beneath his line of vision which one was shreck he couldnt tell oh christ bob he thought he looked around desperately seeking a tree he could climb to get some elevation into the fold but there was nothing he put the rifle down drew his beretta feeling helpless rage put the gun down said payne ill blow her fuckin brains out he will you know said the colonel so here we are bob thought come a long way for this party lets see whos got the stones for close work bob leveled the short mean semiautomatic shotgun at payne payne could see the yawing bore peeping out from the forestock he isnt going to shoot said the colonel forcefully payne hes bluffing he doesnt have a shot im not going to shoot said bob heres the damn deal i put the gun down you cut the girl free everybody walks okay dobbler backed away nervously done said the colonel the smart move okay said bob im going to count to three then im putting the gun down nobody get excited here do it slow swagger said payne one said bob and then two and then he fired payne was astounded that it happened like this the crazy fucking fuck the moron he actually fired and in the explosion he fired too sending the woman to hell fuck them all fuck all who fucked with jack payne soldier and killer of men and he felt the gun buck and knew the womans head was gone except that it wasnt for she fell backwards somehow screaming in terror but intact and he fired again felt the impulse to squeeze run from his brain down through his arm to his finger felt it squeeze waited for the gun to go off only then did he realize he was squeezing a phantom finger on a phantom hand swagger had blown a charge of doubleought clean through his elbow from a range of two feet literally severing it the hand still grasped the shotgun bound in tape to her skull it simply was no longer attached to him in horror payne held his stump high and watched jets of bright blood pulse out into the clear fall air in that second the incredible agony of it hit him you fucker he screamed you fucker bob put the muzzle of the remington against paynes stout little chest and sent a deer slug through the kevlar vest that tunneled to his spine payne disappeared as he collapsed in the same attenuated microsecond shreck broke through the shards of disbelief that clotted his actions and yanked the marlin up to put a shot into bob but he was not quite fast enough bob pivoting through a short arc to his new target beat him by a clean tenthsecond and doubletapped a pair of deer slugs through shrecks vest so swiftly the blasts seemed like a single sound their roar hit the mountains and rolled back across the valley and still vibrated in the air as the colonels legs went and he toppled backwards shreck felt no pain he lay on his back in the yellow grass he thought of landing zones frontals good men dead in far places krations and c and that bitch duty whom hed never once betrayed always doing the hard thing bob stood over him shreck blinked and felt his fingers turn to feathers he had no legs he had no body he was very thirsty and confused then he realized it had finally happened i deal in lead friend bob said and fired another deer slug into him it blew out his heart in an instant bob ran to julie okay okay honey its all right he said to her taking her in his hands dont move dont jerk just be calm were almost home free dobbler dobbler goddammit come here he tried to get her to lie still terrified that a sudden motion might somehow trip the trigger she was blinded by the tape and making mewling noises but now he got his arms around her squeezing her tight just to hold her steady against his own strength now just relax baby girl please just relax he reached into his boot and drew out his razorsharp randall survivor looking at the knotted strands of black tape he was at first unsure where to cut afraid that if he cut too savagely the vibration on some unseen strand of the stuff might fire the gun very carefully he began to slice through the strands around her face until hed freed it and peeled the strands away one by one they broke but the gun did not budge okay okay were almost there nothings going to happen to you were almost home free gently he rotated her trembling head and inserted the blade in a knot of tape right under the muzzle and began to saw the edge devoured the tape one by one popping the individual links but the gun remained jammed against her and seemed a living thing a snake almost with its fangs sunk crazily into her skull he didnt want to touch it he could see that the safety was off and that the weight of paynes dead finger still lay across the trigger he sliced another strand of tape and the gun seemed to loosen and slide the breath came so hard to him he thought hed pass out and someone seemed to be pounding a kettledrum against his ears then another strand went and the gun dropped and bob had the thing free and clear he looked at it soaked in blood one of paynes tattoos remained visible airborne all the way it said you got that right son he thought and heaved the goddamn thing as far as he could it landed in the grass fifty feet away and did not go off oh jesus she was saying as he pulled the tape from her face youre okay youre okay youre fine we made it he hugged her held her very tight dobbler was crouching beside them he lifted one of her eyelids looked into her pupil read her pulse what did they give you he asked i dont know she said well youre stable bob give her your coat the danger is shock if we keep her warm there should be no problem she lay back clutching the coat its all over were home free i swear to you nobody can hurt you now or ever again he set her down on the grass where she settled in though she did not want to let go of his hand but he had some other business still he drew the doctor away from her until they confronted the bodies in the grass dobbler stopped and stared ggod said dobbler i cant believe we bob silenced him four feet apart payne and the colonel lay in the yellow grass the colonels eyes were open paynes were closed paynes grotesque stump still gushed a magenta delta into the yellow grass the vests however constricted the blood from the chest wounds in both men only the burned puckers where the slugs had blasted through signified the cause of their deaths look at them dobbler said half in shock i cant believe theyre men shoot em they die thats all said bob listen here we dont have much time ive thought this out carefully he reached into his shirt and pulled something out dobbler saw that it was a money belt theres seven thousand dollars in here its all i have left from my magazine money you take it i now just listen i want you out of here and gone before that damned boy shows up with his badge and remembers what he does for a living you see that white pine at the far end of the valley he pointed to the tree dobbler nodded at the tree youll find a creek bed you follow it about seven miles mostly downhill to a river you can follow the river either way it doesnt matter if you walk hard youll come out of the forest around three tomorrow on us route twoseventy flag down the greyhound that makes the four pm run to oklahoma city take the money disappear start a new life dobbler looked at him in shock but you need a witness you need someone to testify you dont you worry about me doc you did your part it doesnt matter what came before you go on that stand and youll be in a mess thatll destroy you forever i know ive been there take your freedom and go but but nothing said bob now get out of here before that damned kid shows up he pushed the doctor along and then watched as the man confused at first but then with more spirit in his step made a beeline for the white tree soon he had disappeared bob returned to julie she lay quietly in the grass breathing softly he knelt her hand came up and touched his he bent and kissed her on the lips were going to have plenty of time together he whispered i guarantee it now i have just one little thing to do he went to the knapsack still lying in the grass he opened it and removed the green plastic bag that held annex b and the cover letter he ripped it open took out the paper he couldnt wait for the sun he pulled out a zippo lighter that said usmc and beneath that semper fi a souvenir of the days when he smoked he ignited it held the bright small flame against the corner of one of the pages watched the flame begin to spread in seconds annex b was engulfed he held it until he could hold it no longer then tossed it it burned to ash stop it stop it it was nick yelling at him from two hundred yards away he began to race toward him what are you doing jesus christ but bob now grabbed the video cassette he placed it on the ground and drove his boot into it smashing the plastic he pulled the tape out into a loose jumble leaned over and lit it it went like a flash and was gone in seconds jesus fucking a what are you doing nick stood over him dark with anger thats evidence thats the goddamn evidence that can get you off the goddamn hook what the fuck are you doing you know what im doing bob said bob i now you shut up boy and you listen its over these boys are in the goddamn body bags now and what they did is going in there with them and thats where itll stay theres nothing left to tell elsewise now youll go to nick you saved my ass with that shot were even up now and you have to be your own man and make your own decisions youre free of me do you get it nick looked at him openmouthed then they heard the helicopter and turned to see a huey hurtling low over the far end of the valley oh christ thought nick its howdy duty time chapter thirtyseven it amazed nick that they worked so hard when he was so willing to tell the entire truth from the start he even waived his right to legal counsel without giving it a second thought hey i dont need it youll see i dont need it but they insisted on working hard it was the bureau way they had removed him to a safe house outside new orleans an estate out in lafayette parish not far from a swamp and there they set to their labors for close to a month their first goround was the friendly approach with his old buddy hap fencl and his expartner mickey sontag for a time it was like the good old days in the new orleans district office bull pen on loyola street the three of them just swapping yarns and laughing it up and having a great time but underneath there was serious business and nick let it all come out he told everything from his procurement of the bureau ramdyne file though he overplayed his pressure on sally to spare her what trouble he could to his abduction by jack payne and his henchmen his near fakesuicide in the swamp and the private war hed fought with bob lee swagger against the agents of ramdyne you ought to see this damned guy in a fight hap he heard himself saying in awe this is the best gunfighter this country ever produced he doesnt miss he doesnt panic he doesnt quit thinking and he never gives up hes fantastic he got to the embarrassing part too look i may as well be upfront with you guys i did represent myself as a federal officer when i was officially on suspension i did it over the phone at least two or three dozen times and in person at least three times so are you going to bust me hell i broke the new orleans thing for you gave you the biggest scoop youll ever have they laughed and wrote it all down asking gentle questions coming back the next day with other questions but they wouldnt tell him anything else either so wheres bob whats become of him nick i think they have him in a safe house too going through the same kind of debriefing truth is i dont really know would you mind if we got back to you nick no sure no problem this went on for two weeks then suddenly hap and mickey were gone instead along came two hardeyed guys from what nick assumed was the crack counterintelligence squad called cointelpro expert interrogators they were very very smart much smarter than hap and mickey and naturally distant not hostile so much as remote utterly professional they were like sharks they ate him alive and seemed to know the material as well as he did they pored through it and him for minor inconsistencies for small glitches as if they wanted the lint of the operation and not the truth but he cooperated again offering eagerness as his only defense holding nothing back telling everything everything now the bills he used to finance the operation it wasnt an operation we just made it up as we went along anyway hed evidently cached quite a bit of cash from that lawsuit plus some guns in the mountains and when he got back to them before we ran into him at the health complex he must have dug it up he always had cash he always paid cash you cant trace cash not old small bills he had plenty of old small bills cash isnt a crime at least it didnt used to be what have you got him on a few minor car theft charges for which theres really no proof and no prosecutor would bring to court the rest was selfdefense he never shot a man who wasnt trying to kill him or someone else he was green light all the way new orleans new orleans i told you it was a professional setup they used a different rifle to shoot a bullet that had been already fired out of his rifle they had a great shot lon scott in the steeple its possible you know its possible okay memphis this isnt the time to argue now could we go back to then finally there were the scientific gentlemen nick took three polygraph tests and volunteered to undergo both hypnosis and sodium pentothal treatment he was probed drugged pricked psyched drained and squeezed he got through it all with only moderate testiness old nick everybodys helper friend to all men duty hound stalwart and chum one day late in the process he was told he had a visitor blinking he went outside to the porch there to discover the nervous sally ellion awaiting him hi god sally hi how are you jesus youre looking great and sally was looking great hi nick how are you she still had that soft southern accent as if the mississippi itself poured through her words oh im okay you know im fine im sorry i havent called you theyve got me pretty busy and i dont think theyre going to spring me soon youre not in any trouble are you nah nah im fine i want to work with the guys and get this all straightened out itll be fine youll see im hoping that when this is over we can go out to dinner again that was great fun how are you she looked terrific to him im okay nick they came to me and wanted i know i know just tell them the truth you didnt do anything wrong remember you didnt know id been suspended when you gave me that file youre okay dont worry im not worried about myself nick im worried about you he said you might have broken some laws he was very upset about what might happen to you um howard yes mr utey yeah i smell him all over this thing dont worry howards an old pal hell look out for me whats going on in the outside world oh the television and papers have made a big thing about bob lee swagger i think the government wants to settle it quickly get it off the front page what have they done with bob hes in a holding facility in a prison yes hes got a lawyer but theres so much publicity that i think theyre going to do something soon this shook nick greatly he shouldnt be in a prison hes a hero he did great things for but he saw a hurt look on her face and realized hed begun to sound deranged well anyway sally i hope this hasnt been hard on you no it was a little scary at first all the questions but i think im out of it great ive tried to make them see its all my fault im to blame thats all im sure theyll understand im sure they will nick are you sure youre going to call me when all this is over id like to see you sure of course because if you dont im going to call you ill call you i swear you know old ab nick i want to hear more about the time when you ditched that quarterback tom terry ted she laughed god what a horrible guy i cant believe i was engaged to him the memory brought a smile to her face a little one then it was time for her to go they pretty much left nick alone for a week after sallys visit with only two incurious bodyguards who let him go for walks they let him watch tv and he caught up on the events of the last month and the controversy surrounding bob lee swagger amazed to see what a huge national story it had become with all the networks camped outside the louisiana state reformatory where bob was being kept in isolation with visits only from his lawyer a doughtylooking sly old boy operative word old named sam vincent meanwhile a grand jury investigated the matter and all the louisiana state prosecutors were lined up waiting their turn looks like a carnival nick said and nobody answered then finally inevitably howard arrived with a sharp young man along who had ambitious federal prosecutor written all over his feral little features and an older man twinkly with an almost academic air about him as he sucked on a pipe nick nick nick said howard expansive and embracing nick i want you to meet phil kelso who works on a lot of cases with us phils a damned fine prosecutor nick the best um said nick and this is hugh meachum of the state department nick hes here to advise us on national security implications of the situation the salvadorans are very interested in the way this turns out nick shot a quick look at hugh smelled gin felt his blood begin to roar in his head we hear youve been extremely cooperative said kelso thats wonderful thats a big plus on your behalf right now nick were in the zone of attitude attitude is everything nick we need great attitude from you well i always try and do my best said nick swallowing hard somehow not wanting to look at meachum thats nick said howard nick tries real hard nicks a worker a plugger a scrapper you could see it seven years ago in tulsa and you can see it now an extraordinary young man said the elderly gentleman now nick guess what day this is can you guess howard was effusive and charismatic today nick only saw him like this when he wanted something big no howard nick its the first day of the rest of your life nick its your lucky day you can walk out of here in an hour in ten minutes a free man nick no questions asked nick the only thing you have to do is your duty thats all but nick was hardly listening he could only think of meachum on the cover letter that sent annex b to the general and set the whole thing in motion he kept trying to keep his eyes off the old man but he could not control himself he saw some sort of benevolence on the pink face pleasurable anticipation that nick was turning into such a team player such a smashing young man nick you can have more than your life back howard was saying when nick tuned back in you can have it all you can have your career nick what do you want do you want cointelpro i dont mind telling you you impressed dave and tom they thought you were a plenty sharp operator and they are the best nick you know cointelpro is the elite squad you can have it or do you want a hostage rescue unit we could get you on hru in miami or dallas nick a hot city where youd see a lot of action those hru boys pick up the medals and they get on the fast track to washington nick nick we may be starting up a squad to extradite suspects from foreign countries now thatll be fast exciting work and some top people are coming aboard nick i think thats what id pick if i were you and had my whole career ahead of me but its up to you nick you can have anything no more dumpy little taco circuit cities for you nick no tulsas or buttes or boises you name it san francisco new york and organized crime philadelphia washington chicago chicagos a great town nick nick just watched howard okay he finally said whats the deal nick caught kelso firing a little whatthefuck glance at howard howard sailed on nick listen to me it can play one of two ways only one of two ways its to everybodys benefit yours mine most particularly the bureaus and the countrys if it plays a certain way okay sure said nick what way now kelso and howard exchanged glances they took a pause then both looked back to hugh who smiled his pale blue eyes aglitter finally kelso spoke nick its murder one on bob lee swagger were going for the chair are you all right bob asked her im fine you just answer their questions you just tell the truth thats all behind the glass wall of the visiting room he looked sallow and grim his voice was reedy through the distorting sound of the telephone she put her hand on the glass aware that before her thousands of women had put their hands on the glass and left a residue of wanting and sorrow as they peered at their men bob julie said thats just it they havent asked me any questions i was kidnapped i was drugged and held at gunpoint for close to a month i cant get them to care about it i even called the sheriff of ajo county and he said julie theres no proof we have to let the federal government decide what to do julie he gave you good advice we dont have a thing to worry about this is just some sort of preliminary investigation and they cant have me running around it doesnt matter this is the fbi theyre going to be fair bob i once sam gets it all explained to them ill be out of here in seconds all our troubles are over im hoping we can get back to arizona i liked the feeling of that desert arkansas is getting too crowded think id like to settle down out there in the southwest bob i but he winked at her still looking imposing in prison denims he was manacled to the chair honey he said we dont have a thing to worry about we can trust the us government nick swallowed he had a little difficulty understanding i i i dont nick for one reason and one reason only nick hes guilty said howard nick he took the shot that nailed archbishop jorge roberto lopez hes got to pay he no said nick listen i explained that howard didnt you read the interrogation reports it was ramdyne ramdyne set him up shreck payne dobbler lon scott they set him up lon scott fired the bullet it was a bullet that had already been through bobs gun so it was supposed to have bobs rifling on it he was shooting from the st louis cathedral he nick the cathedral is fourteen hundred yards away fourteen hundred fiftyone yards we measured said howard nobody can hit a target at fourteen hundred yards with a it wasnt a it was a grain sierra bullet that bob had already fired they loaded it into a holland and holland magnum case with a ton of powder saboted it in plastic or paper and blew it down a barrel that had been bored out to or so check check with the experts youll see its possible also i bet you could find that special barrel at lon scotts house did you think of that did you check that lon scott died in we have his death certificate that dead man on that mountain ridge was named james thomas albright born robert parrish albright no we traced it back the real robert parrish albright died in when he was a child that was nick said hugh meachum calmly its not unusual for a young man who is interested in heroes to bond to an older man particularly a man of bob swaggers courage and cunning but nick the bottom line is that bob lee swagger took that shot what happened later well maybe he was extraordinarily heroic in this war against ramdyne still it was a war among gangsters bob took the shot then leon timmons shot him he escaped thats all ramdyne no longer exists the agency wont comment on any relationships it may have had with it and youll never get them into a court of law because of national interest colonel raymond shreck was a difficult complex charismatic man like bob he was a great hero once like bob he was seduced by the power of the guns he loved he may have been involved in narcotics at the end of his life as his empire collapsed and he needed to raise money to sustain his lifestyle he had millions not that we can find said howard what we find is a disgraced war hero who had a great run with agency contracts in the seventies who had lost his way and was facing financial ruin thats all it was a narcotics war or something the official explanation will be that he died in a hunting accident on the first day of deer season it doesnt concern us what concerns us is the immediate bob lee swagger took that shot from four hundred yards at the president of the united states from the house on st ann street in the quarter outside louis armstrong park he missed and hit archbishop jorge roberto lopez a great man who only wanted justice for the atrocities in his native country and was mourned the world over its murder one for swagger its the chair thats all no said nick desperate in his urgency to explain the obvious to these idiots no you see nick the evidence is simply overwhelming his rifle identifiable fragments of his bullet his prints his empty shell he was there he had motive he had opportunity he had thats the frameup they framed him the cassette dobbler had a cassette of atrocities i had annex b i nick this dobblers disappeared weve had a nationwide alert out for him and we havent come up with anything he probably wandered off in the deep woods and died nick we cant even prove he was in the woods with you theres simply no proof only bizarre conspiracy theories no said nick listen just listen it was a frameup and bob burned the annex and the tape because he didnt want the press twisting them hes a goddamned hero he took out guys who killed kids in this countrys name and now hes hanging himself rather than nick lets get back to reality okay said the prosecutor kelso weve got a real deal for you its more than i would have offered but your boss here and mr meachum insisted now you listen to it its very generous very forgiving its a wonderful deal nick bob is gone bob will never see the outside world again he knows it and his lawyer knows it theres nothing you can do except save yourself counseled howard i cant earth to nick said kelso bob lee swagger is history hes finished only a moron couldnt get a conviction off this overwhelming body of evidence ive got a fortysixpage report from the fbi ballistics lab ive got his threatening letter to the president ive got the late leon timmonss sworn testimony that he shot bob lee swagger in the attic of a house on st anns street in new orleans after discovering him in the act of firing the shot and ive got you to testify that bob leapt out of that building overwhelmed you stole your gun and your car ive got him hes gone i nick damn it listen to me said howard it can go two ways one way you win one way you lose those are the only possibilities in either event bob is lost are you listening nick finally nodded number one you are called to the stand as a cooperating witness you are after all the hero of the hour you are after all the fbi agent who penetrated the bob lee swagger conspiracy and went underground with him i shut up and listen nick said howard who went underground with him on his trek through america under the deception that he had been killed which we established as a fiction after the shootout at the baptist church in blue eye you gained his confidence and you shared his danger as you made certain there was no larger conspiracy its one of the most brilliant undercover operations the bureau has ever brought off by the way nick its your triumph and its mine credit where credit is due the spoils go to the victor then when you were certain you called us in and we apprehended him as a consequence we closed down raymond shrecks narcotics smuggling ring and eliminated close to fifty latin gunmen veterans of the infamous panther battalion massacre it was quite an operation nick itll make stars out of all of us nick just looked at him the stars line and howards transparent greed hung in the air for just a second then the old man hugh meachum leaned forward excuse me howard i wonder if i might say one thing to nick of course hugh said howard now nick said hugh i know how complicated all this has been for you but im afraid theres yet another level of complexity that i have to put before you i know youll be able to handle it he smiled in a grandfatherly way that made nick almost want to punch his old teeth out nick i know you think youve seen annex b i know what youre thinking that im involved somehow perhaps you think im the architect of all this that i orchestrated this whole thing the destruction of cuembo the murder of the archbishop the frameup of bob nick its so dangerous where you are youre in the famous wildnerness of mirrors that is counterintelligence ive seen that document a cuban double agent tried to peddle it to the new york times a couple of months ago a translated version actually saw print in a syrian newspaper the japanese news agency torakata paid thirtyfive thousand dollars for a copy then never printed it nick its a plant cuban military intelligence very crafty very clever thats why its so dangerous when young men like you wander into these regions this poor lanzman who tried to reach you he may actually have believed it or he may simply have thought that youd believe it nick its mischief nick looked at him mister youre full of nick if it helps go ahead and hate me it doesnt matter if you hate me its allowed but nick let me tell you something that isnt allowed you actually have an opportunity to save lives thousands of lives to really make a difference in the world its not allowed to stay on the sidelines and watch it happen now you know that a salvadoran army unit called panther battalion was involved in a terrible atrocity on the sampul river several hundred innocent villagers many of them women and children were killed i shouldnt tell you this but it appears there was some american involvement in the episode yes your colonel shreck working for general de rujijo annex b had just enough truth in it to seem convincing but the american government had nothing to do with it and thats why this is a precious secret nick its precious because its dangerous if the usual enemies the press certain members of congress others on the mischievous left sympathizers fellow travelers the like nick if they should get ahold of that information and publicize it they could sabotage for another five years any chances at peace in that country nick think of the children wholl die if that happens nick we have a peace now we cant risk it nick swallowed hating the confusion in his head now the second possibility is distinctly less pleasant than the first said howard you are subpoenaed as a hostile witness a disgraced federal officer now on suspension awaiting termination you are asked very strict limited questions about your participation in the events of march in new orleans where you were what you saw how you messed up then you are dismissed if bobs lawyer tries to crossexamine you well object to every single thing that doesnt refer to march first and well be sustained the minute after you are done testifying you are indicted on three counts of impersonating a federal officer mr kelso himself will prosecute and we will bring witnesses who will absolutely nail you nick youll do at least seven years hard time and you wont have done bob a damned bit of good you will have just thrown your life away for nothing howard sat back nick then said is that all no of course its not all said kelso the same day you are indicted for impersonating a federal officer sally ellion is indicted for espionage delivering classified government files to a private citizen howard goddammit shut up nick said howard nick said kelso ill prosecute that one too it happens to be a much more serious charge than the charge against you youll be out in seven years five with good behavior she wont be out for twenty nick looked at the three men howard she didnt do anything she didnt do anything you cant do this youre the one thats doing this nick just like you put myra in a wheelchair for the rest of her life and doomed her now youre going to doom sally is that what you want nick i had a long talk with her when she confessed everything we have it on tape before witnesses on top of that the silly girl thinks shes in love with you youre going to pay her for her innocence by sending her up nick youve got to make a decision youve got to do whats best for you for sally and for the bureau and for your country said hugh meachum and for you isnt that right howard and you hugh nick youd better nick sat back no longer listening he wished he could shut them up wished he knew what to do you have to be your own man make your own decisions bob said he seemed to be having a little trouble breathing nothing was in focus nick said meachum we have to have a commitment from you save yourself nick thought he decided to sell bob out he couldnt help him bob was gone it was a pity but thats the way it goes hardball world no prisoners thats life think of the bureau nick said howard think of saving the bureau save yourself nick thought but when he opened his mouth what came out was howard you dont give a shit about the bureau youre not the bureau youre just one scuzzy little asskisser trying to make it to the top and youll fuck anybody who gets in your way the way you fucked me in tulsa seven years ago i didnt put myra in that chair you did because you were so fucking scared you wouldnt shut up on the radio and i didnt have the guts to stop you he took a deep breath and i see the last thing too howard you just bet i do youre on lancer committee right yeah its exactly the kind of swank connection a political suckup like you would go for and for years now youve been slipstreaming for the agencys use of ramdyne and thats how you meet a piece of smoothtalking scum like old hugh over here who authorized his pal ray shreck to wipe out a village and then to hit the one man in the world with the guts to stand up to it and then framed a great american hero because it was convenient it tied up a lot of loose ends and protected his own precious ass and if that ever gets out you and everybody on the lancer committee youre all finished nick stared at them he didnt feel particularly serene but he knew what he was going to do now he took a deep breath smiled and then spoke his answer well this is where it ends this is where youre stopped but let me tell you something boys youre going up against the best and manys the time slick operators have thought they had bob lee swagger nailed and just as they moved in for the kill he blew em away hes going to do that to you too and im going to watch it happen and then sally and i are going to walk out of there howard heres the bad news buddy youre history youre the fucking past its payback time you answer for myra and you answer for sally and you answer for lancer and you answer for the sampul river and whatever the hell else youve done im going to watch it happen now get the fuck out of here after they left he noticed that he couldnt stop shaking two federal marshals delivered nicks subpoena that afternoon requiring him to appear at the new orleans district federal courthouse two days hence for the preliminary hearing for case number the government v bob lee swagger a sternly worded note appended to the sheet warned him that he was subject to arrest if he failed to appear half an hour later he got a call from the us attorneys office informing him that he wasnt to leave the city as he was about to be indicted on three charges of impersonating a federal officer and that hed better get himself legal representation and before the day was out to bring off the hat trick he received official notification that for failing to show up at the suspension hearing on august he was formally terminated from service in the federal bureau of investigation and was under legal obligation to therefore return any and all bureau property before next friday or face indictment on charges of grand theft of government property for some reason that was the one that hurt most there was no return howard was cutting off all the exits preventing all possibilities howard was tightening the screws nick returned to his little house in metairie mowed the lawn which needed it badly paid what bills he could afford contemplated his desperate financial straits he hadnt drawn salary for close to three months and contemplated his woe there were moments at his lowest point when he felt like calling howard it would be so easy and it was so tempting uh howard look i think i sort of blew it a few days ago do you think but then he thought of howard triumphant howard bleating howard beaming howards biggest moment no he couldnt do it he simply couldnt make himself do it he knew he had to do one thing however he had to call sally hello hi its me nick she was crying oh nick theyre telling me theyre going to charge me with espionage oh god nick what should i do i didnt do anything how can they honey listen to me theyre bluffing theyre trying to bump me into doing something thatll make them look good howards probably under a lot of pressure to deliver on this thing and to protect his ass so hes playing it hardball but dont worry i swear to you you dont have to worry trust me they havent got a thing even as he said it he cursed himself for not having the guts to tell her the truth that they had everything and they were going to sweep bob and himself and her and anybody whod ever done anything for bob lee swagger away what should i do she asked nothing for now lets see what happens at that preliminary hearing tomorrow its the deal where the defense can require that the government establish that it does have a reasonable case so that a trial date can be set once thats out of the way well see where we stand nick honey i know its hard but it just goes on a little longer do you want to come to court tomorrow id be happy to take you its not much of a date but yes yes id like that very much that night was nicks worst worst ever worst since the night after myra died he couldnt get to sleep until nearly three and kept thinking of poor sally in some federal shithole for the next twenty years of poor bob being strapped into a chair and blitzed away of goddamned howard and his pet prosecutor kelso and that hoary old fraud meachum riding the publicity of their triumph on to better and better things senator howard d utey the man who nailed bob the nailer it put nick into dark rage and when he finally got to sleep his memories were haunted by howards laughing little face his smug confidence god howard youve dogged me ever since tulsa why didnt you shut up on that goddamned radio why didnt i hit that shot poor myra poor sally poor women who made the mistake of falling for nick memphis the alarm went off at seven nick limped grimly into the bathroom and faced his own grave self a sallow scrawny melancholiac his crew cut had grown out and the pouchiness of his face had vanished he was thin as death and maybe just as hard he showered dressed slowly putting on a suit for the first time in months had a cup of coffee and then went to pick up sally he had in his pocket and in his checking account and over in bills today he would be indicted on three counts of a federal felony again the impulse flew at him to call howard it probably wasnt too late he tried to imagine life after selling out how nice it would be but then he remembered the time tommy montoya was forcing the gun barrel of his colt agent toward his head and he was a second from his own death when bobs shot had come from nowhere and saved him howard never saved shit howard only took hugh meachum only took okay bob the nailer thought nick in for a penny in for a pound going to heaven going to hell im along for the ride my friend heres hoping youve got it today chapter thirtyeight all rise all rise the fifth united states circuit court is now in session the honorable roland o hughes presiding nick and sally stood up with two hundred others including dozens of reporters about half the new orleans fbi office and howard and his prosecuting angel kelso at the prosecution table which happened by absurd coincidence to be near nick and sallys seats in the front row of the courtroom hugh meachum sat behind the prosecutors table in a threepiece gray herringbone suit he had a little red bow tie on and nick decided he looked three hundred years old sam vincent also stood he was a slouchy grandpop with a face like a bowl of walnut shells and not much hair on his head he wore a string tie and a pair of bottlebottom glasses his fingers were long and gnarly and dirty from the pipe he was continually stuffing when he wasnt in court and the thick lenses inflated his pale blue eyes when they fixed on you so they were as large as sharks eyes he was nearly eighty and had won the silver star in the battle of the bulge in world war ii you may be seated said judge hughes a stern black man in his fifties now ladies and gentlemen first i want to warn you that although todays case has national implications it is first and foremost a case of law and it will be treated as such i warn spectators particularly those of you with the press to conduct yourself with the proper decorum or i will clear this courtroom in one minutes time is that understood his booming voice was met with silence now today we are having at the defenses request a preliminary hearing in the matter of the government v bob lee swagger in which mr swagger is accused of murdering a salvadoran citizen the archbishop jorge roberto lopez on federal property namely the presidential podium erected in louis armstrong park march first of this year for you spectators let me explain this isnt a formal trial its a hearing to make certain the government has in my judgment enough evidence to warrant the formal trial so theres no jury the two attorneys will be arguing for my benefit furthermore the defense is not entitled to bring evidence but only to attack the evidence the government presents now gentlemen i want these arguments to be swift and clean i dont want procedural detail cluttering up the proceedings you may save the logrolling for the trial assuming there is to be a trial and before you object mr vincent please note i only said if there is to be a trial im not prejudiced now you may bring in the accused bailiff and so bob was led into the courtroom in a bright blue prison jumpsuit with his hands manacled before him and secured by a chain around his waist that was connected in turn to leg irons he shuffled in hair clipped short and face raw and white he was calm however as calm as the last moment nick had seen him sitting next to julie on the floor of hard bargain valley his face sealed off behind the war paint as howards swat team surrounded him god he looked so so fallen your honor it was sam vincent is it strictly necessary to humiliate my client who has yet to be convicted of a single crime and who was a decorated marine hero of this country by festooning him in chains like a common thief your honor answered kelso just as fast mr swagger has a known propensity for both extreme violence and escape these precautions are merely prudent ah said the judge mr swagger are you duly uncomfortable or humiliated sir it doesnt matter to me said bob all right well undo the manacles but the leg irons stay is that an adequate compromise gentlemen yes sir it is your honor bailiff would you make the adjustments now mr kelso your opening statement please ah thank you your honor manfully kelso strode to the center of the courtroom your honor the government will demonstrate very simply that adequate proof exists to conclude that at approximately twelvenineteen pm on march first of this year bob lee swagger did in fact fire a shot from an attic at fourfifteen st ann street in the french quarter of this city that though aimed at the president of the united states did strike and kill archbishop jorge roberto lopez of salvador el salvador mr swagger had the classic threepart modus operandi to accomplish such an act that is motive opportunity and means as we shall demonstrate and that your honor should be that all right mr kelso thank you mr vincent nicks heart sank a little when the old man stood on rocky legs and essayed a little sally past the defense table where he sat alone with bob it was a contrast to the team of bodies that surrounded kelso and howard at the prosecution table well sir he said looking fully his eighty years his rheumy blue eyes staring at nothing in particular his suit a collection of bags that hadnt seen a dry cleaner but had seen more than a few pipe cleanings his clunky black shoes unshined i spose you could say well show the other side and that this decorated war hero could not objection your honor mr swaggers war record isnt in question here and is irrelevant to the proceedings hes got a point mr vincent well hell sir if they say hes a shooter then damned if they oughtnt to point out it was the us marines that taught him to shoot and who gave the boy a chestful of medals for it there was an eruption of laughter at old sams zinger well stated mr vincent but since theres no jury here today and since i am in fact well acquainted with your clients military record perhaps we could forgo in the interests of moving into the meat of the matter any further references to mr swaggers wartime heroism and perhaps that would encourage the prosecution to forgo any timeconsuming pattern of objections well i reckon thats a tolerable deal said vincent excellent mr kelso its time for you to open your case thank you your honor kelso began by introducing into evidence a letter dated december addressed to the president of the united states in which bob lee swagger argued in a strident faintly irrational tone that he deserved the congressional medal of honor for his exploits in vietnam the letter was projected on a portable screen that kelsos minions quickly assembled your honor this document was what initially put bob lee swagger on the secret service list of potentially threatening suspects and earned him an investigation albeit a tragically inefficient one by the fbi nick winced object he protested silently make the point that bob was on the clist felt to be the least dangerous and that even the secret service guys had said he could be skipped but sam vincent and his client sat mute at their table your honor i have here the depositions of four handwriting experts in the federal bureau of investigation the new orleans police department the new york city police department and one widely respected consultant stating that theyve identified well it varies your honor but between fifteen and thirtyone similarities in handwriting between this document and authenticated samples of bob lee swaggers penmanship mr vincent at last vincent spoke your honor i know i cant enter evidence but if i could id enter three depositions from handwriting experts in los angeles london england and chicago illinois stating that the document is a forg objection objection surely your honor can see that the defense is trying to enter evidence which is objection sustained mr vincent you do know the rules sir i do and i apologize but the truth is in handwriting analysis theres just no way to know positively you can have more experts than a mama possum has teats laughter from the spectators in the darkness and you wont get any two of em to agree and let me point out one last thing mr swagger unfortunately didnt have the benefits of a fancy education like some among us hes a product of public schools in rural arkansas in the s with no college experience thus his handwriting as you all can see remained somewhat in the primitive stage it looks to sophisticated people as if it were written by a child now the one thing most handwriting experts agree on is that such a script its called oh i think infantile cursive he said this as if he were just making it up is indeed the easiest for any kind of accomplished forger to imitate all right mr vincent said the judge ill allow that and keep it in mind but please remember you are only permitted to attack the governments evidence not introduce your own yes sir how can they win if they cant introduce evidence sally whispered into his ear hes got to show that their evidence doesnt add up to what they say it does nick said meanwhile kelso struck back quickly your honor im not here to indulge in comedy or groundless conspiracy speculation even when they amount to the same thing im here to argue a point of law and although this isnt the forum where absolute truth is to be decided i think your honor will concede that ive made exactly what the law demands of me at this point in the proceedings that is ive established a reasonable argument for motive it was enough for the secret service and the fbi to begin to monitor mr swagger and it should be enough for the court young man its not necessary for you to tell me my job said judge hughes but lets just say your observation isnt without merit even if it was delivered to this court in a fashion dangerously close to contempt i apologize your honor then you may proceed with the second part of your argument as your honor pleases said kelso he retreated briefly to his table were not doing too well are we whispered sally no im afraid were not i thought this old man would have something more than tit for tat stuff nick im scared just hang on my part is coming up next and but kelso had returned to the center of the floor your honor he said id like to enter into evidence the sworn statement of a new orleans police detective named leon timmons detective timmons is not here because tragically he was slain in the line of duty last april but it was detective timmons who heroically interceded as bob lee swagger was your honor i object said the old man stirring himself to biblical wrath this here evidence is hearsay beyond the reach of crossexamination moreover this heroic detective has been named in several internal affairs reports of the new orleans police department of having suspected ties with organized crime in the greater your honor leon timmons won three commendations for valor under fire in his eighteen years with and he drove one of them damned german convertible sports cars that cost more than sixty thousand dollars on a salary of twentytwo thousand five hundred per year your honor all right all right gentlemen quit your squabbling judge hughes said with a groan he paused mr kelso dont you have a live witness shit said nick to sally yes sir then lets end this here you put your sworn testimony into evidence and ill read it at my leisure and if the issue is still in doubt rule then on its admissibility thats fine your honor i feel my next witness will clear up any doubts anybody will have about the viability of the governments case suddenly a bailiff was standing next to nick mr memphis from mr utey it was a note nick unfolded it it said last chance as you can see bob is lost you can still turn this to your benefit and the bureaus advantage dont throw your life and that poor girls away for nothing that can be helped anyway what is it nick sally whispered so here it was the whole thing come to this his life could be so fine bob was gone anyhow that was clear old sam vincent was a crackerbarrel windbag the evidence was overwhelming ramdyne had won he looked behind the prosecution table and saw hugh meachum sitting there his face serene his blue eyes opaque the prosecution calls mr nicholas memphis nick leaned to sally its a note from a ghost he said crumpling it and walked to the witnesss box without looking at howard nick took the oath without a lot of emotional investment and tried to find a comfortable position in the hardwood chair he could see bob ramrod stiff all marine staring not at him but into space and sitting beside him his slouch carrying with it a suggestion of collapsed feed bags heaped in the barn corner old sam vincent his jowls slightly rising and falling as he breathed heavily his eyes enormous behind the thick glasses your current employment mr memphis asked kelso im currently unemployed as of yesterday and until yesterday nick summed himself up quickly twelve years federal bureau of investigation special agent and can you tell us your duties on the date of march first of last year i was part of a multidepartmental task force assigned to a presidential security detail i was mr memphis please just answer the question i ask without elaboration youve done this before no yes good but mr memphis what did these responsibilities entail i was parked in a car on st ann street about five blocks from the speech site louis armstrong park on north rampart i see what was your job uh well it was a secret service operation basically we were just on the farthest perimeter of the security envelope pretty much as lookouts thats all i see now please tell me what ensured at exactly twelvenineteen pm that day you are in your car and well its a lot more complicated than that see theres context its very important what came before what came after what i learned what was involved and just to isolate mr memphis you were asked a direct question you answer with an essay on an irrelevant topic what ensued at exactly twelvenineteen pm that nick felt it all draining away hed rehearsed a dozen times reducing the story into the smallest understandable parts your honor i have to explain because your honor i should explain the witness is here as a hostile hes under subpoena and may soon be indicted under federal statutes for impersonating a federal officer i just need mr memphis youve testified before said the judge you know the rules if you have a statement to make ill allow you to file it in writing at the end of the proceedings sir i just feel your honor hes got to answer the question im hurting him nick suddenly realized im coming across like a crazy man and in doing that i absolutely hurt the man i meant to help kelso knew it kelso counted on it howard had prepped kelso well on the weaknesses of nicholas memphis formerly of the federal bureau of investigation mr memphis ill have to hold you in contempt if you dont answer i dont think you want three months in jail added to your current legal difficulties i just want justice your honor i mr memphis i have to warn you once more answer the question or ill find you in contempt yes sir but if you would just let me put it in con nick it was bob nick just tell the truth dont you worry about a thing his deep voice resonated in the courtroom like a mourning cry it was followed by stillness mr swagger if you make an interjection again ill find you in contempt and ill have you restrained and gagged said the judge nick saw how brilliantly the prosecutor had choreographed it put nick in distress gull bob into breaking his stoicism we both look like fools locked in complicity terrified of the truth howard was watching intently shaking his head as if to claim at this point the victory was too easy to take all right nick finally said hed tried hed lost theyd come so far it was over bob the nailer was nailed it was over quickly i heard a shot i got out of the car he told it simply in the end identifying bob as the bleeding man whod jumped from the window hit the roof and staggered down the stairs thank you mr memphis said kelso im finished your honor mr vincent do you have any questions at last nick knew his time had at last come now he could get it out now he could vincent said no further questions your honor you may step down mr memphis nick looked at the old man in utter disbelief he felt like throwing up that was it it was over it was oh one thing mr memphis the old man seemed to be awakening from a dream uh you say detective timmons was already inside the house out of which mr swagger fled bleeding yes sir hmmm did you see him enter as i recall theres only one entry to that courtyard no sir and i was on station at hours damn isnt that strange yet in his log he says he saw something suspicious at fourfifteen st ann street up near the roofline and entered the courtyard and your honor i object said the quick kelso detective timmons isnt on trial here and counsel himself objected when i tried to introduce the detectives account your honor im just an old country boy but im wondering how this heroic detective turned himself invisible that day thats a hell of a trick your honor kelso pushed ahead let me further point out that mr memphis has been dismissed from his job in the bureau out of gross negligence and dereliction of duty his screwups on this case are notorious throughout the law enforcement community to offer him as any kind of paragon of professionalism as the defense is clearly trying is ludicrous beyond words great now ritual humiliation in public added to everything else he does have a point mr vincent but ive marked your observation down for further study all right mr kelso proceed nick lumbered back to his seat feeling the weight of ages on his suddenly frail shoulders another nail in the coffin he fought his way back to the seat next to sally and she leaned over and put a hand on his you tried she said catastrophe was all he could think to say he looked up to see the judge announce an hour recess for lunch lets get out of here he said on the way out two or three news types hounded him but he just bulled on by more of them were clustered around the star of the hour the charismatic young prosecutor who gobbled up soundbitesized nuggets for the six pm news sam vincent was nowhere to be found sally he said after they had sat in glum silence for a few minutes at a diner a few blocks away the food claiming his last eleven dollars i think we have to talk all right i dont think were going to win in fact i know were not going to win maybe bob specializes in getting out of tight spots but this timewell the point is its not going to happen today the noose is too tight its over nick i and when he goes i go and when i go youll go but it doesnt have to happen like that i want you to call kelso and volunteer to testify against me tell him i duped you i seduced you i used you i wont deny it its me they really want if you give them me on an espionage charge something heavier than this stupid impersonating a federal officer thing theyll go for it in an instant its the smart move okay the smart move she said howard only wants me destroyed because i wouldnt give him his phony undercover thing and theres this mysterious old goat named hugh meachum that i think works for the cia or did or something like that hes here to make sure it all stays contained thats the point of the drill i know they wont nick let me tell you something bob lee swagger may specialize in getting out of tight places but you specialize in loyalty you gave everything to the bureau and everything to myra all those years ive watched you ive been watching you for years and how much you gave and how i was never a honey to you you were the only one who ever treated me like a human being and you never came on to me and believe me a b nick you wouldnt believe some of the champions of the family value system that came on to me and thats because at some point you are fundamentally the most decent man who ever lived and now youve given your loyalty to bob lee swagger well nick ive loved you for half a decade and if all i get for it is today and tomorrow until were both indicted and held without bond then thats enough for me ill give you the loyalty youve been giving everybody else all those years its time for somebody to give you some loyalty sally i and ill bet you that old country boy bob lee swagger has some sly left up his sleeve ill tell you this nick im from the south and ive known men like that my whole life theyre not much damn good at anything except dying in wars and shooting helpless animals lord knows why and outsmarting the law theyre sly thats their talent and i never met anybody who could outsly a sly old country boy and from what ive heard of bob lee swagger hes the slyest of them all theres just no way a carpetbagging yankee like howdy duty or an old ghost like hugh meachum could bring it off nick youve just got to believe in bob lee do you hear me he touched her arm he wanted to kiss her all that radiance in those bright eyes dammit she believed where he himself had lost all belief come on son she said time to git back to the show got me a feeling theres fireworks to come the young mans name was walter jacobs he was extremely cleancut balding mild of face and demeanor his eyes narrowly intelligent and beaming with goodwill behind his wire frames his suit blue and crisp his shirt white and crisp his tie black and crisp and he was death he was the one whod do it finally push it that last little bit your employment mr jacobs im a senior firearms technician in the fbi forensic ballistics laboratory in washington dc and so to means at last kelso grunting to make it appear heavier and more lethal for the judge bent to lift the means and this is it yes sir said jacobs your honor id like to enter this rifle as state exhibit four please so mark it and this it was a tiny twisted piece of lead and copper the base of a hollowtip bullet yes exhibit number five mr kelso and this the final link as state exhibit six he held up a thin brass tube inches long narrower at one end rimmed at the other it was an empty cartridge case so marked said the judge would you identify this exhibit please mr jacobs yes sir its a customized remington model v bolt action centerfire rifle in caliber with a leupold ultra scope it was recovered in the attic of fourfifteen st ann street in this city on the date march first all right can you tell us of the rifles background quickly jacobs sketched the rifles course from the remington custom shop in ilion new york to its specialorder purchase through the naval px system by the commanding officer of the marine corps marksmanship unit at camp lejeune in where the paperwork said it was presented to gunnery sergeant bob lee swagger that unit on the occasion of his disability retirement from the service i see can you characterize the nature of the weapon yes sir someone has gone to a great deal of trouble and evinced a great deal of guncraft in making that rifle superbly accurate the original custom rifle was very accurate what wed call a minuteofangle rifle but he has done things to refine it even more for example the original remington barrel has been replaced by a custommade hart stainless steel barrel with buttoncut rifling that work incidentally was performed by hart rifle barrels of lafayette new york according to company records for bob lee swagger of blue eye arkansas in june of the new fiberglass stock was manufactured by mcmillan and company of phoenix arizona a stock of that model was sent to bob lee swagger of blue eye arkansas the firing pin has been replaced by a much lighter one of titanium from brownells of montezuma iowa to improve lock time thirtyfive percent that is increase the speed between the trigger pull and the actual firing the rifle has been bedded in devcon aluminum and its screws have been pillar bedded meaning that theyve been driven through a pillar of aluminum inserted in the stock all of this of course makes the rifle more stable and therefore more accurate thank you and now the last two items kelso held up the lead and copper scrap thats what remains of a grain boattail hollowpoint sierra matchking bullet said jacobs it was recovered from the podium of the louis armstrong park here in new orleans clotted with brain tissue and skull fragments is there enough left to make a ballistic identification no sir we were unable to get a rifling signature from the bullet since it was so mutilated i see so what did you do sir we carefully sluiced the barrel of the rifle and took very careful samplings of copper and lead residue that remained in its rifling channels we took copper and lead samplings from the bullet then we made neutron activation analysis examinations of each metallic sample what did you learn that the bullet and the residue were atomically identical sir proving proving that either that bullet or one exactly like it was the last bullet fired down that barrel there were no other identifiable lead or copper tracings are these bullets common theyre manufactured in small lots by sierra bullets of sedalia missouri primarily for thousandyard shooting the yearly production is less than five thousand its not a common hunting round we found several boxes including one recently opened in the suspects shop in blue eye arkansas i see and finally the case would you characterize it please yes sir well sir the case indicates a handload assembled with some care and skill both the outside and the inside of the neck had been turned to guarantee smooth bullet release and concentricity the primer a federal bench rest primer had been seated precisely in the center of the primer pocket the flash hole had been deburred for consistent ignition and the primer pocket cleaned and reamed for perfect depth and squareness could you mate it to the rifle yes sir there are six tests and measurements that one can make to ascertain whether or not a shell was fired in the chamber of a rifle and ejected from it these include neck diameter visàvis chamber diameter thickness chamber imperfection pattern rim indentationsand on and on it passed all six so it was fired in and ejected from that rifle it would be mathematically impossible for it not to be thank you mr jacobs what kind of case was it sir it was a federal nickel match case federal doesnt make them anymore but we found several boxes of them in bob lee swaggers shop and we found federal large bench rest rifle primers we identified the powder residue in the case as imr we found an eightpound keg of imr in mr swaggers shop half gone thank you mr jacobs he turned your honor i think you can see the chain we have motive resentment of the president as evinced in the letter we have opportunity as agent memphiss testimony placed swagger in the snipers nest at the time of the shooting and we have means his rifle custom built painfully assembled over the years into the most efficient killing machine ever made we have the bullet from the rifle we have the shell ejected from the rifle and a good man is dead and there sits his killer were screwed said nick to sally the prosecution rests said kelso mr vincent your honor i have no oh just out of curiosity mr jacobs how does the rifle shoot i beg your pardon how does she shoot if youre examining a rifle to see if it killed a man dont you have to have some idea how it shoots i can assure you sir it has all the hallmarks of a rifle customized for maximum accuracy yes but how does it shoot jacobs was suddenly a bit uncomfortable your honor said kelso i object this has no bearing on mr kelso you introduced the rifle to evidence not mr vincent objection overruled answer the question please mr jacobs well sir said jacobs i assume it shoots very well whoa son said sam vincent you assume now does that mean you havent fired the rifle yes sir there was no cause to given the fact that the recovered bullet was too badly damaged to read the rifling signature so you cant say how accurate this rifle is not ever having fired it you cant testify that this rifle is capable of the kind of accuracy you say it is nick held his breath wondering if the old goat had come up with just the faintest opening whats going on whispered sally see nick explained because there was no ballistic signature on the murder bullet they couldnt shoot it because they didnt want to have to say in court they failed to get a match they just passed on the test altogether i dont know where this is leading jacobs held his ground sir ive examined thousands of rifles in my time and i examined that one minutely including taking it completely apart and examining it for function and reliability and i can say i can guarantee you that everything in that rifle is consistent with a weapon of extreme accuracy there was no point in shooting the rifle as we had no sample of its rifling to test or maybe you did test it and it didnt match said sam vincent kelso was on his feet screaming i object he yelled counsel is impugning the integrity of the fbis ballistic laboratories an institution with a worldwide reputation for integrity or maybe the fbi tampered with the rif sam started thatll be quite enough mr vincent said the judge objection sustained theres no evidence to suggest tampering sir said jacobs may i make a statement go ahead said the judge sir ive been testifying in cases for over ten years and nobody has ever suggested that our lab would tamper with evidence on my word of honor i guarantee that that rifle is exactly precisely the way we found it except for disassembly and the barrel swatching process ive already described it has not been altered in any way at all seems to me he has you mr vincent said judge hughes no further questions your honor said the old man and limped back to his chair your honor said kelso springing up as jacobs left the stand that finishes the states case i believe ive delivered on my promise your honor now the defense insisted on a preliminary to discredit my evidence and if youll allow me to point it out he hasnt scratched it he hasnt dented it your honor isnt it time to declare this farce over and set a trial date it was the contempt in his voice as much as the triumph that made nick hate him mr vincent your honor the old man had bestirred himself your honor i confess my best shot didnt pay off id hoped to prove that the fbis failure to testfire the rifle proved the case couldnt be made but i just couldnt budge that smart young feller over there he had a sad moment it was solemn in the courtroom sally nudged him what hes staring at you who your friend and so bob was and when their eyes met bobs face suddenly lit into a big grin then he winked whats going on sally asked i think bob the nailers about to blow some smart boys to hell and gone nick whispered his breath suddenly hard to find in his chest but said the old man the government has proven completely that this here rifle and he moved with surprising swiftness the palsy gone from his limbs his gut sucked in his glasses gone this death rifle shot and killed archbishop jorge roberto lopez on march first of this year thats their whole damn case and damned if it aint airtight a cat couldnt get out of that damned bag with a swift hand he picked up the rifle from the prosecutors table and flicked open the bolt yep he said booming bob took a bullet a cartridge just like this one and from his pocket he pulled out a gleaming brass cartridge just like this winchester ranger grain hollowpoint it suddenly occurred to the judge that the cartridge was live mr vincent that bullet is not to be inserted in but sam slapped the cartridge into the chamber and drove the bolt home the sudden overwhelming power of the loaded rifle that utterly transforming alchemy by which a mute piece of equipment after insertion of the little missile of brass and powder and lead becomes an almost living presence filled the courtroom kelso didnt even bother to object two bailiffs quietly put their hands on their revolvers mr vincent said the judge you now have a loaded weapon in your hand i formally order you to unload it quickly and no nonsense about it or sir i will find you in contempt and lock you up for the rest of your life bailiff if mr vincent doesnt comply your honor your honor said old sam i have no intention of firing this here murder gun that the fbi and the prosecution have proven bob lee swagger killed the archbishop robert lopez with no sir he held the rifle aloft its muzzle skyward no sir he said no sir i have no intention of firing it then he smiled on the other hand he said i didnt say nothing about pulling the trigger he pulled the trigger in years that followed nick would recollect that the loudest shot in the long and violent story of bob lee swagger was also the quietest but at the time he had no way of knowing that like everybody else in the room he watched the old mans finger constrict on the trigger and anticipating the hugeness of the explosion caused by the crazy old man in the constricted space he felt his face crack into a flinch click went the rifle no louder than a pencil dropping on the floor silence then chaos order order shouted the judge your honor shouted kelso i object i dont know what the point of inserting a dummy cartridge into and then he shut up himself and shot a look at howard your honor said sam it wasnt no dummy i could point out the dummies in here but this cartridge isnt one of them you could feed a thousand a million live cartridges through this rifle because it does everything the fbi says it does except one it dont shoot quickly he ejected the cartridge to the floor then pushed the boltretaining lever in front of the trigger and released the bolt he set the rifle down on the prosecution table and held the bolt up then he pressed the bolt against the tabletop to release the spring mechanism and in five expert seconds broke the bolt down to its components one of which he held aloft the firing pin your honor he said as the young man pointed out its a titanium firing pin for faster lock time what he didnt point out because he didnt notice was that it aint four point fivesixfive inches long as the remington specs call for no sir its four point foursixfive inches long aint no way its long enough to reach the primer now if you looked real careful youd see that a man who knew all about rifles took this little sucker and cut it in two with a file then he removed just one tenth of an inch of metal from the pin shaft then he welded it together again and youd have to measure it with a set of jap calipers to tell the difference but the one thing sure as death is that it aint long enough to reach the primer just by a hair but close dont count it dont shoot it dont go bang now why would he do that if bob lee swagger were a sly man you might say that at some time in his past when he was shooting for some people he noticed that somebody had removed one of the spent casings on his handloads and replaced it with another it bothered him a small thing ten cents worth of brass thats all but it bothered him and so later he took out the firing pin and he performed that surgery and then he put it back because he suspected something strange was going on in his life and maybe all these months hes known he had absolute physical proof that he could not have shot the archbishop and the fbi and the government didnt know diddly and maybe he used that time to find out who those men are and what dark deeds theyd done in the past your honor you may have noticed that on the first day of deer season last month in arkansas there was an astonishing number of accidents three men killed on one day amazing what with hunting accidents way down these days on account of blaze orange but you know your honor sometimes justice happens in strange ways that men and courts cant quite understand and so who fired the shot that killed archbishop jorge roberto lopez youll have to ask bob lee swagger maybe hell tell you he wont tell me but we do know this someone else fired that bullet from another rifle cause this one dont work thats what the irrefutable evidence says so your honor i ask you is there a case here or are we trying the wrong case the judge asked the two attorneys to stand he looked at them both squarely mr kelso he finally said what are you doing here you have a murder to solve and youre nowhere near solving it you havent even started bailiff please release mr swagger he is free to live his own life now im dismissing all charges and i think that should do it i think we can all go home now the reporters exploded out of the courtroom to file the days astonishing events in this ruckus almost unnoticed bob stood smiled easily shook sam vincents hand then came over to nick his bonds at last off you did good nick you can spot for me any day you did good yourself old man arent we a damn team though you sure you werent a marine no i wasnt well you take care now it was fun it was bob lee walked away and within seconds somehow was gone it was the snipers gift to disappear leaving no trace gone suddenly and totally nick turned to sally but instead found himself looking upon the ruined face of howard d utey howard you werent even close you didnt even muss his hair he just blew you away over howards shoulder he could see the old man meachum standing in the shadows watching nick almost called out to him but meachum stepped back and he too vanished then he turned to sally you want to get out of here boy do i where to oh i think we could figure something out chapter thirtynine the scandal was a flame it burned hot and bright and it devoured those who attempted to control it howard was unceremoniously retired by a humiliated federal bureau of investigation before the week was over as were the other three members of the lancer committee the us attorneys office reassigned young philip kelso to a far western state but he refused the assignment resigned and went into private practice the real shocker however was hugh meachum dead on the third day after the hearing by coronary aneurysm his heart simply exploded as if hit by a bullet when he heard nick thought he got them all every last one of them he was spending a long glorious week just being with sally in her apartment mostly but with a few other stops when at last a phone call tracked him down it was hap fencl quite a mess here bub yeah well said nick know where i might find a good slightly used special agent we got some snappy cases going down need a guy with experience wasnt i fired oh nick gee some guy may have had an idea like that but hes long gone and i dont think you could find anybody in the personnel office who knows where the paperwork went nick seriously this is where you belong you were right howard was a mistake they come along sometimes but they destroy themselves its a good outfit guys like you make it good oh hell come on nick nothing special just street work new orleans the same salary back pay some guys in washington want to talk to you about this ramdyne thing so you may as well get paid for it nick breathed heavily he just wanted to be an fbi agent that was all hed ever wanted okay he finally said see you tomorrow and nick marry that damned girl will you well dammit he said i did yesterday congrats see you partner so nick went back on duty and spent his honeymoon in washington two weeks of telling his ramdyne story over and over again as a crack team of hotshots tried to track down the elusive truth that unit is due to release its report it will happen any day now you may be sure of it it would have helped matters immensely of course if theyd ever found dr david dobbler but they never did he was either dead in the fastness of the ouachitas or perhaps living by his wits under a new name in some southern california resort town nick always favored the latter explanation of ramdyne no trace remained its staff dispersed its seedy headquarters languished and is now the location of a small software concern those who spoke to the fbi were lowerlevel people who knew nothing colonel raymond shrecks body went unclaimed it was buried in arlington national cemetery not far from john f kennedys because after all the colonel had won the silver star and the dsc in korea and another silver and three bronze stars in vietnam john d jack payne was buried in the united states army cemetery in baton rouge louisiana he too had been a hero and james thomas albright or lon scott his secrets lost forever went into a mausoleum outside danville where his remains joined those of his father and his mother which he had had disinterred and brought down from vermont he willed his collection of benchrest rifles and shooting memorabilia to the national rifle association and the tenth black king now resides in its national firearms museum in washington dc testament to a time when skill with a rifle was the most gentlemanly of all pursuits and men like art scott represented their country proudly with winchesters best in their hands the association had little use for the other effects including a curious collection of fired grain caliber bullets from some bizarre project or other in the early sixties found in his safe deposit box his corporate portfolio amounting to over seven million dollars went to the national association of quadriplegics bob lee swagger was another instant mia when all state charges were dropped as a consequence of the collapse of the federal case he vanished from public sight almost immediately with the woman julie fenn but he paid his debts in the currency of his choice an exbig game hunter in oklahoma was astounded to discover a package delivered to his doorstep opening it the old man cackled with glee it was a pre model in winchester no note accompanied the weapon only a tag this rifle once belonged to bob lee swagger it said it was signed bob lee swagger and one day a month after his return from washington nick answered a knock on the door to find a ups guy with a package about three feet long that weighed about seven pounds he signed for it took it into the basement and opened it it was the ruger mini nick said a note in careful almost childish handwriting am moving on thought you might want this as a souvenir of our days on the lam you sure you werent a marine no signature nick looked at the damn thing a small handy neat little rifle once owned and used by bob the nailer he shook his head honey what is it sally called down ah just a deal from a guy i used to know he said and went over and slid it behind the water heater where to this day it remains rusting they came over the last rise in the desert the town looked like a patchwork of bright and dark shapes flung across the living radiance it was hot and dry and above the sun blazed down without mercy its not much she said no mountains no trees just scrub pine and little sticky things that will kill you and hot its so hot out here most of the time that people live on iced tea and airconditioning it looks like rough land not too many people around though is that right hardly any she said and lots of room to move and nobody to pay you mind only me she said sounds pretty good he said now lets stop somewhere and get us a dog that would be fine she said we can raise him with this damned baby i seem to be carrying about the author stephen hunter is the author of thirteen novels
