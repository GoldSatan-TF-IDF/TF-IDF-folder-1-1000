michael palmer flashback if i fulfill this oath and do not violate it may it be granted to me to enjoy life and art being honored with fame among all men and for all time to come if i transgress it and swear falsely may the opposite of all this be my lot conclusion of the oath of hippocrates b c saint peter dont you call me cause i cant go i owe my soul to the company store merle travis prologue toby nelms lay on his back and counted the lights as they flashed past overhead he was eight years old but small even for that age with thick redbrown hair and freckles that ran across the tops of his cheeks and over the bridge of his nose for a time after his fathers job relocation from upstate new york to the t j carter paper company of sterling new hampshire tobys classmates in the bouquette elementary school had called him dot face and shrimp and had pushed him around in the school cafeteria but things were better now much better since the day he had held his ground and absorbed a beating at the hands of jimmy barnes the school bully five six seven toby rubbed at the lump at the top of his leg next to his peenie where the pain had started and still persisted the doctors had said that the shot would take the pain away but it hadnt the music that the nurses had promised would relax him wasnt helping either the song was okay but there werent any words his hand shaking toby reached up and pulled the padded earphones off his head eight nine the lights turned from white to yellow to pink and finally to red ten eleven following the fight with jimmy the kids had stopped pushing him and had begun asking him to walk home with them after school they had even elected him to be the class representative to the student council after months of inventing illnesses to stay home it felt so good to want to go to school again every day now because of the lump he would miss a whole week it wasnt fair twelve thirteen the red lights passing overhead grew brighter more intense toby squeezed his eyes as tightly as he could but the red grew warmer and brighter still he tried putting his arm across them but the hot blood light bore through and began to sting them softly he began to cry now now toby theres no need to cry doctors going to fix that little bump and then youll be all better are you sure you dont want to listen to the music most of our patients say they feel much better because of it toby shook his head and then slowly lowered his arm the lights were gone from overhead instead he saw the face of the nurse smiling down at him she was grayhaired and wrinkled and oldas old as aunt amelia her teeth were yellowed at the tops and smears of bright red makeup glowed off her cheeks as he watched the skin on her face drew tighter more sunken her wrinkles disappeared and the spaces below the red makeup and above where her eyes had been became dark and hollow now now toby now now now now once again toby threw his arm across his eyes and once again it did no good the nurses skin tightened still further and then began to peel away until the white of her bones shone through the red dripped like blood over her skeleton face and the holes where her eyes had been glowed now now now now let me up please let me up toby screamed the words but heard only a low growl like the sound from the stereo when he turned the record with his finger let me up please let me up the sheet was pulled from his body and he shook from the chilly air im cold he cried wordlessly please cover me please let me up mommy i want my mommy okay big fella up you go it was a mans voice deep and slow toby felt hands around his ankles and beneath his arms lifting him higher and higher off the bed with wheels higher and higher and higher that same music was in the room now even without the earphones he could hear it easy does it big fella just relax toby opened his eyes the face above his was blurred he blinked then blinked once more the face beneath a blue cap remained blurred in fact it wasnt a face at alljust skin where the eyes and nose and mouth should have been again toby screamed again there was only silence he was floating helpless mommy please i want mommy down you go big fella the faceless man said toby felt the cold slab beneath his back he felt the wide strap pulled tightly across his chest just the lump his mind whimpered dont hurt my peenie you promised please dont hurt me okay toby youre going to go to sleep now just relax listen to the music and count back from one hundred like this one hundred ninetynine ninetyeight one hundred ninetynine toby heard his own voice say the words but he knew he wasnt speaking ninetyeight ninetyseven he felt icy cold water being swabbed over the space between his belly and the top of his legfirst over the lump and then over his peenie ninetysix ninetyfive please stop youre hurting me please thats it yall hes under ready jack team the voice a mans was one toby had heard before but where where okay marie turn up the speakers just a hair good good okay then lets have at it knife please the doctors voice yes toby thought that was who the doctor who had come to see him in the emergency ward the doctor with the kind eyes the doctor who had promised he wouldnt a knife what kind of knife what for then toby saw it light sparked off the blade of a small silver knife as it floated downward closer and closer to the lump above his leg he tried to move to push himself away but the strap across his chest pinned his arms tightly against his sides for a moment tobys fear was replaced by confusion and a strange curiosity he watched the thin blade glide down until it just touched the skin next to his peenie then pain unlike any he had ever known exploded through his body from the spot i can feel that i can feel that he screamed wait stop i can feel that the knife cut deeper then began to move over the top of the lump then back toward the base of his peenie blood spurted out from around the blade as it slid through his skin again and again toby screamed thats it suction now suction he heard the doctor say calmly please please youre hurting me i can feel that toby pleaded he kicked his feet and struggled against the wide strap with all his strength mommy daddy please help me metzenbaums the blade of the shiny knife now covered with blood slid free of the gash it had made in its place toby saw the points of a scissors pushing into the cut first opening then closing then opening again moving closer and closer to the base of his peenie each movement brought a pain so intense it was almost beyond feeling almost dont you understand toby screamed struggling to speak with the reasoning tone of a grownup i can feel that it hurts it hurts me the scissors drove deeper around the base of his peenie no dont touch that dont touch that sponge i need a sponge right here good thats better thats better the scissors moved further toby felt his peenie and his balls come free of his body dont do that dont do that the words were in his mind no longer in his voice again with all his strength toby tried to push up against the strap across his chest overhead he saw the doctorthe man whose eyes had been so kind the man who had promised not to hurt him he was holding something in his handsomething bloodyand he was showing it to others in the room toby struggled to understand what it was that he was showing what it was that was so interesting then suddenly he knew terrified he looked down at where the lump had been it was gone but so was his peenie and his balls in their place was nothing but a gaping bloody hole in that instant the strap across tobys chest snapped in two flailing with his arms and legs he threw himself off the table kicking at the doctors at the nurses at anything he could the bright overhead light shattered trays of sparkling steel instruments crashed to the floor get him get him he heard the doctor yell toby lashed out with his feet and his fists knocking over a shelf of bottles blood from one of them splattered across his legs he ran toward the door away from the hard table away from the strap stop him stop him strong hands caught him by the arms but he kicked out with his feet and broke free moments later the hands had him again powerful arms squeezed across his chest and under his chin easy toby easy the doctor said youre all right youre safe its me its daddy toby twisted and squirmed with all his might toby please stop listen to me youre having a nightmare its just a dream thats all just a bad dream toby let up a bit but continued to struggle the voice wasnt the doctors anymore okay son thats it thats it just relax its daddy no ones going to hurt you youre safe no ones going to hurt you toby stopped struggling the arms across his chest and under his chin relaxed slowly they turned him around slowly toby opened his eyes his fathers face dark with concern was inches from his toby can you see me its daddy do you know who i am toby its mommy im tere too toby nelms stared first at his father then at the worried face of his mother then with an empty horror swelling in his chest he slid his hand across the front of his pajama bottoms his peenie was there right where it was supposed to be his balls too was this the dream too weak too confused to cry toby sank to the floor his room was in shambles toys and books were everywhere his bookcase had been pulled over and the top of his desk swept clean his radio was smashed the small bowl home of benny his goldfish lay shattered on the rug benny lay dead amidst the glass bob nelms reached out to his son but the boy pulled away his eyes still fixed on his parents toby pushed himself backward and then up and onto his bed again he touched himself toby are you all right his mother asked softly the boy did not answer instead he pulled his knees to his chest rolled over and stared vacantly at the wall chapter one sunday june was warm and torpid on new hampshire the serpentine roadway from portsmouth almost to the canadian border light traffic wound lazily through waves of heated air far to the west a border of heavy violet storm clouds rimmed the horizon the drive north especially on afternoons like this was one zack iverson had loved for as long as he could remember he had made the trip perhaps a hundred times but each pass through the pastureland to the south the villages and rolling hills and finally the white mountains themselves brought new visions new feelings his van a battered orange vw camper was packed solid with boxes clothes and odd pieces of furniture perched on the passenger seat cheap dog rested his muzzle on the windowsill savoring the infrequent opportunity to view the world with his hair blown back from in front of his eyes zack reached across as he drove and scratched the animal behind one ear with connie gone from his life and most of his furniture sold cheap dog was a rockan island in a sea of change and uncertainty change and uncertainty zack smiled tensely for so many years june the thirtieth and july the first had been synonymous with those words summer jobs in high school four separate years in college and four more in medical school internship eight years of surgical then neurosurgical residencyso many changes so many significant junethethirtieths now this day would be the last in that stringa clear slash between the first and second halves of his life next year the date would in all likelihood slip past as just another day highway narrowed and began its rollercoaster passage into the mountains zack glanced at his watch twothirty frank and the judge were at their club probably on the fourth or fifth hole by now dinner wasnt until six there was no need to hurry he pulled off into a rest area cheap dog sensing that this was to be a stop of substance shifted anxiously in his seat thats right mopface zack said you get to escape for a while but first he took a frayed paperback from between the seats and propped it up on the dash instantly the dogs squirming stopped his head tilted you appreciate i can see the price that must be paid for the freedom you are about to enjoy yes dogs and girls its time forhe took the silver dollar from his shirt pocket and read from the pagea classic palm and transfer italian style the book rufos magic with coins was a s reprint zack had stumbled upon in a cambridge seconthand bookstore amaze your friends amuse your family impress members of the opposite sex sharpen your manual dexterity the four claims embossed in faded gold leaf on the cover each held a certain allure for him but it was the last one of the group that clinched the sale dont you see he had tried to explain to a neurosurgical colleague as he was fumbling through the exercises in chapter one were only in the o r what a few hours a day at best we need something like this to keep our hands agile between casesto sharpen our manual dexterity the way things are were like athletes who never practice between games right unfortunately although the principle behind that thought was noble enough the implementation had given rise to a most disconcerting problem for while zacks hands were quite remarkable in the operating room even for a neurosurgeon he had as yet been unable to master even the most elementary of rufos tricks and had been reduced to practicing before mirrors animals and those children who were unaware of his vocation okay dog he said get ready im going to omit the patter that goes with this one because i can see you eyeing those birches out there now i place the coin here and snap my wrist like this and and voila the coin it is gone thank you thank you now i simply pass my other hand over like this and the silver dollar slipped from his palm bounced off the emergency brake lever and clattered beneath the seat the dogs head tilted to the other side shit zack muttered it was the sun the sun got in my hands well sorry dog but one tricks all you get he retrieved the coin and then reached across and opened the passenger door cheap dog bounded out of the camper and in less than a minute had relieved himself on half a dozen trees shambled down a steep grassy slope and belly flopped into the middle of a mountain stream zack followed at a distance he was a tall man with fine green eyes and rugged looks that connie had once described as pretty damn handsome in a thuggy sort of way he wandered along the edge of the slope working the stiffness of the drive from his bad knee and watching as cheap dog made a kamikaze lunge at a blue jay and missed do you know boy he wondered do you know that the rehearsals over that were not going back to the city again he squinted up at the mountains the rockies the tetons the smokies the sierras the northern appalachiansan avid rock climber since his teens he had climbed at one time or another in all of them there was something special though something intimate and personal that he felt in the white mountains and nowhere else they seemed to be giving him a messagethat the world his life were right where they should be the demands of surgical training had exacted a toll on every aspect of his existence but of all those compromises and sacrifices the unavoidable cutback in his climbing was the one he had accepted the most reluctantly now at almost thirtysix he was anxious to make up for lost time thin air turnabout and fair play the widowmaker carsons cliff each climb would be like rediscovering a longlost friend zack closed his eyes and breathe in the mountain air for months he had wrestled with the choice of a career in academic medicine or one in private smalltown practice of all the decisions he had ever madechoosing a college medical school a specialty a training programthis was the one that had proved the most trying and even after he had made itafter he had weighed all the pros and cons gotten connies agreement and opted to return to sterlinghis tenuous decision was challenged the ink was barely dry on his contract with ultramed hospitals corporation when connie announced that she had been having serious second thoughts about relocating from the back bay to northern new hampshire and in fact that she was developing a similar case of cold feet over being engaged to the sort of man who would even consider such a move not two weeks later the ring had arrived at his apartment in its original box strapped to a bottle of cold duck zack sighed and combed his dark brown hair back with his fingers they were striking expressive fingerssinewy and so long even for the hands of a sixfooter that he had taken to sending to a medical supply house in milwaukee for specially made gloves early on those fingers had set him apart in the operating room and even before that on the rock face he gazed to the northwest and swore he had caught a glimpse of mirror an almost sheer granite face so studded with mica that summer sun exploded off it like a star going nova lion head tuckerman ravine wall of tears there was so much magic in the mountains so much to look forward to true life in sterling might prove less stimulating than in the city but there would be peace and as long as he could climb more than enough excitement as well and of course there would be the practice itselfthe challenges of being the first neurosurgeon ever in the area in less than twentyfour hours he would be in his own office in the ultramodern ultramed physicians and surgeons clinic adjacent to the rejuvenated ultrameddavis regional hospital after three decades of preparation and sacrifice he was finally set to get on with the business of his lifeto show his world and himself exactly what he could do the prospect blew gently across what apprehensions he had scattering them like dry leaves connie or no connie everything was going to work out fine homemade bread and vegetable soup goose pate on tiny sesame wafers waterford crystal wineglasses and goblets rack of lamb with mint jelly royal doulton china sweet potatoes and rice pilaf fresh green beans with shaved almonds fine irish linen the meal was vintage cinnie iverson zack was aware of a familiar mixture of awe and discomfort as he watched his mother wearing an apron she had embroidered herself flutter between kitchen and dining room setting one course after another on the huge cherrywood table clearing dishes away pausing to slip in and out of conversations even pouring water and all the while skillfully and steadfastly refusing offers of assistance from lisette and himself the table was set for eight although cinnie was seldom at her seat the judge held sway from his immutable place at the head his heavy highbacked chair was not at all unlike the one behind the bench in his county courtroom zack had been assigned the place of honor at the far end of the table facing his father between them sat his older brother frank franks wife lisette their fouryearold twins lucy and marthe and annie doucette the iversons housekeeper now a widow in her late seventies and part of the family since shortly after frank was born in sharp contrast to cinnie iversons bustlings the atmosphere at the table was as usual restrained with periods of silence punctuating measured exchanges zack smiled to himself picturing the noisy animated chaos in the boston municipal hospital cafeteria where for the past seven years he had eaten most of his meals he had been raised in this house this town and in that respect he belonged but in most others after almost seventeen years it was as if he had packed up his belongings in boston and moved to another planet of those at the table zack observed lisette had changed the most over the years once a vibrant if flighty beauty she had cut her hair short eschewed any but the lightest makeup and appeared to have settled in quite comfortably as a mother and wife she was still trim and certainly attractive but the spark of adventure in her eyes once a focus of fantasy for him was missing she sat between the twins across from frank and annie and reserved most of her conversation for the girls carefully managing their etiquette and smiling approvingly when one or the other of them entered the conversation without interrupting lisette was a year younger than zack and for nearly two yearsfrom the middle of his junior year at sterling high until her one trip to visit him at yaleshe had been his first true love the pain and confusion of that homecoming weekend in new haven the realization of how far apart just six weeks had taken them marked a turning point in both their lives for a while after lisettes return to sterling there were scattered calls from one to the other and even a few letters finally though there was nothing eventually she moved away to montreal and made brief stabs first at college then marriageto a podiatrist or optometrist zack thought pollowing the breakup of her marriage she had returned to sterling and within a year was engaged to frank zack had been best man at their wedding and was godfather to the twins like lisette annie kept pretty much to herself picking at more than eating her food and speaking up only to bemoan from time to time the arthritis or dizzy spells or swollen ankles which kept her from being more of a help to madame cinnie it was difficult and somewhat painful for zack to remember the wise stocky woman of his boyhood hunkered over a football then hiking it between her legs to prank as he practiced passing to his little brother in the field behind their house one of the curses of being a physician was to see people all too often as diagnoses and each time zack returned home and saw annie doucette he subconsciously added one or two to her list today annie looked more drawn and haggard than he had ever seen her frank of all those in the room had changed the least over the years now thirtyeight he was in his fourth year as the administrator of ultrameddavis hospital he was also if anything slimmer handsomer and more confident than ever what are the possibilities zack had once asked a genetics professor of two brothers sharing none of the same genes the old man had smiled and patiently explained that with millions of maternal and paternal genes segregating randomly into egg and sperm all siblings brother or sister were in essence fifty percent the same and fifty percent different you should meet my brother sometime zack had said if thats the case the professor had countered with a wink then perhaps i should meet the family milkman instead in the end science had prevailed although the notion that he and frank were fifty percent alike was only slightly less difficult for zack to accept than the possibility of his mother having had a child by any gene pool other than the judges it was nearly seven oclock and the meal was winding down the twins were getting restless but were held in place by lisettes glances and the prospect of grandmamas apple pie although snatches of conversation had dealt with zacks upcoming practice most of it had centered around golf the judge blind to anyone elses boredom with the subject was on the sixteenth green of a holebyhole account of his match with frank thirty feet he said nudging his wineglass which in seconds was refilled by his wife maybe forty i swear zachary i have never seen your brother putt like thatmarthe a young lady does not play with her dress at the dinner table he steps up to the ball then looks over at me and just as calmly as you please says double or nothing it waswhat frank three dollars five frank said making no attempt to mask his ennui mon dieu five well i tell you he just knocked that ball over hill and dale right into the center of the cup for a three the nerve say maybe next weekend we can make it a threesome hey judge frank said leave the man alone hes an ultramed surgeon now its in his contract no golfing for the first year he turned to his brother his hands raised in mock defense just kidding zacko just kidding you play any down in boston only the kind where you shoot it into the whales mouth and out its tail zack said annie laughed out loud and choked briefly on a piece of celery we played that uncle zack lucy said excitedly mama took us marthe hit herself in the head with her club will you take us again sometime of course i will youre not going away like all the other times are you no lucy im staying here see marthe i told you he wasnt going away this time will you take us to mcdonalds too we never get to go except when you take us zack shrunk in his seat before lisettes reproving glare they get confused sometimes he said i spoke to jess bishop the judge went on hes membership chairman at the club you remember him zachary well no matter jess says that being as your father and brother are members in good standing you wont even have to go through the application process thank goodness zack said hoping even as he heard his own words that the judge would miss the facetiousness in his voice so who finally won today won why me of course the judge said shifting his bulk in his chair his christian name was clayton but even his wife rarely called him anything but judge he was like both his sons over six feet but his athletes body had years before yielded to his sedentary job and rich tastes a civic leader and chairman of the board of davis regional hospital until its sale to ultramed the judge had no less than six plaques tacked up in the den proclaiming him sterling man of the year he was also though in his midsixties a ten handicap it was close though frank he went on ill give you that close frank humphed judge youre the one who pounded it into us that close only counts in hand grenades and horseshoes again annie doucette laughed out loud and again her laugh was terminated by a fit of coughing this time zack noted she was massaging her chest after she had regained control and her color was marginally more pale than it had been you okay annie he asked fine im fine the woman said in the maurice chevalier accent she had never shown the least inclination to change she lowered her hand slightly but not completely now you just stop eyeing me like you want to take out my liver or something and go on about your talking therell be plenty of time for you to play doctor starting tomorrow all my friends are busy thinking up brain problems just so they can come in and see you in your office before zack could respond cinnie iverson reappeared a pie in each hand and began her rounds of the table insisting that everyone take a slice half again larger than he or she desired annie flashed him a look that warned now dont you dare say anything that will upset your mother still there was something about her color about the cast of her face that made him uneasy dessert conversation was dominated by the twins who competed with each other to give uncle jacques the more complete account of what had been happening in their lives completely yankee on one side of their family and completely frenchcanadian on the other the girls were interchangeably bilingual and as they became more and more animated increasingly difficult to understand what fascinatedand disturbedzack was the lack of outward interaction between the twins and their father or for that matter between frank and lisette perhaps it was the seating arrangement perhaps franks preoccupation with issues at the hospital in particular the arrival of his younger brother as the new neurosurgeon on the block whatever the reason zack noted that frank had spoken scarcely a word to the girls and none that he could recall to lisette in all other respects frank was frankfull of plans for expanding the scope and services of ultrameddavis and tuned into every potential new real estate development and industrial move in the area watching the man listening to him expound on the risks and benefits of entering the bond market at this time or on the possibilities of developing the meadows north of town into a shopping mall zack could not help but be impressed frank had overcome one of the most difficult obstacles in life early success and zack knew it hadnt been easy a legend in three sports at sterling high voted class president and most likely to succeed he had gone to notre dame amidst a flurry of press clippings touting him as one of the great quarterback prospects in the country his high school grades and board scores were only average if that and his study habits were poor but the coaching staff and administration at the indiana school had promised him whatever tutoring help he might need to keep him on the field and help him they did at least until his passes began to fall short midway through franks sophomore year the angry defensive calls and letters home began there were too many quarterbacks the coaches werent paying enough attention to him teachers were discriminating against him because he was an athlete next came a series of nagging injuriesback spasms a torn muscle a twisted ankle finally there was a visit to cinnie and the judge from one of the assistant coaches although his parents had never made him privilege to that conversation zack was able to piece together that frank had developed an attitude problem and had become more adept at hoisting a tankard than at directing an offense by the middle of franks junior season he was back in sterling working construction complaining about his ill treatment at notre dame interviewing with the coaches and administration at the university of new hampshire and partying a knee injury midway through his first season at the state school put an end to his athletic career and as if those failures werent enough frank had to endure the rising star of his younger brother whose participation in all sports except climbing had been curtailed by a vicious skiing injury following that accident zack had suffered through a brief period of depression and rebellion and then had quietly but steadily built a gradepoint average that enabled him to be accepted at yalethe first sterling graduate to be so honored there was every reason for frank to fold to become embittered and jealous to drop out but he didnt it took an extra year but he got his degree then to the surprise of many he stayed on in school and earned a masters in business administration the walls of expectation erected by the judge were sheer glass but bit by bit in his own way frank had scaled them and now he was a success once again at least in terms of lifestyle power and accomplishments cinnie iverson had poured the final round of coffee and the twins had at last been allowed to leave their seats when frank stood and raised his halffilled wineglass a toast he announced the others raised their glasses and the twins insisted that theirs be refilled with milk so they could join in to my little brother zachary who proved that brains are always better than brawn when it comes to making it in this world its good to have you back in sterling amen said the judge amen the twins echoed zack stood and raised his glass toward frank wondering if anyone at the table besides himself thought the message in the toast a bit strange for a moment his eyes and his brothers met almost imperceptibly frank nodded the toast was no accident for all of his status and accomplishments frank still measured himself against the md degree of his younger brother and found himself wanting to you all zack said finally and especially to my new partner in crime frank im proud to be working with you amen shouted the twins amen chapter two the three of them father and sons sat alone at the table outside the storm clouds had arrived bringing with them a premature dusk the women were in the kitchen annie in the breakfast nook cinnie and lisette by the sink loading the dishwasher for the second time chatting about the upcoming womens club bake sale and keeping watch on the twins who had taken cheap dog out back to play in the meadow in a manner quite consistent with his belief that business matters and women should be separated whenever possible the judge had kept the conversation light until the last of them annie had left the room then after a few sips of coffee he turned abruptly to frank guy beaulieu came to see me yesterday he said so he says ultramed and that new surgeon mainwaring have just about put him out of business at the hospital jason mainwarings not new judge frank said patiently hes been here almost two years and no onenot him not ultramed not me not anyoneis trying to put beaulieu out of business except maybe beaulieu himself if hed be a little more cooperative and a little more civil to people around the hospital none of this would be happening guys a crusty old devil the judge said ill grant you that but hes also been around this town nearly as long as i have and hes helped a lot of folks whats all this about zack asked the judge was hardly a spontaneous man and zack could not help but wonder if there was a reason he had postponed this conversation through four hours of golf to have it now frank and the judge measured one another silently debating whose version of the story zack was to hear first the contest lasted only a few seconds a short while back the judge began obviously unwilling openly to concede franks almost two years ultrameddavis brought a new surgeon into town this jason mainwaring i met him i think zack said he turned to frank the tall blond guy with the southern drawl frank nodded zack remembered the man as somewhat distant but polished intense and during their brief contact quite knowledgeablemore the type he would have expected to see as a university medicalcenter professor than as a mountain communityhospital general surgeon well the judge went on apparently guy was already beginning to have some trouble getting a lot of his patients admitted to the hospital frank sighed audibly and bit at his lower lip making it clear that only courtesy kept him from interrupting to contest the statement more and more his patientsespecially the poor frenchcanadian oneswere being shipped to the county hospital in clarion then rumors started floating around town about guys competence and all of a sudden all the surgical cases who could paythose with insurance or on medicaidwere going to this mainwaring ive heard some of the rumors myself and let me tell you they are vicious drinking doing unnecessary internal exams on women taking powerful drugs because of a small stroke is there truth to any of them zack asked during the summer between his sophomore and junior years at yale med he had worked as an extern at the then davis regional hospital and beaulieu had gone out of his way to bring him into the operating room and to nurture his growing interest in surgery it was a concern he had never forgotten the judge shook his head according to guy there have been no specific complaints from anyone just rumors he says that about eighty percent of his work now is charity stuff at clarion county and that he hasnt operated on a nonfrenchcanadian patient at ultramed for almost a year he says the whole thing is a conspiracy to get back at him because he was so opposed to the sale of the hospital to ultramed in the first place thats ridiculous frank said mainwarings getting the cases because hes good and he works like hell its as simple as that you know judge i dont think its fair for you to take beaulieus side in this thing clayton iverson slammed his hand down on the table dont you ever dare tell me whats fair young man he snapped the provisional phase in our contract with ultramed still has a month to run i convinced the board of trustees to sell out to them in the first place and by god the three weeks until our meeting and vote is more than enough time for me to convince them to exercise our option and buy the damn place back he breathe deeply and calmed himself zack glanced over at frank though he was staring at their father impassively his hands were clenched and his knuckles were bonewhite and let me make this clear the judge went on i havent taken anyones side as a matter of fact frank i resented his implications that you were in any way involved with his problems and i told him so he apologized and backed off some but hes hurt and hes angry i promised him id speak to youboth of youabout it ask you to keep your eyes and ears open i feel we owe it to him you were too young to remember frank but that man all but saved your life when your appendix burst franks fists relaxed a bit though zack could tell that he was still smarting from the judges threat personality clashes power plays and political machinations were he knew all too well as omnipresent and as integral a part of hospital life as ivs and bedpans but he sensed something more to all of thissomething virulent annie cinnie iversons cry was followed instantly by the crash of dishes with reflexes born of years of crisis zack was on his feet and headed toward the kitchen as frank and the judge were just beginning to react annie doucette was on the floor her back and neck were arched and her limbs were flailing uncontrollably in a grand mal seizure as zack knelt beside the woman he felt the change sweep over him early on he had heard about the phenomenon from other older docs but did not undergo it himself until midway through his second year of residency when he witnessed the cardiac arrest of a patient in that moment his world suddenly began to move in slow motion his voice lowered and his words became more measured he sensed his pulse rate drop and all his senses heighten it was unlike anything he had ever experienced in similar emergencies movements became automatic observations and orders instinctive dozens of facts and variables were processed instantly and simultaneously later with the patient successfully resuscitated and stabilized he would learn from the nurses that he had acted quickly decisively and calmly it was only after hearing their account of his performance that he realized fully what he had done the change had been part of him ever since mom call an ambulance please he said as he rolled annie to one side to prevent her from aspirating her own stomach contents should she vomit his fingertips were already at the side of her neck feeling for a carotid pulse as the change intensified all sense of the woman as a friend a loved one a patient yielded to the objectivity of assessment if it became necessary in any way to hurt in order to heal then hurt he would frank my medical bag is in a large carton at the back of the van could you get it please please thank you the use of these words during a crisis kept everybody calmer including he suspected himself stroke heart attack with arrhythmia epilepsy sudden internal hemorrhage causing shock hypoglycemia simple faint mimicking a grand mal seizure the most likely diagnostic possibilities flowed through his mind each accompanied by an algorithm of required observations and reactions annies color was beginning to mottle her back remained arched and her arms and legs continued to spasm her jaw was clenched far too tightly to slip any buffer between her teeth again and again zacks fingertips probed up and down along the side of her windpipe searching for a pulse she had had chest pain at the table zack felt certain of that now heart attack with an irregular ineffective beat or complete cardiac standstill moved ahead of all other possibilities in his mind judge are you okay to come down here and help good im going to put her over on her back if she starts to vomit please flip her back on her side regardless of what im doing lisette check the time please and keep an eye on it zack eased the woman onto her back her seizure was continuing though her movements were becoming less violent again he checked for pulses first at her neck then in each groin there were none he delivered a sharp twofisted blow to the center of her chest and began rhythmic cardiac compressions as frank arrived with his medical bag judge please fold something up and put it beneath her neck then lay that chair over and put her feet up on it if you can thats it frank there are some syringes with needles already attached in the bottom of the bag i need two also theres a little leather pouch with vials of medicines in it ill need valium and adrenaline that one may say epinephrine on it mom did you get the ambulance good how long five minutes at the most frank can you do cpr i took the course twice good take over here please while i get some medicine into her to stop her seizing dont bother trying mouthtomouth until she stops just pump youre doing fine every ones doing fine zack placed his fingertips over the femoral artery a little harder frank please he said time lisette just over a minute without bothering with a tourniquet zack injected valium and adrenaline into a vein in the crook of annie doucettes arm in seconds her seizure stopped frank continued pumping as zack hunched over the woman and administered half a dozen mouthtomouth breaths moments later annie took one on her own hold it frank please zack said as he searched once again for a cartoid artery pulse this time he felt oneslow and faint but definite he checked in her groin both femoral artery pulses were paldable i n again the woman took a breath then another come on annie his mind urged do it again just one more just one more he slipped a blood pressure cuff around her arm and then worked his stethoscope into place with one hand while he returned his other to the side of the womans neck i hear a pressure he announced softly it aint much but for right now its enough annies breathing was still shallow but much more regular softly but steadily she began to moan her lips were dusky but the terrible mottling of her skin had lessened at that moment they heard the whoop of the ambulance and seconds later strobelike golden lights appeared in the living room window zack looked up at his older brother who knelt across the woman from him for an instant he flashed on two young boys kneeling opposite one another in a dusty vacant lot shooting marbles for ten seconds twenty neither man moved or spoke then frank reached over and took his hand welcome to sterling he said the ambulance was one of several well equipped vans owned by ultrameddavis and operated by the sterling fire department zack sat beside annie in the back watching the monitor screen as the vehicle jounced down the narrow mountainside road toward the hospital a young but impressively efficient paramedic knelt next to him calling out a blood pressure reading every fifteen or twenty seconds sterling new hampshire was small in many ways but zack could see ultrameds influence in the emergency teams response this was big city medicine in the finest sense of the term annie was still unconscious although her breathing seemed less labored and her blood pressure was inching upward eighty over sixty the paramedic said its getting a little easier to hear zack nodded and adjusted the iv which the young man had inserted flawlessly and even more rapidly than he himself could have done frank had stayed behind to tend to the family and contact a cardiologist they would meet later at the hospital zachary felt tense but he was also charged and exhilarated when it all came together when it all worked right there was no comparable feeling come watson come the game is afoot zack loved the quote and often wondered if arthur conan doyle a physician had transferred the energy of his experience with medical emergencies to his detective hero after a brief stretch on the highway the ambulance slowed and turned into the long circular driveway leading uphill to the hospital a large spotlighted sign at the base of the drive announced ultrameddavis regional hospitalcommunity and corporate america working together for the betterment of all zack smiled to himself and wondered if he was the only one amused by the hubris of the pronouncement the betterment of all ultramed hospitals corporation and davis regional hospital could certainly never be accused of setting their sights too low still although he had a few lingering concerns about working for a component of what some had labeled the medicalindustrial complex his conversations with frank and the judge and his investigations of the hospital and its parent company had provided no cause to doubt the proclamation however audacious ultrameddavis now a modern twohundredbed facility had a proud history dating back to the turn of the century when the quebecbased sisters of charity placed ten beds in a large donated house and named it in french hopital st georges over the decades that followed brick wings were added until ultimately the old house was completely replaced the hospitals capacity grew to fifty patients and eventually to eighty in the st georges school of nursing was established and before its closing in the early seventies produced more than nurses in mid the ownership and administrative control of st georges was transferred from the sisters of charity to a community based nonprofit corporation headed by clayton iverson already a clarion county circuit judge and was renamed after reverend louis davis the pastor who had donated the initial structure to the town over the years that followed a succession of inadequate administrators most of them using davis regional as a steppingstone to bigger and better places made a succession of unfortunate decisions opting too often for projects and personnel additions that looked progressive but could not support themselves financially gradually but inexorably community support for the facility dwindled and benefactors became scarce older physicians began retiring earlier than they had planned and a lack of financial inducements kept young recruits from taking their places bankruptcy and closure became more than theoretical possibilities it was then with the wolves howling at the hospital door that the ultramed corporation appeared on the scene a subsidiary of widely diversified riata international ultramed assailed the hospital board with slide shows brochures stock reports pasteboard graphs and more financial information on the facility than even the most diligent trustee possessed suspicious of outsiders and wary of losing control of an enterprise that had for most of a century been at the very heart of their community a majority of the board opposed the sale favoring instead another bond issue and one more stab at doing things right clayton iverson citing what he called the bloodred writing on the wall knew the community had no sensible alternative but to sell by his own spirited account he worked his way through the trustees one by one cajoling arguing calling in markers in the end zack had been told proudly the vote was unanimous unanimous that was save one only guy beaulieu remained opposed though out of respect for the judge he declined to vote at all never one to relinquish power with a hook the judge extracted two concessions from the corporation in exchange for the sale of the hospital a provisional fouryear period after which the board of trustees could repurchase the facility including all improvements for the original sixmilliondollar price and the serious consideration of his son for the position of administrator as near as zack could tell from his fathers account following an exhaustive series of interviews ultramed had selected frank over dozens of applicantsmost with extensive hospital experience that decision for whatever reasons it was made had proved brilliant orchestrated by frank and aided by timetested business practices and public relations techniques the turnabout in the hospital was immediate and impressive new equipment and new physicians underscored the corporate theme of a change for the better and the remaining opponents of the facilitymostly in the poor and uninsured sectors of the communityexperienced increasing difficulty in finding a platform from which to voice their concerns in just a few years ultrameddavis regional hospital had been transported from the backwater of health care to the vanguard hang on doc the ambulance driver called over his shoulder to zack were here zack braced himself against annies stretcher as the man swung a sharp turn and backed into the brightly lit ambulance bay alerted by the ambulance radio a team of three nurses dressed in blue scrubs and an orderly wearing whites was poised on the concrete platform before zack could even identify himself two of the nurses with tightlipped efficiency had pulled annies stretcher from the ambulance and sped past him into the emergency ward zack followed the stretcher to a wellequipped room marked simpy trauma and watched from the door as the team transferred annie to a hospital litter switched her oxygen tubing and monitor cables to the hospital console and began a rapid assessment of her vital signs one nurse apparently in charge listened briefly to annies chest then took up a position at the foot of the bed supervising the evaluation excuse me zack said to the woman who wore a white lab coat over her scrubs could i speak to you for a moment the woman turned and zack felt an immediate spark of interest she was in her early thirties he guessed if that with short beachsand hair fine very feminine features and vibrant almost iridescent bluegreen eyes instinctively and quite out of character for him given the situation zack glanced at her left hand there was no ring i im dr iverson zachary iverson he said had he actual stammered im a neurosurgeon due to start on the staff here tomorrow that woman we just brought in is i mean was sort of like my governess when i was young mine and my brother franks now theres a name i recognize the woman said cocking her head to one side as if appraising a painting in a museum yes zack said several seconds passed before he realized that he had not yet finished explaining what he wanted he cleared his throat well frank said he would arrange for a cardiologista dr cole i think he said his name wasto come in and take over annies care has he arrived yet no the woman said thoughtfully no he hasnt doctor her expression was at once coy and challenging and zack often oblivious to womens attempts at nonverbal interplay felt illequipped to respond with an expression of his own i see he said finally wondering if he was looking as flustered and restless as he was feeling his ego was goading him to be assertiveto remind the woman that while he might have momentarily been taken aback by her he was at least until the arrival of dr cole in charge he cleared his throat again and unconsciously stood more erect well then he went on with a bit more officiousness than he had intended would you please have someone call him again ill be in there with mrs doucette just send him in as soon as he gets here also could you order an ekg and a portable chest x ray certainly doctor the woman said as he strode past her and into the room bravo his ego cheered well handled he glanced back over his shoulder the woman had not yet moved could you call the lab too please he ordered wishing her eyes would stop smiling at him that way routine bloods certainly she said cardiac enzymes too damn her cool zack thought yes of course he responded have them draw extra tubes as well dr cole can order whatever else he wants when he gets here he walked to the bedside without waiting for an acknowledgment of his request and forced himself not to look back annies eyes still closed were beginning to flutter im dr iverson he said to the two nurses who were attending her hows she doing her pressures up to a hundred over sixty one of them a husky matronly woman in her fifties said shes moved both arms and both legs and it looks like shes about to wake up good zack said aware that a portion of his thoughts at least were not focused on the matter at hand he slipped his stethoscope into place and checked annies heart and lungs annie its zack he said into her ear can you hear me annie doucette moaned softly then almost imperceptibly she nodded you passed out annie youre at the hospital now and youre going to be all right do you understand that again a nod good just relax and rest youre doing fine he turned to the nurse dr coles due here any minute until he gets here well just keep doing what were doing the nurse looked at him queerly then glanced over at the door zack followed her line of sight and found himself once again confronting the enigmatic oceangreen eyes this time though the disconcerting woman behind them stepped forward and extended her hand dr iverson im dr suzanne cole she said simply her expression was totally professional but there was an unmistakable playfulness in her eyes zack felt the flush in his cheeks as he reached out and shook her hand im sorry he mumbled it was sort of dumb for me to assume what i mean is you werent exactly i know she said her tone suggested an apology for having allowed him to dig such a hole for himself im sure it was this outfit that confused youshe indicated the blue scrubsuitbut i just finished putting in a pacemaker she nodded toward annie who was now fully awake and beginning to look around you seem to have done quite a job bringing this woman back dr iverson congratulations it was nearing midnight zack iverson sat alone in the staff lounge at the back of the emergency ward sipping tepid coffee sorting through what had been perhaps the most remarkable june the thirtieth of them all and trying to slow down his runaway fantasies concerning suzanne cole it had taken several hours to ready a bed for annie in the coronary care unit and to effect her transfer there during that time zack had stayed in the background watching suzanne as she managed one dangerous cardiac arrhythmia after another in the woman balancing complex treatments against their side effects checking monitor readouts reviewing lab results then suddenly stopping to mop annies brow or to smooth errant wisps of gray hair from her forehead or simply to bend down and whisper encouragement in her ear unlike what zack had imagined from her cool composure during their initial meeting she was actually quite tense and frenetic during critical moments moving from one side of the bed to the other then back checking and rechecking to ensure that her orders were being carried out correctly still while she seemed frequently on edge she was never out of control and it was clear that the nurses were comfortable with her ways and even more important trusted in them who are you his mind asked over and over as he watched her work what are you doing up here in the boondocks the judge and cinnie had checked in twice by phone and around ten frank had stopped by he seemed restless and irritable and although he mentioned nothing of the episode zack sensed that he was still quite upset by the judges outburst and thinly veiled threat citing the need to be near the twins during the violent thunderstorm that had just erupted he had left for home after only half an hour but before he left zack had managed in what he hoped was an offhanded way to pump a bit of information from him regarding suzanne cole dartmouthtrained and a member of the ultrameddavis staff for almost two years she was thirtythree or thirtyfour divorced and the mother of a sixyearold girl in addition she was coowner along with another divorcee in town of a small art gallery and crafts shop zack had tried with little success for a more subjective assessment of the woman but frank distracted and anxious to leave had completely missed the point now as he sat alone zack wondered if it was worth waiting any longer for the woman to finish her work in the unit and as she had promised stop by for a hit of decaf the nurses had told him that it was not that uncommon for suzanne as they called her to spend the night in the hospital if she had a particularly sick patient and this night with annie and her pacemaker caseshe had two who are you what are you doing up here the state of infatuation with a woman was not something with which zack was all that familiar or comfortable a bookworm throughout his college years and a virgin until his junior year he had had a reasonable number of dates and a few shortlived romances after lisette but no prolonged relationships until connie he had once described his social life in college as a succession of calls to women the day after they had met someone special connie was five years younger than he but possessed a worldliness and sophistication that he felt were missing from his life she had an mba degree from northwestern a managementtrack position at one of the big downtown companies a condo in the back bay a silver bmw friends in the symphony and an interest in impressionist painters pissarro has more depth more energy in one brush stroke than renoir has in a dozen canvases dont you think and foreign films zachary if you would stop insisting on plot all the time and concentrate more on the universality of the characters and the technical brilliance of the director this film would mean more to you friends of his spoke to him from time to time of what they perceived might be a mismatch but he countered by enumerating the new awareness connie had brought into his life whether he truly loved the woman or not he was never sure but there was no questioning that he was for most of their time together absolutely infatuated with her beauty her confidence and her style her decision to break off their engagement had hurt him but not as deeply as he first thought and over the months that followed he had spent what free time he had flying the radiocontrolled airplane he had built in high school exercising himself back into rockclimbing shape hiking with cheap dog and horseback riding with friends along the seashore at the capebut not one minute at a gallery or locked in combat with a foreign film hi startled zack knocked over his styrofoam cup spilling what remained of his coffee into a small pool on the veneer tabletop hi yourself he said as suzanne cole plucked a pad of napkins from the nearby counter and dabbed up the spill was there to be no end to his ineptitude in front of this woman it would seem you might have reached the limit of your caffeine quota for the day she said she had changed into street clothesgray slacks and a bulky fishermanknit sweaterand she looked as fresh as if she had just started the day actually he said i use caffeine to override my own inherent hyperness i think it actually slows me down she smiled i know the syndrome im surprised to find you still here what with tomorrow being your first day in the office and all i wanted to be sure annie was out of the woods shes been pretty special to me and my family besides i just finished my residency yesterday itll probably be months before my internal chemistry demands anything more than a fifteenminute nap in an institutional naugahyde easy chair i remember those chairs well suzanne said leaning against the counter theres an old ratty maroon one in the cardiac fellows room at hitchcock that i suspect would one day have a sign on it proclaiming suzanne cole slept hereand only here so its a progress report youre after well the news is good at least for the moment your annies awake and stable with no neurologic deficit that i can identify although you might want to go over her in the morning in fact i think ill make her your first consult if thats okay you did say you were going to do neurology as well as neurosurgery yes absolutely i actually enjoy the puzzles nearly as much as i do the blood and guts her eyes narrowed you sure dont talk like a surgeon she said the ones i know have signs in their rooms like to cut is to cure and all the world is preop oh i have those too believe me only as an enlightened renaissance surgeon mine say almost all the world is preop he pushed a chair from the table with his foot here have a seat sorry but i cant she said ive got to go mrs doucette was my third critical admission this weekend and i have a full day tomorrow you ought to get some sleep too so youll be sharp for my consult good night now she slipped on her coat and headed for the door wait zack said realizing even as he heard his own voice that the order was coming from somewhere outside his rational selfsomewhere within his swirling fantasies yes she turned back to him the darkness in her eyes and the set of her face were warning him not to push matters further he picked up on the message too late i um i was wondering if we might have dinner or something together sometime suzanne sagged visibly im sorry she said wearily thank you zacks fantasies stopped swirling and began floating to earth like feathers oh he said feeling suddenly very selfconscious i didnt mean to what i mean is it seemed like zack im sorry for being so abrupt its late and im bushed i appreciate your asking me really i do and im flattered but i i just dont go out with people i work with besides im involved with someone the last of the feathers touched down zack shrugged well then he said with forced cheer i guess i should just hope that a lot of folks show up at this hospital with combined cardiac and neurosurgical disease shouldnt i suzanne reached out and shook his hand im looking forward to working with you she said i know well be terrific at that moment from the far end of the emergency ward a man began screaming again and again no i wont go im going to die im going to die the two of them raced toward the commotion which centered about an old manin his seventies zack guessedwhom the nurse the emergency physician and a uniformed security guard were trying to move from a litter to a wheelchair the man with striking long silver hair and a gnarled full beard was struggling to remain where he was zacks gaze took in his chino pants and flannel shirt stained with grit sweat and grease and a pair of tattered oily work boots the old mans left arm was bound tightly across his chest with a shoulder immobilizer the tissues over his cheek and around his right eye were badly swollen by fresh bruises no he bellowed again dont move me im going to die if i go back there tonight please just one night what gives zack asked the emergency physician a rotund former gp in town named wilton marshfield released his hold and the old man sank back on the litter oh hi iverson dr cole he said nodding i thought you two had gone home we were about to said zack everything okay he had known marshfield a marginally competent graduate of a nownonexistent medical school for years and had been surprised to find him working in the emergency room during a conversation earlier in the evening the man had explained that frank had talked him out of retirement until a personnel problem in the e r could be stabilized plucked me off the scrap heap of medicine and offered me a salary as good as my best year in the office was how he had put it sure sure everythings fine marshfield said its just that ol chris gow here doesnt understand that ultrameddavis is a hospital not a bloody hotel what happened to him suzanne asked nothing as serious as it looks marshfield answered with unconcealed disdain he just had a little too much of the hooch he brews up in that shack of his and fell down his front steps fractured his upper arm near the shoulder but theres not a damn thing we can do for that except ice and immobilization films of his facial bones are all negative and sos the rest of his exam now weve got an ambulance all set to cart him home but the old geezer wont let us take him off the litter without a fight well take care of it though dont worry suzanne hesitated for a moment as if she wanted to comment on the situation but then nodded and backed off a step zack however brushed past the portly physician to the bedside mr gow im dr iverson he said the old man looked up at him but didnt speak his face beneath the beard and the filth had an ageless almost serene quality to it but there was a sadness in his eyes that zack had seen many times during his years of caring for the largely indigent boston patientsa sadness born of loneliness and hopelessness there was also no small measure of fear are you in much pain not according to him i aint the man answered still breathing heavily from his struggles i wonder when the last time was he fell down the stairs like i did and broke his arm who do you live with the old man laughed mirthlessly wincing from the pain then he turned his head away zack looked to marshfield for the answer he lives by himself in a shack at the endfof the old logging road off do you have a phone chris again the man laughed how did you get here how do you think a trucker found him sitting by the highway and brought him in marshfield explained chris is no stranger here hes a woodcutter periodically he goes on a toot and cuts up himself instead of the wood he laughed at his own humor and seemed not to notice that no one else joined in we sew him up and ship him back home until the next time zack looked down at the old man could there be any sadder state than being sick or badly hurt and being aloneof hoping against hope for someone to come and help but knowing that no one would why cant he just be admitted for a day or two he asked are there empty beds in the house oh we have beds marshfield said but ol chris here doesnt have any kind of insurance and unless his problem is lifethreatening which it isnt he either goes to clarion county if we want to ship him out there or he goes home what if a staff doctor insists on admitting someone who cant pay marshfield shrugged it doesnt happen if it did i guess the physician would have to answer to the administration look iverson you werent around when this hospital admitted every tom dick and harry who came down the pike regardless of whether they could pay or not but im here to tell you it was one helluva mess there were some weeks when the goddamn place couldnt even meet its payroll let alone buy any new equipment this mans staying zack said the emergency physician reddened i told you we had things under control he said i zachan glanced down at the old man sending him home to an isolated shack with no phone and as likely as not no food went against his evess instinct as a physician under control or not he said evenly hes staying admit him to me as malnutrition and syncope ill write orders marshfields jowly cheeks were now crimson its your goddamn funeral he said youre the one whos going to get called on the carpet by the administration i think frank will understand zack said this time marshfield laughed out loud there are a few docs beating the bushes out there for a job because they thought the same thing iverson like i said hes being admitted and like i said its your funeral its okay tommy he said to the guard you can go on about your rounds dr social sewice here is hellbent on learning things the hard way he turned on his heels and stalked away chris youre going to stay at least for the night zack said taking the old mans good hand in his ill be back to check you over in a few minutes the man bewildered by the sudden change in his fortune could only stare up at him and nod but the corners of his eyes were glistening zack turned to suzanne come on he said ill walk you outside i can use the fresh air they walked through the electronically opened doorway and out onto the ambulance platform a steady windblown rain swept across the coalblack pavement i guess i have a few adjustments to make if im to sunive here he said shivering momentarily against the chill suzanne flipped the hood of her trench coat over her head do us all a favor she said and dont make any ones you dont absolutely have to that was a very kind thing you did in there insurance or not that old guys paid his dues perhaps suzanne said yes perhaps he has well ill see you in the morning yeah she turned and took several steps then turned back zack about that dinner how about wednesday night my place zack felt his pulse skip i thought you didnt date men you worked with no policy should be without exceptions she said you just made that point in there yourself didnt you yes yes i suppose i did but how about your other involvement she pushed her hood back from her forehead and smiled at him first with her eyes then with her lips i lied she said iverson stood by the glass doors of her bedroom balcony wincing as half a dozen spears of lightning crackled through the jet sky over the androscoggin river valley far below and to the south sterling incandesced eerily beneath the strobe a cannonade of thunder rumbled then exploded shaking the tall hillside aframe like a toy she tightened her robe and then tiptoed down the hall to check on the girls mercifully after two fitful hours battling the ghosts of the storm both were asleep lisette had never done well with thunderstorms herself and felt no small guilt at having passed those fears on to her children god how she wished frank would come to bed or at least talk to her it was nearly one in the morning and he was still downstairs in his den staring she knew at the embers in his fireplace and listening over and over to the album of morose progressive jazz he favored when he was angry at her and as usual she also knew he would take his own sweet time in telling her why it was the job the hospital that kept him so tense lisette felt certain of it for a yearno much longer than that now two at leasthe had been a bear to live with and with each passing week each passing month there seemed to be less and less she could do to please him silently she cursed the day he had closed his business in concord and moved back to sterling even if the little electronics firm was on the ropes to be sure his success with ultramed had given them more than she could ever have imagined but as she reflected on the dashing dreamer she had fallen in love with and married lisette told herself the price they were paying was far too high for a time she debated simply going to bed if she did of course frank would never come up he would spend the night on the sofa in his den and would be in his office at the hospital by the time she and the twins awoke with a sigh of resignation she stepped into her slippers and headed down the stairs there was no way she could outlast him she cared and he for the moment at least did not the situation was as simple as that chapter three garfield mountain junior olympic time trials sparkling like neon against the sunlit snow the crimson and white banner said it all from his spot at the base of the main slope frankie iverson squinted up at the giant slalom coursea rugged series of twodozen gates marked with red and blue flags one more run he told himself just one more run like the last and he would be on his way to colorado the trip the trophy evew thing after years of practice years of frustration they were so close now he could taste them next year will be yours the judge had told him during the agony and tears that had followed last years race next year tyler will be too old to compete and youll be number one tyler what a joke why couldnt his father understand that it was the shitty way the slope had been groomedthe goddamn ruts that had caught his skisthat had caused him to lose by half a second not tyler one more run hey frankie you sleeping or what startled frank whirled his brother zack wearing black boots and a black racing suit ambled toward him over a small mound of packed snow just studying the course zacko frank said as if you needed to you could ski backward and theres still no one in this field who could catch you frank jabbed a thumb toward the huge board where the times for the first run were posted you could zack laughed out loud make up three seconds on you when ive never once beaten you on a run youve got to be kidding listen all i want to do is stay on my feet and get that second place trophy therell be plenty of time for me next year when youre racing seniors sure zacko sure lay it on any thicker and ill slip on it since when did you get off thinking you could psych me and psyching he was too the little worm frank thought they were just about two years apart in age but zack had hit a growth spurt just after his thirteenth birthday and suddenly over the year that had followed the competition between them had intensified in all sportsespecially in skiing where the gap separating them had been narrowing all winter again frank glanced at the time board there was a wide margin between zack and the boy in third place the final run was a twoman race and his brother knew it as well as he did he was being psyched all right zack would be skiing second right after him and he was getting set to pull out all the stops listen frankie zack said with that note of sincerity that frank knew was a crock of shit i mean it ill try my best sure but ill be pulling for you too believe me i will he reached out his hand good luck frank looked at his brothers hand and then at his face there was something in zacks eyes that made him almost shuddera confidence a determination he had never seen in them before it was a look though that he knew wella look he had faced many times in the eyes of their father frank hesitated for a fraction of a second and then pulled off his glove and gripped zacks hand tightly go for it he said i will see you up top zack smiled at him nodded and wandered off to join a group of racers waiting for word that the second run was to begin frank glanced over at the crowd of parents preparing to make their way to vantage points along the course at that instant the judge who was chatting with several friends looked over frank smiled thinly and his father responded with a hearty thumbsup sign one more run restless to get it over with frank crossed to retrieve his skis from the rack where they and those of the other competitors were lined up on end like pickets in a fence he knew he was shaken by the brief encounter with his younger brother and by the look in his eyes and that knowledge upset him even more three seconds was a lot true but the way zack had been coming on over the past few weeks anything was possible for a moment frank even toyed with the notion of asking him to back off to wait his turn it wasnt fair he thought first that goddamn rut now this it was his year the judge had said so himself nothing was going to keep him from that trophy that tripnothing and no one he pulled his skis from the rack and ran his hand along the bottom testing the wax relax he pleaded with himself relax but keep that edge the judge is always talking about that winning edge it was then that he noticed zacks black rossignols resting in the slot next to where his own skis had been trancelike he set his skis back in their place and then took a coina dimefrom his pocket this would be his year next year would be zacks that was the way it was meant to be he glanced about no one was watching using the coin he loosened the toebinding screws on one of zacks skis two turnsnot enough to really feel different just enough to lessen control a bit to widen each turn a few inches to preserve his threesecond edge it was his year his last chance in fact he was doing zack a favor ensuring that should he fall the ski would come free and help keep him from a serious ankle injury but there would be no fall no injury just a few inches at each gate just a few fractions of a second just enough next year was time enough for zack then the judge would have two junior olympians to boast about it was the best way for everyone the way things were meant to be it was his year his year frank the colors and sensations of that day faded as lisettes voice nudged its way into the scene frank rubbed at his eyes and then pushed himself upright on the sofa the fire he had built against the chill of the summer storm had dwindled to a few smoldering embers his mouth tasted foul from the two scotchesor was it three he had buried and his head was pounding at the temples honey are you all right im fine he mumbled pawing at his eyes just great it had been years since he had had that nightmare years frank please come to bed its after onethirty im not tired you were sleeping i wasnt fucking sleeping i was thinking do you want anything some milk a sandwich i told you im fine just leave me alone it was going to be bad he thought he had fought the whole thing from the very beginning but he hadnt fought hard enough the last thing he needed in life was his brother moving back to sterling and now thanks to the judge and goddamn leigh baron here zack was and already playing hero he should have fought harder baron ran ultramed but davis was still his goddamn hospital and he should have fought harder frank honey lisette said you say youre fine but i know thats not true you havent said a decent word to me all night she tried to sweep his hair from his forehead but he brushed her hand aside then he crossed unsteadily to the hearth threw a log on the embers and jabbed at it with the poker that was quite a little show you put on this evening lisette he said thickly quite a little show i dont know what youre talking about really i dont oh give me a break i saw you standing back there mooning over my brother and im sure i wasnt the only one either honey thats crazy i never sure like you never made love with him either christ its a wonder you didnt rip your dress off right then and there in the kitchen frank please youve been drinking you only say things like that to me when youve been drinking what you know about me and zack is all there ever was nothing more and certainly nothing that didnt burn out years ago i was excited about what he did for annie but so was everyone besides that i didnt say three words to him all night now please come to bed let me rub your back or something you go to bed ill be up when im ready frank you believe me dont you i love you theres only one reason one explanation why he would have passed up all those bigtime job opportunities to come back here he said more to himself than to her one reason and thats to rub it in to me he splashed more scotch into his glass and downed it immediately frank please dont have any more to hes a vindictive son of a bitch lisette beneath that mellow dogooder image of his hes as vindictive as they come and whether he admits it or not hes got a score to settle for all those years he had to watch from the stands while everyone was cheering for me hes got points he wants to make with mom with the judge with everyone in this damn towneven you thats crazy yeah well well see whats crazy he stumbled against the side of the sofa and then dropped heavily onto it he can have this place the hospital the judge leigh baron all of it except youbut only when i say so only after ive done what ive set out to do only after his eyes closed and his head slumped to one side in seconds he was snoring lisette took a blanket and drew it over him it was the liquor talking nothing more by morning it would be a wonder if frank remembered anything of what he had just said he loved his brother just as he loved her and the twins he just wasnt very good at showing it that was all there was something tearing at himsomething that had nothing to do with zack only after ive done what i set out to do what in gods name had he meant by that silently vowing to do whatever she could to get her husband through whatever it was that had him so on edge lisette turned and headed back up the stairs chapter four the carter conference room of ultrameddavis refurbished by ultramed but originally donated to the hospital by the paper company was a large allpurpose space with deeppile carpeting a speakers table and podium at one end and seating for close to one hundred metalframed fullcolor lithographs of significant moments in medical history lined the room on either side and photographic portraits of past presidents of the medical staff filled the rear wall by the door beneath each portrait was a small gold plaque engraved with the officers name year of birth and year of death beneath those photographs of past presidents still living the date of birth had already been engraved followed by a hyphen and a ghoulishly expectant space it was seventhirty in the morning of wednesday july the medical staff usually met on the first thursday of the month but because of the holiday the staff had voted to hold its july session on wednesday instead the heated debate on the subject typical for any group of mds had taken up more than half of its june meeting forty physicians nearly the whole staff of ultrameddavis milled about the room some exchanging pleasantries or bawdy stories others obtaining curbside consultations from various specialists a few merely stood by a window staring wistfully at the brilliant summer day they would never have the opportunity to enjoy zack iverson sat alone toward the back of the room mentally trying to match the faces and demeanors of various doctors with their medical specialties gray crew cut red bow tie pediatrician fortyfour long sportcoat thirtyfourinch waist slightly crooked nose orthopedist and musing on his first two days in practice they had gone quite smoothly with a number of consultations in the office and several in the hospital he had even spent a brief stretch in the operating room assisting one of the orthopedists in the removal of a large calcium deposit that had entrapped a young carpenters right ulnar nerve at the elbow several times each day he had visited with annie who was progressing reasonably well in the coronary unit he had also discharged old chris gow after a day and a half of good nursing care and after arranging for social services to help him get medicare coverage physical therapy and one meal a day at home contrary to wilton marshfields dire prediction there had been no repercussions from frank or anyone else regarding the old mans hospitalization all in all they had been two interesting and rewarding daysthe sort that more than made up for medicines liabilities as a career this day however was the one zack had been awaiting it would start with his first major case in the o r the removal of a womans ruptured cervical discand it would end with dinner at suzannes he smiled to think of how misguided his apprehension about coming to sterling had been okay everyone find a seat the staff president a pale doughy internist named donald norman called out the order as he handshook his way to the front of the room norman had interviewed zack twice on behalf of ultramed and it was actually in spite of the man and those two sessions that zack had decided to come to davis at all a graduate of one of the medical schools in the caribbean norman had been subsidized and trained at ultramed hospitals and was a company man right down the line his portion of the interviews had consisted of little more than a mirthless litany of ultramed procedural and medical policies each accompanied by a set of statistics justifying the guideline as beneficial to the welfare of both patient and hospital while norman hailed the streamlined corporate approach as revolutionary and unquestionably necessary zack wondered if it amounted to a sort of gentrification of health care and he made no points whatever with the man by saying so to make matters worse between the two of them zacks spontaneity and relaxed eclectic approach to medicine sat poorly with norman who though no more than a year or two older than zack wore a threepiece suit smoked a curved meerschaum and generally conducted himself like some sort of aging medical padrone in the end with zacks decision still very much in the air several of the other physicians on staff managed to convince him that ultrameddavis was far more flexible in its policies and philosophy than donald norman liked to believe norman took his place at the front table and gaveled the meeting to order with the underside of an ashtray during the secretarys treasurers and committees reports several latecomers straggled in including suzanne looking lithe and beguiling in sandals and a floralprint dress she was accompanied by jason mainwaring who zack noticed in spite of himself wore no wedding ring although he did sport a sizable diamond on one little finger the two took seats on the opposite side of the room and continued a whispered conversation during which the charismatic general surgeon touched her on the arm or hand at least half a dozen times zack spent a minute or two trying unsuccessfully to catch her eye and then gave up and turned his attention to the meeting any additions or corrections to the committee reports norman was saying if not they stand accepted as read old business one hand went up accompanied by low groans from several parts of the room yes dr beaulieu norman said taking no pains to mask the annoyance in his voice from his seat five or six rows in front of zack guy beaulieu stood looked deliberately about the room and finally marched up to the speakers podiuma move that prompted several more groans zack who had not seen beaulieu in three or four years was struck by the physical change in the man once energetic and robust he was now almost pathologically thin his suit was illfitting and his gaunt face had a sallow grayish cast still he held himself rigidly erect as had always been his manner and even at a distance zack could see the defiant spark behind his goldrimmed bifocals thank you mr president beaulieu began with a formality that probably would have sounded unnatural and patronizing coming from most in the room but coming from him did not his speech still bore an unmistakable frenchcanadian flavor especially his th diphthongs which sounded more like ds i know that many of you are becoming a bit weary with my monthly statements on behalf of those who are not being cared for by this institution as well as against those of you who have slandered my name in this community well i promise you that this will be the last in that series so if you will just bear with me he removed a couple of sheets of yellow legal paper from his suitcoat pocket and spread them out on the podium once again there were muted groans from several spots in the room zack glanced over at jason mainwaring who now sat motionless staring impassively at the man at that moment suzanne turned and caught his eye zack waved a subtle greeting with three fingers and she nodded in return she seemed even at a distance to be preoccupied i would like to inform the medical staff of ultrameddavis hospital beaulieu read adjusting his bifocals that i have retained the concord firm of nordstrom and perry and have filed a classaction suit against this hospital its administration its medical staff and the ultramed hospitals corporation on behalf of the poor and uninsured people in the ultrameddavis treatment area i am being joined in this effort by a number of present and former patients who fall into that group including mr jean lemoux mr ivan macgregor and the family of mme yvette coulombe the charges which include unlawful and callous discharge from the hospital improper patient transfer and refusal to treat are currently under review by legal assistance of new hampshire who have promised a decision in the next two weeks as to whether or not they will join our effort as i have said many times before sound compassionate medical care is a right of all people not a privilege the attitude of this facility has over the past three years become one of why should you get health care just because you are sick we intend to fight that policy zack glanced around the room and catalogued myriad reactions among the physicians few if any of them seemed sympathetic and none of them appeared very threatened or upset some were openly exchanging looks and gestures of disgust and one was actually circling a finger about one ear there are a few docs out there beating the bushes for a job because they thought the same thing iverson wilton marshfields warning against bucking the ultramed system echoed in zacks thoughts as he studied the sea of blank and disapproving expressions suzannes he noted fell vaguely in the second group beaulieu too paused and looked about but then he continued as if unperturbed in addition to the charges outlined above we shall document a progressive and unethical blurring of the distinction between medical suppliers and providers to the point where the care of patients throughout and without this facility is being compromised we have evidence to back up our position and every day we acquire more it is my hope that those on the medical staff who have information which will further substantiate our claims will come forward and present such information to me or to our attorney mr everett perry i assure you that all such disclosures will be kept in the strictest confidence the man for all of his crustiness as the judge had put it had guts zack acknowledged again he scanned the room guts yes but not a speck of visible support finally beaulieu read on i would like to announce that i personally have initiated legal action against a member of this staff as well as against the administration of this hospital who are i believe responsible for the slanderous inaccurate and highly damaging rumors regarding my personal and professional conduct i call upon any physician who has knowledge of this matter to come forward again i promise strictest confidence remember there but for the grace of almighty god go any one of you i thank you for your patience and would welcome your questions and comments not a hand was raised beaulieu nodded in a calm and dignified manner and then returned to his seat apparently unmindful of the many annoyed and angry expressions that were fixed on him the staff meeting proceeded uneventfully at the end of new business zack was formally introduced and welcomed with brief measured applause sensing that some verbal acknowledgment of the greeting was called for he stood up thank you all very much he began it feels great to be home again and to be on the medical staff of the hospital in which i was born as dr norman noted in introducing me in addition to my neurosurgical practice i shall try to function as a medical neurologist until we are large enough and lucky enough to get one of our own it is my hope to care for all those who need help in my area of expertisehe glanced over at guy beaulieuregardless of their ability to pay i would also like to thank our radiologists drs moore and tucker as well as my brother frank for their work in obtaining our ct scanner its a beautiful piece of equipment and both radiologists have gone out of their way to become versed in its use sometime soon the three of us plan to present some sort of workshop on the interpretation and limitations of the technique since my nearest backup is close to a hundred miles away ill be on twentyfourhour call except during my vacation which is scheduled from august third through august fifth three years from now thank you there was laughter and applause from around the room oh one more thing zack added as the reaction died away i expected there might be some unusual problems arising from my decision to return and set up shop in the town where i was born and raised so id like to make it perfectly clear that there is absolutely no truth to the rumorstarted i believe by dr blunt over there who delivered me and was my pediatricianthat i wont go into the operating room without the oneeyed teddy bear i insisted on clinging to during his examinations suzanne with jason mainwaring in tow caught up with zack in the corridor zack hi she said thanks for the laughs in there have you met jason i think briefly a few months ago zack said shaking the surgeons hand nice to see you again same here mainwaring said in a pronounced drawl that was a cute little speech iverson i was especially partial to the line about the teddy bear thanks zack said wondering if the man was being facetious i even liked that other one about your next vacation being so far away youre a funny man thanks again however the surgeon continued i would caution you against makin any more inflammatory statements about this beaulieu business until you know all the facts ysee iverson im the staff member beaulieu alluded to in therethe one hes suin and noble as you tried to sound in your little pronouncement there you and beaulieu arent the only ones who do charity work i operate on plenty of folks who cant pay too zack was startled by the mans rudeness well he said im glad to hear that i only hope they get their moneys worth you know mainwaring countered ive always heard that only the most arrogant and sadistic surgeons elect to spend their professional lives suckin on brain hey guys what is this suzanne cut in this sounds like the sort of exchange you both should have put behind you when you climbed down from your tree houses and started high school jason whats with you were you attacked in your crib by a mad neurosurgeon or something mainwaring smiled stiffly my apologies iverson he said he extended his hand but shielded from suzanne the hostility in his eyes was lcy hey no big deal jason no big deal good well then well have to see what we can do about drummin up a little neurosurgical business for yall thanks meanwhile you might try to steer clear of politics around this placeat least until youve been here long enough to learn everyones name he checked his gold rolex suzanne dear i believe we still have time to complete our business nice to see you iverson im sure youll make the adjustment to this sleepy little place just fine without waiting for a response he took suzannes arm and strode down the hallway andy omeara redcheeked beerbellied and beaming strolled among the tables of gillies mountainside tavern shaking hands and exchanging slaps on the back with the twenty or so men enjoying their midday break in the smoky warmth over nearly twenty years he had come to know each and every one of them well and was proud to call them his friends andy o you old fart welcome back hey its mighty mick way to go andy way to go we knew youd beat it first the cards and candy and flowers when he was in the hospital and now this welcome back they were a hell of a bunch the very best and at that moment as far as andy omeara was concerned he was the luckiest man alive tomorrow would be independence daythe day for celebrating the birth of freedom and this day was one for celebrating his own rebirth hey gillie he called out the lilt of a childhood in kilkenny still coloring his speech suds around on me after three months of pain and worry after more than a dozen trips to manchester for radiation therapy after sitting time and again in the doctors office waiting for the other shoe to fall waiting forthe news that we cant get it all he was back on the road cured the bowel cancer that had threatened his very existence was in some jar in the pathology department at ultrameddavis hospital and whatever evil cells had remained in his body had been burnt to hell by the amazing xray machines the backseat and trunk of his green chevy were once again filled with the boxes of shoes and boots and sneakers that he loved to lay out for the merchants along route and the rhythm of his life had at last been restored to the luck of the irish he proclaimed as he hoisted the frosted mug over his head and to you andy o gillie responded were glad to have you back among the living andy omeara exchanged handshakes and hugs with each man in the place and then set his halffilled tankard on the bar it was his first frosty in more than twelve weeks and with a full afternoon of calls ahead of him there was no sense in putting his tolerance for the stuff to the test he settled up with gillie and stepped out of the dim pinepaneled tavern into the sparkling afternoon sunlight he prided himself on never being late for a call and colsons factory outlet was nearly a thirtyminute drive through the mountains he switched on the radio kenny rogers was admonishing him to know when to hold and know when to fold the countrywestern music usually andys staple seemed somehow out of keeping with the peace and serenity of this day at the edge of the driveway he stopped and changed to a classical program on wevo the public station better he thought much better the tune was familiar almost instantly it conjured up images in andys mindsoftly falling snow a stone hearth a roaring fire family as he hummed along andy tried to remember where he had heard the haunting melody before what child is thiis who laid to reest in marys laap lay sleeeeping he surprised himself by knowing many of the words this thiis is christ the kiing whom shepherds guaand and angels sing it was the christmas carol he suddenly realized that was it as a i child in ireland it had been one of his favorites how strange to hear it in the middle of summer he paused to let a semi roar past the noise of the truck was muted almost as if it made no sound at all andy shrugged as wonderful as it felt to be back on the road again it also felt a little odd haste haaste to bring him lauallaud the baabe the soon of mary he closed the windows turned on the air conditioner and swung out of the drive onto route the green of the mountainside seemed uncomfortably bright he squinted then rubbed at his eyes and wondered if perhaps he should stop someplace to pick up a pair of sunglasses no he decided no stops at least not until after colsons settle down old boy he said to himself just settle down he adjusted the signal on the radio and settled back in his seat humming once again route was two lanes wide with a narrow breakdown space on either side it twisted and turned rose and dropped like an amusement park ride from groveton on the vermont border along the ridge of the ammonoosuc river valley to sterling and route a scarred low white guardrail paralleled the road to andys right and beyond the rail was the gorge at places seven hundred feet deep andys restless illatease sensation was intensifying and he knew he was having difficulty concentrating he adjusted his seatback and checked his safety harness the guardrail had become something of a blur and the solid center line kept working its way beneath his left front tire he tightened his grip on the wheel and checked the speedometer fortyfive why did it feel like he was speeding subtly he noticed the trees on the mountainside had begun to darkento develop a reddish tone he rubbed at his eyes and once again forced the sedan back to the righthand lane twentyfive years on the road without an accident he was damned if he was going to have one now ahead of him the scenery dimmed a tractor trailor approached sunlight sparking brilliantly off its windshield suddenly andy was aware of a voice echoing in his minda deep slow resonant reassuring voice at first too soft to understand then louder and louder still okay andy it said now all i want you to do is count back from one hundred count back from one hundred count back from one hundred out loud andy began to count one hundred ninetynine ninetyeight a blue drape drifted above him then floated down over his abdomen ninetyseven ninetysix e hands covered by rubber gloves appeared in the space where the drape had been ninetyfive ninetyfour why arent i asleep his mind asked ninetythree ninetytwo bove electrode please the low voice said set it for cut and cauterize another pair of gloved hands appeared one of them holding a gauze sponge and the other a small rod with a metal tip slowly they lowered the metal tip toward his belly ninetyone ninety suddenly a loud humming filled his mind the metal tip of the rod touched his skin just below his navel sending a searing electric pain through to his back and down his legs jesus christ stop andy screamed im not asleep im not asleep the wall of his lower abdomen parted beneath the electric blade exposing a bright yellow layer of fat eightynine eightyeight for gods sake stop its not working im awake i can feel that i can feel everything metzenbaums and pickups please no please no the metzenbaum scissors sheared across andys peritoneum parting the shiny membrane like tissue paper and exposing the glistening pink rolls of his bowel again he screamed but this time the sound came from his voice as well as from within his mind his vision cleared at the moment the right headlight of his automobile made contact with the guardrail the chevy now traveling at nearly ninety miles an hour tore through the protective steel as if it were cardboard crossed a narrow stretch of grass and gravel and then hurtled over the edge of the gorge strapped to his seat andy omeara watched the emerald trees flash past in the fourth second of his fall he realized what was happening in the fifth the chevy shattered on the jagged rocks below and exploded ill the cafeteria of ultrameddavis like most of the facility had been renovated in an airy and modern though quite predictable style the interior featured a large wellprovisioned salad bar and a wall of sliding glass doors opened onto a neat flagstone terrace with a halfdozen cement tables and benches pleasantly exhausted from his threehour cervical disc case zack sat at the only table partially shaded by an overhanging tree and watched as guy beaulieu maneuvered toward him through the lunchtime crowd during the summer zack had spent as an extern at the then davis regional hospital beaulieu had been extremely busy with his practice and with his duties as president of the medical staff still the man always seemed to have enough time to stop and teach or to reassure a frightened patient or to console a bereaved family and from that summer on the surgeons blend of skill and compassion had remained something of a role model for zack so beaulieu said as he set down his tray and slid onto the stone bench opposite zack thank you for agreeing to dine with me nonsense zack replied ive been looking forward to seeing you ever since i got back to town how is your wife doing and marie clothilde bless her heart is as good as can be expected considering the filthy stories she has had to contend with these past two years and as for marie as you may have heard she grew weary waiting for you to propose and went ahead and married a writera poet of all thingsfrom quebec zack smiled he and marie beaulieu had been friends from their earliest days in grammar school but had never been sweethearts in any sense of the word knowing marie im sure hes very special he said you are correct if she could not have you then this man luc is one i would have chosen for her in an age when most young people seem to care for nothing but themselves he is quite uniqueconsumed by the need to make a difference he works for a village newssder and crusades against all manner of social injustice while he waits for the world to discover his poems kids they have two children and i dont know how on earth they manage to feed them but manage they do and theyre happy zack said yes poor and crusading but happy and as in lovemore so perhapsthan on the day they were married zack held his hands apart cest tout ce que conte nest ce pas beaulieus smile was bittersweet yes he said that is all that matters he paused a beat for transition so your old friend guy beaulieu is a little short of allies in this place so it sounds zack said picking absently at his salad beaulieu leaned forward his eyes and his voice conspiratorial there is much going on here that is not right zachary he whispered some of what is happening is simply wrong some of it is evil zack glanced about at the newly constructed west wing at the helipad at the clusters of nurses and doctors enjoying their noontime breaks on the terrace and inside the cafeteria youll understand i hope if i say that i see little evidence of that around me could you be more specific your father spoke to you yes briefly so you know about the lies i know something of the rumors if thats what you mean beaulieu leaned even closer zachary i beg your confidence in this matter that goes without asking zack said but i have to warn you of something the judge on sunday and you again this morning suggested that at least some of your quarrel might be with frank you should know that i have absolutely no desire to take sides in that disagreement your friendship means a great deal to me i dont know if id even be a surgeon today if it werent for your influence but franks my brother i cant imagine lining up against him even if he was in the wrong in my experience guy right and wrong are far more often shades of gray than black and white besides i tried my hand at crusading during my years at boston muni all it got me was a tension headache the size of alaska i should have bought stock in tylenol before i took my first complaint to the muni administration ill listen if you want to talk but please dont expect anything thank you for the warning beaulieu said even though i have a great fondness and respect for you and even though as you no doubt gathered i havent much support around this place i was reluctant to share with you what i know largely because of frank but then when you said what you did at the meeting this morningi mean about treating anyone regardless of their ability to paywell i sort of took that as an invitation to talk zack sighed you thought correctly he said finally i fight it tooth and nail but when im not looking the part of me that cant stand seeing people get screwed always seems to sneak to the surface yes i heard what you did for that old woodcutter the other night you did dont be so surprised this hospital this entire town in fact has a communication system that would make the department of defense green with envy you had best accept that fact and adjust to it if youre going to survive here drop a pebble in the lake and everyonebut everyonewill feel the ripple thats why stories such as those that have been spread about me are so damning in no time at all everyone has heard a version like that old gametelephone pardon its a party game we used to play every one sits in a circle and the first person whispers a secret to the one next to him then the secret goes all around the circle and by the time it gets back to the one who started it it has totally changed it bothers me terribly to think that anyone would deliberately be doing anything to hurt you especially making the sort of accusations the judge says have been flying around they are lies you know zachary every last one of them zack studied the frenchmans facethe set of his jaw the dark sadness engulfing his eyes i know old friend he said at last i know they are so beaulieu tapped his fingertips together deciding where to begin what did you think of my little prepared statement this morning he asked finally well the truth is i thought you handled yourself and expressed yourself very well beaulieu smiled diplomatically put my boy but please continue and remember my feelings are quite beyond being hurt zack shrugged okay if you really want to know the truth i kept thinking that all that was missing from the whole scenario was a horse a lance a shavingbowl helment and sancho panza this time the older surgeon laughed out loud so you think i am tilting at a windmill is that it well my young friend let me give you a closer look at that windmill richard noulombe do you know him the pharmacist of course i know him i called in a prescription him just yesterday and did you know that he does not own his pharmacy anymore the sign says coulombe drug i know what the sign says i also know that richard is now an employee and not a proprietor he sold his store nearly two years ago to a chain outfit named eagle pharmaceuticals and surgical supplies i do not know how that particular deal with that particular company was brought about but i can guess now that it was no accident richard did not want to sell but he needed the money to pay an enormous debta hospital bill and a surgeons bill zacharyrun up by his wife now his late wife yvette during a series of cancer operations beaulieu chewed on a bite of sandwich as he gauged zacks reaction did you perform the operations zack asked the surgeon shook his head the coulombes had been my patients for many years but shortly before yvette began having symptoms the rumors about me began circulating like most of the other people in town they decided or were toldim still not exactly certain whichto go and see jason mainwaring instead they were also told that their insurance coverage was quite limited but that barring complications most of yvettes bills would be covered but complications there were four separate operations all of them indicated and due to unforeseeable circumstances as far as i can tell but four nonetheless then there was a protracted stay in the sterling nursing home in fact yvette never did return home before she died and of course there were more bills for that i get the picture actually beaulieu said gravely you havent gotten the picture at all yet you see ultramed corporation not only owns our hospital it now owns both nursing homes in town as well did you know that no zack said no i didnt the corporate name is the leeward company they own nursing homes and rehabilitation centers all over the east and midwest and about three years ago they purchased the two here in sterling but what not so many people know including me until just a few months ago is that leeward is a division of ultramed bought out by them precisely four years ago the bills for all three institutionsultrameddavis and the two nursing homesare actually spit out of the same computer im not going to tell you whos in charge of that computer but you can guess if you wish i dont have to zack said wondering why frank had never mentioned the purchase of the nursing homes to him coulombes story is a very sad one especially with the unfortunate outcome for his wife but i see nothing evil or even immoral in it that is because you are missing a piece of the puzzle beaulieu said a crucial piece and remember he added what i am about to reveal to you is just the tip of the iceberg go on zack said wishing now that the man would not beaulieu pulled a folded typed sheet from his jacket pocket smoothed it out on the table and slid it across to zack as i mentioned before he said i do not have too many allies in my little crusade but i do have some one of them has spent nearly six months traveling from place to place trying to gather information for me just last week he came up with this its a list of the boards of directors of two companies zack scanned the parallel lists of names headed simply r and epss five of the ten names on each list were identical what do these letters stand for he asked the fire in guy beaulieus eyes intensified the r stands for riata of boston the megaglomerate that owns ultramed in a sense they are our bosses zachary yours mine and every other doctors in town and the other the other my friend stands for eagle pharmaceuticals and surgical suppliesthe corporation that bought out richard coulombe their boards of directors interlock beaulieu illustrated his point by sliding the fingers of one hand between the fingers of the other before he could respond zack saw movement at the corner of his eye he slid the paper onto his lap at the instant a shadow fell across the table he and beaulieu looked up frank smiling benignly stood not five feet away from them holding a tray of food are you gentlemen having a hearttoheart he asked or do you have room at the table for one more carefully zack folded the sheet of paper and slid it into his pocket although he sensed the move was a fruitless one frank had heard at least part of their conversation of that he was almost certain a bach fugue was playing on the small cassette deck by the sink barbara nelms staring glumly at the bathroom mirror ran a finger over the furrows in her forehead and the crows feet at the corners of her eyes the creases had it seemed appeared overnight instinctively she reached for her makeup kit then just as quickly she snapped off the tape turned and walked from the bathroom if she was bonetired if she was stressed close to the breaking point if frustration and fear had aged her six years in six months why in the hell should she try to hide it anymore the product of a perfectly uncomplicated unbringing in dayton ohio and four idyllic years as a business and marketing major at tiny st marys college in missouri she had always prided herself on being a model parent wife citizen and member of society she was a registered democrat a voting republican an officer in the pto three years running a scout leader a reader at church a better than average pianist and tennis player and at least according to her husband the best lover a man could ever want but now after six months of haggard guidance counselors and harried school resource workers of evasive pompous behavioral psychologists and bewildered pediatricians none of that mattered she had dropped off all committees hadnt picked up a tennis racket in weeks and couldnt remember the last time she and jim had had sex something was wrong terribly wrong with her son and not only could none of the socalled specialists they had seen diagnose the boys problem but each seemed bound and determined to convince her that it fell in someone elses bailiwick the violent episodes occurring at first monthly but now almost once a week had enveloped toby in a pall of melancholy and fear so dense that he no longer smiled or played or even spoke except for occasional monosyllables in answer to direct questionsand then only at home situational depression delayed autism childhood schizophrenia developmental arrest with paranoid ideation acting out for secondary gain the labels and explanations for tobys condition were as variedand as unacceptableas the educators and clinical specialists who had applied them the boy was sick and he was getting sicker he had lost nearly ten pounds from a frame that had not an ounce of fat to begin with he had stopped growing he had failed to satisfy the requirements for promotion to the fourth grade he avoided interacting with other children he had been given vitamins antidepressants thorazine ritalin special diets she had taken him to concord and then to boston where he had been hospitalized for four days nothing not a single objective clue if anything he had returned from the medical mecca even more uncommunicative than before now as she prepared to drag her son to yet another specialistthis one a young psychiatrist new in town named brookingsbarbara nelms felt the icy alltoofamiliar fingers of hopelessness begin to take hold tobys episodes at first seemed like horrible nightmares several times she had actually witnessed them happenwatched helplessly as her sons eyes widened and grew glassy as he withdrew into a corner drifting into a terrifying world he would share with no one she had listened to his cries and had tried to hold him to comfort him only to be battered about the head and face by his fists in the end there was nothing she could do but stay close try her best to see that he didnt hurt himself and wait sometimes the episodes would last only half an hour sometimes much longer than that always they would end with her son mute cowering and totally drained perhaps this will be the day she said to herself perhaps this man brookings the first fulltime psychiatrist in the valley would have the answer but even as she focused on this optimistic thought even as she buttoned her blouse and smoothed the wrinkles she should have ironed from her skirt even as she went to her sons room to fetch him for yet another evaluation at yet another specialists office barbara nelms knew that nothing would come of it nothing perhaps except another label and time she also knew was running out the drive from their house to the ultrameddavis physicians and surgeons clinic took fifteen minutes for most of the ride barbara nelms kept up a determined conversation with her sona conversation that was essentially a monologue this doctors name is brookings toby hes new in town and he specializes in helping people with attacks like yours were going to get to the bottom of this honey were going to find out whats wrong and were going to fix it do you understand toby sat placidly hands folded in his lap and stared out the window it would make it easier for dr brookings to do his job if you would talk to himtell him what it is you see and feel when you have the attacks do you think you can try and do that toby please answer me will you try and talk to dr brookings almost imperceptibly the boy nodded thats good honey thats wonderful we all just want to help no ones going to hurt you barbara nelms thought she saw her son shudder at those words she swung her station wagon into one of the few spaces left in the crowded parking lot locked her door and then walked around the car to let toby out it was a promising sign that he had unbuckled his safety belt himself instantly hope resurfaced perhaps this would be the day the only other time she and toby had been in the ultrameddavis physicians and surgeons clinic was for a brief followup visit with dr mainwaring tobys pediatrician worked out of an old victorian house on the north side of sterling a directory framed by two large ficus trees in the gleaming tiled lobby listed two dozen or so doctors along with their specialties phillip r brookings md child and adult psychiatry was on the second of the three floors toby do you want to take the stairs or the elevator honey i promise you dr brookings just wants to talk now which will it be okay well take the stairs then barbara took his hand and led him up the stairs half wishing he would react make some attempt to pull away he was plastic emotionless still she could tell he was completely aware of what they were doing a small plaque by the door to room read p r brookings md ring bell once and enter the waiting room was small and windowless with textured wallpaper an array of blackandwhite photographs of mountain scenes and seating for only four at one side was a small childrens play area consisting primarily of dogeared highlights magazines multicolored building blocks and puzzles none of which barbara knew toby would be interested in she ached at the image of her son before it all began huddled on the floor with his father pouring excitedly over his erector set no daddy this way turn it this way see at precisely three oclock phillip brookings emerged from the inner office introduced himself stiffly to her with a handshake and to toby with a nod he looked even younger than she had anticipatedno more than thirtytwo or three she guessed although his thick moustache made it hard to tell as so often had happened over the preceding months barbara found herself wondering if she had aged so much or if doctors were actually getting younger so he said taking one of the two remaining empty chairs welcome to my office toby i appreciate your coming to see me and i hope we can help you to feel better he wore a buttondown shirt and tie but no jacket and barbaras initial impression despite his youth was positive if nothing else he had started off on the right foot by not talking down to the boy she glanced over at toby who sat gazing impassively at the photos on the wall heres the medical history form you sent us dr brookings she said passing the paper over you have the other reports i sent you brookings nodded and briefly scanned the sheet i think he said that if it is all right with toby i would like to speak with him alone in my office what do you say toby we can keep the door open if you want okay he stood up and stepped back to the doorway of his inner office are you coming go ahead honey barbara urged ill be right here remember what i said theres nothing to be afraid of slowly toby rose from his chair wonderful brookings said come in come in silently but with every fiber barbara nelms cheered her son on he was being more cooperative more open to this man than he had been to anyone she had taken him to in some time perhaps at last he was ready perhaps she watched as brookings disappeared into his office from where she sat directly opposite the doorway she could see a roomy comfortably furnished office with a large picture window and plants arranged on the floor and hanging from the ceiling go on darling go ahead in its okay its okay after a brief hesitation toby followed brookings in then after a single tentative step inside the door he stopped his gaze riveted on the broad picture window across from him come in toby barbara heard brookings say im not going to hurt you barbara could see tobys body stiffen his hands which had been hanging lifeless at his side began to twitch dear god she thought hes going to have an attack right here right now toby are you all right brookings asked toby took several backward steps into the waiting room his face chalk white his eyes still fixed on the window honey whats wrong barbara felt her muscles tense no one but she and her husband had ever witnessed one of the attacks before frightened as she was she sensed a part of her was actually grateful for what was about to happen at least someone else would know what they had been going through all these months instinctively she glanced about for any objects on which toby might hurt himself then suddenly the boy turned threw open the outer office door and raced out into the hall toby barbara and brookings who had come out of his office called out in unison the psychiatrist was across the waiting room and out the door before she had left her seat barbara reached the corridor just as he disappeared through the stairway door her pumps were almost impossible to run in at the head of the stairs she kicked them off and skidded down to the first floor falling the last three steps and skinning her shin as she limped into the lobby barbara heard the horrible screech of an automobiles tires and froze anticipating the sickening thump of the car hitting her son there was none instead through the glass doorway she saw him weaving through the parking lot running as she had not seen him do in many months phillip brookings was a dozen yards behind and closing barbara raced across the drive narrowly avoiding being hit by a car herself toby stop please stop the boy had made it beyond the parking lot and was sprinting across a stretch of thirtyorso yards of lawn toward the dense woods beyond brookings was now no more than a few steps behind him with only a yard or two to go before the forest the psychiatrist launched himself in a flying tackle catching toby at the waist and hauling him down heavily thank god barbara panted hurrying across the parking lot this was the first time in all of his attacks that toby had done anything like this even at a distance she could tell that although he was pinned beneath the physician toby was struggling as she neared she could see his efforts lessen toby stop that she heard brookings saying firmly but gently stop fighting me and ill let go barbara approached cautiously expecting to see the familiar lost glassy terror in her sons eyes what she saw instead was a fierce hot mix of anger and fear it was almost as if he were snarling at the man carefully brookings pushed himself away although he still maintained a grip on the boys belt as barbara knelt beside her son she realized that this was not one of his attacks after allat least not a typical one he was awake and alert whatever had set him off was in this world not in the world locked within his mind toby are you all right she asked what happened what frightened you so the boy did not answer im going to let you go toby brookings said promise me you wont run again there was no response slowly brookings released his grip on tobys belt the boy still breathing heavily did not move what was it barbara asked pardon brookingss shirt and the knees of his tan trousers were stained with grass and he too had not yet caught his breath dr brookings toby saw something out your windowsomething that frightened him this wasnt one of his attacks she turned to her son it wasnt was it honey tears glistening in his eyes toby stared up at her then he shook his head can you tell us what it was this time there was no answer phillip brookings rubbed at his chin mrs nelms i dont know what to say i saw toby staring out my window and i followed his line of sight but there was no one there nothing nothing brookings shook his head just a big oak tree a parking lot and beyond it the emergency ward of the hospital nothing else im sure of it the emergency ward barbara nelms saw her son stiffen at the words toby was that it was it the emergency ward the boy remained mute dr brookings what would you suggest she asked can you help us the psychiatrist looked down at toby perhaps he said perhaps with time i can but i would like to insist on something before i begin anything i want toby to have a ct scan and a clean bill of health from a neurologist as near as i can tell from reviewing the material you sent me he has had neither correct i i guess so well if his attacks are some sort of seizure disorder i think a neurologist should be involved dont you doctor i told you when i first called were willing to do anything absolutely anything is there someone you can recommend brookings nodded theres a new man in town yale med trained at harvard hospitals hes a neurosurgeon actually but hes doing neurology as well his names iverson zachary iverson ill give him a call and then get back to you barbara stroked her sons forehead there was nothing in his expression to suggest he had followed any of their conversation for a moment studying the sunken hollows around his eyes and the tense waxy skin over his cheeks she felt as if she were looking at a corpse please doctor she said just one thing yes do it quickly brookings nodded and then rose and returned to his office barbara took her son by the hand and led him back to their car desperately she searched her thoughts for any unpleasantness or difficulty he had encountered at ultrameddavis or in any other emergency ward there was none nothing but a gashed chin when he was five and of course the incarcerated hernia operation last year but barbara nelms knewas the surgeon dr mainwaring had told herthat the whole hernia affair had been as routine as routine could be chapter five suzanne cole and her sixyearold daughter jennifer shared an isolated narrow twostory north of town with a fat yellow cat named gulliver because jennifer explained he likes to travel and a black labrador retriever who seemed oblivious to any name the rooms in the modest place were cluttered and warm snow shoes ski poles tennis rackets and even a pair of old stethoscopes hung on the smokedarkened pine walls interspersed with prints and original oils representing all manner of styles there was a franklin stove in the living room and a loom in one of the back bedrooms as well as a battered spinet mommy used to play a lot but now she can only play deep purple and dozens upon dozens of books the spaghetti dinner zack had been proudly informed was largely jennifers creation and she served it with a charm and enthusiasm that made almost as deep an impression on him as did her mother she was a tall girl for her age with an elegant nose straight auburn hair that hung midway down her back and suzannes magical eyes and smile she talked of school and animals and ballet and seemed quite pleased to show off her collections of rocks and stuffed animals in return zack had promised to introduce her to cheap dog and to teach her to fly his radiocontrolled plane he even completed a relatively smooth italianstyle thumb palm and transfer although when he was finished jennifer had smiled earnestly and said that one could use a little more practice zack i could see the coin by dessertchocolate brownies with ice creamwhat selfconsciousness he had arrived with had long since vanished and he found himself feeling more like a friend of the family than a guest e if there was an uncomfortable edge to the evening at all it was due to suzanne who seemed at times distant distracted and content to let jennifer keep the conversation afloat but unwilling to find any fault with the woman zack read into her mood swings an introspection and vulnerability that only made her that much more interesting and attractive she was returning to the table with some coffee when jennifer hopped up and announced that she was leaving to watch tv and wash her hair theres only one thing that troubles me the girl said as she shook zacks hand whats that well its your dog ive heard of sheep dogs but never a name like cheap dog well zack said theyre sort of the same thing from the corner of his eye he saw suzanne stop and lean against the wall watching you see i was walking on the beach one morning in a place called san diego do you know where that is in california zack nodded they have a great zoo out there and a killer whale who does advanced calculus and prepares his own tax returns well there was this man on the beachhe was mexican but he was sort of sleazy do you know that word well it means like sneaky not all mexicans are that way by any means but this guy sure was anyhow there he was with this big cardboard box and in the box were a bunch of puppiesscruffy little mongrel puppies he reached in and pulled this little fur ball up by the back of the neck like this and he held him up for me to see sefior he said how would you like to buy this leetle fellow i geeve you my word sefior he is purebred ol eengleesh cheap dog his papers are een my safe at home buy him now and i breeng them to you tomorrow si that means yes jennifer said si xs and you said si the three of them said the word together and laughed and thats how cheap dog got his name isnt there any old english sheep dog in him at all jennifer asked there must be some zack said because every time princess di or prince charles comes on the television he stands up thats silly she thought for a moment and then added i like that story again she formally shook zacks hand then she turned and raced up the stairs thanks again for dinner he called out after her i like that story too suzanne said after the footsteps overhead had died away and i really liked the way you talked to jen persontoperson not grownup to child no condescension and believe me she appreciated it too thanks that girl doesnt encourage anything approaching kid talk believe me suzanne nodded somewhat sadly shes had to do a lot of growing up in a fairly short time my marriage and divorce were a bithow should i sayturbulent oh for a moment she looked as if she might want to expand on the remark but then she shook her head fodder for another evening she said she chewed at her lower lip rested her chin on one hand and stared into her cup of coffee there was a sadness in her eyes but there was also zack observed something elsea restlessness perhaps a tenseness in the set of the muscles in her face and neck is anything the matter he asked suzanne hesitated and then pushed away from the table and stood up i think wed better call it a night she said i have a really busy day tomorrow and i have a lot of things to sort through before i go to bed youve been great companyfor both of usbut i guess i just need some time alone nonplussed zack glanced at his watch it was not yet quarter to eight thats it she shrugged and nodded for a few seconds it seemed as if she were about to cry im sorry zack she said finally but i guess this just wasnt a good night for me to be charming and entertaining god it seems like all i ever do around you is apologize well forgive me anyhow ill make it up to you some other time i promise she waited until he had stood up and then locked her arm in his and guided him across the screenedin porch and down the wooden front steps the subtle scent of her and the touch of her breast against his sleeve made his sudden dismissal that much more confusing and painful he shuffled along beside her wishing he were less inexperienced in understanding women and feeling totally inadequate and foolish for not knowing what to say at the camper she once again apologized for cutting their evening short and promised him a rain check good for one afterdinner conversation sometime very soon he reached for the handle and then stopped and turned back to her yes she asked eyeing him appraisingly as she had that first night suzanne i i know that somethings bothering you he heard himself say i only wanted to say that whatever it is i hope it comes the way you want he hesitated expecting her to thank him politely for his concern and send him on his way she did neither im afraid ive been guilty of not paying attention he went on i guess i was just too busy indulging my own fantasies look i just want you to know im glad weve met and im grateful as hell were becoming friends he opened the door to the van if you ever do want to talk about whatever it is im available no strings attached in fact for a modest fee ill even omit the coin tricks he moved to kiss her on the cheek but then thought better of it and climbed up behind the wheel of the camper zack wait a minute she called as he began to back away he stopped and leaned out the window theres a spot halfway up the hill behind the house where you can see almost the whole valley its really peaceful on an evening like this to sit up there and watch the lights of town wink on if youll give me a minute to check on jen and get a blanket and some wine id like very much to go up there with you its okay not to you know she smiled in a way she hadnt all evening i know she said the soft evening air was filled with the hum of cicada wings and the chirping of peepers and crickets for nearly an hour they lay side by side in the noisy silence watching the mountain shadows stretch out across the valley high overhead a solitary hawk glided in effortless loops its silhouette a dark crucifix against the perfect bluegray sky the girls in the o r said you did a beautiful job on that womans neck this morning suzanne said at last sipping at what little remained of a bottle of chardonnay you checked up on me of course i checked up on you do you think you have a corner on the attractiontosomeoneyou justmet market no he said trying to ignore the sudden pounding that seemed to be lifting his chest off the blanket i guess not technique high marks speed high marks looks high marks he grinned well im glad i made a decent first impression on the nurses after nine years in various o r s and all that time on rock faces theres not too much that rattles me this morning though ill admit i was a little nervous i can understand that doctors are always under a big magnifying glass of scrutiny but never the way we are during the first few months at a new hospital for a time after i arrived on the scene i felt sort of like a new haircut every one had to express an opinion the case you did is doing okay pain free for the first time in a year and moving all the parts that are supposed to move zack held up crossed fingers for her to see thats super you know im curious you seem like the type who would thrive on an innercity madhouse like boston muniall that action actually i loved that part of it but not just that there were so many cases and so much trauma to work on i loved the patientstalking with them getting a sense of their lives becoming important to them even growing into friendships with some of them but i never was comfortable with the pressure in big teaching hospitals to become the worlds expert in some little corner of neurosurgery suzanne nodded and if you dont play it that way she said then you end up being the worlds expert at being passed over for promotion exactly i also confess that i was getting a little tired of the political bullshitthe empire building and back stabbing having to grovel before a department head or administrator just to get a lousy piece of equipment that the hospital would have been able to purchase out of petty cash if it werent so damn inefficient so you thought corporate medicine would be more streamlinedmore responsive to the needs of the hospital and the patients thats what i thought you say that as if your opinions already changed zack propped his chin on his hands and stared out over the valley i dont know he said a few things have happened since i arrived here that his voice trailed away throughout the day he had more and more come to realize that there was no way he could discount guy beaulieus claims and if they were trueif ultramed or mainwaring or frank had conspired for whatever reason to drive the old surgeon out of practicethen the situation in sterling was more virulent more frightening more unacceptable than anything he had ever encountered at boston muni he also knew that if his old mentors concerns about the ethics and practices of ultramed proved accurate there would be no way he could walk away from the problem he had returned to sterling to practice the best possible neurosurgery in the best possible setting and that was that hey doc suzanne said do you know that that last sentence of yours never quite made it out of the womb he looked at her fodder for another evening he said i believe thats the established way out thats it charlie nuff said then suzanne rolled onto her side resting her cheek on one hand after a time she reached over and ran her fingers lightly over his face you really are quite handsome you know she said thanks i have trouble believing that especially having spent my life in the shadow of a man with franks looks but its nice to hear its nice to say zack cleared his throat which seemed to be getting drier and grittier with every passing moment he was at once reluctant to touch her and even more reluctant not to so he managed struggling to pull his thoughts from her perfect mouth what tale of crisis and resolution brought you to this place again she touched his face this time allowing her fingertips to linger on his lips i guess i didnt make the law of the mountain clear to you she said as long as were lying on my little overlook at the base of my mountain i get to ask the questions thats the law take it or leave it but what happens to those unfortunates like me who dont have a mountain her eyes and the very corners of that exquisite mouth formed the smile that was perhaps her most alluring in that case she said you must adopt one ill send you the paperwork in the morning and have our social worker come by for an interview as soon as possible meanwhile well save all that stuff from between the lines of my curriculum vitae until you get approved okay zack shrugged its your mountain exactly its my mountain do you think im too forward touching you like this no not forward maybe a little tough to read though considering that a couple of hours ago you were trying to rush me out of the house and down the hill ah she said but that was before you said the magic word oh of course the magic word how stupid of me why ive used that damned magic word approach so often its become automatic in fact it was so automatic this time that that ol magic word just slipped right past me she took his face in her hands and drew him toward her again as at the dinner table he saw a strange sadness in her eyes the magic word zachary was friend her kisses first on his eyes then around his mouth and finally over his lips were as sweet and warm as the mountain air for one minute two she held him her tongue exploring gently beneath his lips and then along his teeth and around the inside of his cheeks finally she drew away was that okay she asked zack swallowed hard there are at least a hundred words i would pick before settling for okay im glad you look a little bewildered though i suppose i owe you some kind of apologyor at least an explanationfor being so inconsistent zack ran his hand through her hair then down her back and over the seat of her jeans her body was fuller than connies but tighter and far far more exciting to touch you dont owe me anything he said shaw wrote that there are two tragedies in life one is not to get ones hearts desire and the other is to get it at the moment i think he was wrong about number two zack out by the camper before you said no strings attached does that promise apply if we make loveright here right now it applies he slid his hand beneath her blouse and over her breast her nipple hardened instantly to his touch whatevers going on i just want to make it better youre making it better she said again and again they kissed there was an urgency and hunger in her lips and her touch zack knew that it was the secret of her sadness that was driving her into his arms he knew that this night at least she needed him rather than loved him but this night at least it was more than enough she helped him slip off his shirt and nestled her face against the hair on his chest slowly she pleaded just make it last please just make it last zack undid the buttons of her blouse pausing between each one to kiss her lips and her wonderful breasts then eased off her jeans he worked his moistened fingertips over her nipples then down her belly along the edge of her soft hair and finally to the tense nubbin of her clitoris touch me here she murmured two fingers thats it oh god zachary thats it moment by moment what questions he had faded in the smoothness of her skin and in her craving for him with every touch every kiss he felt himself drawn closer to her he brushed his lips over her ankles and along the softness of her inner thighs and then he drew his tongue over her again and again she dug her nails into the skin of his back pulling him even more tightly against her dont stop oh dont stop yet she was an angelat once vulnerable and knowing chaste and worldly wise and making love with her was unlike anything zachary had ever experienced in his life she drew his face to hers as she eased him onto his back caressing him then sucking on him until he begged her to let up now zachary she whispered her lips brushing his ear youre so wonderful please do it now they made loveslowly at first and then more fervidly each immersed in the other each focused on pleasing rather than being pleased darkness settled in across the valley far below them the lights of sterling flickered like so many stars mirroring the expanse overhead zachary what time is it midnight a little after actually they were half dressed bundled in the blanket against a slight early morning chill the connection between them had already transcended their lovemaking and each minute every second it grew do you know she said that in my entire life i have never come like that what a wonderful rush he kissed her on the neck then on the lips it must have been that chardonnay yes of course she said buttoning her jeans how foolish of me to overlook that next time well have to try it without the wine a controlled experiment just to be sure my mountain she laughed your mountain it will be you know i keep saying it but you are really a very kind and very sweet man she kissed him lightly on the mouth i only hope youll still respect me in the morning believe it or not making love like this is a bit bevond my usual first date fare not to worry he said doing what one wants in situations like this is a payback for all of the headaches and responsibilities of having to be a grownup her expression darkened zachary id like you to know whats going onwhy ive been acting so weird all night well almost all night listen its perfectly all right if no i want to besides by tomorrow night youll know anyhow she rolled onto her back took his hand and guided it to her right breast the upper outer quadrant she said fairly deep it took his fingers only a moment to find the lumpa disclike mass the diameter perhaps of a half dollar and as hard as the sidewall of a tire which was to say too hard his first impulse was to reassure her to label the mass a cyst but he knew better there was without a biopsy absolutely no way to tell suddenly the whole nighther distraction her mood swings their passion everythingmade sense how long since you first felt this he asked he ached for what he now realized she was going through if at that moment the lump were offered as an exam question with only one correct answer he would have to call it trouble all the way down the line and so he knew would she a month six weeks now i guess she said theres been no change over that time mammograms were equivocal a needle biopsy came back normal breast tissue and rather than go through that procedure a second time i elected to go ahead with an excision and if necessary a modified radical when im going in tomorrow evening surgerys scheduled for friday morning and in case you couldnt tell im scared stiff he held her tightly im just grateful you didnt send me away tonight thats all youve made arrangements for jennifer my partner in the gallery is going to take her she has a son two years older than jen good its going to be okay you know suzanne nodded grimly just keep reminding me i tell you being a physician i just know too goddamn much and ill tell you something else no matter how much you read no matter how many donahue shows you watch the prospect of what might happen just doesnt compute its going to be okay he said again forcing conviction into his voice youve got a friend whos going to be with you all night tomorrow will they be doing the excision under local she shook her head no she said the anesthesiologist and surgeon both recommended general and frankly i was relieved whos the anesthesiologist pearl jack pearl good he did my case this morning hes a little on the weird side i think sort of like a character out of a gothic horror novel but he sure as hell knows what hes doing in the o r and the surgeon suzanne sighed its your friend from this morning she said jason mainwaring whatever you might think of him zack hes by far the best technician around so ive heard well i only hope his skill in the o r is more highly advanced than his skills in interpersonal relations oh it is in that case zack said weve only got one thing to worry about right chapter six frank iversons office was a spacious tworoom suite on the ground floor of the west wingthe newest addition to the hospital from his spot in one of three leather easy chairs zachary watched his brothers two secretaries go about their business with prim efficiency one of the women was dark with an air of sophistication and polish the other was blond and wholesome both were young well built and remarkably goodlookingfar beyond the runof themill in any setting but near goddesses by sterlings standards gorgeous secretaries a plush office bigmoney business deals a porsche a spectacular hillside aframethe man certainly had style zack mused and while that particular style was not one zack had ever really wished for himself frank had clearly come a hell of a long way from fraternity beer blasts fifty percent identical with each passing year it seemed the two of them were becoming less and less a validation of that genetic truth still there was a time zack knew when their drives and their goals were not nearly so divergent a time when the two brothers careened through their world along virtually parallel tracks guided only by the beacons of early success trophies ribbons medallions and adulation it had become something of a game for hima recurring daydream to imagine his life had he not fallen that winter day had the ligaments of his young knee not shredded accidents illness the violent uncaring acts of others the daydream as always led him to acknowledging how fragile life washow totaily beyond control a patch of ice the fraction of an inch and suddenly in one agonizing instant the blinders were stripped away from his protected view of life his unswerving track was transformed into a twisting rutted path negotiable only one uncertain step at a time zacks eyes closed as he drifted back to that day he was in a perfect spot racing after frank three seconds was a lot but nothing he couldnt have made upespecially with his brother being so uncharacteristically cautious on his second run and he wanted it he wanted it more than he would ever admit to anyoneeven he reflected to himself the colors the packed snow the sudden disappearance of the steady crosswind that had been blowing all dayit was a moment frozen forever in his memory the conditions were perfect for an upset for a demonstration to all that zachary iverson had suddenly come into his own the judge their mother and most of the town it seemed were gathered along the slope anticipating his run waiting beyond the red and blue pennants marking the slalom course was a wonderful trophy a savings bond a trip to the junior olympics and a huge piece of the praise and newsprint that he had watched being heaped on his older brother over the years it was time it was at last his moment his run he checked the course below no problems a few final seconds to mentally chart his line and he lowered his goggles and glided to the electronic starting gate then suddenly he stopped something was wrong something simply didnt feel right his boot the wax no he realized at the last possible second it was his skihis right ski somehow the binding on it had come loose he backed away and made the necessary adjustment on the screw cursing himself for not being more meticulous in his preparation in the first place the oversight could have been ruinous but now there was nothing to stop him it was his run and there was nothing but two minutes of skiing between him and colorado nothing that was except a small patch of ice zack shuddered and sensed his body recoil and stiffen as he relived some of the pain and helplessness of that fall the bouncing and tumbling over and over again down the matted slope the loose binding while never a factor had certainly been an omen dr iverson can i get you something some coffee it was one of franks bookend secretariesthe blonde scrubbed and sensual the prototypical farmers daughter the impotence and anguish lingered for a moment and then drifted away unconsciously zack rubbed at the stillhypersensitive scar that ran along his knee no he said hoarsely no thanks he checked the time just four oclock three fortyfive frank had said he had been quite specific about the time zack had a consultation waiting and a small stack of paperwork in his office suzanne was due to sign herself into the hospital in less than two hours the last thing in the world he needed at that moment was a meeting with frank however the invitation had been couched in words that made it difficult for him tobeg off even for a day the fifteenminute wait while very annoying was hardly surprising frank had never been one to pay too much attention to the schedules of others excuse me zack said to the secretary do you have any idea how much longer hes going to be the woman smiled blandly no dr iverson im sorry i dont but it shouldnt be too much longer mr iverson is on the line with the ultramed mainframe computer in boston he talks to it every day she sounded very proud to be working for someone who regularly talked to a mainframe computer are you sure you wouldnt like a cup of coffee or a coke zack shook his head what id like he said standing is to reschedule this appointment for a time when hes able to keep it just tell my brother to have me paged when hes through okay that wont be necessary old shoe franks voice boomed from the intercom on the blondes desk i was just calling annette to have her send you in the doors open no explanations no apologies zack wondered how long the intercom had been turned on the notion of being eavesdropped on did not sit well with him at all sit down sit down frank sang as zack closed the door behind him are you sure you dont want the girls to get you something a drink something to eat no thanks but go ahead if you want to the office was richly paneled a floortoceiling bookcase complete with a builtin bar and sound system covered one wall and a huge aerial photo of ultrameddavis filled much of another a computer keyboard and screen occupied only a portion of the massive mahogany desk that frank had once proudly described to him as a oneofakind honey frank himself seated in a highbacked brown leather chair and dressed in a tan linen suit silk tie and customtailored shirt looked as if he had just stepped off a page of gentlemans quarterly so he said sliding a box of slim cigars across the desk how goes zack slid the box back it goes fine frank the office okay perfect zacks office supplied and paid for by ultramed for one year with the strong possibility of a second year if all goes well was a neat threeroom space on the top floor of the ultrameddavis physieians and surgeons clinic word has it youve been doing a hell of a job in the operating thats nice to hear nice for both of us its not too many hospitals the size of this one that can claim a fulltime harvardtrained neurosurgeon and of course i come off looking like some sort of healthcare iacocca for recruiting you frank you didnt exactly beat down my door to get me to come nonsense i just had some some early misgivings thats all but the judge and the ultramed people helped me see the light and now im really happy with the way things are turning out youve been a real shot in the arm for the morale in this place i havent encountered any morale problems zack said sensing the word was something of an introduction to the real business at hand well we do our best to see that there are none frank replied and as you say we do pretty well at it but every once in a while something or someone pops up that threatens to polarize our ultrameddavis familyturn brother against brother as it were and you know what they say about a house divided right right frank so zacko speaking of houses hows your place oh for crying out loud zack wanted to shout this isnt some sleazeball business adversary you have to play cat and mouse with this is your brother just say what in the hell it is you want and lets get it over with instead he folded his hands together crossed his legs and settled back in his chair it was franks show the house is beautiful frank he said mechanically i dont know how you stumbled onto the place but im certainly glad you did he wondered where suzanne was at that moment what she was doing how she was feeling great frank said remember what i said about the basement full of extra furniture we have just come by and take what you want until you get your own stuff okay sure zack reminded himself that his brother for all of his straightup themiddlewithpower athletic skill had always been an expert at hidden agendas it was an art he had studied at the feet of a master their father if frank was operating true to form this small talk was anything but casual the rents pretty decent for a place like that yes zack laughed decent was far too tame a word the rent for his tiny apartment in boston had been three times what it was for the house which had a huge wooded lot two fireplaces and several times as much space as the apartment dont tell the realty company that owns it zack said but theyre getting killed on this deal i sleep with my lease under my pillow for fear someone will sneak in and take it away oh we wont frank said calmly we zack realized that the hidden agenda was about to surface ultrameddavis zack you see pine bough realty trust is a sort of well convenient way for the hospital to administer some property it owns hereabouts were your landlord frank beamed obviously delighted with the way he had delivered the news you know zack said now consciously working to keep his cynicism in check somehow that little piece of information doesnt altogether surprise me not that it would have made any difference frank but you could have told me when i rented the place that in addition to my salary my office my equipment and my insurance ultramed was providing the roof over my head frank shrugged this seemed like a more appropriate time tell me is it customary for a hospital to have such ahow should i sayproprietary role in a community i would use the word progressive frank smiled and winked you see zack the bottom line of this or any other business is money dinero the big d as he became immersed in his rhetoric he grew more excited and animated his gestures more professorial thats what the administrators and boards of directors of hospitals all over the country are just beginning to realize fortunately ultramed recognized it years ago eliminate nonprofitable programs and deadwood increase receivables and collections change the red ink to black no matter how and the rest takes care of itself if its real estate then its real estate if its other investments then its other investments colleges like harvard and dartmouth have some of the biggest stock portfolios and real estate holdings around why shouldnt hospitals follow their example i i dont know why they shouldnt zack said but give me time he was thinking and im sure i can come up with something the wedding of business and medicine was one with which he was simply not comfortableat least not yet he reflected on the new ct scanner the incredible opportunity he had been given by ultramed to set up a private practice the marriage he acknowledged deserved if not his blessing at least his open mind perhaps that was what his brother needed to hear you know frank he went on if i seem uncomfortable with some of this corporatemedicine stuff youve got to remember that ive spent the last eight years in a hospital where everything was always in incredibly short supply everything that is except for the dedication of the nurses and the doctors and the lovei guess there really isnt any better word for itthat they had for their patients im grateful to be in a situation like this believe me i am but there are some parts of those years i spent at muni that are hard to get out of my system frank i tell you there was something so pure about the kind of caring that went on in that grimy old place something so i dont know holy that many times patients seemed to get better when every medical factall the oddssaid they shouldnt does that make any sense frank held up his hands hey zacko he said that makes all the sense in the world thats what makes you such a valuable addition to the staff here so you just do the doctoring and let me worry about the politics and the ct scanners and such that way everyone benefits right dignity zack was thinking still immersed in his years at boston muni thats what it all boiled down to the dignity that came from being cared for with love and respect from being treated as something more than a credit or debit on a balance sheet he flashed on the tears glistening in the eyes of chris gow at the realization that someone cared enough to stand up for him regardless of the cost right frank asked again huh oh yes exactly good frank said then i can assume youll leave this beaulieu business to me what again zack warned himself not to drop his guard too low frank was and probably always would be the fiercest of competitors beaulieu sport hey are we on the same wavelength or not frank you havent said one word about well what in the hell else do you think weve been talking about ive let that business with the old man and wil marshfield slide by because i knew that you hadnt had time to learn the system around here but beaulieu is another story zack that man is on a vendetta because he thinks the hospitals to blame for his inability to maintain a surgical practice have you heard that kind of paranoid talk from anyone else around here no but every time someone new has come on the staff over the last few years beaulieu buttonholes him with wild claims and stories about how were railroading him out of business and how we forced richard coulombe to sell his pharmacy in order to pay his hospital bills christ im surprised he hasnt tried to tie us in with the fucking famine in ethiopia let me tell you something zack no one has to try and force guy beaulieu into retirement hes doing a perfectly adequate job of that all by himself and as for that coulombe crap of his ours wasnt the only debt the man had believe me he was in it up to here with everyone in town check it out yourself coulombe either sold that store or he spent the rest of his days in a courtroom but zack stopped himself at the last moment from breaking his promise to beaulieu by bringing up the connection between ultrameddavis and eagle pharmaceuticals and surgical supply he also found himself wondering if the former owner of the house he was ig renting had ever been a patient at the hospital but what frank demanded there was a sudden hardness in his eyes an edge to his voice nothing zack said forget it with his thoughts focused on suzanne and on problems at the office he was willing to do almost anything to avoid a clash forget it frank shook his head youre holding out on me zacko its written all over your face now whats going on i said nothing zack felt the skin tighten across the back of his neck some of what is happening is simply wrong some of it is evil guy beaulieus words his anger and his sadness took hold your old friend beaulieu is a little short of allies in this place all right frank zack suddenly heard himself saying you want to know whats wrong ill tell you what i believe guy thats what i listened to him and i looked in his eyes and i know hes telling the truth thats whats wrong i dont know if its ultramed or that pompous ass mainwaring or what and i sure as hell dont know why but i think beaulieu is being railroaded out of practice just like he says and if thats true then it pisses me off it pisses me off a lot and it makes me want to do whatever i can to help the man out there is that what i you wanted to hear frank laughed out loud then he lit up a cigar and sent a smoke ring swirling toward the ceiling lets just say its what i expected to hear he said you always were something of a bleeding heart zacka sucker for anybodys cause vietnam timmy goyettes supposedlystolen junior olympics entry fee womens rights not enough mashed potatoes in the school lunches give the boy a sob story and he gives you his guts and his allowance remember all that i sure do so why should guy beaulieu and his paranoid stories be any different right frank you can really be a bastard do you know that careful boy frank said launching another perfect ring thats your mother youre talking about besides this time youre wrong dead wrong what this is one cause youd best steer clear of brother beaulieus on his way off the plank and if youre hanging onto him when he goes then youre going to get awfully wet i promise you that he opened his desk drawer withdrew an envelope and slid it across ive been keeping this letter quiet because i still hoped beaulieu would back off now im afraid i have no choice but to present it to the ethics committee there are people on the staff who wanted to do something months ago to limit or cut off his privileges but i kept putting them off like the judge said the old guy did save my life here have a read the letter was handwritten and carried no heading other than the date june dear mr iverson i am writing to share with you some allegations against dr guy beaulieu by myself and several other nurses on the emergency ward over the past several months he has become increasingly inconsistent and indecisive in his dealings with patients he has been quite forgetful at times issuing the same set of orders more than once and at other times neglecting to order certain studies which we would consider routine and basic in addition on more than one occasion his speech has been slurred and his manner inconsistent enough to raise the question of drugs alcohol small strokes or some combination of the three fortunately his case load has been small enough so that no one has been harmedat least no one that we know of still we feel some sort of investigation and action is called for i would welcome the chance to meet with you and discuss this matter further meanwhile i feel you should have a talk with dr beaulieu sincerely yours maureen banas r n head nurse zack read and reread the letter in stunned silence trying to match the charges with the eloquent dedicated man he had listened to at the staff meeting and later over lunch there was nothing in beaulieus manner speech or the content of his words that bore out the nurses claims still there was no way such charges could be dismissed across the desk from him frank sat in smug silence obviously savoring the moment this is terrible zack murmured trying as he read the letter for a third time to get a fix on the nurse maureen banas colorless but efficient distant knowledgeable he simply hadnt spent enough time around her yet to have any real handle terrible but true frank said i had hoped to spare the old duffer any more humiliation but after hearing his little speech the other morning and seeing the way hes gotten to you well it seems i have no frank does anything about this letter strike you as strange frank set his cigar aside and leaned forward what are you talking about zack slid the letter back across the desk well for one thing this woman doesnt substantiate her charges with one specific example well theres no doubt she has them zack dont you think youre grasping at straws and for another the whole damn thing is just too too sterile what just look at it frank not one bit of sensitivity or poignancy not one indication that she understands the charges shes making could quite possibly send a mans life down the draina man who has practiced surgery in this town for thirty years christ for all the awareness shes showing she might just as well be writing to complain that a neighbors poodle is shitting in her flower bed the more i think about it the more this letter smells i think that woman should be spoken with face to face you dont think ive done that well then i want to its the only way im going to even begin to believe all this you go to her or anyone else about this business frank said jabbing a finger at him and youll be out on your ass quicker than you can say scalpel this is my affairmine and ultrameds you really have it in your mind to fuck things up for me around here dont you frank thats nonsense is it for several frozen moments zack couldsonly sit and stare at his brother despite his tan frank looked pallid his expression a disconcerting amalgam of anger andwhat fear they had had their differences over the years true and from time to time some magnificent arguments but zack sensed something far more powerful at work here frank please he managed stop sounding like im your goddamn enemy im not i just care about beaulieu and i want to see that he gets a fair shake okay a margin of color returned to franks cheeks okay zack asked again frank smiled sure sport he said far too amicably i understand ill tell you what why dont we just leave it that ill keep you posted and youll keep an eye on things from a distance that way i get to do what im paid to do and you get to keep from taking a fall i promise you beaulieu will get every break thats coming to him yes zack gauged the intensity in his brothers eyes and then nodded their session had gone far enough so thats taken care of frank said tilting back in his chair and folding his hands in his lap his tone and expression gave no hint of their disagreement listen how about we have dinner sometime this weekend ill have lisette give you a call sure frank thatd be fine excellent oh and by the way he added getting up from his chair as zack stood to go tell that new squeeze of yours that were all praying everything goes well for her tomorrow now zack felt the color drain from his face how did you his brother patted him on the shoulder sport if someone who works for me so much as farts anywhere in this hospital sooner or later i get a whiff thats worth remembering trust me on that one and youll be doing both of us a favor shes a terrific lady im glad shes finally coming out of her shell i hope things work out between you with that he shook zacks hand and ushered him out the door chapter seven disturbed by a cart clattering past the door of her hospital room suzanne cole rolled onto her back floating in the twilight world between sleep and wakefulness for a time she struggled to complete a dream she had been having a romantic storybook dream in which jason mainwaring dressed head to foot in ebony armor sitting astride a coalblack stallion was jousting with a knight clad equally spectacularly in gold again and again the men sped past one another their lances exploding off their opponents shield with each encounter one or the other came close to falling from his mount but each time the stricken knight recovered and swung about for another pass suzanne herself was seated in the grandstand wearing a flowing gown of pink silk and clutching a single white rose who are you she called again and again to the gold knight who are you what do you want from me as the dream faded the knight turned toward her and lifted the visor of his golden helmet like flashing neon the face of the man kept changing one moment it was zachary iverson and the next paul cole the pathologically selfpossessed physiology professor who had picked her out of a crowded lecture hall during her second year in medical school and had swept her up in a whirlwind of flowers and parties and romantic weekends in the country less than a year later they were married if there were signs of the mans sickness during those months she had missed them completely later when the recreational drugs and the erratic behavior and the liesmisunderstandings paul had called thembegan to surface she had chosen to ignore them to rationalize them away by the time she knew that her efforts to hold their marriage together had been a mistake there was jennifer the years she spent trying to accommodate paul for her daughters sake had nearly cost suzanne her career and perhaps even more than that why she pleaded again what do you want from me dr cole its morning why dr cole the nurses gentle voice and the touch of her hand began to dispel what remained of the dream the colors began fading into a sea of white how long had it been since paul had last forced his way into one of her dreams the arguments the guilt trips the hangups when she answered the phone the missing prescription pads the visits from the glib condescending drug enforcement agents why had she given the man so goddamn many benefits of the doubt dr cole suzanne opened her eyes a slit hi she murmured instinctively she reached up and touched her breast dreading the thick bandages she expected to find there its sevenfifteen the nurse said time for your preop meds preop damn she thought it was not over at all it was just starting why was this happening life in sterling had been everything she had hoped it would beso peaceful so uncomplicated so good for jen now suddenly everything seemed to be unraveling at once why she opened her eyes fully sevenfifteen uhhuh youre on call for twenty minutes from now this is some atropine and demerol atropine demerol one to dry up secretions and the other to help one not give a damn about the prospect of being disfigured or worse what wonderful potions we doctors have at our fingertips she thought acidly what wonderful potions indeed she turned onto her side and winced as the needle pierced her buttock then she rolled onto her back and smiled up weakly at the nurse nicely done she murmured the nurse a kind elderly woman named carrie adams patted her hand youre going to do fine she said ive had a couple of cysts removed and so has my daughter the hardest part is the waiting to get it over with ill try to remember that once again this time in spite of herself suzanne reached up and touched her breast it was all so crazy this sort of thing happened to other peopleto patients she was trained to help them through their medical crises not to go through one herself she had bounced back so far put so many pieces of her shattered world back together now this helplessness panic rage her emotions held in check over the weeks since that terrifying moment of discovery swirled about like windblown snow where in the hell was the acceptance that the textbooks all wrote about that demerol should start to work in just a few minutes the woman said as if reading her thoughts good and here are your earphones oh yes suzanne said taking the set and placing it on the bed beside her whats on today i dont know the woman replied but dr mainwarings on channel she took a threebyfive card from her uniform pocket three the systemtapes picked by the surgeons to be played in the operating rooms and broadcast to earphone receiverswas designed to reduce patient anxiety levels over the few years it had been in place the innovation had received high marks from surgeons and patients alike suzanne flipped the dial on the phones to and held one up against her ear greensleeves she said pardon greensleeves thats the music a really beautiful version of it here listen she passed the earphones up the nurse politely listened for a few seconds and then returned them very pretty she said well ill be back in a little while meanwhile you just relax oh by the way theres an envelope for you on the bedside table perhaps youd better read whatevers inside it before that medicine i gave you takes effect suzanne thanked the woman and then waited until she had left the room the envelope with the ultrameddavis heading and logo read dr suzanne cole she peeled it open knowing it was from zack throughout much of the evening he had sat there with her reading out loud from magazines and newspapers laughing sharing stories of his life and when there was nothing to say just holding her hand he had been as open as tender and as understanding as any man she had ever met she wondered if he realized the resentment she was feeling at his intrusion into her life silently she cursed herself for using him the way she had she had no intention of allowing a man close enough to ruin her life againnot now at least possibly not ever zack had said they could make love with no strings attached but she knew damn well that there were always strings when the operation was over regardless of the outcome she would do what she must to put distance between them for a moment the fear of what might be growing within her breast seemed pale next to the fear that she might never again be able to trust dear docits now a m the sleeper they gave you seems to have worked because youve been out fairly solidly for about an hour im going to leave now and hope that you dont wake up until a minute or two before they bring you down to the o r i just wanted to thank you for wednesday night and even more for letting me share this evening here with you i dont know if my being here helped you but it has surely helped me its not much of a secret that i think youre pretty special i know how frustrating and frightening this is for youpartly because its frustrating and frightening for me too just know that whatever happens ill be with you as much and as closely as you want me to be if theres a good working definition of friend maybe its someone who helps us find the tools to get through this kind of shit when we cant seem to find them for ourselves regardless of what happens youve got one in me its going to be benign thats all i can say its going to be benign and everythings going to be okay be strong you have an appointment on my mountain as soon as this is over zack im sorry zack suzanne whispered as she slipped the note back into its envelope tucking it between the pages of the novel she had been reading for the past two weeks im sorry i wasnt stronger she settled back onto her pillow and slipped on the earphones her mouth had become uncomfortably dry from the atropine but the demerol too was having its effect so she did not really care carrie adams and an orderly wheeled a stretcher into the room and helped her slide onto it please god suzanne whispered to herself as the fluorescent lights flashed overhead let it be nothing let it be benign jason mainwaring met her in the operating room his bluegray eyes intent from between his aqua mask and hair cover suzanne pulled off her earphones the same lovely piece she had been listening to filled the operating room welcome to my world suzanne he said suzanne smiled weakly i wish i could say i was pleased to be here i understand he patted her arm reassuringly well take good care of you dont you worry thanks how do yall like my music it its beautiful the most beautiful music ever written i think its called fantasia on greensleeves an its by an english composer named ralph vaughan williams i begin every single case with it an then go on to some other pieces of his if you want ill make a tape of it for you that would be very nice she managed jack pearl the anesthesiologist appeared at mainwarings side together with a nurse they helped her from the litter onto the chilly operating table then in a maneuver so quick and painless she barely realized it was happening pearl slipped an intravenous line into a vein at her left wrist next a broad strap was pulled across her abdomen and tightened a final pleasantry or two from mainwaring and they were ready to begin jack pearl came into suzannes field of vision held up the rubber stopper of her intravenous line and slipped in a needle attached to a syringe full of anesthetic please god she prayed once again let zack be right let it be okuy all right suzanne jack pearl said this is just some pentothal he depressed the plunger emptying the contents of the syringe into her intravenous line all you have to do now is count back from one hundred from the speakers overhead ralph vaughan williamss flowing fantasy filled the room one hundred she said thickly ninetynine ninetyeight above her the huge saucerlike operating light flashed on ready she heard someone say takashi yoshimura was one of seven orientals living in sterling new hampshire the other six were his wife and five children though japanese by birth and in fact by birthplace he had been raised and educated in lower manhattan and spoke both english and japanese with a pronounced new york accent like a number of the new ultramed physicians zack had met since his return to sterling yoshimura a pathologist who insisted on being called kash was young well trained and exceedingly capable it was just after eight in the morning yoshimura diminutive with closecropped hair and ben franklin glasses sat at his desk with zack peering over his shoulder before them in a stainlesssteel pan was the fleshy silverdollarsized mass that had just been removed from suzanne coles right breast zack watched in tense silence as the man maneuvered the tissue about beneath a bright light and magnifying glass a floor above them lay suzanne adrift in the dreamless netherworld of general anesthesia in minutes the unimposing little pathologist would send word to the o r of his interpretation of the cells in the frozen sections of the specimen and suzanne would either have her incision sewn up or a large portion of her breast and the surrounding lymph nodes removed if kash yoshimura was the least bit nervous about the awesome implications of this facet of his work it certainly did not show in his face he hummed a soft almost tuneless melody as he scanned the surface of the mass searching for any telltale dimpling or discoloration then with a final satisfied arpeggio he used a scalpel to produce a thin slice from the core and handed the pan with the exposed specimen to the histologist okay george he said to the tissue technician do your thing well zack asked after the technician had left what do i think uhhuh you are perhaps familiar with the immutable medical law of eightyfivefifteen zack shook his head im surprised yoshimura said your being harvardtrained and all well simply put the law states that every probability in medicine is either eightyfive percent likely or fifteen percent likely proper application of the law means one can never be wrong as long as one knows whether the event in question seems remotely likely or not so remote zack smiled i take it you scored well on your boards kash yoshimura nodded i did okay he said and the biopsy is eightyfive percent likely to be benign an adenoma i would guess wonderful zack pumped his fist at this point you may be eightyfive percent enthusiastic the pathologist cautioned no more i understand yoshimura reached across and patted zack understandingly on the shoulder well have the answer in just a few minutes he said meanwhile all i can tell you is that our mutual friend is in remarkably capable hands mainwaring zack flashed on his initial unpleasant encounter with the man kash nodded i watched him work a number of times when i was a student and resident he is a superb technician so ive heard hes a little short on tact though in the first five minutes after we met he managed to say something snide about virtually every aspect of my life perhaps he finds a new neurosurgeon in town threatening to his ego perhaps where was it you trained hopkins mainwaring was at hopkins he was no small fry either a full professor if im not mistaken zack was surprised i wonder what on earth hes doing up here in the boondocks he said especially the northern new england boondocks that accent of his puts him well below the masondixon line the pathologist shrugged beats me apparently he doesnt deem pathologists threatening enough to insult aside from my reporting biopsies to him we havent had more than a one or twoword conversation since he arrived a year or so ago actually zack said suddenly anxious to learn more about the man guy beaulieu claimed was helping to drive him out of practice it was closer to two years did you ever tell him you watched him operate at hopkins as a matter of fact i did once shortly after he got here and what did he say nothing really he glared at me for a moment with that steely look that i think surgeons practice in front of a mirror to use on nurses and anesthesiologists and the like he grimaced i mean some surgeons he qualified then he just said thats nice something like thatand walked away and no mention of that since yoshimura shook his head how weird mainwaring seems very much the oldboy type id expect him to go out of his way for someone from his college or his hospitalespecially a prestigious place like hopkins believe it or not yoshimura said without rancor there are still those about even in our lofty profession who are uncomfortable with certain aspects of certain anatomies he gestured toward his eyes whatever the reason the social circle jason mainwaring runs in certainly does not include the yoshimuras well id enjoy it very much if mine did zack said kash yoshimura eyed him for a second and then he smiled i think we would like that too he said the histology technician announced his return with a soft knock on the doorjamb ah kash said this is the moment we turn our eightyfivefifteen into something quite a bit more certain good sections the technician nodded proudly and set down a cardboard holder containing a dozen or so glass slides zack was struck by the remoteness of the unfolding scenario from the woman whose quality of life and even perhaps whose very existence was at the center of the dramaa marked contrast to the immediacy and intimacy of surgical medicine still he knew in the moments to follow kash yoshimura would hold as much power as much responsibility as if he were the man in the operating room with the scalpel the pathologist slid the first of the sections onto the stage of the dualview teaching microscope and motioned zack to the second pair of oculars silently zack watched barely breathing as the multicolored cells slid through the brightly lit field one by one yoshimura worked his way through the slides with the fifth or sixth one he had resumed his humming finally he stopped and looked over at zack you have an opinion he asked zack nodded uniform cell type uniform pattern no obvious foci of necrosis he said i cant put a name on it but i can say that it sure as hell looks benign yoshimura nodded should you ever tire of neurosurgery dr iverson i would say you have quite a future as a pathologist he picked up the phone and dialed the operating room this is dr yoshimura calling from pathology he said you may inform dr mainwaring that he has excised a totally benign fibrous adenoma thank you zack pumped the mans hand as if he had been the cause of the tumor being noncancerous rather than merely its interpreter before it had really even begun suzannes nightmare was over anxious to be at the bedside when she awoke zack hurried to the recovery room one story above in operating room jason mainwaring received the news of the biopsy impassively and then looked over at his anesthesiologist so jack he said if its all right with you we are ready to close jack pearl a ferretlike man in his midforties smiled at the surgeon from beneath his mask then he glanced down at the serene face of their patient everything is better than all right dr mainwaring he said in fact its perfect as always absolutely perfect subtly unnoticed by anyone else in the room jason mainwaring returned the smile and nodded his approval at that moment both men were focused on precisely the same thought four hundred ninetone down only nine to go chapter eight over the more than thirteen years that zack had spent as a medical student and surgeon suzanne represented without doubt the most striking recovery from general anesthesia he had ever encountered he was already in the recovery room waiting by the nurses station when she was wheeled in from the surgical suite she was awake smiling and totally alert her jubilant thumbsup sign to him made clear that she was also well aware of the results of her operation that is the most amazing wakeup ive ever seen zack commented to one of the recovery room nurses as suzanne with very little help transferred herself from the litter to her hospital bed its hard to believe she was ever really asleep the nurse an animated young redhead whom zack knew only as kara beamed with pride oh she was out all right she said isnt it wonderful almost all of dr pearls cases come out of the operating room looking like that mine didnt zack said recalling the prolonged but quite typical recovery of his cervical disc case pardon nothing im just really impressed thats all every one around here is the woman said part of it may be dr mainwaring too he demands that his patients be anesthetized just so and dr pearl is the only one hell allow to work with him i used to scrub before i got the job in here and i tell you they are quite a pair things have really taken a turn for the better at this place since they teamed up across the recovery room zack saw jack pearl peering through an ophthalmoscope examining the nerves and vessels on suzannes retinae while one of the nurses checked her vital signs he was a slight sallow man with a pencilthin moustache and a broad high forehead that dominated his nondescript eyes what do you mean a turn for the better zack asked knowing he was fishing for some opinion on guy beaulieu i grew up in sterling and then did an externship here i always thought we were pretty fortunate with the surgeons we had the nurse eyed him warily suddenly uncertain as to whether she might have said too much to a virtual stranger zack tried his best to appear only marginally interested in her response after a beat or two she shrugged and brushed a wisp of hair from her brow ormesbys okay she said at least for routine things but i think it might be time for dr beaulieu to retire especially with all the trouble hes been having and with someone as good as dr mainwaring around is that the general feeling of the nurses zack ventured again she appraised him dunno she said finally although her eyes told him otherwise but they like you i can tell you that much and we all like having a neurosurgeon on the staff it makes ultrameddavis seem morei dont knowspecial thanks kara thanks for telling me that the young nurse blushed well ive got to get back to work she said see you see you zack watched as the woman returned to her patient her opinion of guy beaulieu was he suspected typical of what he would encounter from most of the other nurses on the staff whether justifiably or not the mans reputation at ultrameddavis was shot and zack knew that given the nature of medicine gossip and the intense microcosm of hospitals there was probably nothing on gods earth that beaulieu could do to reverse the situation still despite all the rumors and innuendoes despite franks vehemence and the damning letter from maureen banas zack could not shake the belief that guy was the victim of some sort of calculated effort to drive him from practice the thought was so sad so pathetic that it almost defied comprehension on some level zack realized he was half hoping the charges against beaulieu would prove true at least then he could make some sense of it all jack pearl had finished his evaluation of suzanne and was headed back toward the operating room when he noticed zack morning iverson he said jack zack nodded how goes it no i just stopped by to see how suzanne was making out she looks great pearl glanced back at her pretty routine business he said what did you use for the fraction of a second the anesthesiologists expression seemed to tighten then just as quickly it relaxed the usual he said a little pentothal a little gas mainwaring likes his patients really light i guess she doesnt look as if shes even been asleep again tension flickered across pearls face well she was he said simply he glanced at the clock over the nurses station got to go iverson you have a good day now yeah jack you too as the taciturn little man shuffled away zack realized that during this and all their previous encounters pearl had not once made direct eye contact with him the trait was not that surprising he acknowledged given the nature of the breed although the exceptions were far too numerous for any generalization many of the anesthesiologists he had known were introspective loners skilled more in biochemistry and physiology than in the more subjective arts of clinical medicine and committed to one of the specialties where conversation and interaction with patientsawake patients at leastwas at a minimum still there was something unusual about jack pearl something furtive and arcane that zack found both curious and disconcerting he wondered if perhaps the man had a pasttrouble somewhere along the lineand he made a mental note to ask frank about him sometime then he turned and headed to suzannes bedside though a bit pale she was still smiling radiant and wide awake hi lady he said whats new oh nothing she feigned a yawn a little this a little that you know just another routine humdrum day yeah my day too thats quite obvious from those dark circles around your eyes she said hey before i forget to mention it thanks for your note it meant a lot you look fine are you in any pain not really at least not compared to what i would have been in if that biopsy had been positive it does seem a bit easier to deal with this way zack said i thought id have the chance to break the good news to you or at least to remind you of it but you came out of the o r as if youd never been asleep its absolutely incredible how light you are so soon after general anesthesia i know jason said i would be its wonderful i had my appendix out when i was seventeen and i remember being totally out of it for a day jack pearl said that if it was okay with jason i could go home this afternoon thats great zack god bless every woman who has to go through this madness i know were supposed to believe that theres some sort of grand cosmic scheme operating in life but cancerespecially breast cancerjust doesnt lend itself very easily to any philosophizing i tell you im so relieved all i want to do is cry well go ahead and do it in fact im pretty relieved myself so if youre free tomorrow night i could come over with a bottle of wine and a box of kleenex her eyes darkened zack i go ahead he said i really owe you for staying with me the way you did last night theres a but coming i can feel it zack wednesday night was wonderful she whispered i really mean that but its just not like me to start things in the middle that way do you understand i guess so for weeks ive been so consumed with my damn lump then suddenly you show up in my life and zack i just need some time and a little space to sort some things out you said the other night that you had no expectations i hope you meant it zack swallowed hard i hope so too he said she smiled thinly and squeezed his hand thanks at least for trying listen i have the next week off i owe jen some quality time with her mother and my partner a few days of help in the gallery ill call you toward the middle of the week okay middle meaning like tuesday zack please okay sorry sorry middle of the week is fine can i at least drive you home later ill be fine besides i dont even know if ill be going home later zack therell be time if its supposed to be therell be plenty of time there was a sadness in her eyes that helped keep him from pushing matters any further sure thing he said hey for what its worth i just ran into your replacement in annies room suzanne smiled broadly obviously relieved at the change in subject don norman is he overwhelmed yet hardly norman doesnt seem like the type to be overwhelmed very easilyat least not as long as there are guidelines and policies for him to follow and ultramed seems to have provided all the guidelines and policies he could ever want so not to worry i wont she said and i agree totally the man is conscientious as hell but he is a little medical robot julia childs with a stethoscopestrictly cookbook annie okay zack nodded when i stopped by she was fighting with norman about her sodium restriction so i guess thats about as good a sign as any oh get this right in the middle of their little altercation he puffs himself up like he loves to doyou know like thisand he says mrs doucette pulleese whether you know it or not i am the chief of staff at this hospital i certainly know what is best for my patients good imitation excellent and what did annie say nothing too inflammatory she just eyed him with this great annie look called him tubby and suggested that he should lose weight so that he would be a better example for his patients oh no it was great norman turned ten shades of red and looked for a moment as if he might haul off and pop her in the nose having been brought up by the woman i can say that its lucky for him he didnt even after cardiac arrest my money would have been on annie well listen ive got to go play doctor if you change your mind about that ride home give me a page sure you know i still cant get over it what she asked how light you are the nurse i was talking to said all of mainwarings patients come out of the o r like that ive got to ask him his secret no secret doctor just good technique jason mainwaring sans mask and haircover appraised them from the foot of the bed well zack said casually trying not to appear as startled by the intrusion as he was whatever it is its impressive id like to scrub with you sometime to learn firsthand how its done my goodness mainwaring mused a neurosurgeon who doesnt know everything what will the gods send us next now just a minute zack countered again feeling his hackles stiffen at the mans superciliousness i dont know if youre like this with everyone or just with me but i hey fellas suzanne cut in remember me the patient mainwaring smiled down at her as if zack were no longer there is everything still all right my friend he asked perfect jason i cant tell you how pleased i am thats fine just fine he drawled zack arms folded tightly stood back from the bed a step wondering if he should say goodbye or simply leave it was obvious that jason mainwaring for all of his glistening reputation and surgical skills was too threatened by him to let up even for a moment unless he could find some way of reassuring the man that they were playing for the same teamand his experience with similar egos told him that possibility was highly unlikelythe two of them seemed destined to be enemies well so be it zack thought it would only make things that much easier if in fact mainwaring did prove in any way responsible for guys difficulties can i go home this afternoon suzanne asked mainwaring smiled walked to the bedside opposite zack and took her hand if theres no major bleeding from that incision he said and you still feel the way you do right now i dont see why not listen ive got an emergency exploratory in just a few minutes and a gall bladder at two why dont i stop by after thatsay fourthirty then ill not only discharge you but ill even drive you home your place isnt very far out of my way suzannes eyes flicked toward zack oh jason i wouldnt think of no no its settled dont you think driving your postop patients home is carrying bedside manner a bit too far doctor zack barely kept the snide rebuke in check he was already irritated with the man and his ways and now he realized he was jealous of him as well suzanne had made no secret that she and her surgeon had a friendship that at times went beyond the hospital but she had also been careful to add that mainwaring had a wife and children living somewhere in the south who were for whatever reason as yet unable to follow him to new england there was zack reminded himself angrily never a valid excuse for jealousy nevertheless jealous he was his reaction also reminded him that it was far more pleasant being threatening than feeling threatened well he said clearing his throat but still unable to fully expunge the hurt from his voice you two seem to have everything pretty much under control so ill just get along see you later suze nice job mainwaring before either of them could respond a nurse whom zack recognized as one of the emergency crew rushed across the recovery room to mainwaring doctor she said breathlessly theres some trouble in the emergency ward its dr beaulieu hes she glanced at zack and suzanne and stopped in midsentence obviously unsure of how much more to say um mr iverson would like you to come down right away if you can of course sandy mainwaring responded with urbane calm tell mr iverson ill be right along thank you doctor hi dr iverson hi suzanne are you okay im fine sandy thanks suzanne said everythings all right thats wonderful ill tell everyone downstairs the good news she hurried off so said mainwaring ill see yall at fourthirty yes he gave suzannes hand a final squeeze and then strode out of the recovery room are you going down there she asked zack uhhuh let me know whats going on okay sure he made no move to touch her zack she said softly what im sorry i didnt handle that situation better jason comes on a little strong sometimes he caught me off balance hes really a decent guy just dont let him get to you okay sure talk to you later in the week right he turned to go i hope the trouble with guy is nothing big she called you and me both he muttered but as he headed for the emergency ward feeling not a little deflated zack could not shake an ugly sense of foreboding nothing that zack had imagined about what was transpiring in the emergency ward prepared him for the reality there was commotion bordering on chaos the hospitals threeman security force was there as were the director of nursing mainwaring chief of staff donald norman and half a dozen embarrassed patients and their families the epicenter of the turmoil was behind the closed door of the family quiet room where brief periods of strained silence separated angry easily audible outbursts in english and in french from guy beaulieu damn you frank get out of my way before i strike you were the first words zack heard that woman is my patient and i have every right to care for her now out of my way guy sit down and quiet down or i swear ill have the guards come in here and tie you down i will not have you making a scene like this in my hospital your hospital if its your hospital mr high and mighty then why dont you see that this is all a plot to take my practice away youre in on it arent you thats why youre one of them dammit guy shut up there are patients out there i know there are my patients now let me pass zack crossed to where jason mainwaring stood leaning against a wall near the quiet room what gives he asked mainwaring glanced over at him and then looked back toward the source of the commotion the old quack has gone beserk thats what he said coolly hes been unbalanced for some time but at least hes had the presence and intelligence to limit his outbursts and paranoia to the staff meetings this is disgraceful do you know what happened mainwarings response was preempted by yet another outburst from beaulieu followed by still another though more constrained response from frank moments later the door to the quiet room opened and frank slipped out he appeared a bit more ruffled than usual but was still impeccably dressed with not a hair out of place stay with him henry he said to one of the security guardsa broad reckless man with bad skin and closecut hair who looked to zack like a mammoth fireplug if he starts yelling again cuff him to the chair and shove a rag in his mouth mr iverson i dont hurt people unless they hurt me i told them that when i started working here look henry if you want to keep on working here youll do as i say and keep that nutcase quiet until chief clifford and his men get here now get in there and do your job shaking his massive head the guard entered the quiet room and closed the door behind him there were no shouts of protest from beaulieu frank scanned the cubicles filled with patients christ he muttered spotting zack and mainwaring he approached them shaking his head this is fucking insane he said keeping his voice low and you know what its my fault i should have done something about him way back when his craziness started well zacko if theres one good thing to come out of all this its that at least you get to see him in action firsthand exactly whats going on zack asked what tipped him over frank laughed sardonically i keep telling you brother guy beaulieu tipped over a long time ago this is just an example of how far see that woman over there in bed five well shes got some sort of bowel problem probably a ruptured diverticulum mainwaring interjected well frank went on beaulieus done some surgery on her in the past on her husband too i think this time though the woman and her internist apparently talked things over and decided that she might be better off with jason here doing the surgery i evaluated her right before i did suzanne mainwaring explained and had her scheduled to follow in the o r meanwhile beaulieu the lunatic comes strolling through the emergency ward spots the woman and without a word to anyone begins examining her and issuing orders to the nurses needless to say the poor lady whos not too swift to begin with was totally confused and absolutely terrified frank looked impatiently toward the ambulance bay where in the hell are the goddamn cops when you dont want them theyre all over the place frank you dont need the police zack said let me talk to him cant you see where this might be upsetting and humiliating for him ill just get him out of the hospital and hell calm down hes out of the hospital anyway frank said acidly for good what this was the last fucking straw i told him about the latest series of complaints and about that letter from maureen banas and i suspended his privileges zacks heart sank frank is that when he went nuts what difference does it make frank said nuts is nuts just listen to him from within the quiet room beaulieu had again begun to shout you ape let go of me take your hands off me goddamn it take your hands suddenly the surgeons words were cut short without waiting for franks permission zack bounded across to the quiet room and threw open the door the guard henry had balled a red bandanna in his fist preparing to use it as a gag beaulieu was sitting handcuffed to the arm of his chair he was staring in wideeyed terror not at his tormentor but at a vacant spot on one wall the right side of his face was starting to droop oh jesus zack said as he knelt by the man guy can you talk beaulieu turned to him slowly his eyes were glassy and filled with tears head hurts he moaned his speech was thick and slurred his tongue seemed bunched at the corner of his mouth did you hit him zack demanded of the guard not even a tap i swear i didnt undo these zack snapped jiggling the handcuffs the man hesitated dammit do as i say do it henry frank said from the doorway whats happening zack zack turned slowly and looked up at his brother hes having a stroke frank he said hoarsely thats what a cerebral hemorrhage i would guess i need a litter a nurse and an iv setup and i want the ct scanner warmed up he turned to the guard tell me again did you touch this mans head his voice was ice his eyes fire i didnt touch nothin except his wrists the man said defensively i swear i dont hurt people unless they hurt me undo these quickly now the guard did as he was told and instantly as if made of rags guy beaulieus right arm flopped off the chair and dangled down zack lowered him to the floor and cradled his head in his lap i need that litter please he said barely able to contain his anguish he bent close to beaulieu easy does it old friend he whispered easy does it beaulieus eyes opened and zack noted with horror and despair that the pupil of the right one had already begun to dilate okay guy he whispered stroking the older mans forehead and cheek the litter will be here in a second just hang on youre going to be okay suddenly for a few frozen seconds beaulieus eyes stopped their random drifting and focused on zacks face no im not he said forming each word with the most excruciating effort god help me im not slowly his eyes closed damn you zack hissed looking first at the guard and then at frank mainwaring and don norman who were clustered in the doorway god damn you all chapter nine over the months since her sons attacks had first begun barbara nelmss approach to housework had changed radically where once she had been meticulous almost to the point of obsession now she cut corners wherever possible she was never comfortable remaining out of range of the boy for more than five ten fninutes at a time with sitters unwilling to stay alone with toby and her husband drifting further and further into his work the television set had become her closest ally only when toby was engrossed in saturday cartoons or some of the programs on the childrens cable network did she dare spend any prolonged time doing laundry or preparing meals it was late afternoon and barbara had not even begun to think about dinner all day toby had been even more restless and remote than usual she had read to him for a time and taken him to the store with her she had pulled him around the block in his wagon and pushed him on the tire swing in the backyard for as she stared at the unwashed dishes in the sink and thought about the pile of ironing she had been avoiding it was all she could do to keep from breaking down through the door to the living room she could see her son lying on his back on the carpet staring at the ceiling troby she called out five more minutes and robins on we missed him this morning while we were at the park why dont you go nd get your bear and ill turn him on rhat the boy did not react was upsetting when toby was at his worst his most distant the prospect of watching robin the good usually brought a response of some sort the actor who played robin was overveight for the role and as patronizing to the children as inane and vapid as anyone she had ever seen but his halfhour show aired three times a day was bright and quick okay honey she said you just stay put then im going to do some dishes and then ill turn on robin glancing almost continuously over her shoulder she thrust her hand into the sink and snapped a nail off so low that it drew blood dammit she said sucking at the wound dammit dammit damfait she ran cold water over her finger then as much from frustration as from pain she began to cry she snatched up the phone dialed the mill and had her husband called out of a meeting bob hi its me she said i know has he done it again no no hes okay just now but hes not acting right he never acts right honey im sorry i cant talk now but im in the middle of an important meeting was there something special farbara blotted her bleeding finger on a towel i i was hoping you might be able to come home early id like to put a nice dinner together but im worried about toby impossible bob nelms said too quickly honey you just said he was okay the people from chicago are here ive got a ton of stuff to go over with them in fact i was going to have sharon call and tell you id be late couldnt you postpone them for a day just this once sweetie you know id come if i could but theyre only going to be here for a day please she whispered

barbie please dont make things any more difficult for me than they are ill be home as soon as i can okay okay doggone it barb dont do this slowly barbara nelms replaced the receiver then she waited for her husbands return call a minute passed then another finally she wrapped a bandaid around her finger and shuffled to the living room come on my merry man she said hoarsely its time for robin toby nelms let his mother lead him into the den and then sank down on the floor by the couch he wanted her to get his bear for him but the words to ask wouldnt come okay to be she said switching on the television ill just be in the kitchen call if you need me stay he thought please stay with me the cartoon that introduced robin the goods show appeared on the screen along with a nowfamiliar voice that announced hey merry men and merry maids get out your longbows and your stout staffs its time to travel once again to those days long long agoto sherwood forest and that friend of the poor robin the good toby watched quietly as his mother adjusted the color and then left the room moments later she returned and set his tattered bear beside him enjoy the show she said patting him on the head ill be in the htchen thank you toby whispered but she was already gone he stared toward the kitchen for a time and then stuffed his bear between his legs and turned his attention to the television robin the good wearing a green suit and a hat with a feather was dancing about and singing while alanadale played his guitar we welcome all you boys and girls but dont bring any diamonds or pearls cause i take from the rich and give to the poor then i go right out and get some more what ho merry men and maids welcome to sherwood where learning is always fun fun fun today were going to do some drawing with little john and take a ride on a camel with maid marian but first heres friar tuck tell us pray the good friar what letter we are going to learn about today a fat man with a brown robe and a bald place on the top of his head hopped onto the screen hello boys and girls he said what ho there robin today were going to learn about one of my favorite letters its the letter that starts off a lot of our favorite words like candy and cartoon its the third letter in the alphabet and its called c so herere robin and alan to tell you about it robin the good swung across the screen on a rope with leaves growing off it then he dropped to the ground as alanadale began to play alas my love you do me wrong robin sang to cast me out so discourteously because today i sing this song about our friend the letter c toby nelms rubbed at his eyes as the color of the television set began growing brighter and brighter c c is all our joy cs for carrot and car and cat c c starts club and cloud now what do you think of that robin the good danced around a tree seated on the floor in his den toby nelmss body grew rigid his shoulders began to shake the sound of robins voice grew softer as the music grew louder overhead lights began to flash past a face floated into view theres c for comet and c for crab and c in front of the coat we wear now toby the face said theres nothing to worry about youre going to go to sleep just relax relax and count back from one hundred robin the good was singing and prancing across the television screen as toby nelms began in a soft tremulous voice to count he was on one knee crooning the final lines of his ballad as the boy began to scream it was all would later agree a magnificent funeral standing room only the crowd sweltering in the brutally humid summer afternoon filled the pews of st annes church and spilled out into the vestibule the priests conducting the mass were not only from the predominantly frenchcanadian st annes but from the cross town parish st sebastians as well guy beaulieu was not a son of sterling monsignor tresche was declaring g in his eulogy he was one of its fathersa gentle man whose skill and caring hands have through the years touched each and every one of us over the three days following beaulieus death zack had visited his widow clothilde and daughter marie fontaine several times even so he was surprised when marie asked him to serve as a pall bearer although he would have preferred to remain less intimately involved with guys funeral than he had been with his death accepting their request was the least he could do it had been at his desperate urging that marie and her mother had put aside their biases against such things and had agreed to an autopsy a man of vision and conviction a humble man who faced mounting personal difficulties with courage and dignity the priest droned on but zack seated in the first row with the seven other pall bearers heard only snatches his thoughts kept drifting as they had much of the time to the agonizing scene with guy in the emergency room and to the equally unpleasant experience of viewing his post mortem examination as zack had suspected the man had died of a massive cerebral hemorrhage there was however a major surprise the arteries in beaulieuss brain and in fact in his whole body were those of a man decades younger the lethal stroke had resulted not from any crack in a hardened vessel but from the rupture of a small aneurysma peasized defect in one artery which almost certainly had been present without producing symptoms for many years the cause of that fatal tear zack knew could only have been a sudden drastic rise in blood pressure that thought sent an angry jet of bile rasping into his throat as it had over and over again since the autopsy guy beaulieus two years of difficulties at ultrameddavis whether real or contrived had loaded the weapon of his destruction the humiliating conflict in the emergency ward with mainwaring frank and the security guard had in essence pulled the trigger frank of course saw things differently he had issued statements of shock and bereavement from the hospital and from ultramed and had sent a basket of fruit to guys widow but in the few minutes he and zack had spent alone he had made it clear that he considered beaulieus death nothing short of an act of providence unobtrusively zack glanced about the chapel suzanne though dressed in sedate blue and wearing no makeup sparkled in the midst of two rows of ultrameddavis physicians which did not include donald norman jack pearl or jason mainwaring several pews behind her between the judge and cinnie sat frank resplendent in a beige summer suit and appearing as usual composed and in control the mayor was there along with several other area notables including the regions congressman guy beaulieu had once described himself to zack as just a plain old smalltown canuck lucky enough to be born to parents who wouldnt let him quit school to work in the mills it was good at least to see that so many people knew better later as zack and the other pall bearers shuffled up the aisle with guys casket his eyes and franks met briefly he felt so distant from the manso totally detached had they really grown up in the same home played in the same yard year after year had they really worn the same clothes shared so many childhood dreams had they really once been fast friends the hope of reestablishing a friendship with his brother suddenly seemed naive they would make do perhaps tolerate one another even work together they would spend sterile time together at family functions but they would never be close the open hearse was festooned with flowers zack feeling overwhelmed by the sadness and futility of it all helped slide the heavy casket into place among them excuse me doctor a voice behind him said as he stepped back from the casket kin i talk to you zack turned and was surprised to find himself confronting the huge security guard henry flowers who seemed ill at ease in a dark suit and solid black tie looking on several respectful steps behind him was a petite plain young woman in a white lace dressalmost certainly the mans wife yes zack asked the guard shifted uncomfortably i uh i wanted you to know that im real sorry for what happened to dr beaulieu he said he took care of my wifes mother once real good care and hes never done nothin bad to me dr iverson i never laid a hand on him except to grab his wrist i swear it i his voice drifted away it took several moments before zack realized that the man did not know the results of the autopsy and if he did he did not understand them zack reached out and put a hand on the guards shoulder you didnt do anything that caused dr beaulieus death henry he said loudly enough for the mans wife to hear he had an aneurysm a time bombin his head and it just happened to go off while you were there relief flooded the guards pocked face thanks doc he said pumping zacks hand as if it were the handle on a tractortrailer jack oh god thanks a lot if theres ever anything i can do for you just ask anything he backed away and then grabbed his tiny wife by the arm and zack watched until the incongruous couple had disappeared around the corner then he turned and headed to his camper feeling marginally less morose at least one other who had shared those awful moments in the quiet room had been affected by them the procession to all saints cemetery was according to the judge as long as any sterling had ever seen following the service zack accompanied frank and their parents to the shaded spot where marie fontaine and her mother were receiving final condolences marie who seemed to have aged a year in just three days since her return home accepted an embrace from cinnie and a kiss on the cheek from the judge however she barely touched franks outstretched hand before pulling away it was good of you to come she said coolly your father meant a great deal to all of us frank replied blandly she eyed him for a moment and then said simply thats nice to know zack glanced over at his parents but saw nothing to suggest that they appreciated the tension in the brief exchange marie then turned to him took both his hands in hers and kissed him by the ear please stop by our limousine she whispered imperceptible to the others zack nodded half an hour later zack sat across from marie fontaine and clothilde beaulieu in the back of the mortuarys black stretch cadillac the smokedglass windows including the partition separating them from the driver were closed but the limos airconditioning system kept the steamy afternoon at bay maries husband a gaunt bearded man whose quiet dignity reminded zack a little of her father stood outside we wanted you to know how grateful we are for all youve done marie began your father was always very good to me he was very good to everyone she said thats why its so hard to understand why nobody stood up for him while he was being murdered zacks impulse was to correct her but the intensity of her eyes told him not to bother it upsets me a great deal to think that anyone might have deliberately set about to ruin him he said not anyone zack ultramed what zack we know father confided in you we know that even though your brother runs the hospital he thought you would give him the benefit of an open mind was he right i told him i would listen and that i would respect his confidence if thats what you mean marie glanced over at her mother who nodded her approval of zacks response thats exactly what we mean she went on several years ago father opposed the sale of the hospital to ultramed he just didn t believe an outside corporation should be given such a vital foothold in this communityat least not with so little community involvement or control if it werent for your fathers influence we think he would have succeeded in blocking it but that is neither here nor there now did you know that shortly after they took over at the hospital ultramed took legal action to fire him no zack said no i didnt he was preparing to countersue them when they backed off according to father they became frightened by a court decision in florida that ended up costing one of the other corporations millions for trying to do the same thing to a pathologist who was working in a hospital they had acquired zack ultramed wants blind loyalty from everyone working for themtotal acceptance of their policies father fought them at every turn less than a year after they dropped the suit against him the rumors started and within just a few months of that a showy new surgeon was on the scene snapping up chunks of fathers practice i that would be jason mainwaring zack said exactly have you any proof that ultramed engineered all of this he asked only this she reached beneath her seat drew out a thick manila envelope and passed it across to him mother and i talked it over last night father liked you and trusted you and frankly we have nowhere else to turn this is all the information he had been able to gather in his battle against ultramed it doesnt prove they were behind his murder but it does show something of how they operatesome of the things theyre capable of doing to turn a profit what am i to do with this for the first time beaulieus widow spoke dr iverson she said in a soft accent virtually identical to guys it was my husbands hope that the information contained in that envelope would convince the board of trustees including your father to exercise their option and order the repurchase of the hospital from ultramed zack stared at her in disbelief mrs beaulieu are you forgetting that i work for ultramed they pay my salary my office expenses insurance everything to say nothing of the administrator at the hospital being my brother what you are asking me to do isnt really fair my huuand is dead is that fair zack saw the response flash in the womans eyes and then vanish we are asking you clothilde beaulieu said patiently to do nothing more than study the contents of that envelope and use itor notas you see fit i assure you there will be no hard feelings if you return the material to us after you have looked it over or even right now we mean that zachary marie said we really do for a time there was only silence zack looked first at one woman and then the other and finally at the envelope in his lap a sucker for anybodys cause had franks terse assessment of him been so irritating because it was so close to the mark suzanne the mountains the judge his career any clash with ultramed and frank was almost certainly destined to be a losing proposition for him and there was much so very much at stake the envelope was a pandoras box a bomb that might be nothing more than a dud or nothing less than a lethal explosion a sucker for anybodys cause slowly deliberately zack slid the dead surgeons legacy under his arm then he reached across and shook hands with both wnn pn ill be in touch he said h w frank frank hes our man if he cant do it no one can over the two decades since his graduation from sterling high not a day had passed that frank iverson did not hear the chant echoing in his mind cheerleaders dancing on the sidelines each one hoping frank would at least spend a few minutes with her at the victory celebration after the game grandstands jammed with parents teachers students and reporters all screaming his name all begging him for one more pass one more score the judge and his mother proudly accepting congratulations from those seated around them driving through the streets of sterling toward his hospital frank heard the cheering as clearly as if he were standing on the field staring across the line of scrimmage at the opposition knowing that in just a few seconds his play would swell those cheers to a deafening roar frank frank hes our man they had been days of glory for him days of strength and independence it felt so good to realize that after all the difficult humiliating years that had followed after all the lousy breaks and the goddamn patronizing demeaning lectures from his father a return to the stature and influence of those times was so close at hand two weeks that was all three at the most he had done his part and done it well now all he needed was patiencepatience and constant vigilance three years before he had made the mistake of complacency of trusting and it had cost him dearly there would be no repeat of that fiasco this time nothing would be taken for granted nothing besides he affirmed as he swung up the drive to ultrameddavis there were reasons aplenty for keeping his eyes open and his guard up a million reasons to be exact if he cant do it no one can helene i dont know how to tell you this but i think its time we moved mr gerard morriss fabulous woodland scene out of the window and more toward the backlike in the storeroom suzanne propped morriss huge oil against a display case and stepped back several paces hoping that the change in lighting and perspective might thaw some of the feelings she had for the man and his work the mans a legend helene meyer called out from the back in his own mind he is suzanne when are you going to come to grips with the reality that tourists dont come up to northern new hampshire to buy abstract art they want mallards paint by numbers suzanne muttered remembering a tongue lashing she had received from the pompous artist for reducing the price of one of his masterpieces by fifty dollars what nothing nothing it was nearing three in the afternoon suzanne and her partner had been doing inventory nonstop since her return from guys funeral outside muted midday sunshine filtered through a row of expansive centuryold sugar maples turning main street into a gentle work of art that far surpassed anything gerard morris had produced immersing herself in the inventory and spending time with helene had helped lift some of the melancholy suzanne was feeling but memories of guy beaulieu kept her mood somber although she had not known the man outside the hospital she had shared several patients with him before his practice dwindled and more than respected him as a person and a physician nevertheless the stories that had been circulating about him of late were disconcerting and suzanne had gradually come to agree with those who believed that it would be in everyones best interest for guy to retire now reflecting on zacks opinion that the aging surgeon seemed quite capable and mentally intact and with the realization that the man had died defending himself she was having second thoughts first guy beaulieu and then the old woodsman chris gowin both cases she had backed off siding with ultramed through her silence true the corporation had plucked her from a situation that had seemed totally hopeless and had given her a chance for that alone she owed ultramed her loyalty but still there had been a time she knew when she considered herself a liberal a champion of the underdog there had been a time when she would have gone to the mat for either man just as zack had done it was hard to believe she had changed so much over just a few short years as she hefted morriss painting off the floor and replaced it in the window suzanne silently cursed paul cole for the chaos he had brought to her life so helene meyer dressed in jeans and a blueprint smock emerged from the storeroom with a pair of ceramic vases that the had taken on consignment from a micmac indian potter she was a short dark energetic woman with closecut hair and just enough excess pounds to puff her cheeks and arms so what suzanne asked so where are morriss ducks suzanne nodded toward the window good good youre learning child youre learning the white mountain olde curiosity shop and gallery occupied the ground floor of a halfcenturyold redbrick structure two blocks from the center of town three years before when she received word that an uncle had died and left the place to her helene was working in a deadend advertising job in manhattan and competing with what seemed like several million other fortyyearold divorced women for any one of a minuscule pool of available men she took her inheritance as an omen for change despite having taken her act on the road along with her two children helene had never given up on the notion that mr perfect was at any given moment just one man away perhaps suzanne reflected that was why the woman always had a smile and an encouraging word for even the bleakest situation you okay helene asked setting the vases on a pair of lucite pedestals and then reversing them huh oh sure im fine you look tired i always look tired you always look beautiful helene corrected today you look beautiful and tired im fine im just not sleeping too well the explanation was an understatement since her discharge from the hospital she had been almost continuously restless and ill at ease sleeping no more than an hour or two at a time and often awakening with an intense freefloating anxiety it was hardly the mood she would have expected given the outcome of her surgery you need some sex helene said i dont need any sex thats your cure for everything well have i had a sick day since youve known me as long as there are ski lodges and contra dances and thursday night singlemingles at the holiday inn i intend to stay healthy as a horse dont you think its time you no no i dont now lets change the subject besides she caught herself after that one word but it was too late helene leapt at the opening besides what nothing oh yes she squinted across at suzanne you did it didnt you the other night with that new doctor whats his name zachary but well ill be damned no wonder youre so tired i thought that was supposed to perk me up not when its the first time in several years its not helene said you need to keep in shape for that sort of thing glory be he must be something else thats all i can say tell me about him theres nothing to tell hes a nice guy i was frightened about my surgery and he was understanding and things things just got out of hand it was a mistakejust one of those things were not even going to see one another again outside the hospital glory be helene said again you stop that helene took suzanne by the shoulders no you stop that she said suze youre like my sister bringing you in as a partner in this place is the best thing ive ever doneexcept maybe for that furrier from white plains she sighed wistfully and suzanne laughed if i keep putting my two cents into your life she went on its because i love you i know you had it rough with that jerk you were married to and all but thats water under the bridge hes gone you cant keep letting him rule your life i dont let him rule my life im doing just fine thank you and youve got a great job and a great kid and a lot of interests and you dont need anyone messing things up for you again i know i know youve said all that before so so theres more its out there waiting if youd just stop running scared and give it a chance helene im perfectly happy and my life is perfectly under control okay okay but if you ask me you could do with a little less control and a little more meyer enough helene held up her hands defensively just trying to help she said i know so this zachary that youre not going to see again outside the hospital tell me about him helene i thought we tall kind of a clint eastwood face great eyes dark brown how did you at that instant the door behind suzanne opened she whirled and tensed visibly hi zack said i thought so helene muttered glory be im sorry to have popped in on you like this zack said sipping the cappuccino suzanne had made him i know you said wednesday thats okay i needed a break they were perched on cherrywood stools on either side of a glass case that doubled as a sales counter and jewelry display following introductions small talk and a nudge that suzanne had tried unsuccessfully to find annoying helene had gone off on errands across the gallery a dowager tourist and her diminutive husband were eyeing a gerard morris entitled typically the forest is a symphony life in itself hows the incision zack asked no problem the atmosphere between them was subdued but not strained and despite her efforts to pull away suzanne sensed that her connection to him forged on the hillside behind her house and later in her hospital room had not softened silently she cautioned herself against giving off any encouraging signals helene meant well but she simply didnt understand im sorry about guy she said he was a nice man yeah zack debated telling her about the envelope but decided against it especially since it still lay unopened on the seat of the camper are you off for the afternoon she asked nope im due at the office in a couple of minutes i um actually i came by for a consultation she eyed him suspiciously seriously he said she started to protest but held back helene was right he did have great eyes damn you paul she thought annie she asked no thank goodness norman seems to be hanging in there all right with her she doesnt care much for him though she says she doesnt trust him no i dont need advice from suzanne cole cardiologist i need it from suzanne cole mother interesting she said in that case let me just change my expression from knowledgeable and unflappable to disheveled bewildered and exhausted okay you may proceed across the gallery the dowager and her husband had shifted their attention to morriss three deer a stream and the cosmos a garish rendering with luminescent stars and tiny sparkles in the water its a consult ive got to do for phil brookings zack said an eightyearold boy name reflexively suzanne picked up a pen and doodled years on the corner of a pad nelms toby nelms the kid hasnt spoken more than a word or two to anyone in five months brookings is ready to enter therapy with him but he wanted me to evaluate him first i think hes terrified at the prospect of spending hour after hour locked in his office with a kid who wont talk that does sound awfulespecially for a shrink but the child doesnt exactly sound neurosurgical probably not but he might be neurological apparently hes been having some sort of psychomotor seizures psychomotor sort of a grabbag diagnosis meaning i dont have a handle on whats going on some variant of temporallobe epilepsy is as close as i can come based on what brookings told me during the first seizure just before he stopped speaking he destroyed his room there have been a number of others since then so why isnt it temporallobe epilepsy well for one thing although there is this rage component like we see in temporal obe patients theres also an enormous fear component the kid acts as if hes absolutely terrified of something and for anotherand this is whats really disturbingthe recovery time is getting longer and longer with each episode it sounds as if these seizures or whatever they are are associated with some actual increased pressure in the boys brain cerebral edema quite possibly thats frightening until now the swellings been reversible but as you know at some point a vicious cycle sets in edema causing high fever causing more edema and so on are there any triggers triggers you know something that sets off an attack oh no not that anyone has picked up on brookings wants to put him on dilantin or one of the temporallobe epilepsy drugs but he wanted me to check the boy out first i thought maybe you could give me some hints about dealing with kids around his age has he had an eeg i want to get both that and a ct scan but according to brookings the little guy gets so agitated when he gets anywhere near the hospital that its been next to impossible to get any kind of technically satisfactory study the hospital brookings swears that the kid looked through his office window at the hospital and bolted he had to chase him across the parking lot and actually tackle him absently suzanne had scribbled the words and hospital on her pad i assume brookings has looked for the obviousa bad experience in the hospital something like that she asked uhhuh repair of an incarcerated hernia a year or so ago is all your pal mainwaring did the work i reviewed the record the boy was in overnight but there were absolutely no problems suzanne added hernia and no problems to her list was it done under local something like pentothal and gas i think it was why no reason just throwing out thoughts i had the same anesthesia and im still talking up a storm so i dont think thats it across the room the tourists were embroiled in a heated debate the dowager gesturing toward cosmos and her husband toward symphony any suggestions zack asked suzanne scratched lines under several of the words on her pad just one off the top she said dont see him in your office what and do your best not to look like a doctor either or to call yourself doctor hell probably know you are one but theres no sense in making a big deal of it unlike most grownups kids dont get impressed with our title they just get scared you mean see him at my place or even his place or better still somewhere neutral what about that plane you were telling jen about shes very excited about that is there any way you could put on a show for this child excellent idea zack said of course i could thats perfect i have just the place the meadows up at the top of gaston street you know where that is uhhuh weve been there that sounds just right when are you seeing him wednesday wednesday at onethirty say listen that being wednesday and all why dont we meet up there at say eleventhirty we can have some luncha picnic you can bring jen and i cant she said too quickly what i mean is we already have plans zack im sorry yeah sure another time well thanks for the coffee he cleared his throat and pushed off the stool i um i guess id better get back to the hospital zack she said as he headed off he turned back zack i i really am sorry about guy yeah he said the hurt in his eyes unmistakable me too he turned again and was gone stonily suzanne tore the sheet from her pad and balled it in her fist perhaps it was time she herself made an appointment with phil brookings sterling had been every bit the refuge she had hoped it would be peace and beauty a good job and time to spend with jen that was all she had wanted and all she needed why was this happening now excuse me miss the dowager her husband hovering behind stood by the stool zack had just vacated huh oh sorry suzanne said i see youre interested in gerard morriss work yes is he local f one town over hes growing more popular every year why had she lied to him about wednesday jen did have plans with friends but she was free why had she lied well the woman said my husband and i are most interested in the work on the left the one with those lovely deer could you tell me its price its eibhteen hundred oh the woman said i see she scanned morriss mimeoed resume has he had any gallery shows outside of this area boston new york no suzanne said realizing that despite her taste in art the woman was no novice at buying it i dont believe he has maybe helene was right maybe it was time to stop running scared well the woman said that being the case dont you think the asking price for his work is a bit high suzanne eyed her for a moment and then flipped the crumpled list into the wastepaper basket as a matter of fact she said i do for years people had called her the witch of west eightyseventh street but hattie day had known better they called her batty hattie and filed petitions claiming her cluttered apartment was a health menace and her family of cats against the law but hattie hadnt cared on her infrequent trips to the store children taunted her and even sometimes threw things at her but hattie had understood and still loved them as much as she loved her cats for years people had said that she was crazy but because she had known better hattie had just smiled at them but now since the terrifying events that had followed her trip to v hattie smiled at no one because now hattie knew they were right it was nearly two in the morning exhausted but reluctant to sleep hattie hobbled to her stove lit a cigarette from the burner and then put on a pot of tea she was only sixtytwo but with her pallor her long unkempt hair and her cadaverous thinness she looked eighty she sank into a tattered easy chair and studied her hands there was nothing about the bony nicotinestained fingers and the long curving nails to suggest the wonderful music they had once made the death of her parents in an accident had in effect ripped the violin from her handspulled her out of juilliard and into a succession of mental hospitals but over the years she had made do she had her apartment and her cats and her battered stereo and more than enough records to fill each day with music but that was before quebec shakily hattie stubbed out her cigarette hesitated a moment and then limped to the stove to light another the water had not yet boiled if only she had refused the invitation to martins wedding she thought if only she had stayed home where she belonged none of this would have happened but martin her cousins son was really the only family she had and when he was at juilliard he had stopped by often bringing food and usually a record or two and staying long enough to tell her about his studies once he had even brought his guitar and played for herbach and several wonderful villalobos pieces hattie smiled grimly at the memory the bus ride up to canada had been easy enough and the wedding had been beautifulespecially the chamber groups made up of martins friends it was during the ride home that the dreadful ache in her leg had begun the bus driver had turned her over to the ambulance people in sterling new hampshire and within an hour she was in the operating room having a cloth artery put in to bypass the clot in her groin they had called her recovery a miracle after just a week in the hospital and two weeks in a nursing home she had gone home martin had driven her back to manhattan and had even gotten one of her cats back for her from the animal protection people a miracle it was just a day after martin had dropped her off that the frightening episodes had begun without warning her mind would go limp for an hour or more at a time she would sit staring at nothing unable to move or to focus her thoughts knowing what was happening but powerless to control it the colors in the room would become uncomfortably bright all sounds unnaturally muted sometimes she could force herself out of her chair other times she could only sit and wait for the terribly unpleasant episodes to pass twice she had wet herself she knew she was becoming insane then as if verifying her fears some of the bizarre episodes had begun exploding into horrible vivid distorted reenactments of her surgery the teapot began whistling hattie pushed herself upright put a tea bag into a chipped stoneware mug and poured in the boiling water on the way back to her easy chair she stopped and put on one of the albums martin had left with herelizabethan music and english folk pieces with martin featured on his guitar perhaps she thought it was worth calling martin and telling him she was going mad she looked about for orange the cat he had retrieved for her during the last of her nightmares she had hurt it somehowknocked out a tooth and cut its lip since then the animal had spent most of its time under the bed or behind the bookshelf hattie sank heavily into her chair for a brief time martins playing brought her some serenity and even some sweet glimpses into her dim past there was a set of dances that she felt sure she had once played at a recital and a lovely rendition of a song by thomas stewart next came her favorite a gentle and haunting flute and guitar duet of greensleeves bit by bit her fears began to loosen their grip then as they had twice before that day the colors in the room began to intensify no hatties mind screamed please god not again the mus grew faint and gradually faded into the hum of traffic passing on nearby columbus avenue no hattie felt the unpleasant inertia begin to settle in the glow from the lamp across the room hurt her eyes please god desperately and with all her strength she forced herself to her feet and grabbed her cigarettes and stumbled toward the stove not this time she said out loud goddamn it not this time she thrust a cigarette between her lips and shakily turned the burner knob the gas flame flashed on hattie hattie just relax the voice deep and soothing seemed to be coming from everywhere at once then from above her hattie saw the bluegray eyes smiling at her over the mask just relax now theres nothing to worry about nothing at all i want you to begin counting back from one hundred please hattie count one hundred ninetynine good hattie keep counting keep counting ninetyeight shes under ninetyseven ready everyone okay ninetysix no wait please youre wrong im not asleep im not asleep yet suction up wait knife please no not yet not yet hattie day screamed as the scalpel cut into the wall of her lower abdomen her screams intensified as flame leapt from the stove and ignited first her hair and then her robe snap please now another hattie reeled across her apartment knocking away pieces of fiery cloth the rug began to smolder she fell to the floor as the scalpel cut down her abdomen and over her groin flames seared her face and scalp she retched from the smoke and the acrid smell of her own burning flesh retractors ready please the voice bored through the pain the knife cut deeper sponge no over here right here her clothes now a mass of flame hattie day lurched to her feet and plunged toward the window okay now retract here shrieking and now engulfed in flame the woman they all called the witch of west eightyseventh street hurled herself through the glass and out into the summer night ten stories above the street tuesday morning descended on zack in the guise of one of his sneakers set neatly and carefully on the side of his face by cheap dog selfcentered brute he mumbled working his eyes open one at a time the world has to turn upside down just because you have to take cheap dog responded to the rebuke by licking him on the mouth okay okay mopface you made your point zack scratched the animal behind one ear and made yet another in a long series of promises to get him a haircut im afraid i havent been paying much attention to you lately old boy thanks for being so understanding feeling sluggish and less enthused about a day at work than he had in some time he pulled on a pair of surgical scrub pants emblazoned property of municipal hospital of bostonnot to be removed for any reason let cheap dog out into the backyard did fifteen minutes of lackluster calisthenics and finally started water for coffee suzannes striking change of attitude toward him was he knew one reason for his unpleasant humor and as wonderful as making love with her had been he wished now that they had played things differently but weighing perhaps even more heavily at that moment was guy beaulieus legacy for most of the prior evening guys envelope had remained unopened in the camper in fact at various times throughout the day zack had actually considered returning it in that state in the end though he realized that his decision to do what he could for the man had been made well before meeting with his widow and daughter and in fact even before the terrible events in the quiet room as he dripped hot water through his chemex filter and scrambled two eggs with some chopped peppers onions and bits of leftover bacon zack mulled over his initial impressions of the surgeons strange and bitter legacy it was after midnight when he had finally returned home from a long walk with cheap dog and brought in the envelope too tired to read with much comprehension he had spent two hours sifting through the material and sorting it into piles on the dining room table from what he could tell the ultramed hospitals corporation whether responsible for guys difficulties or not had had a tiger by the tail there were dozens of newspaper clippings and official documents plus computer printouts a number of typed and amended lists of corporate officers and boards of directors and several smaller envelopes filled with hastily scrawled handwritten notes beaulieu and his researchers had been thoroughly preparing themselves for battle still despite their diligence it looked to zack as if the evidence they had accumulated of ultrameds avaricious business practices was circumstantial and vague zack felt certain that although the assorted documents might raise some eyebrows among the hospital trustees they were lacking the one essential ingredient that might turn that concern into votes a fleshand blood exampleeven oneof the dangers of such practiceswhat rock hudson had been to aids or the challenger explosion to the dangers of space exploration without such a rallying point such an emotional linchpin zack knew that beaulieus efforts were ultimately as doomed as the man himself in addition to the evidence against ultramed the envelope contained a diary during the early morning hours zack had done no more than scan the small spiralbound notebook now after clearing a space on the table for his breakfast he opened it randomly not surprisingly the writing almost all of it in fountain pen was meticulous and precise december th several patients cancelled today including clarisse lfrenniere spoke on phone to her she was reluctant to say anything had to beg her finally admitted that her son ricky had heard at school that i had seen one of the girls in his class for a lump on her neck and had undressed her and made her lie on my examining table and then that i had walked around and around the table touching her no such patient exists in my records or memory made several calls to parents of any young girls i had treated they admitted to having heard rumors but denied any of them dealt with their daughters they were all quite distant and embarrassed i feel i may have done myself more harm than good by contacting them called ricky and begged him to give me the girls name he could or would not finally clarisse took the phone from him told me not to call again and hung up i will not stop trying zack glanced at several other pages some of which outlined more of guys efforts to dive beneath the murky sea of rumors others described clashes with members of the medical staff the local newspaper and even certain patients taken as a whole it was a chronicle of the agonizing disintegration of a mans life allegations of malpractice none of them substantiated or backed up with a suit ietters of complaint to the newspapers and the hospital most of them anonymous rumors of sexual misconduct rumors of inappropriate behavior patient defections blow after blow humiliation after humiliation yet guy beaulieu had refused to knuckle under on one page he seemed heroic on the next pathologically obstinate as zack scanned the notes the fine line separating the two conditions grew even less distinct the chances that a man is in the right increase geometrically by the vigor with which others are trying to prove him wrong the maxim was one of zacks favorites and he had cited it any number of times over the years but never had he felt it in his gut the way he did at this moment still there was more than gut instinct to consider there was the incriminating letter from maureen banas along with other damning evidence frank claimed to have there was also guys explosive and irrational behavior in the emergency ward on the morning of his death and finally there was the lack of any really good explanation as to why the man might have been singled out for destruction in the first place certainly his widows belief that ultramed was trying to rid itself of a potential troublemaker was possible but the response seemed absurdly out of proportion to the threat guy posedlike shooting a fly with an elephant gun zack retrieved cheap dog from where he was lurking beneath the window of a neighbors unspayed collie and chained him on a long run in the yard then he showered dressed and headed for the hospital wondering what he would do if he had to confront marie fontaine and her mother with hard evidence that guy had been in fact irrational unstable and paranoid even with a negative autopsy the man could have been in the early stages of alzheimers or struggling with nonanatomical mental illness as he was pulling into the small doctors only lot at the hospital zack flashed on another sayingthis one from a poster he had tacked to the wall of his med school apartment just because you re paranoid doesnt mean theyre not out to get you the emergency ward was in a louderthanusual morning hum with several private physicians doing minor procedures and the e r physician of the day wilton marshfield huffing from one of four active rooms to the next clearly upset that things were not proceeding at a more gentle pace zack stopped by the lounge for one final cup of coffee and was in the process of failing to confound two candy stripers with a thumb palm when he was paged for an outside call zack its brookings here phil brookings oh yes phil if youre calling about that youngster nelms i had to postpone his appointment because of guy beaulieus funeral ill be seeing him tomorrow afternoon zack glanced over at the candy stripers one of whom was completing the morethanpassable thumb palm of a penny on her first try i know the psychiatrist said the boys mother called me she was how can i say a little concerned that you told her to meet you on the side of some mountain i promised her i would check with you to see if ah if there was anything further i could do actually zack said smiling at brookingss discomfiture its near the base of the mountain not on the side oh i see well ill just give mrs nelms a call and reassure her that youre not the how should i say the eccentric she thinks you might be this time zack laughed out loud phil forgive me for being glib the truth is i probably am the eccentric she thinks i might be but this time at least im just doing what i can to avoid the difficulty you had its a little tricky doing a detailed neurological exam on a moving target i understand brookings said although his tone suggested some lingering doubts ill speak with the boys mother and make sure they show up and just in case perhaps you should wear your sneakers the kid is fast thanks phil ill be in touch zack hung up as the candy stripers still practicing were preparing to leave the lounge here you go ladies he said one more this ones called a finger roll in it this perfectly normal american quarter will be magically transported across the tops of my fingers and back without the aid of a crane bulldozer or my other hand between the second and the third roll the quarter slipped between his fingers and plunked into his coffee now i suggest that you two stay away from this trick until youre old enough to work with hot coffee he warned he stood proudly by the cup and waited to retrieve his coin until the bewildered pair had left the room me eccentric he muttered as he headed through the emergency ward thats ridiculous absolutely ridiculous a set of x rays five views of a teenagers cervical spine were wedged up on a fourpaneled viewbox in the corridor hours later when the tension and excitement had died down and there was time to reflect zack would be unable to explain what it was about those films that had caught his eye but in that one microsecond as he passed by something did it might have been the widening of a shadow or perhaps the slightly unusual curve in the lateral view or it might have been nothing more or less than the instinctive processing of the films against thirteen years of study and god only knew how many other cspines in how many other settings whatever it was something made him stop turn and study the x rays in more detail the fractures of vertebrae c and c were far from the most obvious he had ever seen but they were certainly presentand unquestionably unstable if the spinal cord had not already been damaged a sudden twist or turn or bump could be disastrous either way he certainly should have been called in on the case he checked the name and birthdate stacy mills age next he cut through the nurses station looking for wilton marshfield the portly physician was hunched over a counter hurriedly writing a set of discharge instructions next to the instruction sheet was a soft cervical collar hi zack said moving close enough to verify that the instructions were in fact for stacy mills he looked past the man to bed where a dark pretty girl in riding jodhpurs and a lavender tshirt was waiting with her parents she was sitting on the edge of the litter with her feet dangling down and she was rubbing gently at the base of her skull oh hi iverson marshfield said he glanced up only long enough to nod and then returned to his writing this is one bitch of a morning ill tell you saw you at beaulieus funeral yesterday terrible business terrible wilton could i talk to you for a moment zack asked softly marshfield shook his head cant stop right now he said pulling a prescription pad from his clinic coat ive got to get rid of this kid and then i still have two more patients to see im getting too old for this pace iverson too damn old tell your brother hed better hurry up and get this place straightened out so i can get back to my trout stream and my grandchildren its about that girl youre getting ready to send home zack said stacy mills marshfield squinted over at the girl and then picked up the cervical collar and the instruction sheet and began writing a prescription for a muscle relaxant fell off her horse and strained her neck muscles he said as he wrote look iverson he added curtly im sorry i snapped at you the other night but please just dont make any trouble for me today im too far behind to listen marshfield zack whispered i just looked at her films over there she has a fracture two of them i think cone and ctwo the older man froze in slow motion his pen wobbled in his fingertips and then fell clattering onto the counter are you sure he rasped zack nodded jesus come let me show you moments later zack led a mute badly shaken wilton marshfield across to stacy mills and her parents hello stacy mr and mrs mills he said my name is iverson zachary iverson im a neurosurgeon he glanced back at marshfield who looked as if he were listening blindfolded to the final counts from a firing squad inwardly zack smiled if the man was waiting for gunfire he was in for a pleasant surprise hey wilton relax he was thinking as far as im concerned this business of ours has never been a contest or a game its life its the real bananae and its hard enough to do right even without the bullshit and the oneupsmanshipw you did the best you could and thats all we gotany of us theres no way i would hang you out to dzy dr marshfield here has just made an excellent pickup on stacys x rays he said he spotted a shadow he didnt like and wanted me to check it before he would consider sending her home im afraid his suspicions were correct stacy there is a small fracturea broken bone right up here i knew it stacy said see mother i told you it was killing me is it dangerous the girls mother asked it would have been zack said slipping the soft collar into place if it had gone undetected it could have been a blooming disaster but everything is under control now youre going to be just fine mrs mills reached over and squeezed a stunned wilton marshfields hand her husband patted him on the shoulder now stacy zack went on first of all i dont want you moving your head around okay okay good then there are some things i must explain to you and to your parents about what we do for cervical fractures dr iverson please the girls mother said before you start i d like to get stacys auntmy sisterover here would that be okay certainly but i dont see she helps me understand medical things im sure you know her shes the head nurse here maureen maureen banas chapter ten although operating room at ultrameddavis was newer than some of the dozens zack had worked in the ambience was no different the sounds the lighting the tile the filtered airtinged with the unique mix of antiseptic and talc and freshly laundered gownsprovided sensations as familiar to him as reassuring as the mountains the stabilization of stacy millss neck was proceeding flawlessly standing by the head of the table zack paused savoring the sensations the wonder of what he was able to do and the bond he was feeling with the rest of the o r team the sound systemfranks brainchild now installed in nearly all ultrameds hospitalswas playing george winstons magical treatment of the holly and the ivy all set he asked the scrub nurse the woman nodded all right then he said evenly stacy this is the part i told you about were going to twist those four screws into place on your head ive put lots of novocaine in each spot so they wont hurt but it will feel funny and you might hear the grinding noise everything is going just fine i know its scary for you but theres really nothing to be frightened about im not frightened the girl said at least not too much good and you remember what you have to do dont move she answered exactly zack checked the position of the cervical halo one last time and worked the four screws farther into place through the small incisions he had made in the girls scalp unless i tell you to dont move from a spot several feet behind the o r team wilton marshfield watched his every breath a sigh of relief even though zack iverson had publicly gone out of his way to share credit for the pickup with him and had privately assured him that this sort of cervical fracture was the toughest of all to diagnose he sensed that he would never be truly comfortable in the emergency ward again he had come out of retirement and into the e r as a favor to frank iverson and because he was bored now he knew it was time to stop and thanks to iversons brother after forty years of busting his hump of doing his best to survive first the knowledge explosion then medicare and the paperwork crunch then the malpractice crisis and now the goddamn corporatepolicy crap he could at least go out as something of a winner god love ya kid he said softly as zack tightened the apparatus in place god love ya okay stacy zack was saying thats one now wiggle your toes the way i showed you good now your fingers good good were almost there he stepped back for a moment and shifted his focus from the metal frame to the fine features and peaceful face of the girlwoman biology organic chemistry anatomy and physiology boards and more boards endless nights and weekends on duty or on call countless meals of cafeteria food or nondescript leftovers in cardboard containers countiess hours in the o r and on the wards scattered days and weeks and even months of consuming selfdoubtat moments like this one the choices he had made in his life and the price he had paid made so much sense and when it was over when the girl who loved to ride horses walked away from the hospital and from the split second that could have paralyzed her forever he would take that moment and bankroll it in his mind as vindication for all the years and all the anguish and as a hedge against those outcomes yettobe which would not bring smiles and handshakes and pats on the backoutcomes that as long as they were unavoidable were no less a part of medicine than this one thats it stacy he cooed as he tightened down the last of the screws thats it youre doing perfect were all doing perfect with the elective surgery schedule now an hour behind o r was emptied out as soon as the last screw was in place and the proper position of the halo was verified zack accompanied stacy mills to the eastwing room where for a few days she would be observed for signs of spinal cord swelling or compression well you just take it easy stacy he said im going to go talk to your folks and then ill send them up ill be back to see you at the end of the day wearing this device wont be the most fun youve ever had but like i said it wont be forever dr zack the girl called out as he was leaving in the operating room i said that i wasnt scared well now that its all over i can tell you that i really was i just didnt want to sound like a baby zack returned to the bedside and smiled down at her in that case he said ive got something to tell yousomething ive never told any patient before he bent over her bed and whispered im always a little frightened and a little nervous when i operate you are really the truth i think it helps my concentration never to forget that its always possible that something could go wrong there i said it and hey dr mills i feel better already youre very silly do you know that i hope so he said as he was leaving the girls room zack spotted maureen banas approaching down the corridor she was in her late forties or early fifties he guessed with short graying hair that looked as if it had been cut by an amateur although she carried herself with authority the tension etched into her face and the lack of attention to ten or fifteen excess pounds hinted at a life that had perhaps not been an easy one congratulations dr iverson and thanks she said with an almost clinical lack of emotion stacy is a very special child to a lot of people we all owe you a great deal for what you did in that case he wanted to say tell me about the nail you helped hammer into guy beaulieus coffin listen he replied instead justseeing her moving those arms and legs and piggies of hers is enough to get me through six months of the usual neurosurgical nightmares besides its wilton marshfield you should be thanking i was just the technician nonsense i know he missed those fractures sticking up for him was a very kind thing for you to do especially with the altercation you two had last week wiltons really a sweet old guy most of the time but he misses too much he misses too much the opening however slight was there zack glanced past the nurse the corridor was quiet there might have been a more appropriate time and place but one day after guys funeral and only hours after reading his diary thoughts of the man were too close to the surface for zack to walk away from this opportunity sort of like guy beaulieu in that respect he said yes maureen banas looked at him queerly i beg your pardon i was asking about your impressions of guy beaulieu i was with him when he died you know of course i know her strange expression had not faded i thought a lot of dr beaulieu to die the way he did was was very tragic she averted her gaze and peered around the corner into stacys room well she said i guess id better check on my niece and get back to the emergency ward thank you again doctor mrs banas wait please zack said the woman stopped her back still to him her posture rigid please he said again slowly she turned to face him her arms were folded grimly across her chest yes mrs banas i i read the letter you wrote about guy what little color there was drained from the nurses face your brother had no right to go passing that around she said the woman looked about restlessly dr iverson i think id better go mrs banas just a minute ago you said that you owed me a great deal for what i did for stacy well i dont usually call in markers like this but i need to know about guywhat hes been like these past two years what he did that prompted you to write those charges please its terribly important to me and to his family maureen banass reaction was far from the anger or defensiveness zack would have anticipated she began to tremble and quickly grew close to tears i please i dont want to talk about it your brother said he would speak with me before showing that note to anyone he had no right to give it to you look zack said i didnt mean to upset you im just trying to get to the bottom of thingsto the truth it took several breaths before the nurse began to regain her composure dr iverson ive got three children one of them retarded and an exhusband who hasnt sent a dime of support in ten years im sorry i wrote that letter but but i had to i had to now youve got to leave it alone for my sake for my family leave it alone i beg you i cant mrs banas maureen i dont want to cause trouble for you or for anyone but ive got to know if that letter contained the truth about guy please the woman said nothing what is it he asked did someone pressure you to write it threaten to take your job away the nurse bit her lower lip her eyes had filled with tears she glanced nervously about two nurses were approaching down the hall come with me she said softly there was a small sitting area at the end of the corridora colonialstyle maple settee and two matching chairs arranged beneath a huge picture window that faced southwest toward the mountains maureen banas took one of the chairs and motioned zack to the edge of the settee closest to her dr iverson i meant what i said about my family she began in a hoarse whisper if you speak of this conversation to anyone and i lose my job you will have hurt a number of people who do not deserve to be hurt you have my word i im terrified about doing this please at the beginning of the summer i qutteled with dr beaulieu in the e r we never got along all that well to begin with but i think we more or less respected one another it doesnt make any difference what we fought about the whole incident was actually pretty mitd but there were a number of witnesses a week or so later there was an envelope stuck under my door at home in it were ten onehundreddollar bills a copy of the note you saw and instructions that when i copied the note over in my own hand and sent it to mr iverson i would receive a second equal payment no hint of who the note was from once again the nurse seemed close to breaking down none well did the note say what would happen if you refused it said that trouble would start happening in my life and that i could count on being fired dr iverson i know what i did was awful but but i had been doing so poorly with the kids and the damn bills just keep coming in and please maureen you dont have to explain zack said i understand that you did what you had to do do you still have the note the nurse shook her head i i was afraid to keep it any sense at all as to who sent it do you think it was my brother zack felt sick at the thought i i dont believe so she said why do you say that well whoever wrote me added at the end that if frank iverson learned my note wasnt really my idea he would be tired just as quickly as i would be she began to cry you see why you cant say anything to anyone about this yes maureen i see telling me what you did was a very brave thing to do i promise you that ill honor your confidence ththank you she dabbed at her eyes with her uniform sleeve and then hurried back down the corridor feeling more sadness toward the woman than anger zack propped his foot on one of the chairs and gazed across at the presidential range hikine climbing camping unique challenges in the office and in the o r the projected life that had drawn him back to sterling suddenly seemed so remote so naive guy it appeared had been right all along someone at ultramed was committed to driving him from practiceand in the ugliest of ways zack was grateful that that someone did not appear to be frank but in the end would it really matter in sterling at least frank was ultramed and when push came to shove it was hard to imagine him lining up against the company the situation was so crazy so far removed from a patient needing help and a physician trained and ready to render it but for better or worse zack acknowledged he was in it to stay he had chosen this town and this hospital and now if he had to do battle with ultramed to justify that decision then battle there would be all he needed to complete the circle to place himself once and for all squarely where guy beaulieu had stood was proofif not proof from maureen banas then perhaps from the ultramed system itself if guy was right if the policies and the climate created by the corporation were so ruthless and selfserving if compromises were being made and corners cut in the name of profit then somewhere there was the medical tragedy such a philosophy must inevitably bring somewhere there was that emotional focal point that would translate possibilities and abstract concerns into flesh and blood and if such a tragedy existed zack vowed sooner or later he would find it from his position at the nurses station on west donald norman md propped annie doucettes chart on his ample lap and peered over the top of it at a rubenesque young nurse named doreen lavalley she was standing on tiptoes atop a small stool stretching over her head for a bag of iv solution the skirt of her uniform was at her midthigh and rising doreen was the sexiest most desirable woman in the hospital at least to the ultrameddavis chief of staff for months he had been cultivating her with small talk friendly pats on the shoulder an arm about the waist and impromptu teaching sessions since his arrival at the hospital four years before norman had gone out of his way to keep his reputation spotless and to portray the perfect responsible family man and community servant the powers at ultramed rewarded such behavior just as vigorously as they punished actions that brought negative publicity down upon their house but after four consecutive yearly merit awards he believed that the company would tolerate a few slips and with his wife gaining weight and growing more involved with her school committees and steadily less involved with their physical relationship doreen lavalley had become worth the risk besides norman reasoned frank iverson was rumored to have made it with half the decentlooking women in the hospital and he had been made a member of the golden circle and had twice won the highest administrators award that ultramed offered just as her skirt was about to reach the base of her panties doreen located the right iv solution and hopped down from the stool donald norman cursed under his breath morning doreen he said tugging at the small bulge that had materialized behind annie doucettes chart how goes it oh dr norman hi hey i told you he whispered with a conspiratorial wink when no ones around you can call me don listen id like you to make rounds with me if thats okay mr rolfe has some interesting findings in his chest and that that harpy mrs doucette should still have her murmur the nurse glanced about well im a little behind in my work and oh come on he urged i just have these two on this floor it shouldnt take long i well okay as long as its just two and dr norman annies a nice lady really she is just give her a chance its don remember norman said and as far as annie doucette goes she may be a sweet old lady to you but shes been a harpy to me he checked the three by five file card he carried on her besides he added its all academic to all intents and purposes sheg out of here youre sending her home doreen asked with disbelief norman shook his head not home he said to the sterling nursing home provided they can clear out a bed remember under the diagnostically related group systemyou know the drgsmedicare pays by the diagnosis not the length of the hospital stay our job is to get patients out as quickly as possible what norman did not mention although they were certainly on his mind at that moment were the ultramed incentive points awarded for discharging patients before the end of their drg period and the even greater number offered for a transfer to a leewardowned nursing facility i dont think annies going to like that idea the nurse said shes very independent well then norman said tucking her chart under his arm and adjusting his tie well just have to reason with her wont we bring your order book along just in case by the way he added as they started off im giving an inservice on hepatitis next thursday evening i hope youll be there well actually i i think flo bergman the ultramed nursing director will be up from boston id like her to meet you with the ultramed director of nursing and the davis chief of staff on your side theres no telling what opportunities might open up for you annie doucette flipped off the quiz show she had been trying to watch settled back on her pillow and stared up at the ceiling the pains in her chest little more than twinges throughout the previous day had begun to intensify and for the first time since the horrible night of her admission she was frightened there were gaping holes in her recollection of that night but not gaping enough to erase the agony and the humiliation she felt to say nothing of the disruption she had caused cinnie iverson the judge and their family she should never have accepted their invitation to dinner she told herself never after twentyodd years of doing her work proudly and well of being the glue that held the iverson household together she had become nothing but a burdenan imposition and source of worry for everyone if only she could have just gone as her husband had quickly and painlessly in his sleep she chewed two rolaids from the pack her son had bought for her and tried to focus her thoughts on the sweaters for her grandchildren and the afghan for the church bazaarunfinished projects waiting for her at home in her flat all she needed was a few more daysa week maybein the hospital and everything would be okay she had not given in to the aches and pains and the passing years yet and she would not this time the rumblings in her chest were probably nothing more than indigestion anyhow annie closed her eyes as bit by bit the discomfort yielded to a gentle sleep a week that was all she needed a week to get her strength back then everything would be okay everything would be back to nonnal again it felt so good to nap so good to drift off so good so mrs doucette how are we doing this morning donald norman boomed startled annie felt another slightly more urgent twinge in her chest we have felt better dr norman annie said opening her eyes only after the last vapor of sleep had drifted away oh hello doreen dear hi annie and what seems to be the trouble norman asked annie debated whether or not to repeat what she had already told the nurses about the pains donald norman had never paid much attention to her complaints anyway im getting some pains she said finally norman thumbed through her chart doreen look heres the description i wrote of that murmur right here a gradetwo systolic lets listen and see if its changed he slipped his stethoscope down annies nightgown listened for a few moments and then guided the nurse to the bedside with his arm around her waist and gave her a turn hear it the young woman looked at annie uncomfortably and nodded dr norman she said annies been having chest pain on and off since yesterday morning of course she has norman said as if he and the nurse were the only two in the room i would bet dollars to doughnuts that they started right after i mentioned her discharge from the hospital it happens all the time people get anxious did you order an ekgt its right there in the front of her chart good he said good work he scanned the tracing well it shows nothing to be alarmed at just the same twave changes in the anterior leads here see right here ill explain how theyre different from other twave changes after we finish seeing these two patients he turned back to annie so if everything else is okay i think we should begin to plan for your discharge im not feeling well enough to leave yet dr norman i know dear i know norman took her hand to pat it but annie pulled away youre bound to be nervous at the prospect thats why ive arranged for you to i wish to stay in the hospital for another week or so she said then i should be ready to go home mrs doucette you didnt let me finish i was saying that im in the process of arranging a bed for you at the sterling nuruh convalescent facility a couple of weeks there and you should be ready to go home i wont go annie said flatly sitting up in bed to confront the man you are not going to stick me in any nursing home i shall stay here for one more week and then i shall go to my own home im afraid thats not possible mrs doucette well she said ill just speak with mr frank iverson and well see what is possible and what is not feel free to do that if you wish mrs doucette but frank iverson is not taking care of you i am and i am telling you that your hospitalization is about to run out and you will not be able to remain here for another week that is the rule in fact it is one of the rules frank iverson is paid to uphold now please calm down and try to realize that what im doing is in your best interests before she could respond annie felt another stab beneath her breastbone under the sheet her fists clenched youre not a very good doctor you know she managed finally you not only dont take very good care of yourself you dont take very good care of your patients either donald norman glanced back at doreen lavalley his face flushed with anger and embarrassment the old woman was a goddamn harpy there were no two ways about it not only was she jeopardizing a hefty set of bonus points for him but she was making him look like a goddamn asshole in front of doreen as well mrs doucette he said sternly well discuss this later meanwhile lie back and get some rest doreen come with me please he turned on his heel and stalked from the room the nurse looked down at annie and shrugged helplessly ill be back a little later she said i want her to get some valium norman ordered when they were out of earshot no no on second thought make it haldol one point five by mouth every eight hours give her the first dose now doreen lavalley hesitated norman smiled at her and patted her on the shoulder hey doreen dont worry he said this is absolutely routine stuff nobody wants to go to a nursing home but some people have to and listen i didnt get to be chief of staff in this system by not caring about my patients if anything i care too much believe me its all for the best the haldol will calm her down and by this evening shell be a thousand times easier to reason with you just watch okay now about my inservice talk next thursday what do you say we chapter eleven the fleet monoplane cut through the warm midday air like an arrow soared over the dense forest panoply and then across the broad grassy field it dipped and looped like a yoyo barrel rolling again and again sunlight exploding off the hand polished crimson butyrate paint of its wings at the far edge of the meadow it nosed upward streaking toward a solitary puff of cloud in an otherwise flawless sky from his spot on a large boulder zachary watched intently as his fingers through minute movements of the stick atop his radio control choreographed the flight a stall a spin a roll out a second pass over the field zack had built the fleet as a high schooler and although he had sometimes gone a year or more without the opportunity to fly her he had kept the engine and the finish in perfect condition with a final wide bank he eased the model upwind and set her down sweetly in the grass the plane was as always fascinating to watch and this day with any luck she would be more than just a hobby this day she would be a toot to help him unlock the tortured silence of a young boy hey ace that was a nifty piece of flying suzanne dressed in snug white shorts and a dartmouth tshirt stood on a small rise looking as if she might have just drifted down from the sun she had a plaid blanket draped over one arm and a wicker picnic basket hanging from the other you know he said squinting up at her about twenty minutes ago i started getting this funny feeling you might show up do we have time for lunch she asked making her way down the slope zack glanced at his watch about fortyfive minutes im glad youre here suzanne stretched on her tiptoes and kissed him lightly on the mouth me too she said can i set this food out or is cheap dog lurking somewhere no no mopface and the fleet out there are avowed enemies sort of like sibling rivalry hes home digging up the yard she spread the blanket and set out dishes of fried chicken smoked fish and salad then she extracted a small portable radio set it on the grass and fiddled with the dial until she found wevo the announcer was thanking his guests for participating in midday roundtable and inviting listeners to stay turned for a special edition of music of the masters you must think im a little crazy for the way ive been acting around you she said as she poured lemonade i wanted to apologize zack shrugged no need he said youve had a few more important things to deal with than me perhaps just the same ive been acting like a jerk and im sorry he reached over and brushed her cheek with the back of his hand fair enough he said if thats what you need then apology accepted there do you feel better zack i i want to explain hey i dont require any no i want to she studied her hands at least i think i do for much of the night she had sat with helene struggling to come to grips with the past nothing matters except the truth her friend had said nothing matters except how you really truly feel right here in your gut i go out the way i do see men the way i do because i honestly know in my heart that i hate being alone otherwise id stay at home or join the ammonoosuc valley quilters believe me i would you dont have to do it my way or anyone elses way for that matter but your own suze butand its a big butyou cant keep fighting your feelings you cant fight who you are if you think you care about the man tell him who you are where youve been if he can deal with it fine if he cant thats his problem it all had made so much sense while they were talking now suzanne was not so sure there was more than a little to be said for living the safe life the meadow abutting the low hills southwest of town glowed verdant and golden in the dry afternoon sun for a time they ate in silence save for the deep cultured voice of the wevo announcer who was extolling the virtues of an english composer whose name zack missed zachary suzanne said suddenly the other night was the first time ive made love in more than three years well you certainly havent gotten rusty he replied i would also guess that whatever the reason for those three years of celibacy it wasnt a lack of offers she smiled at him wistfully youre sweet actually there havent been that many i havent been able to trust any man enough even to be encouraging if youre trying to make me feel special youre doing a great job you are special zack my husbandmy exhusbanddid an incredible hatchet job on my life and then left me for dead the scars that formed just dont seem to want to heal i dont put all the blame on him for what happened i could have put my foot down when i figured out what was going on i could have gotten out but i stayed i always told myself it was for jen but looking back i realize that i simply couldnt admit to myself how blind i had beenhow badly i had misjudged the man i had married and i couldnt accept that he didnt care enough about me to change you were young twentythree if you call that young and not a very worldly twentythree at that paul was a ph d brilliant handsome charming as hell already an associate professor at thirtyfive every woman in school had a crush on him unfortunately what they didnt know what i didnt knowwas how sick he was inside he was a sociopath zachary a womanizer a drug addict and a glib an unbelievably glib liar he used me in every way imaginable he used me she searched zacks eyes for any signs of judgment or revulsion but saw only sadness you dont have to share any more of this if you dont want to he said taking her hand no im okay much better than i thought id be youre really very easy to talk to for several years she went on paul stole prescriptions from the hospital made them out to his women or his cronies or to people who didnt even exist and signed my name he had my signature down even better than i did he hit up a dozen or more wholesale houses and worked his way through just about every pharmacy in the state jesus suzanne gazed off toward the mountains to the south and began rubbing at her eyes are you okay zack asked huh oh sure im fine fine she fished through her purse and put on her sunglasses where was it you were telling me about the prescriptions listen if you want to change the subject its perfectly no no it feels good to be able to talk about it she reached beneath her sunglasses and again rubbed her eyes besides theres not that much more to tell somehow paul must have found out that the dea people were on to me because a week before they showed up at our door he emptied out our bank account sold everything we had of value and took off no note no call nothing jen was only two at the time a year or so later i heard that he was teaching at a medical school in mexico somebody else said they snv him at an international conference in milan but by that time all i wanted was never to hear his name again what happened to you pardon i asked what happened to you suze are you sure youre all right is the glare bothering you no why nothing nothing what did you ask suzanne lets just leave it for another time no now whwhat was it she continued to stare off at the mountains the muscles in her face had grown lax and expressionless her hands had begun to tremble zack studied her uncomfortably he glanced at his watch barbara nelms and her son were due in ten minutes suzanne she did not respond listen he said shutting off the radio and putting it back into the wicker basket i think maybe youve shared enough for one day he began repacking the leftovers im just happy you felt able to talk about it with you know ridiculous as it may sound suzanne went on fluidly im not sure i know exactly what happened next zack looked at her queerly the lifelessness was gone from her face and her voice and she was as animated as ever he battled back the urge to again ask her if she was okay one minute i was suspended from the hospital sitting in lawyers offices fighting with the child welfare people and trying to fend off the dea animals and the next i was here in sterling putting in pacemakers zack studied her for any lingering sign of distraction but saw none it was as if a cloud bad passed briefly across the sun and then had suddenly released it he forced concern from his mind she seemed as she had claimed to be absolutely fine did frank have a hand in that he managed i guess one day he called the next day he came down and interviewed me and the next day it seemed the pressure that had been on me from all those sides began to disappear well good for frank zack felt his tension recede we havent been getting along too well lately i think ill have to try a little harder im not really sure if it was him or ultramed she said but someone got the wolves off my back thats a horrible story except for the ending it is call that part of it the beginning zack said i hope telling you all of that helps you see why ive had a little problem with letting a man back into my life and also why i feel obligated to support ultramed wherever i can thanks to paul loyalty has moved ahead of just about everything else on my list of qualities that matter in a person i understand she kissed himonce and then again the last drop of his worry vanished so she said still cradling his face in her hands just be patient with me okay just once in more than three years huh he repacked the last of their lunch and pulled her down to him as soon as we have a little time id like to help you improve on that average she brushed her lips across his neck in that case just dont stop trying my horoscope told me to be on the lookout for a tall dark stranger who did coin tricks he ran his fingers slowly down the back of her thigh and over her calf thanks for the picnic he said thanks for dessert and listen good luck with the nelms boy i hope this works out if you get anywhere today i think we should consider writing up our technique for some journal we can title the article pediatric neurology alfresco she pushed herself to her feet zack walked her to her car and watched until she had disappeared down the hill then he returned to the field absently humming a passage from fantasia on greensteeves by ralph vaughan williams toby nelms looked chronically ill his skin was midwinter pale with several small patches of impetigo alongside his nose and at the corner of his lips he was thin as a war orphan and carried himself with a dispirited posture his gaze nearly fixed on the ground but it was the listless dull gray of his eyes that worried zack the most they were the eyes of utter defeat which he had encountered so many times in terminally ill patientsthe eyes of death at zacks request barbara nelms hugged her son promised to return for him as soon as she had finished shopping and drove back down the hill to town if toby was frightened at her departure his dispassionate expression hid the fact well he had spotted the fleet almost immediately and had glanced over at it twice before she had even started to drive off zack reflected on brookingss account of the childs terrified dash across the clinic parking lot and knew that for the moment at least he was making progress a tumor a seizure disorder a congenital slowly developing vascular abnormality a toxic reaction to something the boy was consuming without anyones knowledgezack had balanced the possibilities against the psychiatric diagnoses and found all of them wanting he had even made a brief drive around the boys neighborhood searching for a landfill or other dumping site where toby might be sustaining a chemical exposure nothing hi kiddo zack said kneeling on the grass two yards away from the boy my name is zack there was curiosity in the boys eyes but no other reaction im a doctor but im not going to examine you or do any tests or even touch you please believe that i would like you to learn to trust that i would never lie to you and that i mean exactly what i say okay ill say it once more i will never ever lie to you i asked your mom to bring you here because i thought it might be easier for us to get to know one another outside the hospital at the mention of the word hospital a shadow of fear darkened the boys expression your mom will be back as soon as she finishes her shopping zack added quickly meanwhile we can lie around or explore or even climb up to that little cliff over there this place is called the meadows i used to play here when i was a boy he flashed momentarily on suzanne i still do in fact he added tobys eyes darted again toward the fleet i built that plane over there a long time ago zack explained it flies by remote control he held up the control box for the boy to see she loops and rolls over and zooms up to the clouds go ahead take look at her toby nelms remained where he was but there could be no mistaking his interest go on its okay im going back to the car for a second to get some fuel for her only when he had reached the van did zack turn back the boy was kneeling by the fleet and was ever so gently running his fingers over the shiny lacquered finish of her wings too anxious to stay away for the last fifteen minutes of the agreedupon hour barbara nelms rolled to stop some distance downhill from the meadow and made her way quietly toward zacks van half expecting to find her son waiting there in near hysterics for her return what she found instead was a note taped to the rear window mrs nelmstake a peek if you want but please try not to be seen no words from toby yet but were getting there i need another hour please call my office and ask my receptionist to do the best she can with my schedule see you later z iverson from just beyond a small rise she could hear the highpitched whine of the modelairplane engine crouching low she worked her way up near the crest of the hillock she flattened herself in the tall grass and then peered over zachary iverson sat alone his back toward her her son was nowhere in sight suddenly terrified at what she might have done by trusting a man who was little more to her than a voice on the phone she began to scramble to her feet then just as quickly she dropped back down the boy was there nestled between the physicians legs sharing the stick of the radiocontrol device thats it fella she heard zack cry over the noise a little more a little more and now the plane which had begun a slow roll across the grass shot forward and then up climbing at a steep angle toward the treetops at the far end of the meadow thats it youve got it now ease off ease off terrific hold her right there now well above the trees the model banked smoothly to the south and began a lazy circle of the field i did it i did it it took several seconds for barbara nelms to realize that the excited voice she had just heard was her sons with a joyful fullness in her throat and tears in her eyes she slipped back out of sight and hurried down the hill zack and toby nelms lay opposite one another on the warm grass a few yards from the fleet chewing on stalks of wild barley and watching a redtailed hawk glide in effortless loops atop high midday thermals now just who do you suppose is working the radiocontrol box for that model zack asked whoever it is has sure built one quiet engincl thats goofy toby nelms said of course it is any one with half a brain could tell thats just a kite now if only i could see the string once the logjam of silenceof fear and mistrusthad been broken the boys words had come with surprising ease and even occasional spontaneity zack had been reluctant to test the progress they had made with any pointed questions but now with just a few minutes left in their two hours together he felt comfortable enough to try you know kiddo he began a lot of people have been very worried about you these past few months i know but you still wont talk to anyone toby shook his head not even your parents the boy stared vacantly at the crucifix soaring overhead they never help me he said suddenly i scream for them and beg them to stop the the man from hurting me but they never come until its too late they never stop him what man zack asked at once repulsed and fearful at the thought of the boy being molested whos been hurting you toby turned away hey kiddo im sorry i didnt mean to say anything to upset you or frighten you for a few anxious seconds zack feared he had pushed too hard and slammed the door he had so gingerly just opened the man with the mask toby said without turning back mask the boy shifted restlessly and then drew his knees and elbows in tightly to his body zack decided he had gone far enough for one day he reached in his pocket for a coin one good thumb palm and they would call it quits he he cuts it off toby said in almost a whimper and and then it grows back and then he cuts it off again cuts what off toby look i know its hard for you to talk about but youve got to try he moved to put his hand on the boys shoulder but then thought better of it he felt his heart pounding dont stop now kiddo dont give up on me now my my peenie and my balls too do you mean he touches you no he cuts it off he promises he wont hurt me he promises hell fix my lump and then he cuts it off and it hurts it hurts and i scream at him and he wont stop and i scream for my mommy and daddy and they never come the boy began to cry his shoulders jerking spasmodically with each heavy sob again zack moved to touch him but before he could the child spun and flung his arms around him please zack he cried softly please dont let him do it anymore he promises hell fix my lump suddenly the childs words registered toby zack whispered still holding the boy tightly the lump youre talking about is it your hernia that place here you had fixed the boy nodded his body still racked with sobs and the man with the mask is that the doctor again a nod zack eased him away but continued to hold him by the shoulders toby look at me i think youve just been having nightmares bad horrible dreams but dreams that often go away as soon as you see them for what they are the operation was perfect all thats left is a little scar the lump is gone for good no the boy said angrily it isnt it grows back so does my peenie and my balls but then he cuts them off again and it hurts worse each time inwardly zack sighed relief the boys profound disturbance was rooted in a nightmarethe expression of pentup fears surrounding a procedure now nearly a year in the past fascinating but certainly neither difficult to understand nor as bad a situation as he had feared at least brookings would have something to work with you dont believe me do you toby said its not a dream he cuts them off and they grow back and then he takes those metzenbaums and cuts them off again zack felt a sudden vicious chill he takes what there was no hiding the incredulity in his voice the metzenbaums he asks for them from the nurse and then he sticks them into me right here and it kills me then he just cuts and cuts toby think zack said urgently have you ever heard anyone else say that word what word metzenbaums toby have you ever heard anyone except the doctor in your nightmare say that word toby nelms shook his head zack released the boy and sank back on his hands something was wrong something was terribly wrong metzenbaum scissors were commonly used in surgery but rarely if ever until after the initial skin incision had been made toby nelms would have been asleep at the time they were called for anesthetized there was no way he could have heard that term let alone so accurately understood what it meant no way but somehow he had by the time zack had finished rounds and headed from the hospital to his office evening had settled in over the valley to the southwest the silhouetted mountains were ebony cutouts against the deepening indigo sky it was a quiet awesome evening perfect for a run by schroon lake or for a horseback ride into the foothills to watch the moonrise it was an evening to celebrate the joy of living but for zack the magic of the evening was lost in reflection on the agonized struggles of an old surgeon and the desperate plea of the nurse who had condemned him and in concern as to how much to tell the waiting parents of a child who was sinking deeper and deeper into a hell of dreams that were not dreamsdreams that cut and hurt and maimed as he crossed the parking lot zack noticed franks porsche tucked in its reserved slot early mornings late evenings weekendsfor whatever his shortcomings and the failings of his past the man had become a demon of a worker soon zack knew the two of them would have to talk there were things frank needed to learn of and to understand about ultramed about guy beaulieu and now especially about toby nelms the boys condition was clearly on a downward spiral and each passing day was a lost ally in the struggle to uncover the truth with franks help the odds of finding answers in time to make a difference would be considerably shorter but would he listen over the years the two of them had drifted far apart in many ways the disagreement over guy beaulieu had only underscored their differences still zack reasoned they were brothers and they each had a significant stake in ultrameddavis and in sterling he glanced back at the porsche at seven that morning when he had arrived for work it was already there now after more than thirteen hours frank was still at it what more testimony did he need the man had hitched his wagon to the ultrameddavis star if there was a threat to the integrity of the hospital he would listen zack felt sure at least of that much but he also knew that all he had were theoriesgut sensations plus a few million questions his brother was a company man if there were trouble in his paradise it would take more than suspicions to enlist his helpmuch more barbara nelms and her husband were waiting on one of the stone benches that flanked the entrance to the physicians and surgeons clinic bob nelms cleancut fit and hardy had clearly borne less of the daytoday strain of tobys illness than had his wife he greeted zack with a firm hand pleasure to meet you he said barbara tells me you made some real progress with our boy thats excellent excellent using that plane of yours was just a super idea thank you but you know im no professional but ive been trying to tell barbara all along that this was all just a nasty phase and that when that kid of ours was doggone good and ready he would get through it it sounds like you two made quite a large step in that direction today call it a baby step zack said despite the machismo in bob nelmss words and manner one look in his eyes and zack knew the man was whistling in the dark as a supervisor at the mill he was used to accepting the burden of difficult problems and solving them his thinshelled denial would require delicate handling and constant awareness that tobys condition was no less baffling and frightening to bob nelms than his impotence in the face of it as zack followed the couple into the elevator he wondered once again how much to share with them it had never been his way to withhold information from his patients or when the patient was comatose or a juvenile from their families but this was not information it was the purest conjecture and even when he tested the explanation on himself it sounded nothing short of phantasmagoric mr and mrs nelms i dont know how to tell you this but i believe that your son was not asleep during his hernia operation last year he appeared to his surgeon and anesthesiologist to be fully anesthetized but somehow at some level he not only saw his operation from within his body but it would seem he jitlly experienced the pain of it as well now in some perverted distorted way he is reliving that surgery in terrifying flashbacks much like those described in lsd users no i dont have any idea how that could happen no to the best o my knowledge such a phenomenon has never been reported with the anesthetics he received no i dont have any hard evidence to back up what i say no i dont know what could possibly be causing the attacks no i dont have any idea i dont know i dont know i dont know his suspicions were vague fantastic and virtually without proof disclosure of them to the boys parents would almost certainly precipitate premature action by them against ultramed the hospital and the physicians involved in tobys surgeryaction zack was in no position yet to support and which could well lead to a coverup of the truth whatever that was mr and mrs nelms he began once the couple was settled in across the desk from him im afraid i dont have very much to tell you at this point toby did not share a great deal with me however he did say enough for me to suspect that he is having very severe fright reactions and that while these reactions are occurring he is completely unable to distinguish them from reality in other words in just a few seconds apparently with very little warning he is transported from wherever he happens to be into another realitya very distorted very terrifying reality are you saying he becomes insane barbara nelms asked youve observed him zack responded still feeling his way along what do you think but but insanity is a condition isnt it a state of being how can it possibly flick on and off like a light and what has the hospital got to do with it bob nelms added i dont know zack said wondering how many more times he would hear himself repeat that phrase well what do you think zack tapped his fingers together stalling for a few more seconds to sort his thoughts as much as he hated deception this simply was not the time to air his theory i assume you are both somewhat familiar with epilepsy he began well most people think of epilepsy as an electrical disorder of the brain which causes periodic fits the seizures we are most familiar with are motor seizuresthat is they involve the muscles and the extremities but supposing the electrical explosion occurs in one or more of the cognitive areas of the brainthe thinking areas what would result would still be a seizure but it would be a sensory seizure rather than a motor one are you trying to tell us that toby has petit mal or temporallobe cpilepsy barbara asked ive read everything i could get my hands on about both conditions and quite frankly dr iverson i dont think tobys condition fits either one he is aggressive like temporallobe epileptics but only because he is absolutely terrified and very little of his behavior resembles the detached fugue reactions that ive read about in petit mal and although the resting electroencephalogram is not that accurate in making either diagnosis tobys was normal the one time he had it done zack felt his cheeks flush and cautioned himself against any elaborate untruths barbara nelms was too desperate and too bright she was tired of getting the runaround from medical and mental health professionals and she had done her homework well i dont know what to say mrs nelms he countered except to point out that if tobys case were straightforward and typical someone would have diagnosed it before now what about the hospital bob nelms asked again didnt the boy say anything to you to explain why he seems so frightened nothing specific zack lied but since thats the main clue we have i do feel thats the direction our investigation should go barbara nelms slumped visibly dr iverson investigations are fine but you saw toby hes like a stick his skin is getting infected he gets bruises from almost nothing he gets fevers with no evidence of infections hes dying dr iverson i swear time is running out our son is dying barbara dont say that bob nelms blurted his outburst hit a raw nerve dont tell me what to say and what not to say she snapped back youre in that damn mill until seven every night you dont see him doggone it barbara im doing everything i can youre the one who hasnt paid a bit of attention to anything but toby these past please zack said please i know this is hard on you both but sniping at each other isnt helping anyoneleast of all toby the couple stopped abruptly and exchanged sheepish looks were sorry barbara said she reached over and squeezed her husbands hand we never used to fight even at home alone but this has just got us all she looked away i understand mrs nelms all i can ask is that you both just do your best to keep it together and give me a little time to do some reading and talk to some people ill work as rapidly as i can i promise you that and ill plan on seeing toby again next week same time same field meanwhile zack shrugged meanwhile i dont think any specific treatment is indicated especially since i dont really know yet whats going on i will tell you that i dont take my responsibility for my patients lightly and im fully aware that we dont have all the time in the world ill do my very best to get to the bottom of things quickly he stood hoping to bring the exchange to a merciful end before barbara nelms could hone in on the inadequacies in his explanation thank you bob said standing as zack did and shaking his hand zack walked them to the outer door of his office and again promised to work as quickly as possible dr iverson could you just tell me one thing barbara nelms asked of course are you holding anything at all back from us zack had to force himself to maintain contact with the womans eyes it was a technique at which unlike frank he had never excelled no mrs nelms he said flatly no im not the woman hesitated and for a moment seemed poised to challenge the denial then she reached out and shook his hand that being the case then thank you doctor you will keep us posted yes she took her husbands arm and walked away with him down the darkened corridor zack watched until the elevator doors had closed behind them he ached from his lies and from the graphic reminder of the power of illness over the lives of whole families he also knew from her parting look that barbara nelms would never again allow him to hide behind evasions and halftruths he would review toby nelmss record again and then contact the national institutes of health library in bethesda for a complete search of the reported adverse reactions to the anesthe ics he had received finally he would meet with jack pearl and jason mainwaring beyond those steps there was nowhere to gonowhere except another session with toby himself and then the sharing of his suspicions with frank something had happened to the boy during his hospitalization at ultrameddavissomething devastating if nothing else panned out frank would have to realize that it was in everyones best interests that he pursue the matter he would cooperate or face barbara nelms and her attorney frank dont move honey please you feel so good i want to do a little while youre still inside me just a line okay i franks secretary the blond one was named annette dolan she had moved with her child to live with her mother in sterling and had been working as a hostess in the mountain laurel restaurant when frank first spotted her and offered her a job her qualification for the position was quite plainly that she looked better in a sweater than any woman he had ever seen she was a mediocre receptionist and a farworsethanthat secretary but she was sweet and polite to everyone and had proved a wonderful undemanding diversion especially on those occasions when he was able to indulge her passion for cocaine go ahead baby he said running his thumbs over her nipples but hustle i dont have much time left for more than an hour first on the oriental rug in his office and then on the couch annette had screwed him as only she couldpurely and passionately without any of the head games he tolerated but hated in brighter women he cradled her breasts in his hands as she slipped one end of a straw into her nose and lowered the other onto the mirror that she had rested on his chest thats it he whispered as she inhaled the dust get it all baby get it all he glanced across at the lucite clock on his bookshelf twenty after eight less than an hour until mainwaring was due less than an hour until the beginning of the end annette had been the perfect appetizer for that session now however it was time to pack her up and ship her home frank waited until she had wiped the last grains of powder off the mirror and onto her gums then he skimmed the mirror across the room and pulled her magnificent glistening body close to his slowly he toppled off the couch and on top of her on the rug she was beautiful to the eye and to the touch but after an hour and a hundred dollars worth of cocaine she held little excitement for him all that remained was the mechanical need to climax he grabbed her cornsilk hair tightly in his fists buried his chest against her breasts and rammed himself into her again and again until in less than a minute it was over if only lisette knew how much he needed this sort of uncomplicated unquestioning sex everything would be much better for them he thought much better he took a minute to stroke the womans clit her tight flat stomach and finally her perfect ass then he moved to the chair behind his desk and watched as she dressed once every week or two was perfectjust enough to keep the adventure fresh and the woman from becoming tiresome absently he thumbed through the papers on his deskpapers that included the application of the surgeon who would be mainwarings replacement the whole business had gone down like clockwork frank mused just as he had promised it would he and mainwaring had estimated two years and precisely two years it had been now there was less than an hour until the final phase of their project would start less than an hour until the beginning of the end until the beginning of everything good for him frank wrapped up what was left of the cocaine and flipped the plastic bag across to the woman here you go baby he said enjoy you promised you would try some with me sometime frank remember sometime maybe for now you just get on home and enjoy it he answered i dont have much use for that shit there are enough other things i get off on like you and he was thinking like a million dollars frank showered in the bathroom off his office dressed and cleaned up the last vestiges of his session with annette dolan then he settled in before the computer terminal on his desk there were still twenty minutes before mainwaring was duejust enough time to check in with mother and frank noted it was especially fitting that he should for at a time when his back was to the wall when the absence of he had borrowed from the hospital accounts and then lost in that foolish land deal stared at him every day like a gaping black hole of doom mother had provided him with the answer mother was ultrma the ultramed mainframe computer housed in the home office in boston she was the fiber that held the expanding ultramed empire together providing it with consistency rapid exchange of information and a seemingly endless pool of physicians and in franks darkest most desperate hour mother had served up both jack pearl and jason mainwaring frank activated the terminal dialed the network number and flipped the toggle switch on his phone in seconds good evening welcome to ultrmaplease enter access code appeared on the screen frank typed in the code and then when requested his own password in a week or so his regional director would receive a printout of ultrnla users and would note on the appropriate evaluation form that at nine oclock in the evening of that day frank had been hard at work in his office good evening mr iverson we trust all is well in sterling new hampshire do you wish to see your menu frank typed y immediately administrators menu flashed on followed by a list changes in procedures and policies manual ultramed current staff physicians and salaries your hospital only ultramed current staff physicians and salaries your region only available physicians by specialty promotions reassignments terminations past days national health news of note regional health news of note preferred suppliers and services your region only performance ratings region performance ratings nation golden circle administrators as he invariably did when communicating with mother frank began by affirming his membership in the golden circle and his position as the leading administrator in the northest region leading administrator golden circle it was laughable now to think of how close he had come to not even applying for the ultrameddavis job but with his electronics firm going down the tubes the judge refusing to help him out and leigh baron insisting that he would get serious consideration in the search process despite his lack of hospital experience he really had nothing to lose it had been a mild shock when he was finally offered the position and although there could be no arguing his remarkable success with the corporation it remained something of a mystery to him why leigh had picked him over many more experienced candidates frank scanned the regional and national rankings and then returned to the administrators menu and summoned up item four the physicians of possible interest to the ultramed system were listed by specialty and subspecialty along with a detailed but straightforward summary of their education and work experience however item four was hardly a typical employment bulletin board included with many of the names was a paragraph summarizing the professional andor personal difficulties that had made that physician available drugs alcohol sexual entanglements financial improprieties professional misconduct of one sort or anthercompiling the roster was the fulltime job of an obsessively diligent investigator in the home office primary among her responsibilities was the weeding out of those physicians for whom there was little or no hope of rehabilitation those remaining on the list many of them excellent practitioners were of particular interest to the corporation more often than not they proved to be devoted employees grateful for a second chance totally loyal to the company and its policies and willing to work for any salary that was reasonable steve baumgarten in the emergency ward had been recruited through ultrmas unique bulletin board so had suzanne cole a real prize who almost from the start had generated an income many times greater than her salary but for frank it was the onetwo parlay of jack pearl and jason mainwaring that had made mother worth her megabytes in gold for a time when franks back was to the wall when he was becoming so desperate about the that he was actually considering approaching the judge for help jack pearls name appeared in item four the description of pearls problem which frank eventually had memorized read holds patent on what he has claimed is revolutionary new general anesthe ic texas license suspended pending investigation of alleged illegal clinical testing of the substance and falsification of information on experimental drug application physician with same name resigned from wilkes community hospital akron ohio because of alleged sexual involvement with a tenyearold boy further information currently being sought mildly intrigued frank had made a note to do some checking on the man but had not put much energy into the project until not a month later ultrma served up a brief item on a professor of surgery from baltimore jason mainwaring had been found to be an officer and partner in a georgia pharmaceutical house and subsequently had resigned his position due to charges of conflict of interest and illegal use of an unapproved drug it had taken trips to maryland georgia texas and ohio an additional twenty thousand dollars in ultrameddavis funds to gather information and secure the cooperation of a certain politician in akron and finally a series of the most delicate negotiations with both physicians but in the end frank had forged the key to his future and now within the next two weeks the rest was about to become history for several minutes frank scanned the electronic roster of physicians he was amazed as always at how so many who held the ultimate ticket to success and prestige could have made such pathetic shambles of their lives a pediatrician from hartford about to complete four months in an alcohol rehabilitation center a gynecologist from d c who had resigned his hospital appointment amid a cloud of accusations that his aminations were too prolonged and included house calls an oral surgeon facing revocation of his license for writing too many narcotic prescriptions for himself frank jotted down several names along with a memo to himself to make some preliminary calls ultramed and its parent corporation had the clout to make any physicians background difficulties disappear to all but the most intensive investigation however its administrators had been well warned against using that service indiscriminately frank had just terminated with mother when with a discreet knock jason mainwaring entered the office he was dressed in a light cotton suit monogrammed shirt and white topsiders and looked very much like the plantation owner he planned to become as soon as his pharmaceutical company had successfully produced and marketed jack pearls serenyl drink mainwaring asked setting his briefcase down and then striding directly to the small wet bar in franks bookcase sure frank said quietly resenting the way the man as always stepped into a room and took charge bourbons fine the surgeon gestured at the huge aerial photo of the ultrameddavis complex nice little operation yall have here frank he said i think im actually going to miss it some but home is where the heart is right of course frank countered although i knew you had been up here too long when i heard a little yankee accent creep into that drawl of yours the other day mainwaring snorted a laugh as he scanned franks collection of cassettes mantovani mantovani mantovani he said disdainfully tossing them aside one at a time you know the closest thing you have here to beethoven is mantovani i like mantovani frank said i know mainwaring thought for a moment and then snapped opein his briefcase removed two cassettes and flipped them onto franks desk i know im probly tossin pearls to a razorback he said but here are some examples of real music for you its what i listen to in the o r call em a goodbye present this ones beethovens third its called the eroica and this ones by an english composer named vaughan williams its a fantasia on greensleeves listen to these two pieces and i suspect even you will appreciate the difference between real music and the burger mng brand youve been listening to sure thing jase frank said dropping the tapes into his desk drawer ill start my reeducation first thing in the morning i wont hold my breath mainwaring settled in on the sofa frank and annette dolan had so recently vacated and motioned frank to take the easy chair opposite him i hate doin business with anyone across a desk he explained unless its yours right frank thought he hesitated and then did as the man asked there was no sense in making an issue of it at this stage of the game so jason he said i assume youre still satisfied mainwaring took a file from his briefcase and opened it with this kind of money involved he said i wont be satisfied until our little anesthe ic is in every operating room of every hospital in the world but i am certainly pleased with thehe consulted the file four hundred ninetysix cases jack and i have completed i must say frank youve done all right you promised me five hundred cases in two years and you delivered like i told you when we first met jason i know this town the key to the whole project had been the rapid takeover by mainwaring of guy beaulieus practice and only frank and to some extent mainwaring knew how skillfully frank had engineered that feat details thats what it all came down to attention to touches like the letter to maureen banas threatening his own position should she ever disclose to anyone including him what was being done to her the sort of details he had neglected to attend to three years before pity about ol beaulieu mainwaring said blandly frank could not tell if the man was being facetious or not again he opted to avoid an altercation in the morning mainwaring would be gone and in a week or so he would be back to officially tender his resignation and to offer proof of a million dollars in franks cayman islands account and half a million in pearls in exchange for the patent frank now shared with pearl and all future rights to serenyl and that frank knew was what it was all about he would at last have squared away the shortfall in the ultrameddavis books and there would be a nifty little bundle left over to build on well he said dispassionately at least the old guy didnt suffer when my number comes up i want to go the same way so i assume you have everything you need to conclude this business with your company in atlanta mainwaring skimmed through his notes it would appear so frank heres that ah little agreement you insisted upon he passed the document over frank scanned the page to be certain it included mainwarings admission to having illegally used serenyl on five hundred patients it was franks insurance policy against any kind of deal being made behind his back in the morning the two of them would jointly place the confession along with similar ones from frank and jack pearl in a safe deposit box at the sterling national bank and upon mainwarings return to town the three of them would retrieve and destroy the documents together remember frank mainwaring warned i dont have the final say in all this my partners are still calculatin what its gonna cost us to go backward and do all the animal and clinical trials the fda insists on and frank laughed out loud jason please he said it costs tens of millions to develop and test new drugs that you dont even know are going to work let alone work safety youve got a gold mine here and you know it and i know it and your partners know it and even our little fairy friend pearl knows it after five hundred perfect cases without so much as one problem the only money youre going to spend is whatever it costs to grease a palm or two at the fda and to put together a few folders of bogus animal and clinical trials so dont try to shit me okay its unbecoming for a man of your class mainwaring shook his head ruefully there are a number of things im going to miss around here frank he said perhaps purposely intensifying his drawl but i confess you wont be among them be sure jack has all the paperwork and formulas ready for me in the morning y hear assumin my partners and our chemists give their okay ill be back in eight or ten days meanwhile i shall assume that you or jackll let me know if any problems crop up of course jason old shoe frank said but after two years and five hundred cases i dont think you have to camp by the phone waiting to hear from us next to birth death and taxes serenyl is as close as life gets to a sure thing and you know that dont you mainwarings eyes narrowed what i know he said evenly is that this little tatetotate has gone on long enough without offering his hand the surgeon snapped up his briefcase and left not until the office door clicked shut did franks smile become more natural in the interests of their deal he had allowed the pompous ass to walk over him any number of times during the past two years the son of a bitch even tried to tell him what music to listen to now with the work completed and so successful there was no longer any reason to defer to him and frank felt exhilarated that he hadnt after years of operating in the shadows of men like mainwaring and the judge it was time to start casting some shadows of his own his life had finally turned the corner he was a rising star in a powerful corporation and soon he would have the independence and prestige that only money could bring god bless you serenyl he murmured softly at first then louder and louder the familiar chant worked its way into his thoughts frank frank hes our man if he cant do it no one can four miles to the north suzanne cole screamed and leapt up from the couch where she had been dozing a vicious searing pain had exploded through her chest from beside her right breast bathe in a chilly sweat she tore open her blouse and ripped apart the clasps on her bra the scar from her surgery was red but not disturbingly so and the tissue beneath it was not the least bit tender still the pain had been like nothing she had ever experienced before desperately she searched her cloudy thoughts for some logical medical explanation perhaps a neuritis she reasonedthe single violent electrical discharge from a regenerating nerve yes of course a neuritis that had to be it no other diagnosis made sense shaken but relieved she sank back onto the pillow then she checked her watch fortyfive minutes that was all she had napped she needed more than thatmuch moreif she was going to catch up with the sleep she kept losing every night it was lucky she had taken time off after her surgery the strain of the whole affair seemed to have taken more of a toll on her than she had anticipated slowly her eyes closed perhaps she should get up and take something before she slipped off again an aspirin or even some codeine at least then if the irritated nerve fired off again the pain would be blunted no she decided as long as she knew what it was there was nothing to be frightened about it had only lasted ten or twelve seconds anyhow if it happened again she could handle it for that short a time she could handle almost anything what she needed most was sleep relax breathe deeply breathe deeply good thats it thats it now she thought as she drifted off just what was it she had been dreaming about chapter twelve the white pines golf club course designed by robert trent jones was the pride joy and status symbol of its select shareholders sculpted along a narrow valley between two massive granite escarpments the layout was short but exceedingly tight and members still delighted in recalling the day in sixtytwo when sam snead playing an exhibition round from the championship tees shot an eightysix and lost two balls it was early saturday afternoon and for the first time in years zack was preparing to play a round of golfhis opponent judge clayton iverson zack had originally planned to spend the morning meeting with jason mainwaring and jack pearl and then the rest of the day not between the granite cliffs but on them climbing with a small group from the local mountaineering club however mainwaring had signed out for a week to greg ormesby the only general surgeon remaining in sterling and pearl too was away until monday morning and in truth as much as zack had been looking forward to making a climb he was pleased with the chance to spend a few hours alone with his father for the first time since his return to sterling typically the judges invitation to play had been couched in words that made refusal difficult he had also intimated that there might be more on his mind than just golf there would be he had made it quite clear just the two of them although whether frank was unable to come or had not been invited he did not say earlier in the day after making rounds thumbing once again through toby nelmss chart and trying to locate mainwaring and pearl zack had spent an hour on the practice range it had been a pleasant surprise to find that some vestige of his swing developed over dozens of childhood lessons remained like most sports that involve doing something with a ball golf had never held any great fascination for him but the rolling fairways perfectly manicured greens and even the sprawling tudor clubhouse with its shaded veranda and oriental rugs had always brought him a certain serenity especially on warm cloudless summer afternoons so zachary clayton iverson said as they approached the first tee just how interesting should we make it he was dressed in white slacks a gold lcoste shirt and his trademarkbrown and white saddle golf shoes although he could hardly be said to be in shape he carried his husky bulk with the easy grace of a natural athlete set off by a gnarled thicket of pure silver hair his tanned weathered face exuded confidence and authority that depends on how badly you need money judge zack said knowing that it was both fruitless and in bad form to argue with his father against a wager of some sort well then suppose we make it say a dollar a hole with carryovers ill give you a stroke on the par fives and the two long par fours lets see zack made the pretext of counting on his fingers eighteen dollars i guess i can handle that okay sir a dollar a hole it is i assume youll take it easy on me as always the judge set his ball on the tee and looked up at his son with a predatory smile of course he said just like always it was the most basic truth of the mans relationship with his sons and almost a standing joke among them over the years that he had never given them even the slightest quarter in anything competitive whether gin rummy at which he was a vicious profiteer golf or even business victories were to be earned or not to be had loans of even the smallest amounts of money were invariably accompanied by ious and were to be paid back in full and always with some interest zack knew that on this day as always not one punch would be pulled not one edge given away the judges drive to the genteel applause of a dozen or so onlookers split the fairway and rolled to a stop well past the discreet twohundredyard marker aware that he often felt less tension operating on a brain tumor than he did at that moment zack shanked his drive into the goldfish pond i hope you dont have any pressing engagements judge he said teeing up another ball we could be here for a while slow your backswing and drop your left shoulder a bit his father said zack did as was suggested and hit a bullet that bounced almost on top of the judges ball and then rolled several yards beyond thanks for the help he whispered tipping an imaginary cap in response to the applause from the small gallery enjoy it the judge said as they walked off the tee at a buck a hole thats all you get by the end of the front nine zachary was seven dollars behind and was ettiniz blisters on the sides of both heels from his decadeold golf shoes still the afternoon was warm and relaxing and he was enjoying a seldomexperienced sense of connection to his father born largely it seemed of casual snippets of conversation and brief flashes to afternoons long past like this one clayton iverson had asked about his new practice and shared a few anecdotes from the courtroom but otherwise had given no real indication that there were any items on the afternoons agenda other than golf following a brief stop in the clubhouse for a beer the judge dropped off the motorized cart he had used on the front nine and arrived at the tenth tee pulling his clubs on a twowheeled aluminum caddy i need the exercise he explained and besides with me riding and you walking and chasing those shots of yours all over hell and gone it didnt seem like we had much chance to talk out there very witty judge zachary said well just watch the out to quote the words of general custer at the little big horn we have not yet begun to fight he led off the tenth hole with a decent drive but his fathers shot sliced badly flew far to the right and disappeared into a bank of tall rough while they were scuffling through the heavy grass looking for the ball the judge waved the foursome behind them to play through if we dont find it by the time those four have putted out ill drop one fair enough zack wondered briefly about the amicable concession which was out of character for the man zachary tell me something the judge went on still searching through the rough have you encountered any problems with ultramed since you started working at the hospital problems hey you know what ill bet ill bet my shot went a little farther right than we thought lets try looking over that way judge yes what sort of problems are you talking about clayton iverson hesitated for a time apparently uncertain whether or not to continue the conversation guy beaulieu came to see me a few days before he died he said finally oh it was the second time he had been by in just two or three weeks he was very angry and upset he certainly was the judge said now leaning on his club and making no attempt to look for his ball he was also quite determined to prove that ultramed and frank had railroaded him out of practice as a means of setting up their own man this mainwaring in his place he claimed to have evidence that such underhanded dealings are typical of the company i know what he claimed what i dont know is why on earth he kept coming to you when you made it clear to him how strongly you supported frank and the excellent job hes done at the hospital they watched in silence as each of the passing foursome hit his approach shot three of the balls landed neatly on the green and the fourth hit by a grizzled old man whom zack placed somewhere in his mideighties landed in a sand trap as he invariably did when around very old people zack found himself praying that the mans coronary and cerebral circulations were at least at that moment functioning as nature intended the answer to your question zachary the judge said after the old man had hit is that guy was convinced that frank or no frank i would not want to see him go under for acts he never committed remember he and i went back a hell of a long way i cant count the number of committees and projects we worked on together over the past thirty years struggling to pull sterling up from the dying little mill town it once was as often as not we were on opposite sides of the fence on an issue but that never mattered we both fought like hell but we fought within the rules i understand so i guess he believed that based on the way we handled our differences and on my record as a judge i would champion any cause i felt was just and was he right the judge took a new ball from his bag and dropped it backward over his shoulder of course he was right he said you should know that as well as anyone sorry beaulieus dead but the issues he was fighting against if in fact they are issues at all remain very much unresolvedat least until the deadline to repurchase the hospital passes after that we are all quite literally at ultrameds mercy the buy back zack suddenly understood why frank had been excluded from the afternoon silently he cautioned himself against expressing any opinions until the judges position had become quite a bit clearer where clayton iverson and his scion were concerned interactions and reactions had seldom if ever been simple and straightforward while zacks schoolboy years especially after his accident had passed by quietly and by comparison virtually unnoticed the relationship between the judge and frank had been a turbulent volatile affair the man had soaked in his older sons accomplishments like an insaturable sponge and inevitably when franks heroics were slow in coming or worse when he did anything outside of the persona the judge had created for him there was friction thinking back zack wondered if either of the two ever truly appreciated the dynamics of those clashes if being judge clayton iversons second son had engendered certain problems for him being his first had proven something of a curse for frank he recalled the day when frank then a freshman or sophomore in high school had received an a on a history paper the teacher in her comments had noted that the writing style and content of the report were far beyond anything he had ever done before suspicious of the sudden improvement the judge had confronted frank in what he liked to call an eyeballtoeyeball showdown it was a technique that had seldom failed to uncover a lie from either of his sons and on that occasion frank was beaten decisively after an hour of confrontation he shuffled to his room and produced the seniors paper from which he had plagiarized the look in his eyes at that moment a frightening olio of fear hatred humiliation and anger was one zack would never forget the result of that showdown had been a zero on the report from the teacher and a fourgame suspension from basketball by the judge although he subsequently rescinded his punistiment after the coach pleaded that the team would suffer more from it than frank that confrontation and its aftermath said much of both father and son the judge feeling he had made his point regarding dishonesty in any form never again brought up the incident for his part frank was in fact discouraged from further academic shortcuts but only temporarily instead of responding to their fathers leniency with change he reacted with defiance and one boastful day not long after he disclosed to his younger brother that he had dedicated himself to learning how to win in an eyeballtoeyeball showdown at first he literally practiced before a mirror next came a series of what he called test fibs with time even in the most critical situations he was able impassively to meet the mans piercing gaze and to hold it in the years that immediately followed his conflicts with the judge fell off markedly due in part to franks mastery of his new craft and in larger measure to his athletic accomplishments then with franks repeated failures prior to ultrameddavis their relationship again became strained now after four years of relative concord a clash between the two menpossibly a monumental oneseemed to be in the making and as always in the past at the very heart of the matter were the judges expectations franks performance had to be the very best his conduct above reproach the foursome ahead of them finished putting and left the green the judge addressed his ball but after several seconds he checked back down the fairway to ensure that no one was approaching and stepped away zachary you look troubled he said what is it im not troubled its just that what zack shook his head its nothing judge go ahead and hit youre worried that im taking sides against frank is that it he is your son and you think that because of that i should turn my back on the possibility that he might be involved in something unethical or even dishonest i didnt say that what then zack stopped himself at the last moment from sharing details of guy beaulieus legacy of his encounter with maureen banas and of his mounting distrust of ultramed there were still simply too many uncertainties to open those cans of worms before he had had the chance to discuss them with frank judge he said carefully choosing his words guy beaulieu was trying his damnedest to bring down ultramed if frank fell with it that was no concern of his i appreciate your commitment to doing whats right but but what again zack hesitated one slip one misplaced thought and the judge would be off and running on another of his crusades in franks eyes the two of them would be aligned against him and ultramed and any chance of enlisting his help either in exposing the corporation or in solving the mystery of toby nelms would likely be lost for good judge frank has his quirks and his faults he said finally just like the rest of us but considering the expectations and the pressures hes had to overcome since those days at sterling high i think hes done some things we should both be proud of at the very least we should be going out of our way to give him the benefit of the doubt in this business so you think im being disloyal by wanting to know whether my son and the corporation he works for are making a profit at the expense of my community i didnt say that and you think its disloyalty to question whether frank might have had a role in the destruction of a mans reputation judge please im sorry zachary but ive spent more than thirty years as a lawyer half of them as a judge as far as im concerned doing what is right is far more important than any of that kind of socalled loyalty im not arguing with that its just that from what i can see this whole business isnt all that simple did you know that if it werent for franks using his influence at the hospital beaulieu would have been suspended some time ago the judge looked shaken no he said i didnt well its true of course the story of franks intercession had come from frank himself but zack saw no point in sharing that piece of information or for that matter his displeasure with franks behavior on the day of beaulieus death he was enjoying the chance to play his brothers advocate he also sensed that in arguing on franks behalf he was in some ways making a case for their fathers recognition of his own accomplishments in life the judge seemed surprised and upset by his stand again he addressed his ball although zack could see from his stance and his bloodless knuckles that his concentration was broken and suddenly zack understood his father had done something or at least was contemplating doing something that would not sit well with frank and now all at once he had doubts his swing was rushed and awkward the ball never really leaving the ground skimmed across the fairway and slammed into the recently vacated sand trap clayton iverson barely reacted to the horrible shot you know he said as they trudged toward the bunker from the day your mother and i first learned she was pregnant with frank we began to share visions of greatness for our children i dont suppose that makes us unique but i tell you son we spent many an hour by the fire that winter sharing our dreams we even named frank and then you after presidentslittleknown presidents but ones who did leave their marks on history inwardty zack sighed this talk was one he had endured many times over the years franklin pierce the only president born in new hampshire and zachary taylor the muchmaligned warrior who despite four historically undistinguished years in office established the department of the interior were special favorites of the judge betieve me judge zack said in what had become his standard response to the discussion both frank and i appreciate the values and the drive you instilled in us he paused to chip his approach shot onto the edge of the green and then watched as his father now totally off his game took two shots to get out of the sand trap by the end of the hole zack had cut his deficit to six dollars and following two ties and a disastrous seven by the judge on the thirteenth he had pared it by three dollars more judge he said motioning to the small refreshment kiosk by the fourteenth tee lets take a break anything that could upset you enough to play like this ought to be talked out im not upset clayton iverson said okay youre not upset you only went from shooting four over par for the whole front nine to shooting eight over for the first four holes since you brought up this business about the hospital why dont you have a seat at that little table over there and let me buy you a beer the judge started to protest but then relented maybe i am a little upset he muttered zack left him at the wroughtiron table and returned with two frosted mugs and two bottles of lowenbrau so whats going on zack asked as he sipped at his beer what do you mean i mean frank judge i know you helped him get considered for the job with ultramed is that why youre being hard on him because you feel responsible zachary the mess your brother made of that damn electronics company of his wasnt his first fiasco he just didnt have the patience for that kind of business he was constantly trying to go directly from step one to step twenty he was lucky the ultramed opportunity came along when it did i told him that when he clayton iverson stopped m midsentence when he what judge nothing it doesnt matter he asked you for a loan didnt he zack said suddenly pieces of conversations he had had with his brother over the years began falling into place although frank had never shared the details of his companys failure he had made it clear that he felt their father was at least in part at fault it was a foolish request he was already in it up to here it would have been throwing good money after bad frank didnt see it that way judge well i did i agreed to help him out of the hole he had gotten himself in but only on the condition that he get rid of that company the hospital job gave him a chance to get out from underneath that nonsense and to show everyone in town just what he could do to say nothing of bringing him back here under your thumb zack thought angrily so he got the job and hes done it well what more could you want from him i could want him to bring the same values to his position that i bring to mine thats what i could want i could want him to stand up for whats right despite the warm afternoon zachary felt suddenly cold whats right im the one with beaulieus evidence he wanted to shout im the one who confronted maureen banas how can you be so damned sure of whats right dad he said exactly what have you done you know zachary i dont particularly like that tone of yours you may be a bigshot surgeon but youre still my son zack sensed himself backing away from his fathers glare he couldnt remember the last time he had pushed against the man this hard sorry he mumbled apology accepted i think that thirty years on the bench more than qualifies me to tell when someones handing me a line of bull rhere was just too much smoke surrounding beaulieus complaints for there to be no fire i i didnt know until you told me that frank had intervened on his behalf he hesitated and then reached into the pocket of his golf bag withdrew an envelope and passed it over here he said read this mrs leigh baron director operations ultramed hospitals corporation boston place boston massachusetts dear mrs baron the contract effecting the sale of davis regional hospital to ultramed hospitals corporation is now in its fourth and final year as you are no doubt aware the agreement contains provisions for the reacquisition of the facility by the communitybased board of which i am chairman provided the board meets no less than five months prior to the termination date of the contract and agrees by a vote of no less than of its members to return to ultramed the original purchase pricea sum currently held in escrow in the sterling national bankin exchange for resuming control of the hospital until recently i had no intention of convening the board to consider such a vote however a situation has developed that greatly concerns mea conflict between dr guy beaulieu one of the first physicians to settle in sterling and your corporation it was the late dr beaulieus contention that the hospital administration and ultimately ultramed hospitals corporation itself was responsible for machinations calculated to drive him out of medical practice he further claimed knowledge of actions by your corporation through ultrameddavis which have been contrary to the best interests of our community i know that he had conveyed his feelings to you on several occasions and that he had in fact instituted legal action against both the hospital and ultramed hospitals corporation dr beaulieus widow has contacted me and has requested that the board seriously consider dr beaulieus allegations before the end of our provisional period at noon on july have asked mrs beaulieu to make every effort in advance of that date to supply me with details of her husbands claims and the evidence behind them meanwhile please consider this letter notification that i intend to convene the board at a m on friday july for the purpose of discussing our options also as provided in our contract i have commissioned a full independent audit of the hospital which i expect to be initiated within the next few days as you know according to section b of the contract percent of the hospitals profits over the past four years should have been funneled back into the community through the treatment of indigent patients and another percent through support of various civic projects enumerated in section c violation of that section even if uncovered after the july deadline will nullify our contract with you meanwhile if you have any information or thoughts on this matter i would welcome hearing from you hoping for an amicable resolution of this issue i remain sincerely yours clayton c iverson zack was incredulous beaulieus widow and daughter had given him no indication that they planned to contact the board directly judge just when did mrs beaulieu call you he asked well actually she didnt call me i called her and has she contacted other members of the board til um suggested she might want to do so oh judge why because ol guy might have been right thats why but frank said he wasnt why couldnt you have just given him the benefit of the doubt i i felt that if he hadnt done anything wrong he didnt have anything to worry about of course he does hes got to worry about how to explain to the people at ultramed why his own father would be trying to sabotage their hospital you dont even know what kind of socalled evidence guy had do you well do you clayton iverson shook his head i didnt think so well i do judge i know exactly what he had clothilde beaulieu gave it all to me at his funeral and i tell you there isnt enough proof of wrongdoing even to dent ultramed circumstantial stuff thats all he had accumulated just a pile of inferential lists anecdotes and newspaper clippings ill admit that i have some strong reservations about that company but up till now theres no hard evidencenot one person that i know ofwho was directly hurt by the corporations policies why couldnt you have just gone to frank talked to him thats what i had planned to do did he even see this letter before you sent it the judge took a long swallow of beer and wiped the foam from his lips with the back of his hand then he smiled i havent sent it he said simply what the letter is being held by my lawyer in boston until i decide what to do i was thinking about having him send it over to ultramed on monday i wanted to talk with you first now im glad i did zack felt drained and exhausteda yoyo on the string of a master you could have just told me what you wanted in the first place he said you cant play with people like that judge nonsense i havent been playing with anyone i needed your candid opinion and i got it im not committed to opposing turning the hospital over to ultramed for good next week im just reluctant to totally give up our leverage you never know when youll wish you had it the truth is it would take a hell of a lot more than anything ive learned so far to make me turn against frank and send that letter there do you feel better what i feel zack said is wasted good in that case suppose we play us some golf the judge set his beer down took his driver from his bag and wiped its head with a cloth im pleased with the things youve told me about your brother zachary he said i havent made any secret of my disappointment with him over the years but as long as he keeps acting for the benefit of our town then he and ultramed have nothing to worry about from me however if you learn of something anything that i should know then dammit you owe it to all of us to speak up clear clear zack said numbly including anything in that material of guys right the judge set his ball on the tee once again in control he looked relaxed and confident okay if i hit first he asked his swing was loose compact and smooth as velvet the drive was arrow straight and by far the longest of the day an hour later zack stood on the eighteenth green and watched as his father rolled in a twelvefoot putt for a birdie five straight holes for me the judge said thats eight bucks i just love this game dont you chapter thirteen dose by dose microgram by microgram the haldol level in annie doucettes blood had been rising the input from her senses barely adequate to keep her oriented before the tranquilizer was started had become blunted and distorted her periods of lucidity even in the bright noisy daylight hours had all but disappeared now as the muted stillness of late sunday evening drifted over the hospital what little hold she had been able to maintain on reality had begun to slip away one moment she was home in her own room her own bed in the next she was someplace else someplace at once foreign and familiar it was evening it was morning desperately she struggled against the madness desperately she tried to focus her thoughts still nothing was certainnothing except the realization that somehow she had wet and soiled herself call zack call suzanne her mind urged tell them to come and clean you up tell them to get you out of this place she turned to search for a telephone but a wave of dizziness and nausea forced her back onto the pillow lifting the sheet she stared down at her legs foulsmelling loose excrement was smeared over the insides of her thighs so disgusting so humiliating must get washed must get showered before someone comes annie peered through a gray mist toward the door of her bathroom shower clean up then callwho what was his e with all her strength she struggled onto her side there were metal railings along both sides of her bed using one of them and battling the constant spinning she pulled herself up how disgusting how humiliating there was no guard railing at the end of the bed with agonizing slowness she worked her way over the fecessoaked sheet then she dropped one leg over the low foot board and onto the chilly linoleum floor the dizziness was becoming unbearable still she knew she had to get clean an inch at a time she slid her other leg onto the floor with every ounce of her strength she tried to stand momentarily her leg held but then suddenly it gave way and for the briefest time she was floating in air she landed heavily and gracelessly air exploding from her lungs with a loud grunt there was another sound as wella sharp snapping sound coming from somewhere within her body an instant later unimaginable pain shot through her from her left hip second by second the pain intensified then a heaviness settled onto her chest slowly the dim light in the room faded and annie felt a merciful peaceful darkness settle in the night was heavyovercast and humid with not quite enough breeze for comfort it was nearing eleven when zack eased the judges chrysler into the largely empty parking lot outside the ultrameddavis emergency ward the judge hands folded stoically in his lap sat next to him his mother grim and silent rode in the backseat working over the handleerchief she had balled in her fists annie doucette was in trouble zack would have much preferred to evaluate the womans situation before involving his parents but a wellmeaning nurse unable to reach annies son in connecticut had noted that they were listed in her record as employer and had called them a fractured hip and new coronary were the only snatches a shaken cinnie iverson could remember to repeat to zack from that conversation zachary dear she said now as he helped her from the car do you think theyll operate on her tonight i dont know mom its doubtful though especially if the nurse i spoke to is right about her having had a new heart attack her doctorwhat is his name norman mom don norman dr norman did you speak to him he was in working on annie i didnt see any sense in bothering him and did frank say hed be right in yes mom hes waiting for lisette to get back from her sisters and then hell be in cinnie gave her handleerchief one last squeeze and then stuffed it in her purse well she said i just hope annies okay okay clayton iverson laughed disdainfully jesus cynthia what world do you live in the womans almost eighty years old and she just fell out of bed broke her hip and had a heart attack how in the hell could you possibly think shed be okay sorry cinnie said theres no need to cuss she added in a whisper directed more to herself than to her husband they entered the hospital through the emergency ward and took the elevator to the second floor annie had been moved back to the intensive care unit i why dont you two wait in there zack said motioning them into the small waiting room just outside the unit ill be back as soon as i find out whats going on anger and tension had knotted the muscles at the base of his neck and were gnawing at the pit of his stomach to be sure over the years of his training he had had patients fall out of bed even when strict precautions had been taken the risk was always there especially with so many hospitalized patients being old and infirm but this situation was different since he was a consultant on her case annie doucette was technically his patient but even more than that she was his friend in some ways she had been as much a parent to him as had cinnie and the judge and even beyond that he knew was the special proprietary feeling experienced by every physician toward a patient whose life he or she had saved he was on edge his physicians detachment and objectivity hanging by the thinnest of threads from the moment cinnie had called him with the news he had been reminding himself that while it was reasonable for him to be upset there was seldom if ever justification for a physician to lose objectivityeven when confronting oversight or negligence in the microcosm of the hospital explosions by physicians helped no one as he was heading into the unit sam christian one of three staff orthopedic surgeons emerged he was a tall gaunt man in his midfifties who walked with a slight limp twentytwo years before zack and his mangled left knee had been one of his first cases evening zack he said he glanced into the small waiting room judge cinnie hello sam the judge came out to shake his hand whats the story christian shrugged she needs a new hip he said matteroffactty but until her cardiac situation gets straightened out thats out of the question tomorrow if shes stilli mean if shes settled down ill put some pins across the joint to stabilize it until we can do something definitive do you know what happened zack asked were the side rails up on her bed christians expression darkened youd best talk to don norman about all that but yes apparently the railings were up she went off the end oh dear god cinnie gasped thanks sam zack said he turned to his parents ill be out in a little bit as he entered the unit he heard the judge say so sam level with me now who screwed up here zack had seen annie briefly during morning rounds at that time she was awake and responsive but somewhat depressed and more lethargic than she had been he suggested that she try spending more time out of bed and had actually offered to walk down the hall with her she refused citing a headache and lack of sleep the change in her over just fourteen hours even allowing for her accident was terrifying she was disoriented and combative her speech was thick and slurred her gray hair was matted against her scalp with perspiration and bits of feces from the doorway zack watched as don norman struggled to examine annies chest the portly internist had stripped off his suitcoat and rolled up his shirtsleeves but he was still wearing his tie vest and gold watch fob beads of sweat dotted his fleshy forehead and upper lip a young nurse stood off to one side her face drawn and pale need an extra pair of hands zack asked as norman stepped back from the bed the man looked down at annie and then shook his head no thank you doctor he said im just about done she okay if you mean is she going to die the answer is no at least not tonight since we got a line in and gave her some fluid her pressure has come up but shes extended her old coronary theres not much question about that and i guess you know that shes fractured her hip shes extended her coronary shes fractured her hip normans emotionless statementhis tacit implication that annie was responsible for her own misfortuneinstantly rekindled the dislike zack had developed toward the man during their interview many months before still there could be no arguing the truth in his grim assessment of her situation and prognosis pneumonia stroke embolism heart failure while orthopedists could work nearmiracles with hips in the operating room physicians and nurses knew all too well that immobilization of any sort was the deadliest enemy of advancing age zack moved to within two feet of the bed is she making any sense nope strictly word salad stroke i dont think so is there any evidence she hit her head norman shifted uncomfortably cci i havent really checked he said as you can see shes not the easiest thing in the world to examine right now mind if i try try anything you want norman responded somewhat testily then he glanced over at the nurse zack caught the look and warned himself against doing anything that would embarrass the man he took annies hand instantly she dug her nails into his palm hey annie d leggo its me its zack i need that hand for my coin tricks she looked up at him blinking as if struggling to peer through a haze then slowly she loosened her grip do you recognize me zack said already speeding through a neurologic exam annie did not respond well you should he checked her scalp for any telltale lumps and her neck for any points of tenderness you used to wipe my runny nose and drag me back to the bathroom to wash behind my ears remember that although it remained uncertain whether or not annie recognized him there could be no doubt that his words had calmed her down she lay reasonably still as he checked her eardrums and retinae well norman asked his arms were folded tightly across his chest zack smoothed annies matted hair off her forehead there are no focal neurologic signs lets go out to the nurses station and talk ekay is it all right if i listen in the nurse asked pausing between words to clear a huskiness from her voice fine with me if dr norman doesnt mind norman hesitated and then shook his head we havent met zack went on my names iverson zack iverson im the new neurosurgeon on the block im doreen lavalley she said annie was my patient up on four i feel sick about what happened we had her tucked in with the side rails up she soiled herself i think she was trying to get to the bathroom when she fell we were all in with a postop patient who had started hemorrhaging and our routine bed check was delayed almost an hour and and were just she bit at her lower lip and d away go on zack said as they walked from the cubicle to the nurses station for a moment it seemed as if the young woman was going to cry then a flash of anger mixed with the anguish in her eyes dammit she said i knew something like this was going to happen what do you mean she glanced over at donald norman and then turned again to zack were short she blurted thats what i mean were short a nurse on every shift on every tloor except the unit here its been that way for more than a year first they got rid of the union with all those promises of increased pay and benefits and staffing then just slowly enough so that none of us could organize to complain they began to cut back on nursing i knew something like this was going to happen i just knew it her fists were clenched in frustration whos they zack asked the hospital thats who the administration mr iver she stopped in midword and looked sheepishly at zack oh great way to go doreen brother zack nodded sorry she said dont be don youre the chief of staff are the physicians aware that this has been going on normans face was pinched and flushed however his indignation was directed not at the situation but at the nurse if miss lavalley has complaints about this hospital or the way it is run he said his back almost turned to her there are channels established for her to voice those concerns shes worked here for enough years to know thatand also to know that airing her own distorted point of view in the middle of the intensive care unit is not one of those channels now doctor if youd care to share your thoughts on mrs doucette with me i can get on with the business of trying to save her life the woman tensed at normans rebuke but said nothing zack wrestled against the urge to defend her and won a narrow victory the issue at hand was getting annie doucette diagnosed treated and stabilized the nurses charges disturbing though they were could wait he thought about calling suzanne in but quickly tabled the notion annies monitor pattern was regular at least for the moment and donald norman as thinskinned as he was thickwasted seemed hardly the sort to welcome any encroachment on his authority so norman asked impatiently well theres no evidence for a stroke or for head trauma zack said but shes clearly disoriented i guess if i had to put a label on whats going on i would say shes sundowningespecially if her blood chemistries all come back normal out of the corner of his eye zack saw doreen lavalley nodding in vigorous agreement sundowning was not a medical diagnosis in the pure sense nevertheless to anyone dealing with elderly hospitalized patients the disorientation and psychotic behavior stemming from unfamiliar surroundings and the diminished sensory input of evening were as real and reproducible a phenomenon as a strep throat excellent norman said his expression and patronizing tone making it clear that zack had added nothing to his assessment of the case good job listen doctor why dont you dictate a note and ill put a formal request for a consultation in her chart he unrolled his sleeves and retrieved his suitcoat if theres nothing else im going to see another patient ill stop back on my way out zack engrossed in annies chart did not respond what are you looking for norman asked an explanation for what zack glanced up don this womans been here almost two weeks during which time shes been totally with it dont you think its a little strange that she should have taken this long to sundown on second thought norman said why dont you just forget about the consult well discuss this whole thing in the morning its there dr iverson the nurse said norman shot her a withering glare what is zack asked the explanation look on the med sheet give me that chart norman snapped miss lavalley you dont know a good thing when you have it do you you just get the hell out of here ill deal with you tomorrow you can deal with me tonight dr norman because ive had enough i quit haldol zack exclaimed slamming his fist on the page what in the hell is she doing on haldol the nurses fury was not uncontained dr normanexcuse me don she corrected herself sweetly put her on it tuesday when she complained about his plan to transfer her to a nursing home he called her a harpy damn you norman hissed his face now puffed and crimson a nursing home norman are you crazy is who crazy frank iverson hands on hips stood just inside the unit door zack rubbed at the grit of fatigue and tension that had begun to g his eyes this whole place thats who he said to no one and to everyone this whole place is crazy easy zacko frank warned just stay cool hows annie zack lowered his hand and looked up at his brother shes crazy thats how she is shes crazy because for the last five days shes been receiving a major tranquilizer her blood levels have been rising and shes been drifting further and further from reality until its doubtful she even knew where she was when all this happened she lost control of her bowels and was trying to crawl over the end of the bed to the bathroom when she fell the nurse here tells me they didnt get in to check on her as soon as they should have because theres been such a staffing cutback that theyre shorthanded what kind of a goddamn place is this frank i i think id better get back to my floor doreen lavalley said softly mr iverson my resignation will be in the nursing office tomorrow morning without waiting for a response she whirled and hurried out don what in the hells going on here frank asked your brother thats what norman answered he barges in here starts examining my patient without even being consulted badgers the nurse into making some rash statements about the hospital and then accuses me of causing the woman to fall he turned to zack youve been trouble since the day you got here and dont think we dont all know it this hospital needs team players iverson youre a grandstander ultrameddavis ran perfectly smoothly before you showed up and it will do just as well after youve gone im not going anywhere zack said dont bank on it norman shot back easy both of you frank said first of all just tell me is that woman in there going to die tonight it was touch and go for a while norman said but ive gotten things under control shes a bit disoriented but shes not in any immediate danger well wait a few days to let her cardiac situation calm down and then sam christianll fix hey hip zack what do you think thats the way it is i think zack said wearily still resting his head on his hand that suzanne ought to be called in to take care of annie thats what i think over my dead body you arrogant son of a bitch norman rasped careful don zack said thats franks mother youre talking about will you two please stop it there are nurses and patients all over this place now don tell me did you have annie on a tranquilizer or not and for gods sake keep your voice down donald norman was losing what little control he had left first of all frank he said ill thank you not to tell me what to do with my voice second of all ill thank you and your brother here not to go questioning the therapy i choose for my patients you may be the administrator here but im the chief of the medical staff frank stepped forward until his face was less than a foot from normans his eyes were steely donald one call from me onehe held up a finger for emphasis and youll be lucky to have a job scrubbing bedpans you should know that and if you dont think i have that kind of clout at ultramed just try me now take that chief of staff crap and stuff it then tell me what in the hell you were thinking when you put annie doucette on tranks yeah don zack urged acidly tell him zack will you please shut the fuck up for a minute and let me get to the bottom of this norman was visibly cowed frank he pleaded i was just trying to follow policy the womans drg payments are about to run out i have a bed lined up for her at the nursing home thats just what im supposed to do when i told her what was planned she went berserk she demanded more time in the hospital that was out of the question you know the rules as well as i do what rules zack asked frank ignored him so you sedated her he said jesus don she worked for my goddamn family couldnt you have just called me i didnt think to what rules zack asked again yes what rules the three men spun toward the voice clayton iverson was just a few feet away calmly appraising them all his expression was nonthreatening but zack could see anger smoldering in his eyes judge frank said you said you were going to wait out there with mom i got impatient well well good enough im sure its no great news to you that we cant always agree on everything in a hospital right right frank smiled cheerily but zack knew he was shaken don here tells us annies still disoriented but that her condition has stabilized isnt that so zack listen judge why dont you get mom and bring her in its getting late and im sure you both want to get on home the judge confronted him in a brief eyeballtoeyeball showdown but frank easily held his own all right frank clayton said evenly as long as things are under control dons an excellent internist judge and annies getting his best shot right zack right zack nearly choked on the word don come frank said lets you and i go over some things before you call it a day without waiting for an answer frank took norman by the arm and led him from the unit how much of all that did you hear judge zack whispered clayton iverson looked over at annie who was clumsily picking at the restraint that was holding her to the bed enough zachary he said i heard quite enough im going to have that letter in leigh barons hands tomorrow are you going to try and talk me out of it once again zack rubbed at the burning in his eyes even faced with this new reality it was painful to accept that the promise of ultrameddavisthe sparkling physical plant and progressive approach to medicinewas no more than a veneer beneath the sheen beneath the new equipment the new specialists and the intense public relations effort the hospital had no soul no judge he said finally tomorrow im going to give you a look at the material guy had put together against ultramed you go ahead and do whatever you feel you have to do im not going to try and talk you out of anything zack waited until the judge had left and then called suzanne zachary do you know what time it is she said blearily gee no he said but give me a minute and ill see if i can find someone who does thats not funny sorry you dont sound so hot im not i have a splitting headache and sixty milligrams of dalmane had me barely asleep when you called sorry again ive just got to get some rest was there anything special you wanted no he lied nothing special i just wanted to see how you were oh well can you call me in the morning sure thanks i should go before this dalmane wears off good the dial tone cut him off the atmosphere in the shingled ranch zack had leased from pine bough realty was kept musty and comfortable by the lingering aroma of decades of hardwood fires it was after one in the morning seated in a frayed easy chair by the dormant hearth zack sipped from a cup of constant comment tea absently scratched cheap dog in his favorite behindtheear spot and waited frank had asked him to stay up to talk and had promised to be right over but zack knew that his brother had never marched to anything other than frank iversons time in truth it made little difference how late frank would be zack was too keyed up by the events of the evening to sleep his feelings disappointment anger frustrationwere strangely akin to those of the dreadful night when connie had finally leveled with him about her decision to break off their engagement and not to accompany him to new hampshire it wasnt supposed to be like this cheap be said it wasnt supposed to be like this at all so much of him wanted to just pack up and runload the camper and go back to muni for all of its underfinanced stretchedtothe limit turmoil the place at least had heart the bottom line there was never anything but sick or hurting patients and a crew of nurses technicians and docs determined to help them get well but even as he heard the crunch of his brothers porsche on the gravel drive zack knew that he would stay for suzanne and the mountains for guy and toby nelms and all of the stacy millses yet to be in his life he would see things through franks visit did not last long he was speaking even before the screen door had shut behind him you really stuck it to me tonight zacko he said breathlessly you really stuck it to me have a seat frank you want something to drink some tea a beer at that moment zack caught the odor of whiskey and noted the fine red flush at the corner of franks eyes i dont want anything except a little goddamn loyalty and help from my brother frank said making no move to sit a good nurse has quit my father who also happens to be the chairman of the hospital board is furious and my chief of staff wants to shoot me to say nothing of what he wants to do to you thats great zachary thats a hell of a nights work easy frank okay no damnit not okay normans right from the minute you got back here theres been nothing but trouble playing sir lancelot all over the goddamn hospital undermining my authority and ultrameds policies even flirting with my wife for chrissake thats ridiculous frank youve been drinking why dont we both just sit on this and well talk in the morning ill talk about it now frank snapped having perhaps seen and heard enough cheap dog growled a soft warning and from somewhere beneath the shag of his face bared his teeth zack glanced over at the animal but made no attempt to quiet him down with frank less than totally rational already cheap dog was some insurance against a major blowup that the dog was basically a coward would remain his secret all right he said wearily so talk frank was pacing elenching and unclenching his fists and then rubbing his hands on the sides of his trousers for years now ever since you fell on that ski slope and i got to go to colorado youve been waiting for the chance to get back to ruin me sitting in the stands all those years cheering and clapping with the others and all the while hating my guts because you couldnt stay on your skis frank thats crazy revising upward his estimate of how much frank had had to drink zack could only settle back in his chair and watch i told them things were going just fine up here frank ranted on i told them we didnt need any goddamn neurosurgeon least of all you well let me tell you something zacko tougher nuts than you have tried to fuck with me where are they now he whirled and leveled a finger at zacks face from the corner of his eye zack saw cheap dog again stiffen now just listen and listen to me good frank said things are going to change around here or youre out ive worked too hard to get this place the way i want it to have anyone screw it all upespecially someone with a twentyyearold chip on his shoulder so just back off let up on the staff on the judge and on lisette or i swear zacko ill come down on you like a ton of bricks without waiting for a response he spun on his heel and stormed from the house moments later the porsche screeched away zack sat in numb disbelief a twentyyearpast skiing accident an innocent unfulfilled high school romance was frank merely drunk and tired or was he truly crazy let up on the staff the warning would have gone unheeded under any circumstances but now there was not even room for dialogue or tact an eightyearold boy was drifting toward insanity and possibly death and consciously or not someone at ultrameddavis knew why zack glanced at his watch it was after two he picked up a book of crossword puzzles that were far enough beyond his ability to be soporific and shuffled to the bedroom what he needed now more than anything else was some sleep because warning or no warning frank or no frank he was going to get some answersbeginning in less than seven hours with jack pearl chapter fourteen the surgical residents at boston muni traditionally spoke of exhaustion in terms of the wallthe moment when a physician ceased to function with any creative effectiveness throughout training one was either approaching the wall up against it or when operating solely on the grittyeyed fuel of caffeine and nervous energy beyond it at when his clock radio switched in on the final two verses of an a cappella version of au clair de la fontaine zack could distinctly remember seeing three four and five oclock flash on its digital display his bedside light was still on the crossword puzzle book with perhaps a dozen or so items out of one hundred thirty filled in rested in his chest the pencil was still wedged between his fingers across the room cheap dog quite ready to begin the day was perched on his hind legs his paws resting on the windowsill the nub of lis tail twitching at the prospect of joining some action in the backyard it wasnt supposed to be like this zacks first thought of the morning was the same as the last he should remember from the night just past boards of trustees hospital buybacks rules on length of ay policies on who gets admitted and who doesnt enemies allies realty trusts golden circles interlocking directorates as if the stresses pressures and crises of daytoday nedicine werent enough perhaps he mused the real villain in the piece wasnt frank or the judge or norman or even ultramed perhaps it was his own naivetehis idealistic notions of illness and injury and the healing arts perhaps that was what needed overhauling emotionally as well as physically drained he shuffled to the bathroom to shave and shower pausing to pull a quarter from behind cheap dogs ear before letting him out the wall he knew was just a few hours away save for the lone librarian the ultrameddavis record room was deserted with thirty minutes remaining before his appointment with jack pearl zack had decided to give toby nelmss chart one last gothrough although he still felt numb and deflated from the madness of the previous night the morning at least had gotten off to a decent start after getting cheap dog settled on his run he had chosen a route to the hospital that took him past a broad field of tiger lilies lavender and blackeyed susans for years annie doucette had allowed scarcely a day to pass without setting fresh flowers on the dining room table and mantel of the iverson home during her hospitalization the family had done its best to repay her in kind gathering up an armload bouquet zack had amused himself by composing cards he would have liked to have propped up by the vase in her icu cubicle to annie with deepest apologies ultramed to annie my temporary patient from don your temporary doctor in repayment for your humiliation heart attack and broken hip in sharp contrast to the surreal chaos of the early morning hours the unit had been bright and tranquil annie the haldol largely out of her system was fully oriented and even a bit feisty although she was sluggish from the analgesia she was receiving for her hip she had talked in detail of her son and grandchildren and of zacks family of the thirtysix hours preceding her fall she remembered nothing except to reiterate her determination not to be sent to any deathtrap nursing home donald normans cookbook cardiology had for the moment at least proven adequate and while annies cardiac status remained shaky it was not critical all in all zack had left the unit sensing that if anyone her age could make it through the ordeal she was facing annie doucette could the record room librarian an alert young brunette who was nearing the end of a pregnancy seemed grateful to have company zack signed for tobys chart and brought it to one of several formicawalled dictation carrels the manila folder he set to one side contained the notes and the trickle of articles he had begun to amass on the more obscure complications of the two anesthe ics the boy had received none of those sources had offered so much as a clue to his bizarre condition word by word more meticulously even than on previous efforts he picked through the chart family historyunremarkable past medical historyusual childhood immunizations and diseases nothing else of consequence physical examnormal except for an incarceratedinguirial hernia operative and anesthesia notesroutine nurses notes patient brought into recovery from o r awake alert and smiling vital signs normal no evidence for respiratory depression pupils equal and reactive lungs clear remarkable absolutely remarkable zack read the notes once and then again tobys total stay in the recovery room was less than thirty minutes he asked for suzannes chart her anesthe ics and doses when adjusted for weight were virtually identical to tobys so were her recovery room nurses notes total time in the recovery room fortyfive minutes the g im of an idea began to take root zack checked the time thirteen minutes until he met with pearl excuse me he called over to the librarian are these records completely computerized for the last five years yes she said setting aside the romance saga she was reading i think theyre working on the five years before that well supposing i wanted to get say a list of all the gallbladder patients operated on in the last three years no problem cholecystectomy is one of our codes i think how about just the ones where dr pearl was the anesthesiologist the woman checked her manual dr jack pearl physician i can get the printout for you in just a minute but it will take a while if you want me to pull the charts she patted her belly as you can see im walking for two your last month last two weeks i hope well if its too much trouble no no we both need the exercise i hate to make it harder on you but could i have the first few right away and then come back in say an hour to check on the rest sure at this hour of the morning this place isnt exactly humming she was already typing commands into the computer by eightthirty zack had scanned nine charts out of thirtyone he slipped the notes he had taken into his folder and promised to return for the rest despite his lack of sleep he felt energizedkeyed up and very sharp his idea had provided no definite answers but now at last he knew he had some damn good questions if jack pearl had made any attempt to straighten up his office before zacks arrival he had failed miserably the small windowless space between the o r suite and the recovery room was cluttered with journals and scraps of paper and smelled heavily of coffee and stale cigarettes halffilled ashtrays one with a butt still smoldering graced two corners of the desk and opened cellophanewrapped packets of kleenex were everywhere pearl himself sporting a wrinkled green polo shirt was nearly dwarfed behind the pile of reprints texts and notebooks on his desk the hand he extended was cadaverous regardless of how skillful an anesthesiologist pearl was it was difficult for zack to imagine his fastidious brother hiring such a man so pearl said his voice an annoying cross between peter lorre and perhaps carol channing i see you are an early morning person too actually im more a midafternoon person zack replied thanks for making the time to see me no big deal you want some coffee theres a machine right down the hall no thanks though zack noticed a stained mr coffee crammed to the side of one bookshelf but saw no evidence of filters or coffee so iverson whats on your mind pearl sniffling every twenty or thirty seconds stubbed out what was left of the smoldering cigarette as he was cuing up a fresh one he was a man in constant motion wiping his nose smoking or fiddling with the papers on his desk he was also zack felt somewhat effeminate though they had done one case together and had spoken briefly after suzannes surgery this was their first contact of any substance the office for all its disarray was somehow barren and sterile there were no diplomas or certificates on the wall no photographs or mementos on the shelves zack felt an instant immense curiosity about the little man but he had already abandoned any notion of small talkeven nonthreatening questions about his background nothing in pearls manner encouraged such an approach i need to discuss a case with you zack began okay shoot its an eightyearold boy named toby nelms jason mainwaring repaired an incarcerated hernia in him almost a year ago you did the anesthesia no bells pearl said heres a xerox of most of his chart zack passed the copy across and waited as pearl flipped through it seems pretty cut and dried to me pearl hesitated and then looked up his brow pinched in thought cut and dried that was sort of a joke wasnt it he thought some more pretty good joke too if i do say so myself pretty good his laugh was a cackle zack smiled but otherwise made no attempt to join in pentothal and isoflurane is that pretty routine for cases like tobys routine enough pearl said why well zack rubbed at his chin and silently counted to five i have reason to believe that the kid wasnt asleep during his surgery pearls listless eyes flashed thats ridiculous he snapped maybe but i think its true he remembers details of the operation that theres no reason for him to know and to make matters even more interesting for the past six months hes been reliving the whole thing pearl was ashen what hes having flashbacks in which he reexperiences his surgery only in a terrifying distorted way its as if his preoperative fears have become fused with the actual procedure instead of having his hernia fixed he has his testicles and his penis cut off again and again and each time jack he feels the pain every bit of it thats thats insane is it of course it is pearl took a nervous drag from his cigarette and then blew his nose hes lying or or hes been watching too much television i dont think so jack and neither do the boys parents theyre this close to instituting some sort of action against the hospital and i assume against you and mainwaring as well and youre encouraging them in this hell no the opposite well thank god for that pearl muttered but im determined to get to the bottom of things thats why im here the kids very sick from what hes going through very sick in fact he may be dying pearl whistled softly through his teeth cc well he said i cant help you much except to tell you that whatever is going on has nothing to do with his anesthesia ive done thousands of cases with exactly the same stuff this boy got and and nothing like this has ever happened nothing as far as you know zack corrected pearls expression was strange zack tried to gauge the reaction against those he had anticipated anger arrogance confusion concern defensiveness there was i no real match something was going on though of that he was almost certain the man was was what look iverson pearl ground out his cigarette and folded his hands on the desk his fidgeting stopped his gaze became more direct i want to help you i truly do i want to help that kid but theres really nothing i can say he got routine anesthesia and had a routine operation its as simple as that if you want to get to the bottom of whatevers going on then youll just have to head off in another direction okay in that moment zack understood his muscles tensed the sensation was so familiar it was being on the side of a steep drop looking for the handholds and crevasses that would guide the traverse of a rock and then suddenly seeing the perfect line across jack pearls attempt at sounding concerned and accommodating had missed badly he was frightenedabsolutely white with fear the quieter and more composed he became the more zack knew he was squirming something was going on his blade had hit a nerve now it was time to give it a twist jack im interested in something he said suzanne cole was wide awake when she reached the recovery room the nurses notes in his chart say that toby nelms was too how do you do that pearl shrugged i just pay attention thats all i monitor vital signs more frequently than most anesthesiologists so i can keep the level of anesthesia right on the edge a rise in pulse or blood pressure and i just turn up the gas a bit its a matter of experience and technique but why is it that you only seem to use that technique and experience on mainwarings cases the anesthesiologists hand flickered toward the pack of cigarettes and then drew back where minutes before he had been in constant motion now he was rigid thats nonsense he said the recovery room nurses dont think so they tell me his cases always come out of the o r lighter than the rest of ours iverson just what is it youre driving at easy now zack warned himself one step at a time no slips look jack he said i dont want to make trouble for anyone i just want to help this kid well throwing darts at me isnt helping anyone youre youre barking up the wrong tree and frankly your innuendoes are starting to annoy me zack sighed listen just give me a couple more minutes and ill be out of your hair all i want you to do is look this over and tell me what you make of it with what he hoped was just enough theatrical flair zack slid the notes he had just prepared from his folder and handed them across pearl scanned the sheet for only a few seconds before he snatched up his cigarettes his hands were shaking and his heavy breathing blew out the match before it could ignite his smoke just what in the hell is this supposed to be he asked you know what it is jack its a summary of nine of the gallbladder cases youve done the past two years i have another twenty or so charts being pulled right now and i suspect theyll confirm what this list already suggests pearl looked ill which is which is jack that despite having the same procedure and receiving at least according to your notes exactly the same anesthesia jason mainwarings cases came out of the o r looking as if they had never been asleep whereas greg ormesbys were normal look at the recovery room times mainwarings cases were transferred out anywhere from one to six hours faster than ormesbys they didnt get the same anesthesia jack did they it was a statement not a question youre crazy pearl said thrusting the chart back at him those patients got exactly what i said they got now why dont you just take this this garbage and get out of here okay jack but you know i cant let this thing lie pearls hands were again folded tightly on his desk you do whatever you want iverson ive got nothing to worry about because i havent done anything for the first time since their session began zack began to have some doubts a boy was dying he had laid that on the table yet jack pearl if he knew anything had refused to budge could he have been that far off base about the anesthe ic about the whole situation or was the pallid little anesthesiologist some sort of monster only minutes before answers had seemed so close now have it your way jack he said rising you know how to reach me if you think of anything i wont pearl said so just take your witchhunt somewhere else hes eight jack eight years old get out chapter fifteen frank iverson loved his porsche with a passion and intensity beyond that which he felt for any human being including his children the connection he believed was a spiritual oneman at his finest and mans finest machine linked in style flexibility and speed there were times in fact like this clear windless monday afternoon when he felt certain the machine was actually sensing his mood and responding to it with a fourhundreddollar minuet radar detector scanning the road and a mental map of favorite state police hiding spots he swept down route toward the massachusetts state line and leigh baron nudging the porsche through eightymileanhour turns with his fingertips the ultramed managing directors call to meet her at the yankee seaside inn just over the border had come this morning only minutes after frank had learned from mother of his twoplace leap in the national standings almost certainly a promotion of some sortprobably to regional directorwas in the offing the place for their meeting a good hour north of boston had been chosen to accommodate leigh who would be attending a management seminar thereor so she had said there were frank acknowledged excitedly other possibilities time and again over the four years of their association the spectacular redhead had hinted at an attraction for him perhaps now with his stature rising in the company like a rocket she was ready and what an incredible prize she would be looks in a league with annette dolans money power and a brain to bootthe ultimate perk for the new ultramed regional director regional director frank beamed the timing couldnt have been better with mainwarings money as good as in the bank and the nightmarish chore of juggling the hospital accounts to hide that quartermilliondollar deficit nearly behind him he would need the flexibility of offices in new hampshire and boston to set up some of the deals he had in mind although the northeast region wasnt ultrameds most lucrative it was the fastest izrowin he would be functioning in the center of the corporate spotlight the company had set its sights on the prestige that involvement with established medical schools would bring and there were ten of the worlds most respected institutions in new england alone in fact only a year before ultramed had narrowly missed purchasing a major university psychiatric facility success in getting the companys foot in that door and he could pretty much write his own ticket and frank pledged as he cruised around the portsmouth rotary and south toward newburyport the first piece of business he would attend to with his newly acquired clout would be the removal from ultramed of one zachary iverson since being taken to the cleaners in that disastrous land deal he hadnt made too many mistakes in life but allowing the judge and leigh baron to pressure him into bringing zack back to sterling was easily the worst frank screeched through a ninetydegree turn onto the ocean road it might he mused even be worth making zacks dismissal the condition of his accepting the new appointment leigh would agree or risk losing him making such a demand was certainly worth consideringif not now then soon in a matter of months when his involvement with ultramed amounted to little more than icing on his cake he would have that kind of leverage anyhow and as the judge loved to say over and over again leverage was the name of the game the yankee seaside a twostory hotel laid out in a wide v above the rugged coast was opulent but not garish frank stopped in the lobby mens room for a final check in the mirrorjust in caseand then mounted the wide circular staircase to the second floor the notion that leigh barons call might have been social began to dissolve the moment she opened the door suite was a meeting roomrichly appointed with a fireplace and conversation area at one end and an oval conference table with seating for ten nestled in the v huge plateglass windows revealed a breathtaking vista of the north atlantic leigh herself was dressed for business in a lightweight burgundy suit and plain silk blouse her wonderful titian hair was pulled back in a tight bun and she was wearing the tortoiseshell glasses that were sometimes replaced by contact lenses still there was no hairstyle nor manner of dress that could obscure her spectacular good looks and there was no way frank promised himself that they would not become lovers if not that day then before too long frank welcome she said shaking his hand firmly and warning him with her eyes against any other contact im pleased you could make it down on such short notice at perhaps fivefootseven she was shorter than he was by more than half a foot but her bearing and manner neutralized that difference frank felt off balance and edgy with the coolness of her greeting you call i come he said taking a seat in the conversation area across a low marble coffee table from her he gestured to the room nice place thanks we own it ultramed a subsidiarywhiteside travel services whiteside travel i didnt know that was ultramed not many people do there was a door across from the one frank had entered and in spite of himself his mind kept flicking to the possibility that it led to a bedroom it would fit her style he was thinking a stiff businesslike greeting followed by mention of his recent rise in the ultramed rankings then word of his promotion suddenly just as it seemed they were through for the day she would reach up casually and shake free her hair so frank she began crossing her phenomenal legs and then consciously adjusting her skirt youre looking well how are things going im doing all right he answered cautiously my brothers been a bit of a pain but its nothing i cant handle as long as you and ultramed back me up we always back up our administrators especially those with the sort of track record you have i assume you saw the new figures we just posted in mother frank smiled step two of the scenario was unfolding i told you id make it he said feeling a surge of confidence no frank she corrected i told you remember i want you to know how pleased we all are with the job youve done especially me since im the one who first saw your potential and pushed for your appointment your success makes me look good and my promotion will make you look even better he thought the scent of her even at a distance had begun to fill his head making it hard to concentrate he would be the bestthe very best she ever had now she said whats this about your brother oh nothing he wished he had not brought up zack until their business was concluded he just doesnt have i dont know the team attitude i guess to make it with ultramed hes been nothing but a disruption since he arrived in sterling what sort of disruption oh christ never mind him just get on with it a hundred miles from sterling and his brother was getting in the goddamn way hey its no big deal leigh like i said i can handle it tell me please frank sighed okay he said its your dime zacks been constantly clashing with other doctors he goes out of his way to undermine my authority and he wont listen to anyones reason i tried to tell you he was going to be trouble yes i remember he always has been ill take care of it though just as soon as we finish our business here ill take care of it he gestured about the room again you know this place sort of reminds me of a great little inn in provincetown i think youd love it her eyes hardened frank she said i want you to listen to me and listen carefully at this particular moment as far as youre concerned im ultramed you work for me if you want to continue working for me youll stop mentally undressing me and pay attention to what this meetings all about its not going to happen frank get that through your head i have a husband im perfectly happy with understand numbly frank nodded good she reached across and squeezed his hand now just settle back and lets get down to business because im afraid you have a problem to take care of her voice was grim frank sensed a dreadful sinking in his gut what sort of problem he asked this letter arrived early this morning by messenger she said i assume since you havent mentioned it yet that it will come as a surprise the moment frank recognized the judges letterhead an annoying whine began building in his head by the time he had finished reading the noise was a screech he scanned the document and then read it again more slowly it was as leigh had surmised a total surprise an audit when it was crazy frank squeezed his temples trying to quiet the noise as he struggled to concentrate to understand what was happening and why the whole thing was crazy fucking crazy the buy back threat he could deal with the judge was a bastard but he was still only one vote the board could be had a member at a time the board could be had but until mainwaring came through an audit was out of the question absolutely out frank it was zack again it was that goddamn scene with nortnan that had pushed the judge over franks teeth were clenched so tightly that his jaw ached o in the hell did they think they were dealing with frank are you all right huh oh sure im just furious thats all im not too happy about it either any idea why your father wouldnt have spoken to you about this frank snorted a laugh only dozens he said regional director leigh the flexibility the leverage the power he had driven down with such high hopes he would be driving back with nothingnothing but headaches fuck em he thought viciously the judge and his brother fuck em both do you have anything to drink in this place he asked just coffee frank you want that yeah okay no no forget it he stood and stalked to the window his fists opening and closing at his sides frank leigh said evenly you have to calm down weve got to know we can count on you to take care of this ultramed has too much at stake right now to take any backward steps the competition is just waiting for a screwup that they can use to turn prospective acquisitions against us so just stay calm this isnt such a big surprise if you think about it we expected when your father insisted on a buy back clause that hed probably make some sort of move like this hes a controller thats his style tell me about it frank said bitterly still staring out at the atlantic the question is whether hes just playing his game or whether he really intends to fight any ideas about that frank turned back to her its a bluff he said and that business about beaulieus widow also a bluff if beaulieu had anything of substance i would have heard about it long before this its the same sort of crap my fathers been pulling since as far back as i can remember can you handle him youre damn right i can there isnt going to be any goddamn audit what i said ill take care of it he cursed his slip and silently cautioned himself to be more alert this is just another of his little tests he said ive taken them before they were underestimating him zack the judge even leigh they were underestimating him badly and they would see they would all see he was younger and stronger than his father and he had learned the lessons of the man well were counting on you leigh said we want this whole business resolved before the board meets it will be good ill be watching it means a great deal to me to have you do this right and it goes without saying that it means a great deal to you too yes when this is all over frank said stonily i want my goddamn brother out of ultramed i would fire him right now but until this business with my father is resolved i dont want to make any moves that might set off the judge all over again i agree above all youve got to keep things cool her tone softened listen frank you deal with this smoothly and youll have our blessing to get rid of your brother if thats what you want in fact prove you can handle your father and you can consider your potential with this company unlimited she smiled at him unlimited frank i understand good she stood then i want to be kept abreast of whats going on she nodded toward the judges letter i dont like surprises i understand he said again there wont be any in that case frank you have a very bright future with our company a minute passed after the door to suite closed behind frank leigh baron poured a weak bourbon and water from the rooms wellstocked credenza then she turned to the intercom inconspicuously placed on an end table its okay ed she said hes gone edison blair the ceo of riata international entered the room from the inner office where he had been listening and crossed directly to the bar he was nearing fifty but looked ten years younger with closecut sandy hair a lean almost slight frame and a deceptively boyish face his personal worth estimated by various sources to be between twenty and thirty million was actually closer to twice that and was growing as rapidly as his young corporation unlimited potential i like that little touch at the end he said he thinks you were referring to yourself you know of course i know i picked up all the tools i needed to deal with frank iverson in men take away his vanity and hes got nothing with men like him youve always got to leave the carrot ill remember that so he went on what do you think dunno i have my doubts ive only met this judge iverson once but from what i sensed of the man my moneys on him blair poured a shot of jose cuervo gold tequila sniffed it once and downed it in a single quick gulp i agree leigh said but i think its worth waiting a bit before we play out our hand who knows maybe frankll pull it off hes been a hell of a surprise so farto everyone but me that is its lucky we dont have too many more surprises like him working for us leigh its not exactly optimal business practice to carry an administrator who embezzles a quarter of a million dollars from you come on ed hes made ten times that much for us already and you know it our accountants havent found so much as a missing penny since that one time from the scrambling hes been doing they think hes buying time to replace that money and so do i either way its our ace in the hole so we wait we wait leigh i dont want us losing that hospital were not going to lose anything you can count on it edison blair eyed her for a moment i am he said disappointments and hard times had dogged jack pearl most of his life from as far back as he could remember he had been differentan outsider for one thing he was an insomniac a pathologic insomniac as a youth his parents would scold him for being in the basement at four oclock in the morning fiddling with his chemistry set later that same day he would be reprimanded and sent home for falling asleep in class his condition had led to threats of expulsion on any number of occasions and he well might have been expelled were he not thanks to an in the s the best student in his school making matters even more difficult for pearl during those school years was the gradual emergence of his homosexuality and even within that subset he was a fringe player preferring mueh younger boys and their photographs to any more threatening entanglements in college no roommate lasted more than a few weeks with his bizarre biologic rhythms and deepening melancholia his dormitory room walls were decorated with posters and photos of his special heroes napoleon dickens edison churchill kafka and proust none of whom according to the first of his therapists had ever enjoyed so much as one normal nights sleep that an insomniac should have chosen anesthesia as his lifes work was one of the few pleasant ironies in pearls life that one should have developed serenyl the quintessential sleepinducing agent was the ultimate irony of all the screnyl odyssey had begun years before in iquitos a jungle village by the headwaters of the peruvian amazon where pearl had accepted a sixmonth medical mission appointment as a means of escaping yet another disastrous situation in yet another hospital within a few weeks of his arrival he had developed an intense fascination with the drugs used by medicine men and in particular with a plant alkaloid used by the most mystical doctors in the region to induce a purgative state of deep hypnosis in their followers the moment pearl first witnessed the incredible substance in action the lack of direction and purpose in his life was at an end two years of meticulously dissecting the active component in the alkaloid and modifying its composition led him to the synthesis of serenyla structurally unique anesthe ic fully as remarkable as was its chemical forebear now for the first time since he conceived of its application synthesized it patented it and adjusted its delivery and dosage in actual o r situations pearls serenyl was under attack it was five in the morning an hour before pearl had given up trying to sleep and had brewed himself a pot of coffee in the nearly twentyfour hours since his confrontation with zack iverson he had slept perhaps two familiar feelings of loneliness and isolationfeelings he had been able to keep reasonably in check since moving to sterlinghad surfaced and were beginning to smother him the first glow of dawn was spilling over the valley as he wrapped himself in a blanket padded across his dewsliced yard and settled onto a slatbacked chair he wondered if a sleeping pill of some sort might be in order with mainwaring gone to atlanta the surgical load was light enough for his associate and their nurse anesthe ist to handle he could call in sick and take a couple of hundred milligrams of seconal it had been years since he had taken a drug of any kindhe hated feeling the loss of controlbut this might well be the time he had been thinking too hard his mind poring over and over the evidence franks brother had thrown at him frantically trying to assess the extent of the threat and to find fault in the mans logic pinpointing even potential errors in zack iversons reasoning had not been easy pearl lit his fifth cigarette of the hour searched about for a packet of kleenex and finally wiped his nose on the corner of the blanket why was it he wondered that every time life had started looking the least bit bright for him every goddamn time something or someone had come along to screw it up y most aggravating of all to him was that this time from the very beginning he had seen the potential for trouble and had discussed his concerns with his partners he had warned them that serenyls marvelously diminished recovery timethe most distinctive of its many attributeswas also its achilles heel the rest of the properties that set it apart from other anesthe ics injected or inhaled were all unwanted side effects it did not have he had even suggested using the anesthe icon other surgeons patients so that should questions arise his technique and not the drug would be the focus of any suspicion but frank and mainwaring had been obstinate in their demand for absolute secrecy in fact both men had poohpooh ed his concerns and had laughed at the notion that anyone at ultrameddavis might be sharp enough or interested enough to put things together they hadnt counted on zachary iverson pearl knew that he was drifting in over his head over a lifetime of turmoil he had developed something of a sixth sense about such things he should have been on the phone to frank the moment zack iverson walked out of his office but he had needed time to thinknot so much about the gallbladder cases iverson was reviewing or even about the implications of the possible discovery of serenyl but about the chances that this child this toby nelms was in fact suffering from a complication of his anesthesia serenyl was the achievement of pearls lifetimethe validation of his entire chaotic and harried existence it simply had to be flawless it was mainwarings promise in writing that pearl would eventually receive credit for his work that had brought him to sterling that prank iverson had arranged for him to be paid handsomely for his discovery when others had threatened to prosecute him for even working on it was only icing on the cake of course pearl acknowledged grudgingly frank iverson had also smoothed over his past difficultiesmost notably a dicey piece of business involving a politicans son in akron but without mainwarings promise even the lure of escaping that mess would not have been enough to make him move to a place like sterling much less to share the serenyl patent but share that patent he had and now like it or not pearl knew that he had to talk to frank about his brother and toby nelms they had looked at every possible immediate complication of serenylrenal effects liver function pulmonary functionand had found none it had been sloppy not to have been conducting a longrange retrospective survey as well but dammit pearl rationalized the drug had persistently functioned so perfectly well now he would simply have to make his partners understand that they had made a mistake thank god it was not a fatal one they merely had to go back and do the study they should have been doing from the beginning with just a little investigation just a hundred or so calls to patients who had received the anesthe ic pearl knew he could determine if toby nelms was a coincidence or a problem nobody would even have to know why he was conducting the survey and if there was a problem with serenylif a second case like toby nelms was identifiedalmost certainly he could fix it he knew every molecule of the drug all he needed was the chance pearl stood and paced nervously about the yard mindless of the damp which had already soaked through his cloth slippers he had a decent handle on jason mainwaring in a sense they were allies the surgeon was a haughty privileged bastard but he was far more bark than bite in fact with his companys money on the line he would probably demand that this loose end be tied up before consummating their deal pearl stubbed his cigarette into the lawn and shakily lit another it was frank iverson he feared for as long as he could remember wherever he had lived whatever he had been doing there had been frank iversons they had pushed him in the schoolyard and called him names they had sent flunkies to trip him and had stood laughing with their girlfriends as he clutched at the bloody scrapes on his knees and elbows later in life they had loomed behind their desks shaking their manicured fingers at him and telling him that there was no room in their institutions for his type and however much this frank iversons outward concern and intervention had helped him pearl knew better than to trust him it was serenyl and serenyl alone that maintained the mans civility and support for nearly two years their work had gone on without a single hitch it would take care and patience to convince iverson of the need to hold off on the sale but what were a few weeks pearl reasoned desperately or even a few months compared with the importance of the anesthe ic to medicine in the end even frank would have to understand that understand pearl shuddered at the notion one of the more unpleasant constants in life had been that where he and the things that were important to him were concerned the frank iversons had never understood there were still several hours before iverson would even be at his office until then there was nothing he could do he badly needed to relax glancing at his watch he crossed the yard and entered the cellar of his rented bungalow through the metal bulkhead the basement dusty and unfinished was illuminated by a single bare bulb suspended from the ceiling pearl took a screwdriver from his toolbox knelt down behind the oil burner and pried out a loosened segment from the cinderblock wall creating the hiding place had been one of his first priorities after moving in he moved several dozen vials of serenyl and the notebook outlining its synthesis off to one side of the space and withdrew one of two cigar boxes stuffed with photographs next he carefully replaced the cinderblock and shuffled to his room settling onto his bed he undid his robe and then one at a time drew certain photos from the box by the third one pearls hand had slipped down the front of his pajama pants and begun gently to massage himself iverson had demanded none too kindly that he steer absolutely clear of any involvement with boys or for that matter with any men in the area without the photographs he would have gone insane the ones he selected this morning were the very best in his collectionthose he had taken himself in minutes his growing arousal had begun to dispel some of the fears and loneliness it would all work out he told himself whatever words he had to find to convince iverson he would find he produced a fivebyseven in which three beautiful boys were frozen in a montage he had carefully designed that afternoon in east st louis had been incredibleone of the very best slowly pearls eyes closed his movements intensifying as his fantasies took flight being different wasnt easy it never had been but as best he could as he always had he was making do and for once in his life for once in his goddamned troubled life something was going to work out frank come in come in judge clayton iversons chambers a huge highceilinged room with dark oak paneling and three walls of immaculately aligned tomes was as somber and intimidating as was the man himself on the wall behind the desk surrounding a portrait of the chief justice of the supreme court were dozens of framed photographs of the judge in variations of the same pose with three presidents half a dozen governors and virtually every new hampshire politician of substance for the past half century there was also near the center of the display a color photo of frank dressed in his purple and gold sterling high school uniform his left arm extended his right cocked behind his ear ready to throw the draperies were drawn against the midday sun seated behind his massive oak desk his thick silver hair fairly glowing in the dim light the judge looked bigger than life frank had feared it was an error not to have pushed for a meeting in some more neutral site and now as he sensed the awe that had always accompanied his visits to that room he cursed himself for not having been more insistent well no matter he decided it was time for a new iverson to take charge he had set passing records on the fields of a dozen different rivals his play had quieted scores of enemy crowds he would meet the man in his lair or anywhere else for that matter and he would prevail so judge he began matching then just exceeding the firmness f the mans handshake how goes it mom okay shes still upset about annie but otherwise shes fine in it up to here in that garden of hers she certainly does love that ol garden lisettes been working on one too you know you and momll have to come see it speaking of annie have you by any chance seen her today nope tonight i promised your mother id take her over well youre in for a pleasant surprise shes doing great don norman tells me theyll probably operate on her hip before the weeks out now suzanne cole is back on the case so annies got the benefit of both doctors thats good to hear frank its a shame though a crying shame that she had to fall like that frank tensed as always the man had gone right for the jugular no bullshit no finesse the key to handling him would be to stay cool and not allow himself to get rattled no one feels worse about what happened than i do judge he said but whats done is done now our job is to get her back on her feet right and thanks to ultramed weve got one of the best physical therapy departments in the state you didnt keep a tight enough rein on that doctor of yours frank youre in charge its your hospital just like this is my courtroom oh give me a fucking break frank thought youre right judge he said your points well taken ive spoken to don and he knows his behind is on the griddle from now on also hes making arrangements to pay for any expenses annie runs up in getting home care after her surgery excellent son thats an excellent move our hospitals come a long way since ultramed took over judge ill do anything i have to to keep it on the right track clayton iverson loosened his tie and ran his thumbs beneath the black suspenders that had always been part of his courtroom dress i assume he said that statement of purpose is your roundabout way of asking me to withdraw the notice i dispatched to your friend ms baron damn but the man was tough well as long as you brought it up the judge swiveled in his seat lifted the picture of frank from the wall and appraised it thoughtfully remember when this was taken he asked it was right before the state championship game against bloomfield the best game you ever played i think six touchdown passes against the team people were calling the toughest ever in the state five frank corrected the judge smiled youre forgetting the thirty yarder in the third quarter that was called back for a holding penalty on the very next play you threw that fortyfiveyard bomb to brian cullen three men hanging all over you and you heaved that ball downfield like like you were playing in the backyard that was a long time ago judge frank was genuinely surprised and touched by the detail in the mans recollection you have quite a memory son clayton iverson said youd be amazed at how much i remember from those days his tone was uncharacteristically wistful there was a toughness to you then franka determination to be the best you had the whole world right in the palm of your hand somewhere along the line though you started backing off making bad choices no not bad he corrected terrible somewhere along the line you lost that edge but im not through the worst part of it all is that the more you struggled the less willing you became to listen to advice you ran up against problems and instead of plowing through them like you used to do you tried to run around them i want you to succeed here frank i want that very much but im not going to make it easy for you im going through with that letter and im going to try and find out just what went on with guy ive told you before judge nothing went on with guy i hope not frank dont you see i want you to show up at that board meeting with a case for ultramed thats so strong and so polished no one on the board would even think about voting against you this is one problem youre going to meet head on son and i pray to god you roll right over me frank held up his hands in frustration judge youre just making a mess of everything checking up on me and the hospital auditing our books the people at ultramed are watching if they see that i cant even reason with my own father everything ive gained these past four years will be headed down the drain just the fact that i was the last one to know about your letter has already made me look like an idiot well when ms baron and her associates see the case you put together for their corporation you will be a hero but thats the way it is frank he swung back and replaced the photograph frank felt an alltoofamiliar anger and frustration begin to well up he cautioned himself against any outburst and reminded himself to meet strength with strength okay judge he said you obviously have your mind set on this thing i do well then id like you at least to compromise on one thingthe audit we werent scheduled for our general audit until next february it will take me days to put everything together as it is and it will throw my staff into chaos either cancel it or or at least postpone it until next month the judge shook his head farley berger says its got to be done in the next day or two in order for his team to have all the figures checked over by the meeting on friday but theres nothing in the contract that says the audit has to be done by the board meeting make it two weeks clayton iverson thought for a minute okay frank he relented you want two weeks youve got two weeks thats it judge frank thought exultantly thats it thats all i need im going to beat you you know he said i hope so son the judge responded i truly do chapter sixteen for zack the day had resembled some of those during his residency two consults on the floors assisting one of the orthopedists with a back case admitting a threeyearold who had fallen off a swing hit her head and then had a seizure and finally seeing half a dozen patients in the office it was the sort of pace on which ordinarily he thrived this day it was all he could do to maintain his concentration six days had passed since his initial contact with toby nelms and he was still unable to put together the pieces of the childs diagnosis for a time after his abortive interview with jack pearl he had tried as an exercise to give the anesthesiologist the beiiefit of the doubtto concoct another explanation that would jibe with the facts he had cancelled his schedule for the day and driven to boston for consultations with several anesthesiologists at muni he had also spent four hours in the county medical library at harvard reviewing every article he could find on pentothal isoflurane and their complications by the end of his search he considered himself qualified as one of the experts in the field always though his efforts brought him back to his original hypothesis and back to a single word metzenbaums now in a few days he would meet again with the boy and his mother this time zack knew barbara nelms would not settle for evasions and halftruths the woman was desperate she had every right to be it was just after four in the afternoon from the west dusky mountain shadows inched up the valley toward sterling zack had just finished a detailed discussion of meni ampres disease with the last of his office patients i know exactly what you have he had told the elderly man who had come because of intermittent dizziness and a persistent most unpleasant hum in his ears unfortunately i also know there is very little we are going to be able to do beyond teaching you how to live with it he had ordered some tests in hopes of coming upon one of the rare treatable causes of the condition had passed on the address of the national society dealing with menieres and had expressed his regret at not being able to do more the mans disappointment was predictable and understandable but it was nonetheless painful for zack its not going to get you toby zack vowed as he watched his crestfallen patient shuffle from the office the practice of medicine provided more than enough of the frustration and heartache that came from having no answers in toby nelmss case the answers were there and somehow someone was going to supply them just hang in there kid natevers going on whatever theyve done to you its not going to get you zack sent his office nurse home early alerted the answering service that he would be on his beeper and spread the boys folder on his desk most of what he was rereading he knew by heart after just a few minutes he snatched up the phone and called franks office there was no alternative but to share his suspicions with his brother and try to enlist his help in another confrontation with pearl frank was gone for the day and his secretary had no idea where he was or when he would be back a call to mainwarings office gave him only the answering service and the information he already had that the surgeon was out of the state until the following monday and was being covered by greg ormesby answers he canted drumming a pen on the edge of his desk there have got to be answers where are you jason who are you what do you know on an impulse he checked his hospital directory and dialed the pathology department takashi yoshimura answered on the first ring kash he said if you can do it and if it wouldnt put you on the spot i need a name ten minutes later zack was on the line with a dr darryl tarberry at johns hopkins dr tarberry he said after explaining how he had come by the mans name and after listening patiently to ebullient praise of kash yoshimura and his work i am calling for a recommendation but not for dr yoshimura fortunately we already have him on our staff the man im interested in is dr jason mainwaring kash said you might have worked with him when he was at hopkins for a few seconds there was only silence who did you say you were darryl tarberry asked finally from his recollection of the man yoshimura had guessed that tarberry was in his midsixties by now but from the harsh crackle in his voice zack wondered if he might be years older than that my names iverson zachary iverson he repeated im a neurosurgeon and im on the credentials committee here again there was a pause mainwarings applying for surgical privileges at your place thats right well ill be tarberry said where did you say that hospital of yours was new hampshire sir listen i dont want to put you on the spot dr tarberry but we would certainly appreciate any information you can give us this call being recorded zack groaned no i promise you it isnt im not putting anything on paper now thats fine mainwaring and his lawyers had this place tied up in knots for i dont know how long damn lawyers ended up costing the hospital a small fortune to settle even though we were one hundred percent in the right as far as im concerned one of my colleagues got ulcers from it i swear he did i dont want that happening to me im too damn old for that kind of nonsense you have my word your word iverson huh that swedish english its english zack said staring upward for some sort of celestial help well iverson i dont know all the details thats okay and as far as im concerned we never had this conversation promise well the man said drawing out every letter of the word let me tell you first that mainwaring may be the most ambitious sonofabitch god ever put in a mask and gown but he is one fine surgeon maybe the best ive seen and ive seen plenty go on zack said after fifteen minutes of prodding and cajoling zack felt he had extracted as much from darryl tarberry as he was likely toat least over the phone there was more to the story he knew probably much more but even so a huge piece had fallen into place in the puzzle of toby nelms zack was just finishing writing a synopsis of the interrogation when the door to his waiting room opened and closed im here he called out what a coincidence so am i suzanne appeared at his office door wearing a lab coat over an ivory blouse and anklelength madras skirt got a minute she asked for you years he set the tarberry notes in toby nelmss folder and pushed it to one side of the desk trouble with annie no no nothing like that shes doing amazingly well i think sam christians going to do her hip tomorrow excellent im so pissed off about whats happened to her every time i think about what don norman did i want to hunt him down and flatten that pudgy little nose of his zack im as upset as you are about annie but i dont see how you can lay all the blame on don he didnt do anything with malicious intent that depends on your definition of malicious he was sedating her so that she wouldnt object to being sent to a nursing home so that ultramed could continue to rake in profits from her care if thats not malicious i dont know what is hey easy does it okay what do you mean thats your opinion but it happens not to be everyones couldnt you just let up on this place a bit huh zack frank just left my office so thats where hes been ive been trying to reach him hes really upset with you i know is that why he went to see you as a matter of fact it is he he wanted me to talk to youto ask you to let up on your criticism of this place he could have come and asked me himself he says he tried he was drunk he threatened me thats not what i would call the optimal approach so now hes chosen to involve you i cant believe this place zachary i didnt come up here to pick a fight i just wanted to do what i could to smooth things over between you two i owe frank a lot i thought you understood that from all i told you of what happened to me sorry zack mumbled if im touchy i guess its that i just wish things were different between me and frank well suzanne i cant help it if frank thinks its my fault that the judge is pushing the board of trustees to buy back the hospital from ultramed it was clearly the first she had heard of that development my god zack you cant let him do that first of all he said i have no more control over that man than frank or anybody else does and second why not well well because she stammered if the board threw ultramed out frank would be ruined nonsense he knows his job he could do it just as well for a community corporation as he could for an operation like ultramed better probably suzanne listen to me somethings wrong around here somethings terribly wrong dammit zachary what is the matter with you dont you have regard for anyone but yourself i come here to ask you to let up on a man who is partly responsible for saving my career to say nothing of his being your brother and all you can do is is tear down his hospital its not his hospital look i dont want to get into a fight i have too much on my mind like what every instinct was clamoring for him to change the subject to keep his theories to himselfat least as long as they were no more than that he stared down at his hands darryl tarberrys revelations about jason mainwaring were too fresh in his mind suzanne he said slowly i have reasongood reasonto believe that human experimentation is being conducted at this hospital now that is the wildest and he cut in i have just as much reason to believe that you might have been one of the subjects suzanne listened in wideeyed disbelief as he recounted his experiences with toby nelms and jack pearl his brief study of the gallbladder surgery performed by mainwaring and greg ormesby and finally his conversation with tarberry apparently a woman died of an anaphylactic reaction to a local anesthe ic she received in mainwarings office mainwaring claimed it was xylocaine but there was plenty of documentation that the woman had received that drug on numerous occasions with no problems a nurse of his who was very upset with what happened charged that mainwaring had been testing something out that wasnt xylocaine although investigators could never prove that was true they did apparently discover that our friend jason was part owner of a pharmaceutical house somewhere in the south this is crazy suzanne said did that man you talked to at hopkins happen to know what company this might have been te couldnt remember he couldnt remember zack this is exactly the sort of thing frank was protesting these are terrible disruptive charges youre making on very little hard evidence im not making any charges he said feeling his composure beginning to slip im sharing a disturbing theory with a friend whose clinical judgment i value and trust i would think youd be frantic at the thought that someone might have been fooling around with your body while you were asleep well im not frantic im worriedabout you zack youve only been here a couple of weeks in that time youve clashed with wil marshfield had words with jason fought with don norman upset your brother fostered a move to buy back the hospital and now on nothing more than the flimsiest circumstantial evidence youre accusing the finest surgeon and anesthesiologist on the staff of a terrible crime zack pushed back his chair suzanne listen to ine no you listen how do you explain the fact that there hasnt been one other case like toby nelinss i i dont know maybe its a rare complication of whatever it is theyre using maybe people have had episodes like his but theyve happened in other places or havent been brought to a doctors attention maybe theres some sort of sensory trigger involved that just doesnt happen to everyone you told me yourself that you hadnt been feeling right since your operation ive been tired thats a far cry from having a psychotic seizure what about that episode in the field what are you talking about you went blank i did nothing of the sort you did it was as if someone threw a switch and all of a sudden you werent there zack this is crazy youve got to back off youve hit this place like an earthquake suzanne that child is dying maybe so but its not from something jason or jack pearl did to him one other case zachary just find me one other case like toby nelms and ill listen even then i may not believe you but ill listen in the meantime i think you owe your brother and all the rest of us for that matter a little breathing room she stood up back off zack please do what you can to keep your father from destroying what your brother has worked so hard to build and give us all a rest she snatched up her handbag and without waiting for a response raced from the office for a time zack sat numbly staring out the window at the waning afternoon a trigger or a sequence of triggers perhaps that was the key suzanne had no recollection of the episode at the meadows during their picnic but something weird had happened to her a switch had been thrown but what a word a sound a smell zack drummed his long fingers on the desk he felt his thoughts darting out at the answer again and again like the tongue of a snake but each time not quite far enough not quite far enough finally he slid toby nelmss file back in front of him and opened it ice again to the first page theyre not going to get you kid he whispered i swear theyre not going to get you come here so ong the best of the old new england inns the granite house darral the slanting hardwood floors beamed ceilings and oddly regard foroms each with a stone hearth were rated by the guides as man who is vess wonderful than the cuisine and service being your brotin had chosen the spot carefully for his first encounter tal egional trustees specifically this night a successful its not his hccrook and whitey bourque the rotund often outtoo much on my mithe local a amp p like what i gone wellbetter than he had dared hope every instinct wated the conversation beautifully weaving accounts his theories to himstsses and plans in with reminiscences of some golf he stared down at d with crook and some interested queries about mainwaring wqhter renee one of the finest young horsewomen in the suzanne lieve that humey sat in the otherwise deserted colonial room sipping now smoking afterdinner cigars he felt ready to nail the two and might bre were twentyone members of the board frank considered six srm to be all but in the bageither because of their relationship enci him or because of business they would lose if ultramed was forced sut of sterling allowing for two noshows at the meetingand given the boards track record that was a conservative estimatehe would need only three or four more votes to block the buy back regardless of the judges position and at least half of those votes were right there at the table sitting it seemed in the palm of his hand all he needed to do ever so carefully was close his fingers unlimited potential frank allowed himself the flicker of a smile dont go too far away ms baron he thought eyeing the two men over his snifter im coming they sure know how to do it right here dont they he began bill crook logy from the meal and the drinks mumbled agreement he was a slapontheback ivy leaguer with a reputation for enthusiastically supporting the ideas of others while never coming up with an original one of any substance whitey bourque belched and dabbed at his lips with the corner of his napkin frank noticed the tangles of fine veins reddening his cheeks good beef he humphed nothing we dont have at the store but good lisette always said yours is the only place in town to buy meat whitey frank said as a matter of fact i think ill have her stop by tomorrow and stock up our freezer so now before we break up and head home to our families i want to be sure ive answered all the questions either of you might have about just what ultramed has on the drawing board for our hospital bill the banker thought for a moment and then shook his head sounds like a pretty ambitious and exciting set of objectives to me frank he said and dont forget for a moment that ultramed plans to finance every one of these projects with local money sterling national bank money if i have my way whitey bourque shook three sugars into a cup of coffee and drank it in one gulp no questions he said ill have details of our proposal for competitive bidding on our dietary service in your hands by the end of the month thatll be fine frank fine excellent frank glanced at the check and then handed it and his gold card to the waitress bring us a few more of those little mints honey he said he cleared his throat and turned back to the table so gentlemen ive enjoyed sharing this meal with you both and i presume ultramed and i can count on your support at the board meeting friday the two men looked at one another silently selecting a spokesman whitey bourque was chosen well frank he said all we can tell you at this time is that depends frank felt suddenly cold depends on what on what your father comes up with these next couple of days he called us yesterday frank and asked us to keep our minds open on this business until he had checked up on a few things i felt that considering how much help he was to me during last years fund raiser for the new parish house that was the least i could do and i owe him for the way he stepped in when my boy ted experimented with that damn dago red wine and had that accident crook chimed in he saved the kids buns for sure gentlemen please frank said struggling to keep any note of desperation from his voice im not arguing against the good works the judge does around this town for goodness sakes thats a given and im proud to be his son but its apples and oranges what were talking about here is support for your hospital and the good works weve been doing renees broken wrist whitey remember that or or how about that coronary your mother had last year bill people say that if it werent for our new unit and our new cardiologist she would have died i i understand crook said staring down into his empty glass well whitey bourque sighed frank were sorry he said wed like to help you out but we gave the judge our word wed wait and follow his recommendation hes the chairman of the board and hes doin all the legwork on this thing all we want is whats best for sterling since were all too busy to do indepth research of any kind were sort of counting on him to steer us in the right direction i hope things work out and whatever happens i intend to help you and the hospital in any way i can ditto for me frank crook said well then i guess theres nothing more i can say is there you gave a good presentation frank bourque said standing a damn good presentation your fatherd be proud hey what the heck well work it out whitey im sure of it frank forced the words through a noose of anger and frustration tightening about his throat he walked the two men to the dirt parking lot shook their hands amiably and watched until their taillights had disappeared into the night then he turned and landed a vicious kick on the door of the porsche leaving a dent and a small scrape heedless of the damage he leapt behind the wheel and skidded from the lot spraying a retired salesman and his wife with sand and stones from the moment she had heard the porsche screech into the drive and the screen door slam lisette knew it was going to be another one of those nights with a mumbled greeting and not so much as a peck on the cheek frank stormed past her and into his den she stood in the darkened hallway waiting for the clink of ice in his glass frank did not disappoint her now as she brewed a pot of the herbal tea that frank had once introduced to her as the only drink i ever touch after ten she battled the urge to bury herself in bed she set the pot two cups some sliced lemon and some sugar wafers on a tray and carried them to the study frank was standing in one corner his back to her reading hi whats the book she asked nothing he shoved the volume back into the bookcase and turned to her but she had caught enough of a glimpse to know it was his high school yearbook frank are you okay yeah sure im great do me a favor and just leave me alone will you his words were already beginning to slur i brought you some tea i dont want any fucking tea frank please i said i dont want any goddamn tea he swiped his arm across hers sending the tray spinning across the room tea splattered on the wall the fine china a wedding gift from her mother shattered stunned she stared at the mess frank somethings wrong with you she said as calmly as she could you need help please honey i love you the girls love you for our sake youve got to get some help she stepped toward him her arms extended i dont need any help he screamed what i need is to be left alone please she took one more tentative step forward and he hit hera swift backhand slap to the side of the face that sent her reeling against a chair i dont need you i dont need my fucking father i dont need goddamn ultramed i dont need anyone im going to make it and nothing any of you can do is he stopped in midsentence and looked down at her as if noticing her for the first time instantly the fury in his face vanished baby oh jesus are you all right he asked moving toward her lisette backed away forcing herself not to touch the burning in her cheek then she turned and bolted from the room baron stared thoughtfully at the receiver in her hand and then set it gently in its cradle frank just lied to me ed she said i dont like it i dont like it at all as she sipped her coffee she gazed out of her thirtiethstory office window across boston harbor to the airport it was just after eight in the morning and traffic was as usual badly backed up coming into the sumner tunnel she had spent the night in the city working into the early morning on several impending ultramed acquisitions and then catching a few hours of sleep on the foldout in her office the riata ceo still perspiring from his daily sevenmile run scanned the list of the davis regional hospital board of trustees which two did he meet with he asked the top two on that sheet bourque and crook he told me just now that the session went well and that both men were as good as in the bag those were his words precisely the only problem is that stan ogilvie our man on the board told me last night that judge iverson had contacted all of them and that bourque and crook had both given their word to go along with anything he recommended so maybe frank talked them into changing their position possible but doubtful ed hes scrambling i just know it he refuses to admit that hes in over his head no matter how big the writing on the wall becomes he keeps thinking hes going to pull this off she filled two crystal goblets with fresh orange juice and passed one over gcthis is your baby leigh blair said leigh nodded grimly three more new england hospitals were close to coming over but all of them were holding out until the davis regional sale was final blair was watching her performance as closely as she was watching franks and the genius behind riata international was hardly one to tolerate a failure of this magnitude from anyone well she said i guess its time i took a little trip up north i think my friend that is a wise decision youve done an excellent job with frank iversonan amazing job all things considered but its becoming increasingly clear that the man is limited it would seem he has gone about as far as he can go and then some she observed she sighed what is it blair asked surely you cant be upset about pulling the plug on a man whos so blatantly put his own concerns ahead of yours or our companys no she said but i cant help thinking that ill miss him at all the regional meetings miss him yes she smiled wistfully frank iverson may be a little short on principles and a little long on ego but hes been great visuals the pain a gnawing empty ache centered beneath the very tip of franks breastbone had begun soon after his fight with lisette and had intensified throughout the night he had thrown up several times and he suspectedalthough he had not turned on the bathroom light to checkthat the last time had been blood a bottle and a half of maalox had helped calm the burning some and enabled him to shave and dress and make it to his office in reasonable shape but he sensed that it was only a matter of time before the searing pain resurfaced it was lisettes own damn fault that he had hit her if she had only been more patient more understanding of the stress he was under she could have been a wife and not just another strain on his life zack the judge mainwaring leigh baronas if he didnt have enough balls in the air without lisette taking potshots at him what goddamn nerve telling him he needed to get some help when she should have been giving it to him it was a miracle his stomach hadnt gotten fucked up long before this he snatched up the phone and dialed the hospital pharmacy sammy its frank iverson whats the name of the stuff thats good for stomach troubles no no not that stuff the pills cimetidine yeah thats it listen could you bring me up a weeks supply i know its a prescription drug dammit i dont need any lectures what i need are those pills good and not a word about this to anyone right all he needed was a rumor going around that frank iverson had a bleeding ulcer he slammed down the receiver and took another long swig of maalox it might have been a mistake not to have leveled with leigh baron about bourque and crook but this battle was between him and the judge and the encounter with those two spineless yesmen was no more than a skirmish by the meeting he would have more than enough votes to block the buy back he thought about calling mainwaring for a progress report if anything could help calm down his stomach it was a few reassuring words from him two hundred fifty thousand back in the ultrameddavis account and left over to build on just the notion of that kind of money was enough to ease the queasy sensation he simply had to calm down ignore lisettes behavior and concentrate on the judge and the board the ultimate success both within the company and without was so close he could taste it he culled mainwarings atlanta number from his rolodex and was in the process of dialing when his secretary cut in on the intercom mr iverson its annette her voice instantly stirred up images of their sensual uncomplicated unselfish evenings togetherevenings in sharp contrast to those he had been enduring with lisette annette was the perfect lowstress woman for highstress times and frank made a mental note to have her work late again as soon as possible yes annette he said go ahead mr iverson dr jack pearl is here to see you he knows he doesnt have an appointment but he says its quite important pearl frank could think of nothing the distasteful little fairy could have to say that he would ever possibly want to hear annette ask dr pearl if whatever it is can wait until later on this oh never mind have him just come on in pea ri looking as usual as if he hadnt shaved in two days entered franks office with a sheaf of papers in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other and immediately caught his foot on the doorjamb and stumbled sloshing most of his coffee onto the persian rug oh shit oh fuck he mumbled dropping to his knees and dabbing at the spill with a handleerchief that was far from virginal frank was about to insist that he simply get up and leave the mess to housekeeping instead he threw pearl a towel from the bathroom and watched with some amusement as the physician crawled about the floor alternately swearing to himself and clucking like some obscene gigantic chicken enough jack enough frank said finally take a seat ill have annette get you a replacement for your coffeeunless you want to wring that towel out into your cup he laughed heartily sorry jack i was just kidding just kidding seriously do you want some more nno frank no thank you okay then so what is this matter of such earthshaking importance pearl shifted uncomfortably go ahead frank said im not going to bite you theresum pearl coughed and cleared his throat thereve been a couple of things that have come up problems with serenyl franks eyes grew narrow and hard what the fuck are you talking about jack the anesthesiologist began to tremble well he managed what i meant was not problems exactly um a more like potential problems i really needed to talk to you frank you havent been around business jack i had business for chrissake get to the point i had a visitor in my office monday morning frankhis words began to come a bit more easilya doctor who is on the verge of figuring out that mainwaring and i arent using the anesthe ics my operative notes say we are thats impossible frank said his mind already churning through the implications of discovery at this final stage of the game awkward certainly he concluded perhaps even expensive if some sort of payoff was needed but not catastrophic the testing was complete the whole project had been designed to make jason mainwaring comfortable enough with serenyl to buy it and in that sense the project was already a total success i warned you this might happen pearl was saying i warned both of you what are you talking about jack the recovery time i told you and mainwaring someone might pick up on it but you wouldnt listen to me and now someone has his word initially stuttered and uncertain began spilling out like a slot machine payoff and thats not all either theres this kid we operated on last january for a hernia and and hes been having these nightmares and okay okay frank said holding his hands up enough of this bullshit i want you to slow down calm down go back and start at the beginning got that good now first of all jack exactly who are we talking about well frank it its your brother your brother zachary zack again for frank the minutes that followed were the purest torture he listened impassively struggling to maintain his concentration and composure in the face of the grotesque little man and the fireball of hatred that was tearing at his gut he studied the notes pearl had broughtzacks review of the gallbladder cases and the hospital record of toby nelms then he insisted pearl go through the entire story again step by step midway through that recounting he excused himself for a few minutes citing the need to get some papers signed and in the mail to boston then he strolled placidly through his outer office and down the hall to an empty mens room where he threw up twenty minutes later he had picked up the cimetidine and some more maalox at the pharmacy and stood confronting himself in another mens room mirror as a quaterback he had learned that plays seldom went exactly as the coaches had diagrammed them in the playbook a lineman stumbles and everybodys timing is thrown off a halfback is thinking about a fight he has had with his girlfriend and misses a crucial block the quarterback worth his salt always kept his head always expected the unexpected and it was in this area frank reminded himself the instinctive reflex ability to react and to adjustthat frankie iverson had been the very best this time as in so many sticky situations on so many playing fields his edge would lie in keeping a cool head he had picked through pearls story a piece at a time and realized that things werent yet nearly as bleak as he had initially perceived when he returned to his office he was scrubbed combed and outwardly calm annette dolan dressed in a shortsleeved pink sweater with a band of fine beadwork flowing over her breasts looked even more alluring than usual much work to do keep tonight open if you can frank scribbled the words on a scrap of paper signed the note with a smiley face and set it by her elbow as he passed she glanced at it and almost imperceptibly smiled and nodded now there frank thought as he opened the door to his office was an understanding woman the office was empty annette did dr pearl leave he asked over his shoulder no just you she said at that moment the toilet in his private bathroom flushed the notion of jack pearl sitting on his john was enough to start the acid percolating again in franks gut he would have to get housekeeping to scrub the whole place down before he so much as stepped foot in there again pearl emerged from the room wiping his nose with one hand and tugging at his stillopen fly with the other hope you didnt mind my using your head frank he said this whole business has really messed up my insides and ive got the shits something awful frank smiled plastically and vowed that after the sale of serenyl was completed sending jack pearl as far from sterling as possible would rank in priority only slightly below dealing with zachary okay jack he said tell me what it is exactly that you want pearl cleared his throat well the more ive thought about the properties of the drug i built serenyl fromthe more i realize that its possible your brother might be right about that kid thats ridiculous why jack you and mainwaring have done five hundred cases five hundred have you encountered even one problem no but but what jack if the kids problem is due to the drug then its some sort of delayed reaction a flashbackthats what your brother called it if hes right maybe some others are having them but they just havent connected the episodes with the anesthe ic if i knew for sure that was going on i could fix it frank i know every molecule in that drug i could do it jack

thats perfect jack just like that little anesthe ic of yoursabsolutely perfect okay frank pearl said stubbing out his cigarette and shuffling to the door you win the door opened and closed and pearl was gone you win thats right frank thought excitedly i do he had handled the distasteful little pervert brilliantly after tough gorounds with leigh the judge and the two board members it felt splendid to be back in control again all he had to do now was keep zack at bay and off balance for another week and whatever it took to accomplish that he would do meanwhile some wellplaced pressure on a couple of weak trustees and the future of ultramedand of frank iversonat the hospital would be secure after that he would be in a position to deal in a more definitive way with both his goddamn vindictive brother and pearl frank frank hes our man if he cant do it the intercom crackled on mr iverson its annette again theres a mr curt largent on three he says hes a neighbor of yours major curtis largent us army ret was the way the aging war hero had painted his mailbox confined to a wheelchair by an errant piece of shrapnel during a battle for some village or church in italy largent was the unofficial security guard of franks neighborhood surveying the area for hours at a time from his upstairs porch and noting down in a book all suspicious comings and going as well as virtually every license number of every car he did not know twice over the years his vigilance actually had thwarted crimein one case the theft of a bicycle and in the other the illegal dumping of some landfill off the end of the turnaround hello major its frank iverson the last words of the cheer were still reverberating in this thoughts what can i do for you largent despite a college educationengineering

home twenty or more rings brought no answer fifteen minutes later he brought the porsehe screeching around the corner and up the hill to his house fucking lisette he had kept muttering throughout the trip home goddamn fucking lisette lisette the children and the truck were gone most of the house was still intact but she had taken her jewelry the microwave the largest television hers and the twins bureaus their toys bicycles and beds and had left all the liquor bottles she could find smashed to bits in the kitchen sink including the twohundreddollar bottle of chateau lafite rothschild he had given her on her birthday and was saving to celebrate the serenyl sale the note carefully printed on lisettes lavender stationery was pinned to a pillow on their bed you will never hit me again please do not try to find us ill contact you when im good and ready was it worth it frank slapped the bedside lamp to the floor and then balled the note in his fist and threw it across the room youll see he muttered angrily a million fucking dollars from now youll see what was worth it and what wasnt you disloyal bitch he started for the liquor cabinet but then remembered the mess in the kitchen sink and instead stormed from the house and drove off as he spun out of the driveway from the corner of his eye frank caught a glimpse of major curtis largent u s army ret sitting on his upstairs porch rocking and watching the afternoon felt as close to normalas close to the way afternoons once wereas any barbara nelms could remember sunlight was streaming through the bay windows in the living room and kitchen bathing a house that was spotlessly clean stacked on the dining room table were the dishes she would use to serve dinner to the first company she and bob had invited over in more than half a year toby lay on his belly on the living room carpet leafing through the pages of a glossy coffeetable book on the history of aviation on an impulse barbara had stopped and bought the book on the way home from the boys outdoor session with dr iverson that impulse had proven to be inspired over the days that had followed toby had spent hours quietly examining the photographs and paintings and more importantly he had not had a single seizure since then predictably bob had wanted to rush right out and buy a model kit to begin building with their son but she had cautioned him to go slow and for the moment to leave well enough alone even the psychiatrist phil brookings had been a help although he had declined to see toby until after dr iverson had finished his evaluation he had seen barbara herself for two sessions and was encouraging her to bring bob in for some family counseling as well as she strhightened out the bookshelves and polished the already glistening clock on the mantel barbara mentally ticked through the meal she had planned and the music she would choose perhaps after dessert and coffee if she could nudge someone into a request she might even play for them herself it had been so long since she had allowed herself the luxury of such mundane thoughts toby she ventured how would you like to help me put together the dinner were going to make for billys mom and dad tonight toby continued to flip through his book occasionally reaching out to run his fingertips over one of the planes okay she said cheerfully suit yourself just let me know if you get bored with your book ill be right in the kitchen it had been worth a try minutes later as barbara stood by the sink washing vegetables she heard a soft noise behind her suddenly tense she whirled toby was standing by the kitchen door the corners of his mouth crinkled upward in something of a smile barbara felt a surge of excitement hi she said swallowing against the forceful beating of her heart want a job the boy hesitated and then ever so slightly he nodded great i mean thats fine honey i could really use the help here let me get your little stool she put the wooden stool by the sink and handed toby the peeler okay she said now all you have to do is scrape this over the carrots until they all look like this one see thats it perfect listen im going to the laundry room to fold some clothes when you finish with the carrots ill get you started on the potatoes normal barbara had never dreamed she would cherish the feeling so much as she headed toward the laundry room she glanced at the wall clock hey to be she said returning to the kitchen guess what its time for she snapped on the twelveinch blackandwhite set that she kept on the counter to watch soap operas the cartoon intro for robin the good was just ending toby stood on his stool scraping the carrots washing them in the cool running water thinking about airplanes and looking over from time to time at robin and his men now maids and men friar tuck was saying its time to learn about our letter of the day today its a very special letter because its the only one that always has the same letter come after it its the letter that starts the words quick and quail and quart can you guess what it is q toby said absently how many said qt the friar asked well if you did say q youre right so now without further ado heres robin and alan to sing about what letter right our good friend q alanadale strummed his huge guitar several times then robin the good leapt onto a giant rock and hands on hips began to sing alas my loover you do me wroong i do not thiink that thou art true for thou has yeet to sing a soong aboutout the leeter qoo with the first few notes of music toby stopped his scraping and began staring at the tiled wall the peeler slipped from his fingers and clanked into the steel sink he rubbed at his eyes as the blue and gray tiles grew brighter it was beginning to happen just like all the other times it was beginning to happen mommy he called out the word but heard no sound they were coming for him the nurse and the man with the mask they were coming for him again mommy please his eyes drifted downward toward the sink toward the splashing water stop them his mind urged dont let them touch you again his hand closed about the black handle of a knife that lay beside the peeler stop them as he lifted the knife sunlight flashed off its broad wet blade over the half year since her sons attacks first began barbara nelms had developed a sixth sense about them it was as if something in the air changedthe electricity or the ions there had been false alarms times when she had raced through the house terrified only to find toby sitting in the bay window and staring out at the lawn or lying in the den mechanically watching a show that held absolutely no interest for him but there were other times especially of late when she had found him thrashing wildly on the floor or pressed into a corner his frail body cringing from the recurring horror that was engulfing him from within barbara was folding the last of the linen when she began to sense trouble it started as no more than a tic in her minda notion the house was too quiet the air too still like a deer suddenly alert to the hum of an engine still too distant for any man to hear she cocked her head to one side and listened all she could hear was the soft splash of water in the sink and the sound of the television robin the good was singing his alphabet songa series of absurd illrhymed tributes to each letter sung to the tune of greensleeves it was a melody barbara had actually loved before encountering the portly actors version now it grated like new chalk toby she called out toby can you hear me there was no answer toby honey she set aside the sheet she had been about to fold and took a tentative step toward the door then she began to run she bolted through the deserted kitchen and was halfway to the living room when she heard the crash of a lamp and her sons terrified scream noooo dont touch me dont touch me he howled if you touch me there ill cut you i will stop it stop it toby was backing toward the far end of the living room thrashing his arms furiously at assailants only he could see it took several seconds for barbara nelms to realize that he was wielding a knifea carving knife with an eightinch blade then she saw the blood inadvertently toby had cut himselfa wide slash on the front of his thigh just below his shorts crimson was flowing down his leg from the wound but he was totally heedless of it toby barbara raced toward him then slowed a step as his wildeyed fury intensified stay away from me dont touch me toby please its mommy please give me that knife he backed into the hallway still slashing at the air his lips were stretched apart his teeth bared in a frightening snarling rictus there was no sign that he recognized her his flailing sent a pair of framed photographs spinning from the wall the glass exploded at her feet toby please all barbara nelms could see now was the blood cascading down her sons leg and over his foot leaving grotesque crimson smears on the carpet he was nearing the bathroom if he reached it and locked himself inside there was simply no way she could let him do that the hallway was too narrow for any kind of attack from the side focusing as best she could on the knife which toby was slashing in wild choppy arcs barbara ducked against the wall and dove at him the point of the blade flashed down catching her just at the tip of her shoulder and tearing through her flesh and the muscle of her arm shocked by the viciousness of the pain she dropped to her knees clutching the wound with one hand and trying to hold onto tobys tshirt with the other blood gushed from between her fingers again the eightinch blade slashed down reflexively she pulled away her arm the glancing blow sliced another gash in the skin by her elbow before she could recover toby had spun away from her and lurched into the bathroom toby no she screamed as the door slammed shut and the lock clicked woozily she got to her knees and pounded on the door toby open up open up please its mommy the only response was the shattering of glass against tile through a sticky trail of her own blood barbara nelms crawled to her bedroom and dialed this is barbara nelms ridgeview she panted my eight yearold son has locked himself in the bathroom he has a knife and hes already cut himself please please send help the walls had begun to spin she hung up and glanced at her arm the larger wound three inches or four gaped obscenely beefy bleeding muscle protruded from the cut the room began to dim and barbara knew that she was close to passing out she lay on her back and dialed the hospital this is an emergency she gasped forcing hysteria from her voice as best she could please help me i must speak to dr iverson dr zachary iverson it is a matter of life and death chapter seventeen the afternoon was oppressively warm and humid much to judge clayton iversons relief several continuances and a noshow had led to the completion of the docket of the clarion county court far earlier than usual returning to his chambers he slipped off his black robe and tossed it onto the brass coat rack near his desk with two unanticipated free hours before leigh baron was due at the farm he was rapidly becoming obsessed with thoughts of a shower and a cold drink or two his white shirt was soaked through with perspiration and his underwear felt as though it were glued to his body over the summer btu by btu the courthouse airconditioning system had been dying even worse the chances of getting it replaced before several more summers had come and gone were the judge knew remote there was a time when he would have laughed at such inconveniences but now he could barely keep his mind off his own discomfiture and concentrate on the cases at hand perhaps he reasoned in what had become a recurring internal dialogue it was time to consider retiring despite frequent promises to his wife and to himself to cut back to travel more and work lessthe pace of his life had if anything speeded up since buying the house in west palm six years before he and cinnie had spent exactly two weeks there and had finally leased it out they had no real need for the rental income but it had made no sense to leave the place vacant the judge knew that with her arthritis worsening and her childhood roots in north carolina cinnie would jump at the chance to sunbathe away at least some of the grueling new hampshire winter they had friends who had already made the move south and sounded ecstatic about their choice and goodness knew his golf game could always use some attention retirement such a soothing notion he thought such a frightening reality it was one thing to consider leaving the bench he had done about as much as he could do seen about as much as he could see in that position but it was quite another to pack up and move to the land of oversized tricycles and afternoon tea dances the judge sank into his chair and mopped at his brow with a towel for the time being at least cinnie and her arthritis would just have to make do bum airconditioning or not he had yet to reach the point where the liabilities of giving everything up and retiring to florida were outweighed by a few less aches and pains for her and a few more rounds of golf for him besides he reflected excitedly for the foreseeable future he had business to attend to in sterlingimportant business in what could well become a landmark move in slowing the advancing juggernaut of rorporate medicine he had elected to spearhead the repurchase of davis regional hospital from the ultramed hospitals corporation and then to supervise its reorganization and transition back to community control meetings politicking bargaining rearranging bending standing firm winning losing clayton iverson felt an almost sexual rush at the thoughts of what the months ahead held in store it was an ironic harbinger of things to come that even without knowing he had already made up his mind leigh baron was making the fourhour drive from boston just to talk it was also he knew probably not the last time ultramed and riata corporate leaders would be dashing up to sterling for a session with him it would be interesting to see the ploys they chose to tryinteresting and amusing for whatever they were he had absolutely no intention of changing his mind not that his decision to convince the board of trustees to annul the davis sale had come easily in fact it had been one of the most difficult he had ever had to make and the stickiest part of all was frank engrossed in thoughts of his son the judge packed guy beaulieus folder apd some related documents into his briefcase and left the courthouse for the drive home zack was right he acknowledged as he rolled down main street and then out of town along the androscoggin road toward the turnoff to the farm frank had done an excellent job as administrator of the hospital it wasnt his fault he was working for a company whose policies were so selfserving that they could ultimately cause catastrophes such as annies nor was it his fault at least according to zack that the corporation had set out deliberately to destroy guy beaulieu handling frank just right through all of this would be a test perhaps the hardest test of all still the man was worth the effort he had fallen on some hard times true made some bad decisions but nevertheless the initial warning blast of the approaching tractor trailer entered clayton iversons thoughts as nothing more intrusive than the familiar drone of a distant foghorn he was driving by rote looking without seeing the second blast far more desperate and insistent startled him from his reverie with an ugly and terrifying suddenness the left side of the chrysler had drifted far across the twolane roadso far in fact that the solid dividing line was streaking along underneath the very center of the car the semi a monstrous red gmc was hurtling toward him its air brakes screeching its grillwork gaping down at him like the balleen of a whale in the clamorous surreal frozen moments that followed the judge processed countless minute details of the scene before him the high slavic cheekbones of the burly trucker who was staring down at him in wideeyed terror and fury his green baseball capits gold brim the sun glinting off the trucks windshield the white script tenbys on the crimson wind deflector above the cab the horn the air brakes the face the grill the sun the screeching tires with no conscious realization of what he was doing clayton iverson whipped the wheel of the chrysler to the right spinning into one ninetydegree turn and then another before skidding to a stop on the gravelly soft shoulder lurching and heaving from its efforts the behemoth rig barreled past shaking the chrysler viciously in the vacuum of its wake the judge glanced in the rearview mirror in time to see the trailer stop its pitching and level out as the trucker gradually regained control gasping for breath he continued staring at the mirror until the crimson reflection disappeared around a bend then he sat by the roadside trembling mercilessly and waiting either for his heart and lungs to burst or for the adrenaline surging through his body to subside he had had more than his share of close calls on the road before although none much closer than this one and after each one as now he silently thanked his higher power for giving him reflexes quick enough to compensate for being one of the most easily distracted drivers ever set behind the wheel of a car he also paid brief tribute to his own foresightedness in purchasing one of the heavier models on the road after several minutes his pulse had slowed and his shaking had let up enough for him to swing back onto the roadway the rest of the drive he promised would be made at fifteen twenty at the most the trucker whoever he was had earned a pass to heaven with his masterful driving and masterful it was too he thought he fished a handleerchief from the dashboard pocket and wiped the drenching sweat from his face and hands absolutely masterfur he savored a deep breath then another his pulse returned to normal now he thought where was he ah yes frank it had been a joy to hear from both whitey bourque and bill crook of their dinner session with him one hell of a guy those had been bourques exact words smart well prepared and persuasive as the dickens it was almost like the old daysthe reporters the tv people the calls from friends every week judge thats one hell of a kid youve got there one hell of a kid judge can we get a shot of the two of you together at were you thinking when your boy took off and headed for the end zone like that as far as the judge was concerned the moment annie doucette had tumbled off the end of her bed the fate of the ultramed hospitals corporation in sterling had been sealed but speaking to bourque had helped him see that although the company had to go there was no reason frank had to go with it a few calls to select trustees had convinced him that the board would go along with him in keeping frank on as administrator now he had only to convince frank the judge had sped a hundred or so yards beyond the oversized silver mailbox marking the dirt drive to his farm before he realized that he had missed it damn you iverson he cursed out loud he slowed giving momentary thought to a uturn or to backing up then before he could talk himself into chancing either maneuver he accelerated over the five hundred additional yards to the next driveway twice trying turnarounds on that stretch of narrow road he had backed into the drainage ditch the last thing he needed at that moment was to spend a sweltering hour perched on the splitrail fence waiting for pierre rousseau and his damn tow truck he had a date with a shower and a ginandtonic and then with a lovely businesswoman who would try unsuccessfully to get him to reconsider his decision leigh baron wasnt all that tough but she was bright and certainly diverting and she would surely provide a decent warmup for the encounters to come with the real heavy hitters once again he felt the scintillationthe rushat the prospect of what lay ahead it was hardly difficult for him to understand why generals gave up their commands so reluctantly retirement nonsense he thought the game was on and clayton iverson was right in the middle of it as he eased the chrysler to a stop by his barn stepped out and surveyed his land and the mountains beyond the judge made a mental note to send a renewal off to their florida tenant before cinnie realized that the mans lease had run out the atmosphere in the intensive care unit was somber and extremely tense a child was in troubleserious trouble the nurses moved from one patient cubicle to another efficiently but more quietly than usual stopping from time to time at the doorway to number to see if the nurse working on toby nelms needed any assistance behind the nurses station next to the bank of monitors zack checked over the latest set of laboratory figures with the boys pediatrician owen walsh a softspoken man in his late fifties with close cropped graying hair and deep crows feet at the corners of his eyes which gave him a perpetually cheerful expression across from them in cubicle toby lay thrashing on a cooling blanket totally unresponsive to his environment his core temperature despite aggressive measures remained well above the firerescue squad had broken into the nelmss bathroom and found the boy draped over the side of the tub barely conscious with multiple selfinflicted slices and stab wounds on his arms abdomen and legs barbara nelms conscious but in shock lay in the bedroom blood still oozing from the gashes in her arm zack had arrived at the house in time to help with the first aid and the insertion of intravenous lines in both mother and child then he had accompanied the ambulance to the hospital and had turned barbara nelms whose blood pressure had responded nicely to a fluid push over to the general surgeon greg ormesby finally after getting toby up to the icu and onto the cooling blanket zack had begun to repair his wounds none of which involved tendons or vital structures and frightening as the lacerations appeared zack knew that they were of little importance compared to the fever and the deterioration of the boys central nervous and cardiovascular systemsa constellation of signs that were almost certainly a reflection of brain swelling do you think boston owen walsh asked like many community pediatricians especially older ones walsh was far more comfortable dealing with patients in his office than in the hospital and was not comfortable at all with a critically ill child in the intensive care unit at this point im not even sure he could make it zack said although i guess thats what we should be shooting for hes been a patient there in the past you know i know owen i know and i know youre nervous about having him here the truth is im not so comfortable with it myself but believe me as someone who a month ago might have been called in to see this kid after his transfer to boston our fluids are just as good as theirs sore our cooling blanket and our tylenol and our steroids and weve got a hell of a cardiologist in suzanne cole so its not like were doing nothing i think we should alert the people down there about whats happening and put one of the chopper teams on standby but theres something we ought to attend to first the anesthe ic exactly zack had shared tobys history with the pediatrician withholding only his suspicion that some sort of secret anesthe ic might have been used during his hernia operation can you explain it to me again walsh asked sure in a second zack stood and peered across at toby swathe in bandages surrounded by the monitor the clipboards the intravenous gastric and oxygen tubings and the large cooling blanket console the child looked terribly frail and vulnerable any change zack called out to the nurse attending him temps down to doctor she said no other change pupils still equal and reactive but sluggish thank you he glanced at the monitor in time to catch several ominous premature heartbeats see if you can locate dr cole please he said to the unit secretary ask her if she can come down here he turned back to the pediatrician okay owen now if what were seeing is some sort of central toxic reaction to an anesthe ic then as far as im concerned the actual molecules of the drug or at least their chemical imprints are still there in tobys brain clogging up neuro pathways and periodically firing off messages without any warning or control from him the seizures or flashbacks or whatever you want to call them somehow the messages these molecules are transmitting are violent onesones related to the surgery but why zack found himself asking for perhaps the millionth time y do they happen when they do why not to every patient or at least to more of them the answer he felt certain had to be some sort of neuroactivatora trigger or more likely given the rarity of the condition a specific sequence of triggers no other explanation made sense zack you were saying owen walsh was looking at him curiously oh sorry zack made a mental note to go over with barbara nelms the minute details of the events preceding tobys attacks he would also write down his best recollection of the minutes preceding and following suzannes bizarre episode do you follow all this so far walsh said okay zack drew a sketch of several nerve endings on a piece of scratch paper and used the diagram to illustrate his theory so what we might consider doing is putting toby back under again in a perfectly controlled sensorydeprived situation one of those isolation tanks would be ideal but i understand thats just not possible with him being so sick anyhow we just make things as dark and as quiet as we can and we administer the same anesthe ic he received originally and what wed be trying to do walsh said would be literally to wash out the molecules that are sending violent sensory messages and replace them with molecules transmittingwhat blanks precisely you just thought of this actually zack said there was some work done in the late sixties and early seventies using the isolation tank technique on patients who had become psychotic from recurring lsd flashbacks you mean they treated lsd psychoses with lsdt zack nodded a neurologist in europe scotland i think successfully successfully enough to be encouraging this time it was walsh who stood and gazed in at their patient the crows feet by his eyes deepened with what he saw dangers he asked given the disaster youre observing in there zack said i dont see how giving the child some anesthesia can do much harm as long as the anesthesiologist is standing by to intubate him if necessary will jack pearl go along with it that my friend may well turn out to be the sixtyfourdollar question he and i havent exactly seen eye to eye on this anesthesia business owen walsh nibbled at the edge of one fingernail perhaps we should present this to the boys parents and get their consent he said i can do that provided his mother is still stable and maybe your brother ought to know whats going on too hes a good man and an excellent administrator but he doesnt like surprises zack felt the prickle of irritation and impatience he reminded himself that one of the reasons he had opted to become a surgeon while others like walsh had chosen pediatrics or internal medicine was the speed with which they went about making decisions more often than not the primary care people and the surgeons ended up at the same spot they simply arrived there by different routes he motioned toward tobys cubicle owen he said we dont exactly have a lot of time to play around with this thing i can understand your reluctance but we either do this or we dont again the man hesitated okay zack he said finally you deal with pearl and barbara nelms and ill take care of alerting boston getting the helicopter people on standby and notifying your brother well meet back here at say sixthirty sixthirty it is and owen yes its the right decision chapter eighteen long before his wife had become pregnant he had selected the names of his sons and once suggested to her that should the unimaginable come to pass that they consider naming their daughter ruth after rutherford b hayes despite his pride in describing himself as an emerging liberal on the subject of womens rights the judge still had difficulty taking women seriously in any business dealings of substance and with no woman was that difficulty more intensely manifested than with leigh baron evening had settled in around the farm bringing with it a persistent windswept drizzle the judge sat with leigh in his study sharing coffee and some of cinnies apple pie and talking in only the vaguest terms about ultramed and its plans for the future it was nearing eight oclock the conversation with the woman was in his opinion becoming somewhat tedious in addition to ultramed they had touched on the stock market her ideas were innovative but charmingly naive he thought children she and her husband who spent most of his work week in new york had decided not to have any criminal justice her notions about the issues surrounding capital punishment were rather simplistic and poorly substantiated and sports she had the temerity to compare golf to croquet and to state that she would consider taking up the game only after she was physically no longer able to play tennis so my dear the judge said completely ignoring a question from her about the differences between putting greens in various parts of the country i assume that the powers that be in ultramed didnt send someone as bright and charming as you are just to pass the time with this old north woods warhorse no she said smiling at him curiously no they didnt the judge waited for her to continue well then he said finally clearing his throat i suppose they wish you to lay some of the groundwork for tomorrows board meeting in a manner of speaking are you always this evasive and and mysterious mrs baron judge iverson she said exactly who do you think i am thats a rather strange question dont you think i certainly know who you are do you there was a firmness in leigh barons voicea steely brightness in her eyes that clayton iverson had not noticed before still the ploy of asking questions rather than answering them was an amateurish tactic and one she would have to improve upon if her aim was to control their conversation okay he said after some thought ill play youre leigh baron vice president of the ultramed hospitals corporation your division is correct me if im wrong operations judge i hope this doesnt come as too much of a shock but i havent been a vice president at ultramed since oh just a few months after i negotiated our arrangement with davis regional we were restructured by our parent company my formal title now is managing director that translates into ceo startled the judge pulled from his briefcase the ultramed organizational chart guy beaulieu had compiled well then whosum blanton richards leigh smiled enigmatically judge iverson she said blanton richards hasnt been part of ultramed for several years i dont know who put that list together dr beaulieu i presume he was always putting lists togetherbut whoever it was didnt do his homework i know how much you expect to be dealing with the good old boys on matters such as this but im afraid that as far as ultramed is concerned im the good old boy now just a minute young lady young lady leigh barons expression was not a little patronizing judge iverson i appreciate the complimentreally i do but i think it will make things easier for both of us if you understand that my young lady days are well behind me im thirtyseven years old i was second in my mba class at stanford more than a decade ago i spent two years studying economics at oxford and i managed several smaller operations for riata international before i was brought into ultramed my income last yearnot counting bonuses and stock options was slightly over half a million dollars now if that little misunderstanding is taken care of to your satisfaction i would suggest we get down to work you and i have some important business to attend to yes he said clearing his throat again yes i suppose we do how about some more coffee first the judge suddenly felt edgy and anxious to do somethinganythingthat would disrupt the womans rhythm what he had anticipated would be a preliminary sparring match with ultramed had turned out to be the main event no thank you she answered but go ahead if you want i think i will he walked to the kitchen poured himself a cup laced it with a stiff slug of brandy and took a long sip the warm velvet rasp had a calming reassuring effect reminding him that although leigh baron had him back on his heels this was the sort of game he loved to playthe one in which he held all the trump cards he was still the chairman of the board of the hospital and in the end regardless of who leigh baron was how much she earned or what she had to say he was the one who controlled the votes his next swallow drained the cup he poured himself another before returning to the den okay ms baron he said with eversoslight emphasis whats your pitch no pitch judge simply put i would like to know what your plans are for the meeting tomorrow he tried for a bemused expression but sensed that he missed he held all the cards she knew that as well as he did and yet she continued looking at him as if whatever he had to say really made no difference he sought another taste of his brandied coffee but realized that he had once again drained his cup you have my letter he said in it i stated that it was quite possible the board and ultramed would be able to work things out judge we have reason to believe that the situation up here at least in your eyes has changed since you wrote that id like to know whats going on nothings going on ive done what i was supposed to do as chairman of the board here and sent you a letter the meetings tomorrow we expect youll be there to represent ultrameds interests at the end of the meeting therell be a vote cest tout he held his hands out palms up leigh baron rubbed at her eyes wearily judge that list you just consulted was that compiled by dr beaulieu as a matter of fact it was then i can assume that you have all the other material he had been scraping together against our company you did try to drive him out of practice that judge is ridiculous ultramed has grown faster than any company of its size in the field we know exactly what we are doing so does our parent company if we wanted somebody out believe me theyd be out where did you get the idea that we would do such a thing well actually it was from myactually its none of your business you can find out everything you want to know at tomorrows meeting your son zachary was a pall bearer at dr beaulieus funeral is he the one whos taken up beaulieus cause if he has then like i said youll find out tomorrow if he has then hes wrong if guy beaulieu was being driven from practice it was not by us perhaps the judge said sensing a shift in control back toward himself if thats true that should come out at the meeting also tell me something judge youve already made up your mind havent you i wouldnt say that at all she flashed that same disquieting smile you dont have to she said judge if your board does vote to repurchase ultrameddavis from us what were you planning to do about frank do why keep him on of course ifand mind you i said ifwe do vote to return the hospital to the community well need him hes done a terrific job you told me that yourself and i meant it too leigh said with one slightly enormous exception here judge i think youd better look this over carefully she removed a thin folder from her briefcase and handed it to him while youre doing that she went on if you could just point me toward your bathroom huh he had already started scanning the material oh its over there down that hallway and on the left thanks clayton iverson finished reading the first page written by a well established highly respected boston accounting firm it was basically an explanation and summation of the material to follow before going on he went again to the kitchen this time he poured brandy into his cup but did not bother adding coffee by the time leigh baron returned to the study he had reread the cover letter and begun to skim the lists of figures and transactions all of which seemed to bear up the accountants contention that almost three years before frank had embezzled nearly a quarter of a million dollars from the ultramed accounts whether it was the hour or the brandy or the acid anger welling in his throat the judge was having increasing difficulty concentrating on the specific financial transfer maneuvers which were characterized by the bookkeepers as rather superficial efforts to obscure the missing funds efforts which any reasonable audit would uncover and therefore ones which suggest mr iversons intention of making good the shortfall at some near date so leigh baron said suddenly this all becomes very serious business wouldnt you agree why havent you done anything about this before now oh come now judge its unbecoming for you to ask a question with so obvious an answer besides as weve both been saying franks done a terrific job for us its apparent that he just got a little greedy back there three years ago he does have a way of being headstrong sometimes but i guess you know that well i had actually decided that once the sale of davis to our company was a fait accompli i would write off the as sort of a bonus for his good work after all anyone can make a mistake sure sure and now youre saying that i would be making a mistake to vote against turning our hospital over to you you wont have left us much choice judge other than to press charges and believe me the evidence against frank is solidabsolutely rock solid in keeping with his overall outlook clayton iverson had always reserved his strongest emotionspositive and negativefor men but at that moment he hated the woman sitting across from him with more passion than he had ever hated anyone o in the hell did she think she was the question echoed impotently over and over again in his mind she looked like some sort of high fashion model and discussed issues with the naivetd of a schoolgirl and yet there she sat smiling quietly as she viciously blackmailed him the life of his son and by inference the lives of his daughterinlaw and granddaughters in exchange for a vote he should have retired he thought he had clearly lost his edge he should have stepped down from such dealings long ago his head was spinning i i need time to think he said i understand unfortunately you have only until tomorrow i was right in wanting your company out of our town mrs baron youre a very callous and selfserving woman lets not lower ourselves to namecalling judge its so unprofessional she stood so then tomorrow at one minute after noon everything will beshe shruggedexactly as it is right now only more permanent yes clayton iverson his weathered face flushed his eyes smoldering could not respond oh and judge she said there is one other thing i would like to review that material guy beaulieu accumulated i promise its return in a few days you cant have it the judge snapped judge iverson i know i dont have to spell it all out for you but let me do it anyway if you go along with our request your son will be exonerated from all he has done and we will complete our purchase of the hospital if you do not your son will probably end up in prison and his family will be disgraced your influence in sterling will be greatly diminished if not destroyed and we shall almost certainly end up with ultrameddavis just the same this is insane perhaps leigh baron said perhaps it is that material please dammit judge iverson face it its going to happen our business arrangement is going to be consummated as it was laid out either easily and cleanly or very very messily but its going to happen now reluctantly the judge passed beaulieus folder across leigh baron slipped it into her briefcase as i promised she said ill return this in a few days dont bother to show me out i know the way his face buried in his arm clayton iverson sat alone in his study listening to the soft spattering of night rain against the shutters in all his business dealings in all his years on the bench never had he been manhandled so brutally or efficiently as he had by leigh baroin this night desperately he struggled to keep his anger in checkanger directed as much at his son as at the ultramed ceo at this point he reminded himself he had only leigh barons side of the story before he made another move before he spoke to one more member of the board he and frank had to talk if frank could adequately explain why he took the money how he lost it how he was planning on replacing it perhaps they could work something out if not went to franks please dont worry clayton iverson set the note for cinnie on his desk and walked somewhat shakily to the chrysler wondering if perhaps he had had a bit too much to drink his thoughts tumbled about as he tried to focus on what his options might be he needed the fresh air of a drive as much as anything needed to clear his head needed to confront frank he put the car in gear turned around with more difficulty than usual and sped down the winding drive frank would have an explanation he thought he would have an acceptable explanation for everything and together they would find a reasonable way out but if there was no explanation if frank had nothing to offer evcept greed the judge sped through the turn onto the androscoggin access road a station wagon speeding south swerved sharply narrowly avoiding a collision clayton iverson did not notice of all the ungrateful inconsiderate things frank had ever done he was thinking this was absolutely the worst perhaps it was time he put his foot down prison or no prison disgrace or no disgrace perhaps it was time his eyes open but unseeing toby nelms lay twitching on the cooling blanket jerking one restrained hand from time to time in what might have been an attempt to get at the breathing tube jack pearl had inserted into his trachea his core temperature despite the blanket intravenous cortisone and several doses of rectallyadministered lylenol was still absolutely not pearl was saying theres absolutely no way i am going to put a critically ill child under anesthesia for some offthe all theory jack let me go over this again zack pleaded making no attempt to mask his exasperation what im proposing is not off the wall just because it isnt a widely used technique doesnt mean that its wrong hell the problem hasnt been studied enough to be certain one way or the other but there is the lsd article why do you think i drove all the way home to get it from my files for you no way pearl said suzanne joined the two other physicians at the bedside for more than an hour she had been battling one flurry of irregular cardiac rhythms after another in the boy now for the moment at least the situation seemed to have stabilized but the dusky shadows enveloping her eyes were mute testimony to the tension of the struggle so where do we stand she asked sipping tepid coffee throughout the crisis she had made no overt reference to zacks theories regarding mainwaring and pearl although several times her expression had warnedor beggedhim against any confrontation with the anesthesiologist well zack said were right where we were before the arrhythmias started cerebral edema nothing more could be caused by the fever could be the cause of it could be both well for what its worth his arrhythmias seem to be under control its worth plenty nice going thanks so have you two decided are you going to put the boy back to sleep the two men exchanged glances then pearl looked away well jack zack said go ahead and tell her tell her what wetell her what you have decided look down at that child there think about what ive told you what ive shown you and tell her zack please suzanne said she turned to the anesthesiologist sorry he mumbled jack she asked i refuse to do it pearl said simply the evidence that this childs anesthesia had anything to do with his present condition is flimsy enough by itself used as justification for a highly questionable maneuver such as iverson here is proposing is absurd i positively refuse to do it do what frank iverson appeared near the foot of the bed he glanced from one physician to the next and then with some discomfort at the thrashing boy do what jack he asked again frank pearl said earlier in the week i filed an official report and complaint about a visit i had from your brother here at that time he accused me of any number of things including improperly anesthe izing this child why thats ridiculous zack said i never zack will you please let him finish thank you go ahead jack well now the boys got cerebral edemathats brain swelling from god knows what maybe some form of encephalitis or something your brother has this theory that if this is some nervous system reaction to the anesthesia he received my putting him under again with the same drugs might reverse the effect and frank said and i wont do it why why well because it it wont work frank thats why zack has this been done before in analogous circumstances yes i brought in an article describing the theory behind it then jack frank said calmly what harm would it do to put this boy to sleep again as zack is suggesting you put critically injured and ill patients under all the time dont you well yes but suzanne do you think this child would be able to handle being put to sleep i well his cardiac problems seem to have quieted down and he is already on a ventilator so actually i dont see why not but no buts jack im sorry i didnt get over here sooner to discuss all this but i was tied up trying to reach some people in akron now listen were in the business of helping people thats why were here if theres a chance that what zack is suggesting will help this kid i think you should try it my brothers a pain in the neck sometimes but hes hardly foolhardy if he says he has evidence then by god hes got evidence witnessing the bizarre exchange from his spot by the head of tobys bed zack sensed an intense nonverbal interplay occurring between his brother and the anesthesiologist he could also tell from pearls expression that the strange little man was no longer going to object to administering the drugs what were the anesthe ics again suzanne asked peiitothal and isoflurane pearl said gil yes are you going to do it zack asked how long do you think well have to keep him under eight minutes thats how long they did it in the article pearl glanced once again at frank okay he said unenthusiastically give me a couple of minutes to get my equipment together good ill try and get this place set up zack leveled his gaze at the man jack whatever the kid got for that hernia of his thats what he should get now understand he got pentothal and isoflurane pearl responded with exaggerated firmness now are we going to do this or not suzanne no objections she said okay then lets go for it zack said the eerie scene was one that nobody in the icu that night would ever forget throughout the unit all unnecessary lights were extinguished and every noncritical piece of equipment that produced a noise or vibration was shut off nurses sat silently and grimly beside their patients or by the nurses station in cubicle the only lights were flashes of zacks and jack pearls small penlights and the shimmering monitor readouts of toby nelmss cardiac pattern and blood pressure toby himself anesthe ized first with pentothal and now with the gas isoflurane lay motionless and peaceful his eyes patched and taped shut his ears plugged with oilsoaked cotton and covered with bandages his feet were encased in lambs wool two thin cotton blankets covered him on top and the waterfilled cooling blanket lay underneath him zack had checked both the new unopened vial of pentothal and the label on the isoflurane tank before okaying their administration now watch in hand he sat to one side of the darkened cubicle waiting jack pearls willingness to administer the two anesthe ics had dispelled some of his suspicions regarding an experimental drug but doubt remained and even if this treatment was the right one even if the anesthe ics were correct even if jack pearl was as pure and honorable a physician as galen zack knew they might have waited too long cerebral edema was all too often a oneway street five minutes six the time seemed endless blood pressure ninety and holding pulse seven minutes zack watched the last thirty seconds tick off glancing over briefly at suzanne whose attention was riveted on the monitor screen okay jack he said thats it eight minutes he threw back the draperies to the room and motioned the nurse back in her first move was to reinsert the rectal probe attached to the cooling blanket console its she said slowly toby began to stir as concentrated oxygen washed the isoflurane from his lungs and bloodstream zack bent over him and checked his pupils they were if anything more sluggishly reactive than before otherwise a toptobottom neurologic exam showed no change anything suzanne asked nothing zack left the cubicle and circled the counter to where she was stationed satisfied she whispered not really but i guess theres nothing more i can do across from them jack pearl had removed tobys eye patches and was conducting his own exam i really appreciated your restraint in dealing with jack it wasnt easy i could tell you still dont believe me about all this do you she shook her head as i said in your office she whispered glancing first at the monitor and then at pearl one other case and ill at least listen im going to find it you know you are without a doubt the most headstrong man ive ever met im the most headstrong man ive ever met he said its my finest attribute she looked at him coolly well zachary that may be but unfortunately its also your most frightening one she brushed past him and joined pearl at the bedside zack stood alone at the nurses station fighting the hollowness in his chest trying to cling to the notion that for the moment at least he had done all he could for toby nelmshe had done his best dr iverson the ward clerk called to him from her desk the call on line two is for you its mr iverson zack frank said breathlessly im down in the e r weve got trouble maybe big trouble what auto accident two cars both drivers injured bad dunno about one of themapparently theyre still trying to cut him out of his pickup marshfields in with the other one right now let me just wash my face and ill be right down make it quick zack the guy marshfields working on is the judge chapter nineteen the emergency ward was bedlam nearly every bed was full as was the waiting room nurses some of whom zack recognized as having been called down from the floors were hurrying between patients the med locker and the supply room ekg and portable xray technicians were standing by their equipment in the hallway several blueclad rescue team members were assisting the nurses while several more sat perched on countertops filling out forms two of the rooms seemed to be the foci of most of the activity the judge is over there in eight frank said as he and zack crossed the lobby what in the hell was he doing driving around at this hour without mom anyhow i dont know zack you can ask him hes all bandaged and splinted up but hes perfectly with it he must be hes already told me that if we couldnt get a hold of hissontheneurosurgeon he wanted to be transferred to another hospital frank its okay not to be snide right now all right whos with him not sure marshfield was but i see him over there in trauma the other guy from the accident has just been brought in well do you want to call mom now or wait until we know whats going on the later the better as far as im concerned okay well maybe you can call lisette and have her go over and get her lisettes gone zack checked his watch well when will she be back no frank said shes gone as in gone its a temporary thing listen you go ahead in with the judge ill take care of mom and zack yes too bad things arent working out for that kid without waiting for a response frank turned and crossed the emergency ward to where two uniformed troopers were speaking with a reporter from the white mountains gazette yeah frank zack muttered flashing briefly on the bizarre sub rosa interplay between his brother and jack pearl too bad he was heading toward room when the curtain drew back and the nurse doreen lavalley emerged oh dr iverson itn glad you were able to get down here so quickly she said they called me down because i used to do e r work but its been a few years and im sure youre doing great whats the story well ive been in there since just after they brought your father in the rescue people found him sitting propped against a tree about fifty feet from the crash they suspect he was thrown out of the car and then walked or crawled over there he almost certainly has a fractured wrist the rescue people also report theres a huge gash in his lower back but nobodys had the chance yet to move him off the board to check it dr marshfield had to go in with the fellow from the other car from a distance at least that guy doesnt look good at all zack moved to a spot just outside the doorway to room through it he could see his father strapped to a transfer board with his head and neck secured in excellent first aid fashion one arm was wrapped and splinted the other fitted just above the wrist with an iv line a monitor was in place and chronicling a perfectly normal rate and rhythm did dr marshfleld have the chance to get any films doreen lavalley consulted a scrap of paper he got a portable shootthrough of his neck and a view approximately over where that gash is i had the lab draw a blood count and chemistries blood bank too yes i asked them to type him and crossmatch him for four units nice going doreen im glad to see youre still working here just one more week she said somewhat sadly ive taken a job with the visiting nurse association well thats going to be daviss loss thank you ill miss this place at least the way it used to be i will ill see if i can get those films if clayton iverson was relieved to see his son he showed little evidence of it zack was not surprised it had always been that way and regardless of the circumstances it would be that way this night hlo judge zack leaned against the bed rail assessing his fatherthe slight pallor about his lips the deepened creases at the corner of his eyes the man was in some pain and probably still bordering on shock reflexively zack reached across and increased the intravenous flow zachary the judge spoke through teeth nearly clenched by the bandages pulled tightly across his forehead and beneath his chin to stabilize his neck do you think you could get rid of this damn stuff as soon as ive seen the film of your neck judge apparently you werent all that coherent when the police arrived you could have hurt your neck and not know it you in much discomfort mostly my backright through here he motioned with his unsplinted hand at a spot just above his navel does your mother know im here frank went to take care of that have him tell her to wait at home and that ill call her later judge just relax and let us take care of things okay now what happened i dont know i was on my way over to ah to talk with frank and lisette about some investments theyre thinking of making and just as i was passing by cedar street boom the next thing i really remember was the inside of the ambulance to talk with frank and lisette lisettes gone judge whos lying frank to you or you to me did you hit your head not that i know zack suzanne stood by the doorway the x rays in her hand i came down to see if i could be of any help the nurse said shed be next door if you need her hows the boy not awake at all but still reasonably stable owen walsh is trying to arrange a transfer but i dont think hes been able to find a bed yet well im glad you could get down have you seen the films it was only then that he noticed the tension in her face something was wrong in the x rays flip em right up there he said motioning her to the two view boxes on the wall beside the judges litter she illuminated the lateral shootthrough of the judges neck zack counted to be certain that all seven cervical vertebrae were displayed and then checked the alignment and spacing of each normal he said perfect looks like were in luck judge well get a complete set of films just to be certain but i suspect theyll be fine i dont see any reason not to remove this harness theyve rigged up he reached for the restraint zack you may want to wait on that suzanne said snapping the second film into place there was a load of scrap metal in the pickup the police wonder if maybe he fell on something what is that thing the judge asked still constrained by the harness he was forcing his eyes far to the left in order to see the x ray its a chunk of metal dad zack said studying the piece which was stubby wedgeshaped and pointed on all three corners the longest sharpest point of the three was directly between two vertebrae the twelfth dorsal and first lumbar a pretty big chunk too ill need a lateral view to know how deep it is are you having any numbness or tingling in your legs at all i i dont think so well just the same i think ill leave you strapped in for now if you have to am i going to be all right of course you are but ill feel happier when we know exactly where that metal is and weve gotten someone to take it out youre not going to do it judge first things first okay suzanne can you send in the portable unit for a lateral view meanwhile ill go over the rest of him suction i need suction doctor do you want another line his pupils dilating christ i asked for suction the snatches of exchange between wilton marshfield and a nurse came from the trauma room hes vomiting again doctor i think hes seizing get me ten of valium for an iv push did you know that dr iverson is in with his father sounds like trouble the judge said are you going in there if they need me theyll come and get me zack said im not leaving you alone suze while youre out there can you please check on whats going on if thats the other driver from the accident find out who he is zack was completing a rapid exam when the curtain flew back and frank entered ooee what a zoo out there he said police reporters the works what gives here hes got a chunk of metal in his backsee it looks like it shot in there during the crash but maybe he fell on it or rolled over it i wont know exactly where it is until i see some more views but it obviously has to come out well judge frank said even if it does you got the better end of the deal in this one ole beau in there is a mess beau robillard zack and the judge said the name in unison yeah didnt you know public nuisance number one is right in the next room that was his rustbucket pickup you hit if hes operating true to form that scrap metal in the back of it was probably hot hey zack remember how robillard and his buddies used to follow you home after school and kick the daylights out of you frank that was junior high for goodness sakes he hasnt changed the judge said i see him in my court every other week it seems hes as nasty as ever nastier i should have put him away the last time i had the chance was there anyone in the truck with him nope frank answered the police say that while they were cutting him out of the cab he kept screaming that you ran the light at the bottom of the mill street hill thats ridiculous at that moment suzanne reappeared at the doorway with the xray technician zack she said wilton asked if you could help him next door the guy from the truck has a bad head injury hes started seizing his names robillard beau robillard we know he used to beat me up in junior high hes trash the judge said petty theft assault disturbing the peace zachary i dont want you going in there what you heard me tell marshfield youre tied up in here and you cant help him judge i cant do that zack paused waiting for support for his position from frank and suzanne there was none listen he said finally ive got to go in and at least honor his request for help besides you need more x rays and maybe a ct scan and and the o r teams got to be mobilized by the time all those studies are completed i should be done in there okay i already told you how i felt the judge said why are you asking if its okay zack frank said let me talk to you outside for a minute okay in just a second zack felt shaken please go ahead with a lateral of his thoracolumbar region and a shot of his wrist he said to the xray technician on second thought why dont you forget the portable take him over and get a really good set of films suze can you go with him sure owen walshil call me if anything develops in the unit you might want to go over him for preop clearance i dont think theyve had time yet to get a full ekg ill take care of that also find out whos on for orthopedics if you can zachary i meant what i said about robillard the judge said as suzanne and the technician wheeled him from the room i never meant anything more zack could only shake his head hey listen frank said when the two of them were alone just go in there and see robillard and do whatever you have to do leave the judge to me i know hes hurt and angry frank but all the same i cant believe he would talk like that i just cant believe it youve been away from hereaway from the manfor a long time remember buddy were not the only ones he keeps passing judgment on years and years of sentencing the same stiffs over and over again has done something to him listen dont worry about him i can handle things just go on in there and play doctor did you call mom i have one of the state troopers going to get her okay ill be next door frank thanks for your help i hope things with lisette get straightened out not to worry just get on in there and do whatever you have to the two of them left room zack entered the trauma room and frank crossed the e r to the xray department the judge had been moved on the transfer board to the xray table i need a minute alone with him frank said motioning suzande and the technician away judge listen he whispered when the others were out of earshot i tried to reason with zack about not seeing robillard but he just wont listen im on your side on this one one hundred percent just relax and let them take your pictures ill keep trying to make zack see whats right the rescue team nurses and emergency physician cleared a path as zack entered the trauma room his programming in the evaluation of nervous system damage was in reflex operation before he reached the bedside beau robillard lying nude on the trauma room litter was disheveled covered with cuts and abrasions and even worse off than zack had anticipated comatose respirations shallow minimally effective barely responsive to deep pain tight pupil two millimeters left pupil five millimeters sluggishly reactive was he ever awake wilton absolutely marshfield said he was awake when the police found him and moaning and incoherent when he arrived here then he seized some purposeless movement on the left side no movement on the iight babinski reflex absent both sides deep scalp laceration left paiietal region could i have a pair of gloves please size eight also get set to intubate him number seven point five tube wilton can i see his films we havent had a chance to get them what with your father coming in first and this creep looking a helluva lot better than he does right now do you know who he is yeah yeah zack said i know when this this thing here was a boy marshfield said he and his cronies beat up on my nephew so many times that my brother finally ended up having to send the kid to st michaels academy im telling you he was really a creep so were those two older robillard boys zack explored the deep scalp gash with his gloved fingers and felt the distinctive click of bone fragments well i dont care if hes the reincarnation of jack the ripper and attila the hun rolled into one he said hes got a subdural or epidural hematoma expanding on the left he needs burr hole drainage and quickly also see if you can get greg ormesby in here just in case somethings going on in his abdomen the nurse set a tray of equipment by zacks right hand he hunched over the head of the litter positioned the steel blade of the laryngoscope against robillards tongue and in seconds slid the polystyrene breathing tube through the mans vocal cords into his trachea hyperventilate him please zack said connecting a breathing bag to the tube and turning it over to the respiratory technician burr holes an hour in the operating room more if there was trouble zack backed away from the bed a stranglehold of indecision tightening about his chest both beau robillard and the judge needed surgery that of those at ultrameddavis he was by far the most qualified to perform from a purely medical perspective there was no dilemma no doubt about the priorities of the moment without immediate intervention robillard would die it was that simple but thanks to judge clayton iverson it wasnt that simple at all keep bagging him zack mumbled rubbing at the ache that had suddenly materialized between his temples be sure there are two teams available for the o r ill be right back he glanced into room it was still empty please he was thinking as he headed toward the xray department let that chunk of metal be just below the skin let it be someplace where anyone with a scalpel and a little training can get it out suzanne was standing by one of the departments banks of view boxes studying the films even from a distance zack could see that the position of the metal fragment was trouble hows he doing he asked okay hes complaining of some heaviness in his legs but i think you might have put that symptom in his head your mothers here franks got her in the quiet room i think that metals not in such a good spot huh its in near the cord if thats what you mean see right here how its chipped the edge of the vertebral transverse process removing it should be reasonably straightforward but it certainly wont be any smash and grab the areas got to be explored to be sure theres no bleeding around the cord damn but i wish this wasnt happening that robillard is going out a burr hole procedure now is his only chance and not such a huge one at that are you going to do it suzanne i dont have any choice of course im going to do it did you find out whos on for orthopedics sam christians the only one around but hes in the o r over at clarion county apparently he just started an open reduction damn well listen keep your eye on the judge okay im going to call john burris in concord hes an excellent neurosurgeon and with that beechcraft of his he can be up here in an hour or less meanwhile go ahead call in the radiologist and get a ct scan of the area see if we can assess the extent of bleeding this day is really the pits do you know that zack what the judge and frank told me what kind of a person this robillard is if hes really as bad off as you say maybe you should accept the inevitable and devote your energy to making sure your fathers all right suzanne i cant believe youre saying that really well what if it were me lying in there with a piece of metal up against my spinal cord zack this is your father were talking about suzanne that man in theres dying you know there are such things in this world as love and loyalty theyre allowed according to some people theyre even worthwhile virtues to have even physicians are allowed to be human that man you want to operate on steals and beats up on people zachary thats what he does the police say that the cab of his pickup was littered with empty beer cans zack glared at her i cant believe youre saying that i just cant believe it he turned and stalked into the room where his father lay beneath the xray camera dad howre you doing my back aches and my legs feel a little heavy zack tapped his reflex hammer against the judges achilles tendons documenting once again through the reassuring flick of each foot that the ankle to spinal cord and spinal cordtoankle circuits were intact wiggle your toes please good other foot good whats the story the judge asked well your wrist is broken but it will keep until sam christian gets done at clarion county however that piece of metal in your back ought to come out soon i thought so you going to do it zack hesitated and then shook his head triggering a jackhammer pain between his eyes no dad he said ive got to do that man first or hes dead besides were not encouraged to operate on our own family if we can avoid it im going to call john burris up from concord i want you judge please dont make this any harder youre quite stable right now robillards dying let him die i cant do that clayton iverson stared stonily at the ceiling in the silence zack became aware of others in the room he turned frank and suzanne stood just inside the doorway watching and listening suzanne please arrange the ct scan zack said trying to ignore the disapproval in her eyes ive got to call burris and then get into the o r i can see by your face what you want to say to me dont bother im doing the one thing we are taught always to doim doing what i think is right judge i love you and ill be keeping track of things with luck by the time burris gets here ill be done with what i have to do and i can assist him meanwhile just hang in there he turned and left brushing past suzanne she followed him for several steps but then shaking her head in resignation and frustration headed for the radiology office mas here frank said approaching the bed judge im sorry i tried to help him see reason forget it frank clayton iverson said just leave me alone but judge dammit frank i said leave me alone nothing felt normal or comfortable the room o r seemed far too warm the surgical team far too quiet the blades and scissors and drill bits were too dull the hemostats and needle holders unacceptably stiff or loose zachary struggled to ignore his throbbing headache and his sodden scrub suit and to focus on the situation at hand the circulating nurse no longer waiting for his request was mopping perspiration from his forehead and cheeks every two or three minutes they were nearly an hour into the burr hole drainage procedure on beau robillard and still there was no word that john burris had arrived from concord down the hall in o r a second surgical team stood ready valerie zack said to the circulator could you go on down to the e r please and see what you can find out about dr burris he should have been here by now beneath his green paper mask zacks jaw was clenched he was right in what he was doing dammit he was a physician a surgeon not judge and jury why then was everyone acting as if his decision were some sort of mortal sin surely they understood that he wasnt choosing this mans life over his fathers the judge was stable perfectly stable beau robillard was dying pressures down a bit jack pearl cautioned the words brought zacks thoughts back in tune with his hands feel free to transfuse him a unit if you need to he responded ive aspirated a fair amount through these burr holes but his brains not showing any signs of reexpanding if theres no action in a few more minutes were going to have to push ahead with a full craniotomy the circulating nurse valerie reentered the o r through the scrub room dr iverson she said theres a problem downstairs zack shuddered yes go ahead i was told to tell you that judge iversons feet have gone numb hes unable to move his toes whos with him the urgency in his voice bordered on panic he glanced down at the persisting space between beau robillards skull and brain surface and begged himself to calm down dr cole and dr marshfield the woman answered and where in the hell is zack breathe deeply and exhaled where is dr burris he asked more evenly the eyes of everyone on the surgical team were fixed on him there was they all knew little chance he could break scrub and leave the operating room without killing robillard the weathers gotten worse apparently there was a problem with dr burriss plane the nurse explained hes gotten someone to fly him up but they lost some time how much till hes here twenty minutes damn zack murmured it would take another hour to complete the craniotomythe open procedure he now felt certain was necessary and even with the proce beau robillards chances of survival as anything more than a vegetable were growing dimmer each second have them give judge iverson five amps of narcan iv and get him up to the operating room now five but the usual dose is dammit i know what the usual dose is he took a deep breath sorry i didnt mean to snap at you the high dose is to help keep down the swelling in his cord also please ask dr cole if she can come up here and tell me exactly whats going on in truth zack had little doubt as to what was going on an epidural bleed not predictable at all from his initial exam was compressing the judges spinal cord had he missed something had there been a clue uncertainty and selfdoubt hardened around zacks hands like cement with burris less than twenty minutes away could any significant change be effected now by scrubbing out on robillard and going after the judges bleed zack gazed down at the man for whose life he had chosen to be responsible having made that choice did he even have the right now to renege on it the doors to the o r burst open and suzanne dressed in scrubs stepped inside the judge cant move his legs she said burris is about to land a cruisers waiting for him at the airport reflexes a flicker she said it would seem doctor that unless john burris works a minor miracle your father might well end up paralyzed from the waist down at that moment jack pearl called out dr iverson his rates dropping i cant get a pressure give him an amp of epinephrine already done get ready for cpr pulse is dropping dropping more damn begin cpr doctor hes straight line another amp of epi give him another amp of epi chapter twenty it was after two in the morning the fine misty rain drifting over the valley for hours had sapped most of the warmth remaining from the day zack lay sprawled on his living room floor staring at nothing in particular the only illumination in the room was from half a dozen candles and the red and green lights on his stereo receiver for the two hours since his return from the hospital he had been listening to mendelssohn and mahler talking almost nonstop to cheap dog and drinkingat first several beers then beer plus shots of wild turkey and finally the proof wild turkey alone i didnt ask mush yknow cheap peace and quiet some rocks to climb a place to do my work without any hassles the chance to make a difference dont look at me that way i know i said that before so what youre the dog so you just have to sit there and listen thats the way it is zack could count on the fingers of one hand the number of major league drinking bouts he had ever had but he felt determined to add this night to the list beau robillard had survived his cardiac arrests on the operating table only to experience several more arrests in the recovery room zack had called off the resuscitation after intensive efforts failed to bring back any functional cardiac activity in retrospect given the extent of the cerebral contusion and hemorrhage zack had discovered during surgery it seemed that the die was cast for robillard the moment the side of his head had connected with whatever it had unfortunately in the heat of battle with no time to spare and a life on the line there was simply no way for him to know that ahead of time you know what medicines like boys like you come to rely on this wonderful woman who has promised you that if you treat her right shell always be there when you need her so you do you study and no matter how exhausted you are you dont take any shortcuts and then when you need her the most when your own goddamn fathers involved you follow the system and use your clinical judgment and do just what youre supposed to do and poof shes gone gone damn women damn medicine zack had pronounced beau robillard dead just as john burris was completing the removal of a jagged chunk of rusty metal from deep within the muscles of clayton iversons back although there was no evidence that the fragment had pierced the dural lining of the spinal canal apparently there had been some impairment of blood flow to the cord because the judges paralysis had progressed and was now being regarded by burris as total paraplegia whether the condition was permanent or not burris would not speculate although both he and zack knew all too well that the prognosis following such a development was not good word of zacks decision the judges paralysis and beau robillards death had spread through the hospital like wildfire that robillards blood alcohol level had come back well below that of legal intoxication while the judges was above the cutoff was a fact lost in the rumors and the stories of the accident and the virtually universal condemnation of zacks disloyalty to his father suddenly it seemed there was not a soul in all of ultrameddavis who did not have a bone or two to pick with beaudelaire robillard jr nor one who had not been helped at one time or another by judge clayton iverson throughout the hideous evening which ended with a tense one way conversation at his fathers bedside zack did not hear so much as one word of support from anyone for the difficulty of his position or the rightness of his decision with suzanne and owen walsh watching toby and john burris staying the night in the guest room at the hospital there was no reason for him to stay around and there was every reason to come home and get drunk in the morning he would in all likelihood pack up and leave if only there were some way he could take off for parts unknown without bringing himself along with the heat turned off and no fire in the hearth the house had begun to absorb the chill of the night zack pushed himself up and shuffled to the bedroom for a sweater he was surprised that although he had had more to drink over a shorter period of time than he could ever remember he felt quite steady on his feet there was a certain irony that on this particular night he was unable even to do a decent job of getting drunk returning to the living room he laid a small fire put on a slightly less morose album and sipped another ounce of wild turkey he could understand the judges stony castigation of him and even his mothers they had every right to be upset but suzannes reaction was a bitter pill she was a physician to say nothing of being his lover even if no one else did she should have had some compassion and understanding for his predicament he poured another ounce years before in the very beginning of his training he had wrestled with the issues of making decisions in medicine and had chosen to adopt the careful objective bythebook approach over any of the more flamboyant headlinegrabbing tactics embraced by many of his surgical colleagues the decision had not been that difficult he was a second child a plodder he had done his best with what tools he had why couldnt suzanne understand that frank was the buccaneer in the family he was a scholar frank danced on the wind he needed a system the room was growing stuffy and uncomfortably warm if he closed his eyes for any length of time it began to spin his stomach felt queasy his head like modeling clay perhaps he had had enough to diink perhaps it was time to zack fought the unpleasant feelings crossed to the window and opened it a slit the cool air felt wonderful toby nelms about to be shipped off to boston the judge paralyzed the man he had chosen to treat instead dead he himself anathema at the hospital could things have possibly turned out any worse there are such things in this world as love and loyalty theyre allowed suzannes words he should have listened to her he was simply too stiff too inflexible connie had told him that more than once before she had checked out of his life now suzanne was trying to tell him the same thing too many rules not enough person he gazed out across the glistening yard past the low thicket to the wall of jagged rock that he had named there hoping someone someday would ask him why he climbed it the granite face perhaps three hundred feet up and five hundred across was the single aspect of the house that had most appealed to him when the pine bough realtor was first showing him around sloping upward at seventyfive to eighty degrees the face crested at a broad plateau with a better than decent view of the valley the climb though somewhat tricky was one he had already made several times but always he suddenly realized he had climbed in the sunlight and with equipment always he had done it by the rules he negotiated a few heeltotoe steps without any difficulty and stood on one foot for several seconds the alcohol would be no problem he decided probably he hadnt even drunk as much as he thought rules systems zack strode to the hall closet pulled on his rubbersoled climbing shoes and his windbreaker and stuffed a small but potent flashlight into his pocket it was time to stop being a second ehild time to loosen up and shatter the mold time to break some rules because its there zack cackled as he slipped out the back door and into the chilly night just because its there what in the hell other reason did he need the air held little more than a hint of the fine black rain but it was still cool and heavy several times as zack crossed the yard and thrashed his way through the dense thicket he swore he could see his breath by the time he reached the base of the rock face his climbing shoes were soaked through climbing alone at night after a few drinks in the rain how many more rules could he think of to break perhaps he mused he should go up blindfolded as well no reason to do things halfway after a brief debate he rejected that notion what he was doing was quite enough for the momentthe first in a series of steps that would ultimately lead to his transformation as a person and a physician he moved laterally through the tall grass until he located a decent starting point and then peered upward along the ebony granite above the rim the heavily overcast sky was only slightly less black than the stone itself it was going to be a hell of a climb and when it was over when he had proven what he needed to prove he would lie beneath the trees on the plateau overhead and watch as dawn floated in over the valley the exhilaration of the adventure coursing through him zack reached out and pressed his palms against the damp cool stone then with a final glance above he was off five feet ten twenty forty the climb even with the alcohol and the darkness and the rain was a piece of cake fifty sixty seventy every time he needed a sound hold his fingers found one he was zoned climbing with a beautiful smoothness and synchrony if he had wanted to he could have done it blindfolded belownow far belowhe could see the candlelight flickering in the windows of his house his street the winding road toward the river the occasional car the night lights of town with each new hold each upward step his vista broadened it was a magnificent climb he told himself absolutely magnificent connie was right so was suzanne he should have been breaking rules like this long ago while it had been reasonable to operate on beau robillardreasonable and medically soundin the final metaphysical analysis perhaps it might not have been right ninety feet one hundred maybe more below the steeply sloping rock had no features above there was only blackness his progress was slower now but steady still the wind had picked up a bit and a fine spray was once again spattering him through the night minute by minute zack began feeling his breath becoming shorter his grips not quite as firm foultasting acid started percolating into his throat and up the back of his nose how much exactly had he had to drink concentrate he begged himself use your adrenaline your experience and focus in the handholds became more slippery smaller and more difficult to find he was traversing more as he searched for safe leverage ascending less his fingers were beginning to stiffen up behind him nestled in the gloom was his houseso tantalizingly close so incredibly far without lines descent in the dark and the rain was simply out of the question then without warning he slipped his foot went first skidding off the edge of a niche he thought was safe instantly his grips gave way as well he slid ten or fifteen feet slamming his elbow against a small outcropping and skinning his knee and his chin he reacted instinctively using technique and years of practice to stem the fall clawing and kicking at a shallow crevice he was able to bring himself to a stop then gasping he clung to the rock until inch by inch he was able to work himself to a more secure spot his elbow and his knee were throbbing but not broken his lungs were on fire waves of cramping pain had begun to shoot from his stomach through to his back i he looked below him the rock face what little of it he could discern seemed almost smooth it was ascend or find some way to strap himself in where he was and remain there until morning then he remembered the flashlight how could he have forgotten it he loosened his grip and gingerly reached down and patted his windbreaker pocket the light was goneprobably lost during the fall at that moment searing pain knifed through his gut and he vomited retching again and again foul whiskey acid poured through his mouth and out his nose spattering onto his clothes and shoes and cascading down the rock for five minutes ten he could only hang on and struggle for breath he was in trouble he had broken the rules and he was in more trouble more danger than he had ever been in his life gradually his head began to clear and his gasping respiration slowed he was at least a hundred fifty feet up he guessed maybe more certainly he was more than halfway he could use his jacket or his belt to secure himself against the rock but in the dark there was no real spot he could count on his only option was to climb and to pray once again hold by hold inch by inch he started upward the rain and the wind were real factors now making every grip more treacherous every ledge less dependable the taste in his mouth and throat was abominable the stiffness in his fingers elbow and knees worsening every second still he climbed it was all so stupid he had taken on the cliff to to what he couldnt even remember all that was clear was that he had taken a bad situation and made it much much worse he glanced behind himself his house was a toy a shadow vaguely discernible against the glow of a nearby streetlight peering up the rock face through the rain overhead he could almost swear he saw the edge of the plateau the pitch seemed steeper the handholds even smaller zack scanned the rock face to his right looking for a traverse that would set up the last segment of his climb damn but he needed that light it had been stupid arrogant and careless not to have tied it on stupid arrogant careless that thought brought the wisp of a smile before his great decision to break free of his personal constraints he had been none of the three one limb at a time he worked his way across the rock searching with his fingertips for the changes that would once again guide him upward almost there he urged himself on almost there almost before he could adjust or even react his right foot missed its plant and skimmed off the rock his arms snapped taut his hands both with reasonable grips held but they were already stiffened and weak straining his head back and to one side he looked down his feet were dangling a foot or so below the nearest purchase oh god was all he could think of at that moment oh god oh god reluctant to put any additional pressure on his fingers by struggling he lifted one foot gingerly scraping it along the rock searching for a ledge or a crevice below him at a pitch that was almost sheer the granite face disappeared into blackness oh god please oh god his foot caught the edge of a minuscule ledge on a dry day the tiny space would have been a virtual platform for himmore than enough but now there was no way to tell desperate to take some of the pressure off his fingers zack planted the toe of his shoe on the ledge and carefully shifted his weight to the foot hold damn you please hofor a moment the foot felt solid then as he added more of his weight it slipped off the edge tearing his right hand free of the rock for five seconds ten his left hand held then with a painful snap his fingers gave way and he was falling tumbling like a rag doll over and over again down the sheer rock screaming as he hurtled against granite outcroppings shattering one bone after another nooooo his final scream the howl of an animal echoed in his mind and then blended with another sound a voice suzannes voice zack for gods sake zack can you hear me he felt a cool wet towel sweep across his face slowly he opened his eyes a cannon was exploding in his head he was on the living room floor soaked in fetid vomit the lights were on suzanne was kneeling over him concern darkening her eyes nearby resting on its side was an empty bottle of wild turkey across the room watching intently sat cheap dog never again i swear it not a drop not ever over the span of two and a half hours with suzanne as guide zack had wandered from the terror of his alcoholinduced hallucination through a valley of tearful selfdeprecation across a brief stretch of cheery selfdeprecation and finally into an abysmal hangover never again she asked do you want me to put that in writing you can sign it and hang it on the wall zack pressed against his temples write whatever you want he said as long as the pen doesnt scratch too loudly on the paper i just hope you can tell that im a total amateur at abusing my body like this oh i can tell he did not clearly remember the shower or the shampoo or the first sips of tea but he knew that suzanne had taken him through each now although his head still transposed each heartbeat into mortar fire his thoughts had cleared enough at least to carry on a workable conversation he risked a deeper swallow of tea and nearly wept with the realization that it was going to stay down youve done an amazing job of putting me back together again he said thanks she smiled sadly no big deal unfortunately my exhusband gave me a lot of practice great im sorry dont be it was bad but like everything else it came to pass have you been up all night uhhuh helenes with jen she handed him a cool washcloth here wipe your face off with this you want some aspirin soon how are things at the hospital no real changeat least as of half an hour ago tobys still in coma his temps around walsh thinks hell have a bed for him at either hitchcock or childrens by noon and my father no change either as far as i know i think that neurosurgeon from concordwhats his name burris john burris yes well i think john burris is planning to have him transferred later today as well what a mess suzanne pulled back the curtain across the backyard the first hint of dawn was washing over the face of there so she said motioning toward the granite escarpment the dreaded scene of your midnight climb thats not so funny suzanne i died on that rock i really did well i certainly hope so because from what ive been able to extract from your babble these past two hours i dont think i would have much liked the guy who crawled up there in the first place confused selfloathing arrogant the perennial victimtoo close to paul cole for my taste hey come on i was just seeing things the way they are there wasnt a single person in that hospital who had one encouraging word for me fifty thousand frenchmen and all that well those particular fifty thousand frenchmen were saying that i screwed up and dont forget you were one of them i know im sorry for that dont apologize you were rightall of you were right i did screw up by the time i got home i couldnt stand who i was and hallucination or not when i went up on that cliff back there i was honestly trying to break free of myself to to become more i dont know more flexible more human in my approach to medicine and to everything else for that matter i understand that and and i was wrong for saying the things i did zachary you have no reason to change youre an excellent surgeon a decent caring son and a wonderful friend to me and i had no right to insinuate that you were otherwise it was selfish and cruel of me and it was wrongvery wrong thats why i called in the first placeto tell you that i felt so guilty for what i said to you at the hospitalfor leaving the way i did that i couldnt sit still then when you didnt answer i got frightened thats why i drove out here im glad you did he said but there was no need to feel guilty you were right i was wrong dammit stop saying that she took a deep breath to calm herself and rubbed at the shadowy strain that enveloped her eyes zachary as i told you paul was a very sad very sick man totally lacking in any center to his life any perspective he never ever put me or jen ahead of himself or his booze or his drugs or his other women never i still have trouble believing that i could have misjudged anyone so badly thats why ive been so reluctant to get involved with you but those things i said in the hospital last nightabout loyalty about what if it was me lying therewhat i didnt appreciate until after you left was that i was really saying them to a man i was trying not to fall in love with not to another doc with a terrible decision on his hands i was punishing you for being the first man since paul that i wanted to trust i was wrong and im sorry zack stared down at his hands thanks he said but you werent wrong the truth of the matter is that my father is crippled and i probably could have prevented it zack the truth of the matter is that you did what you thought was right you didnt cripple your father an automobile accident and a piece of metal did cant you see that you did all you ever will be able to do you did your best zack could only shake his head hadnt he once said precisely the same thing to wil marshfield why couldnt he believe it now hearing from her doing what we do for a living isnt easy suzanne was saying nobody ever promised us it would be nobody ever told us that everyone we took care of would get better or that every decision we made was going to turn out to be the right one medicine isnt a board game with a set number of cards and answers every situation is different zack looked over at her glumly how in the hell am i ever supposed to trust my own medical judgment again he asked can you answer that for me god she groaned listen zachary have another cup of tea then try a cold shower then if you want to continue to castigate yourself maybe you can try really climbing that wall out there do it with your hands tied behind your back though put razor blades in your shoes no sense in making it easy for yourself hey theres no reason to snap at me like that yes there is she said sounding close to tears there are plenty of them she snatched up her jacket and purse i came over to make sure you were all right to tell you i was sorry and to let you know that i was falling in love with you ive done all that it hurts too much to stick around and watch you sink out of sight in your own little bog of selfpity so if youll excuse me wait she turned back to him her eyes were dark and filmy and as drawn and sad as he had ever seen them what is it she asked wearily i im sorry dont apologize to me zack she said what youre doing youre doing to yourself youve got nothing to apologize to anyone else for im sorry for not listening to what youre trying to say hows that whatever suzanne you dont understand dont i you forget that i was married to the master of melancholy unfortunately for youfor usi understand too well i feel terrible about what happened to your father i would no matter who he was and i dont blame you for being upsetbut it should be at the situation zack not at yourself at the vagaries of life and of medicine not at the fact that youre not perfect im sorry but after all those years of paul i have no patience for this kind of talk lifes too short i simply have no patience for this at all she headed for the door suzanne please dont go he crossed to confront her i dont like the way ive been sounding either really i dont but ive never had anything backfire on me like this before and and what she was keeping her distance and nothing i understand what youre saying lets leave it at that its all beginning to sink in and and im going to be okay really i am could you stay just for a bit she eyed him warily and then for the first time all morning she smiled it was a tired five a m smile but it was vintage suzanne cole sure doc she said i can stay for a bit if you want me to you know what goes around comes around that definition of friend you once wrote for me cuts both ways the one who helps you find the tools when you cant seem to find them for yourself she led him to the couch and laid his head on her lap youve got to face it zack she whispered stroking his forehead no matter how much you want to take off no matter how much youre hurting youve got to gp back into that hospital pick up the pieces and get on with business theres too much at stake not to way too much way too much he murmured slowly his eyes closed his breathing grew deeper and more regular in seconds he was out please zachary she urged softly please dont run she lowered his head onto a pillow brought his clock radio in from the bedroom and set it for nine a call to the o r would delay or postpone anything he had scheduled and one to his office nurse would buy him time there as well the next move would be up to him she was gathering her things when she spied a copy of one of her favorite pieces of medical writing davenports classic treatise on the principles and art of clinical medicine the slim monograph was wedged on the bookshelf between several huge surgical tomes she opened it to a passage that she had read enough over the years to know nearly by heart marked the page for zack and then slipped out the front door into the cool hazy july morning provided toby nelms was reasonably stable there was still time to have a cup of coffee with helene to get jennifer dressed and off to day camp and to shower before making rounds she was nearing twenty four hours without sleep but as she so often told her anxious patients nobody ever died from lack of sleep hello whitey frank iverson here im glad i found you in i know youre due to open in a bit so i wont keep you yes well i guess everyone in sterling knows about it by now goddamn beau robillard never did a single decent thing his whole life and now he cant even die without hurting someone the judge is doing okay itey john burris the neurosurgeon who operated on him is sending him down to concord early this afternoon by ambulance well im afraid you heard right as things stand hes paralyzed from the waist down but burris isnt making any predictions and were all hopeful as hell this is just a temporary condition the judge is tough as we both well know if anyone can beat this thing he can say whitey actually therere two reasons im calling first was to touch base with you about the judge and second was to tell you that i spoke to sis ryder in dietary about next months meat order shes agreed to try allowing your place to handle the whole thing rather than going through the ultramed purchasing office just to see how it all works out oh youre welcome you deserve the chance oh listen there is one other thing needless to say the judge is in no shape to make that meeting this morning no im afraid theres no way to delay the meeting the contract calls for the sale to be finalized at noon unless theres a buy back vote by the board i did speak briefly with him a few minutes ago and he seemed content just to let each board member vote his conscience on this thing and let the chips fall where they may but whitey since youll be running the meeting theres one big favor you can do for me id really appreciate it if that vote later this morning could be by closed ballot i know thats not how you usually do it but dont you think that would be the fairest way do this for me whitey and i promise you that dietary contract will be just the beginning excellent excellent hey then ill see you at the meeting and whitey thanks frank replaced the receiver in its cradle sipped his morning coffee and then drew a careful line through whitey bourques name on the blockprinted list of business he had to attend to that morning before becoming administrator of ultrameddavis frank had never in his life made a list of things to do lists were for morning people for grinds and drudges for catchers and linebackers not for quarterbacks they were for draught horses needing to know in advance precisely where they would be clopping to and when not for thoroughbreds however four years of exposure to the efficiency and effectiveness of ultrnias data banks plus the pressures of juggling a dozen or more difficult situations at once had changed him now he began each day with a carefully drawnup menu frank liked to look on his emergence as a listmaker as one of the more visible manifestations of his adaptability and maturity and of all the lists he had ever made the one for this morning was easily the most exciting he scanned the roster of members of the board to assure himself that everything was in order for the meeting it had taken a hell of an effort but with the judges influence virtually neutralized he had used the promise of a closedballot vote plus certain other inducements to capture the additional members he had needed to block the buy back the votessix in allhad not come cheaply but he had done what he had to do the sudden turn of events had him giddy the whole thing was unbelievableabsolutely incredible zack teetering on the edge of oblivion at davis waiting only for the smallest nudge the judge eliminated from attending the decisive board meeting he couldnt have scripted it better if he had tried with mainwaring due back from georgia any time everything had fallen into place everything that is but one minor exception after brief thought frank took a black magic marker from his drawer and eliminated call lisette from his list fuck her he muttered the woman deserved neither the call nor the apology he had considered making in fact if there were to be any apologies they would come from her she would see the truth on her owncome to understand what she had pushed him to door she would lose out the house the car even the children she would lose out big he had more than enough friends in high places to ensure that she paid for her desertion this was simply not the day for dealing with a whiny passive bitch like lisette this was a day of triumph if she didnt choose to be available to share it with him that was her problem he took his list and carefully added check with a d re tonight perfect he thought annette dolan was the ideal choice to help celebrate the remarkable turn of events he keyed the intercom moments later annette knocked softly and slipped into his office she was wearing a tight plaid skirt and a beige shortsleeved angora sweater that seemed to be straining to cover her breasts gmorning he said morning yourself she stood primly beside his desk her hands folded in front of her skirt her arms pulled tightly downward lifting her breasts together in a way that made them look even more spectacular i um i have some xeroxing i need done frank managed he passed some papers across to her twenty copies no make that thirty you ah thats a great sweater thanks do you think you might be able to wear it to work tonight say at eight oh frank i dont know my moms not feeling too well im sorry to hear that he hesitated and then reached into his desk and brought out the iamond necklace he had planned to give lisette for her birthday because i was kind of hoping youd wear this at the same time annettes eyes widened oh frankie its beautiful she said its the most beautiful necklace ive ever seen youre so good to me thats because youre so good to me about tonight she ran her fingers over the piece how could i say no i dont know how could you he pulled her to him and kissed her sliding his hand over her skirt and then up to her breast annette honey i dont want to wait until tonight just a little right here right now fraank please she said youve got to wait i have work to do and all that xeroxing and that door isnt locked and besides he might hear us who might hear us why your brother of course didnt i t she held her hand to her mouth and looked at him sheepishly oh my i was about to tell you franks expression darkened how long has he been out there just a few minutes im sorry frank hey no need to apologize he said giving her breast a squeeze just wear that sweater tonight and your necklace okay ssure perfect tell my brother i know hes here and ill be with him shortly okay im sorry actually now that i think about it he couldnt have come at a better time the receptionist brightened noticeably really really frank said this will be the icing on the cake he patted her behind as she turned to leave and followed it with his eyes as she sashayed from his office then he added another item to his list in the same perfect block print as all the others fire he paused studying the notation thoughtfully and then drew a small happy face next to it chapter twentyone dr iverson mr iverson said to tell you that he knows youre here and will be with you as soon as he can are you sure i cant get you something no no thank you zack managed to prevent himself at the last possible instant from augmenting his response with a shake of his head actually the tympani that had been rehearsing in his brain had given way to the french horn section and the tempest in his stomach had been downgraded to mere queasiness physically it appeared he was on the mend with a little assistance from cheap dog he had awakened well before the time set on his clock radio by suzanne on the coffee table beside him was a glass of water a packet of bromo seltzer aild his old copy of davenport held open by his stethoscope and marked with a note from suzanne which said simply be strong now as he waited for his brother to decide that he had been kept waiting long enough zack withdrew the monograph from his briefcase and reread the passage be diligent be meticulous be honest account for every variable acknowledge that which you do not know and then at the first opportunity learn it believe in yourself that is our system honor it and it will support you like a rock honor it and even the death of a patient will be no failure zack had been especially grateful for those words when hed lived at the hospital that morning and been informed by his fathers private duty nurse that except for his wife the judge was seeing no visitors and that he had specifically included his sons in that group even annie doucette facing surgery on her hip in twentyfour hours was less than cordial to him after being barred by the judges nurse zack had gone directly to her room hopingnaively it turned outto be the first to tell her of what had happened i am not pleased with you young man she had said you save an old lady like me who wants to die and then let something like this happen to a man like your father what kind of doctor is that zack had started to respond but then had simply shrugged and left another time perhaps nor was the hospital staff any more amiable wherever he went eyes were averted greetings of any kind were mumbled or withheld altogether nurses and other physicians hurried in the opposite direction as he approached he had decided to stick things out at davis but reestablishing himself was clearly going to be an uphill struggle be strong be strong beannette franks voice crackled over the intercom would you please ask dr iverson to come on in and hold all callsunless theyre regarding our fathers condition thank you zack walked into his brothers office wishing he were anyplace else have a seat bro frank said i was wondering when you were going to show up here again whereve you been oh here and there mostly on the floor or on the toilet know zack looked at him curiously john burris told me frank explained apparently he called to give you a progress report on the judge he says you were obviously intoxicated and totally incoherent aw he was just being kind zack this isnt funny burris said something about it to one nurse and already the whole hospital knows once theyre lost reputations around hospitals dont get found again very often ask guy beaulieu now whos being funny frank you know what i meant well one of the reasons i stopped by was to tell you that i was sorry for causing so much disruption around this place i see now that ive got to back off a little if im going to get by here even though ive only been doing what i thought was right have you dammit frank youre an excellent administrator but that doesnt mean youre on top of everything thats going on around here for instance for instance that sleazy anesthesiologist pearl and his sidekick mainwaring theyre up to something frank theyre using something other than what they say they are in the operating room i swear it thats ridiculous i have proof do you well not exactly but i have some data about recovery times that are pretty damn suggestive and ive learned some things about mainwarings past that even you might not be aware of im telling you theres a connection between that poor nelms kids seizures and whatever the two of them have been giving patients in the o r frank this hospital could be headed for terrible trouble weve got to find out whats going on no we dont zacko frank said simply what are you talking about well first of all were not going to find out because theres nothing to find out those two men worked here for two years before you arrived and there was not so much as a whisper of anything but praise for either of them how do you explain that i i cant really at least not yet but im right frank i just know i am mainwarings got a past that involves testing drugs illegally and pearls hiding something couldnt you tell that from the way he behaved last night hes so frightened of being found out that he was willing to put that kid to sleep with anesthe ics he had never used on him in the first place somethings going on and dammit im going to find out what no youre not frank said again youre not going to find out because youre not going to be stirring up any more trouble around here and youre not going to be stirring up trouble because youre through finished fired youre done at this hospital as of right now zack stared at him in disbelief frank looked back at him smiling placidly frank thats crazy im a physician on the staff you cant fire me only the medical staff can do that and then only after due process oh really here doctor here are the corporate bylaws you dont work for the medical staff its on page seven check it out you work for ultramed and ultramed can fire anyone they goddamn well please and im ultramed and youre fired he held his hands out palms up cest tout mon fr ampe be strong suzannes encouragement was growing hollower by the moment frank you cant do this i can and i did you see bro thats been your big mistake all alongnot understanding that this is my hospital and that i can do whatever the hell i want to i wanted beaulieu out and he was out and now i want you out frank you forget that even though you might not have wanted eaulieu here you didnt fire him he was being systematically and deliberately driven out by by who zack hesitated remembering his promise to maureen banas then he decided that she would simply have to understand his situation was too desperate it was ultramed frank he was being driven out by ultramed just look at that letter from maureen banas thats proof you dont know everything thats going on around here do you think she wrote that of her own free will she was coerced frank by that company we work for by ultramed was she yes she received a copy of that letter along with a note that that said if she told me about receiving it both she and i would be fired franks gloating leer was at once disgusting and terrifying jesus zack muttered nice touch dont you think oh frank you are really sad why didnt you just fire him like youre trying to do to me he was an obstreperous sonofabitch thats why i didnt want him making a big stink i was just learning the ropes then zacko learning how far i could go i know them now and they tell me that its okay to fire you so youre fired god i really love hearing that youre crazy frank do you know that you are absolutely nuts maybe frank said but i am also employed which is more than can be said for you im going to fight you frank shrugged do whatever you want as far as the company or the medical staff is concerned youre a drunken disloyal troublemaker i doubt that even your little cardiology fluff will stick up for you frank guy beaulieu died because of what you did to him died doesnt that mean anything to you you have a good day now zack and dont you even care that its possible some madmen are poisoning patients in the operating room of this hospital what are you ill be speaking with the folks at pine bough realty im sure theyll be more than happy to give you oh two or three days at least to get out of their house jesus im coming to that board meeting frank im coming and im going to tell the board and ultramed whats going on here the judge may be paralyzed but he saw what ultramed and its policies did to annie hes had time to review beaulieus evidence and to convince people how to vote im going to be there to reinforce his position well i spoke with him earlier this morning and hes promised to keep hands off the whole affair frank thats a fucking lie i was just up there the nurse told me the judge wont see either of us frank winked then lets just say that if he had spoken with me thats what he would have promised you crazy bastard frank you crazy crazy bastard ill be happy to write you a letter of recommendation provided the place you apply to is far enough away now if youll excuse me i have a hospital to run ill be seeing you later at the meeting try it if you want to zacko the security guards will know exactly how to handle things if you show up there and now little brother how about either you leave or i remind you of how much hurt you ended up with every time we fought behind the barn i probably would enjoy that almost as much as ive enjoyed firing you you take care now yhear numbly zack wandered from his brothers office and through the busy corridors of the hospital the polished linoleum the tile the nurses bustling from one patient to the next in their starched whites the framed prints in every roomhow clean it all appeared on the surface how perfect the set of a movie zack smiled grimly at the thought davis regional had become a gleaming movieset hospitalhollywood veneer with no soul it was a nightmare and now a nightmare he could do no more than walk away from he drifted into the intensive care unit suzanne wearing surgical scrubs beneath her lab coat was in tobys cubicle moving about the heavily bandaged child in a way that could only mean trouble at the foot of the bed owen walsh the pediatrician watched his perpetually cheerful expression darkened by concern hi she said glancing over only momentarily glad you could make it she studied the monitor and then emptied the contents of a syringe into tobys iv line problems zack asked having just been fired from the staff he found himself strangely reluctant to approach the bedside these last sixteen hours have been like a crash refresher course for me in pediatric pharmacology she said without looking up every time his temp goes up his rhythm goes crazy what were doing here amounts to nothing more than a holding action i sure wish we knew what was going on i do know he wanted to say instead he forced himself to the head of the bed where he made a quick check of tobys pupils eye grounds and reflexes while there was still no definite evidence of irreversible damage there was certainly no sign of improvement weve got the promise of a bed for him in boston owen walsh said but they cant transfer him until late this afternoon or this evening take him away from this place away from jack pearl and you take him away from his only chance again zacks thought went unspoken anything i can do in the meantime he asked you can review the steroids hes getting suzanne checked the temperature reading from the rectal probe back down to oneohtwo and look zackhis rhythms stable again damn whats going on if youre able to leave he said id like to talk to you for a minute suzanne checked the monitor and tobys chest and then glanced over at walsh just dont go too far the pediatrician said well be right outside in the waiting room owen she replied besides youre doing fine here walsh smiled she saves this childs life at least five times in one night and she says im doing fine nonsense ill be back in a little bit hang in there as soon as the door to the icu waiting room clicked shut suzanne threw her arms about zacks chest and buried her head against his shoulder i knew youd come back she said im so damn proud of you of both of us listen as soon as we get toby off to boston lets go to my place for dinner helenes going to take jen for the night and i have a batch of shrimp in the fridge and suzanne no listen its my guilt for acting the way i did in the e r last night and only shrimp sauteed in garlic butter will he held her by the shoulders and moved her away suzanne frank just fired me he what effective immediately he cant do that can and did he even was kind enough to present me with a set of the corporate laws to prove he can he held up the book for her to see only then did he realize how totally drained she looked her face was pale and drawn her eyes reddened with strain and fatigue this is crazy she said what reason did he give actually according to page seven here he doesnt need a reason but just to be fair he provided a couple being drunk while on call technically i was you seebeing a disruptive influence hell i cant even remember everything he said listen you look really wasted why dont you find an empty bed and crash for an hour or two ill watch toby frank wont even know im in the hospital and even if he finds out he wont do anything about it owens too panicked about being left alone to allow that well talk later after we get the child to boston no zack im fine really she said but zack we cant let him do this you dont understand this isnt a hospital the way we were trained to know one its a merchandise mart that hires doctors and nurses and technicians and frank is the president to that companyat least here in sterling he is he hires and he can fire except with someone like guy beaulieu in guys case frank didnt want the hassle beaulieu was threatening him with so be just took the route of destroying the man by rumor and innuendo he admitted being responsible for all of that to you he had already fired me what did he have to be afraid of he was actually boasting when he told me suzanne sank onto the sofa oh zack was all she could manage listen suze this is my problem and ill work it out no she said suddenly whatt no its not your problemat least not yours alone its all of ours the medical staff i mean were going to fight this suzanne i dont want anyone else getting hurt because noisten to me for years now at least as long as ive been here the doctors in this hospital have been acting like like ostriches this isnt the first time theres been a problem between frank or don norman and staff doctors zack it isnt the first time one of us has clashed with the system here and then suddenly found himself out dont you remember what wil marshfield said that first night and ive been as much of an ostrich as anyoneso grateful for getting out of the trouble i was in that ive turned my back on any number of company decisions that might not have been in the best interests of our patients i didnt feel committed enough to any one issue to make waves but dammit i feel committed now suzanne i dont want you please you had the guts to come back and face the music and now dammit im going to see to it that the medical staff gets behind you its time we stood up for this communitytime that we stood up for our own she rose and took his hands zack hang in here please do it for all of us if i can just get us to present a unified front im sure the medical staff can stand up to the coqoration and if we cant get ultramed to listen then then well just take our case to the community you think you could pull that off he asked im tougher than i look he touched her cheek thats not saying much you know well you just watch can you stand the heat suzanne i dont want to leave here i dont want to leave you okay then its decided as soon as i finish with my office appointments im going to start twisting some arms its not going to be easy she kissed him lightly its not going to be as hard as you think listen i ought to get back in there what are you going to do right now i think im going to try and get in to see my father he refused to see me earlier but i think its worth one more try i was planning on putting in an appearance at that board meeting later today but frank has promised to have the hospital security people ready for me if i do damn him zack i think your brother and i are about due for a little meeting of the minds you would do that would and will i have too many friends around here and make too much money for this place for him not to listen to me you must be strong god zachary it feels so good to realize that all of a sudden im not afraid anymore you were afraid of the corporation no she said kissing him once again of you brief operative note full note dictated fourinch gash over t and debrided hemostasis attained wound explored jagged five centimeter by three centimeter piece of rusty metal removed without difficulty dura appears intact no collection of blood noted wound irrigated copiously and then closed with drain in place patient sent to recovery room in stable condition still unable to move either lower extremity tetanus and antibiotic prophylaxis initiated preoperative impression foreign body low midback postoperative impression same plus paraplegiaetiology uncertain possibly secondary to spinal cord disruption or circulatory embarrassment seated to one side of the nurses station zack read and reread the account of his fathers surgery and confirmed through john burriss terse progress note and two much more detailed nurses notes that there had been little change in the judges condition since his surgery dura intact no collection of blood zack chewed on the nub of his pen as he stared out the window at the presidential range something was off the judges symptoms seemed out of proportion to the extent of his injuryway out of proportion the pieces of this clinical puzzle simply werent locking together sheering forces snapping fibers in the cord arterial spasm with enough interruption of blood supply to cause nerve damagethere were a number of logical explanations for the judges paraplegia but none of them sat just right at one end of the formica counter a small plastic tray was piled high with pens and pencils as well as a stethoscope and several other pieces of medical equipment zack slipped an opbthalmoseope reflex hammer and straight pin into his pocket and headed for his fathers room it wasnt that he was questioning burriss findings and opinion he rationalized it was just that that a physician was taught never to completely trust anyones findings or conclusions other than his own now if he could only get the judge to allow him close enough to do an exam cinnie iverson was seated on a low hardbacked chair id the hallway outside of her husbands room she was as always dressed immaculatelythis day in a plain blue dress with a white cardigan draped over her shoulders lipstick and an ample amount of rouge failed to completely obscure her pallor her everpresent lace handleerchief was balled in one fist hello mom zack said as he approached she stood and allowed him to kiss her on the cheek her expression was cool but not angry which was to say as disapproving as zack had ever known it to be hows he doing he asked the nurse is giving him a bed bath any change cinnie iverson bit at her lower lip and shook her head mom i im sorry this has happened you cant know how terrible i feel im sure you do she said quietly we all do she hesitated then went on zachary im quite sure that in time ill see things more charitably but right now with the judge lying in there like that youll have to forgive me if i understand he said all i want you to know is the same thing i came up here to tell him and that is that i was only trying to do what i thought was right i believe that i dont think hell speak with you though she added hes very upsetat everybody and hes very depressed he doesnt have to speak mom he just has to listen who sent the flowers he motioned toward an enormous vase of lilies orchids and birds of paradise that he estimated must have cost one hundred fifty dollars probably even more it just arrived from frank she said whether you know it or not you owe your brother quite a thankyou he was very helpful in keeping us all under control last night very helpful ill ill thank him just as soon as i can mom i just dont know what we would have done without him she dabbed her handleerchief at the corner of one eye i understand zack said fighting off a wave of rage i only wish lisette were around at least then id know he was getting a decent meal once in a while he told you about lisette he told me she and the girls are in virginia visiting an old friend of hers if thats what you mean sure mom zack said through nearly clenched teeth thats what i meant at that moment the private duty nurse an expansive woman with pendulous upper arms and thick ankles wheeled her cart from the room hes all set dear she said sorry to take so long but that husband of yours is a big man she eyed zack warily still no visitors doctor she said im sorry mom i need to go in to talk to the judge cinnie took a moment to size up the exchange its okay mrs caulkins she said ill take care of things here you go do whatever it is you have to she waited until the woman had gone zachary ill ask your father if your visit would be okay but i dont expect him to say yes mom its importantvery important that i speak with him she hesitated mom please you wont say anything to upset him promise well then i suppose you should be allowed to go in there and say your piece mom thank you arid zachary she continued to work her handleerchief over and over in her hands i know you didnt mean things to turn out this way thats right mom he said knowing that she would miss the understatementthe sad irony id his voice i certainly didnt muted sunlight filtering through the nearly closed blinds provided the only illumination in the room the judge wearing a blue hospital johnny jay on his back staring at the ceiling an intravenous line was draining into one arm hello judge zack said clayton iverson glanced over at him and then looked away are you in much pain there was no response judge it wont hurt to talk to me believe me it wont okay okay suit yourself it might have been a mistake to have come zack could see that now merely going against the mans wishes was enough to warrant the silent treatment let alone going against his wishes and achieving such disastrous results he reminded himself that the judge could be as petulant and inflexible as frank zack turned to go but then he stopped there were things he had to get outif not for his father then for himself okay judge you dont have to say a word i wont stay long i just wanted to tell you that i feel very badly for the way things have turned out i was only doing what i spent so many years training to dousing my judgment and trying to do my best he pulled a chair over as he spoke and sat down by his fathers hand the judge continued to stare at the ceiling judgment dad thats what you have to rely on too now that i think about it maybe in time that will help you understand the dilemma i was in judge youre my father i love you for thatfor the things youve done for me for the kind of person youve helped me become i would never want to see you hurt never i honestly believe that i would give up my life if necessary to protect you but thats my life anyhow i guess what i really want you to know is that although im sorry as hell for the way everything turned out given the information i had to work with last night if the same situation arose again i would make the same choices thats the sort of person my parents raised me to be and the sort of surgeon i was trained to be i came up here to ask for understanding not absolution he paused hoping for some sort of reply there was none in that moment he decided to say nothing of what had transpired with frank soon the judge would learn it all anyhow but this was not the time to attack the mans myth of his quarterback son well then he said i guess thats that he rose oh except for one other thing im going to that meeting today to present guys case to the board i dont expect to sway many votes but i think guy was right i think we need to take a hard look at what were willing to give up in exchange for a few shiny pieces of equipment and some black ink on the bottom line so if you could just talk to me enough to tell me where that folder of his is ill its gone clayton iverson said flatly still not looking at his son what i said the folder is gone i i gave it to the ultramed people to examine they have it now please go zack sighed you certainly underwent one heck of a change of heart there dad he said i asked you to leave im going im going as he turned zacks hand brushed against the instruments in his pocket he hesitated took several steps toward the door and then turned back judge i know you want me out of here he said but but id like to examine a couple of things on you if i could before i go tentatively he returned to the bedside waiting for the mans outburst there was none he lifted the sheet off his fathers legs thank you dad he whispered gauging the muscle tone of one calf with his fingertips thank you for trusting me this much this will only take a minute in fact zacks examination carried out mostly with his touch and reflex hammer took just over five minutes clayton iverson watched him work in stony silence although there was a spark of curiosity in his eyes by the time zack had finished by the time he had dropped down on a corner of the bed shaken and mentally drained the loosefitting pieces of the clinical puzzle had been pulled apart and rearranged in the strangest of patterns mom can you come in here please he called out after he had regained some composure theres something i want both of you to hear together cinnie iverson entered took the chair next to the judge and held his hand zack paced from one side of the room to the other choosing each word carefully suddenly frightened that the tendon and muscle activity he had detected were not true neurologic indicators at all but rather the phantoms of his own hopes judge mom he began have either of you ever heard of a conversion reaction cinnie iverson shook her head clayton did not move an older term for it was conversion hysteria but i never liked that phrase because hysteria implies craziness and a conversion reaction is much more an intense involuntary focusing of emotional energy than it is a sign of anything crazy zachary what are you saying cinnie asked im saying that there are certain reflexes that disappear when the spinal cord is damaged and others that show up the pattern im finding now isnt consistent with that im not sure i understand cinnie said judge i know this may not make total sense to you at the moment but im picking up signsfairly strong signsthat your paralysis may be due to factors other than spinal cord damageemotional factors emotional factors cinnie sounded incredulous the judge showed no reaction at all i know it sounds far out zack said but believe me it isnt it happens all the time one of my first cases on my neurology service was a man with psychologically induced blindness there was absolutely nothing wrong with his eyes yet he positively couldnt see in fact after hypnotherapy much of his vision returned heart attacks in type a personalities gastric ulcers in situations of high stressour emotions have power over every organ in our bodies theres even a welldocumented condition called pseudocyesis in which a woman who desperately wants to become pregnant has her periods stop her breasts grow large and her abdomen swell only a blood test or an ultrasound or x ray can prove shes not pregnant and you think your father may be having one of thesewhat are they called conversion reactions yes mom i do judge your neurologic findings simply dont jibe well with any other explanation the judge looked away but why cinnie asked zack shrugged im not certain he said anger at me is the most likely possibility there are other factors that could be at work too i guess fear grief guilt only you can fill in the blanks judge but whatever it is isvery powerful stuff at the moment even you might not know many times though as soon as the source of the conversion is identified the symptoms begin to resolve are you sure about this cinnie asked no mom im not its just that the other diagnoses dont fit with the operative findings and dads clinical picture and conversion reaction does i might be wrong all i can do is hope that im not and tell you what i think clayton she asked the judge tightlipped would not answer zachary she said perhaps youd better go now we can talk about this again soon she rose and kissed him on the cheek her expression begging him to leave them beto allow them the chance to digest what he had said sure enough he said when is the ambulance due any time now i think fine dad i he looked down at his fathers pallid emotionless face ill be thinking of you as he reached the doorway zack checked the corridor for his brother or a security guard and then headed for a room at the far end of the hall if as it seemed he was running out of time within the walls of ultrameddavis he would use what little he had left to make one last run at a clinical puzzle that was no less perplexing than his fathers and far more lethal i knew it barbara nelms said as zack finished recounting his interview with her son and the theories he had developed as a result you are not a very good liar dr iverson i could see it in your eyes that night in your office i should have called you on it then dammit you know holding out on me like that was a very cruel thing to do i know and im sorry but i had no proof dr iverson toby is my son i understand barbara was propped up in her hospital bed by several pillows her right arm was in a sling and her left was fixed to an intravenous line that was infusing a potent antibiotic despite her pallor and the heavy shadows engulfing her eyes her glare was piercing im not sure that you do dr iverson she said after some thought but im willing to give you the benefit of the doubtat least for now thank you you said that you held back information from me and my husband because you had no proof of your theories am i to assume that situation has changed zack hesitated dr iverson please she said dont try to lie to me again my son nearly stabbed me to death yesterday without even knowing i was there okay he said okay the truth is as things stand i have no direct proof of anything but the circumstantial evidence supporting my belief is quite strongat least to me it is tell me zack reviewed his impressions of pearl and mainwarings gallbladder cases and summarized his conversation with tarberry at johns hopkins he could see the anger smoldering in barbara nelmss eyes in time whether toby survived or not she would be out for blood and where once that notion had been the impetus to have him lie to her now it goaded him to share every detail frank had been given his chance to clean house but he had ignored it i wouldnt blame you a bit for being skeptical zack said as he concluded his account but thats the way i see it dr iverson barbara nelms responded her fury barely contained this is the first time since this nightmare began that an explanation has fit with the facts as i know them i believe every word youve told me every word she turned and stared out the window resting on the rim of her sling her fist was clenched slowly her fingers relaxed the tension in her neck and back lessened when she turned back to zack the anger had given way to determination now then dr iverson she said what can we do to save my son zack took a moment to sort his thoughts well first of all he said finally it would help tremendously if we could find the trigger you mean the thing that sets toby off exactly but how i want you to close your eyes lean back listen to my voice and begin to tell me everything you can think of surrounding tobys attacks everything no matter how trivial it may sound are you going to hypnotize me i can and i will if it seems appropriate but i believe all youll need is a little help now relax as much as you can open your mind and let it drift back to tobys very first episode he he was in his pajamas good go on it was before bed he was playing playing what i i cant remember was he in his room yes no no wait he ended up in his room but i dont think he started there he he was in the den he was watching television yes thats right thats exactly right good very good now what was he watching the show yes i i cant remember just relax barbara youre doing fine now just open your mind to that evening and think about what he might have been watching see it just relax open your mind and see it the muscles in barbara nelmss face went slack her breathing became deeper and more regular thats good zack whispered thats very good zacks words brought a strange enigmatic smile to barbaras mouth i know what he was watching she said each time i know what he was watching chapter twenty two zack raced down the corridor at nearly a full run hesitating only to glance into his fathers room the bed was stripped and an aide was washing down the plastic mattress cover he bolted through the stairway door and vaulted down to the first floor a major piece in the puzzle had fallen into placea piece that irrefutably connected toby nelms suzanne and jason mainwaring now frank would have to listen my brother in he panted to the buxom blond receptionist annette dolan looked at him strangely he is but thank you zack said already on his way through franks office door frank behind his desk working at his computer looked up coolly you dont work here anymore he said frank ive got to talk to you ive learned somethingsomething important mr iverson im sorry i tried to stop him annette dolan said from the doorway frank smiled at her emotionlessly thats okay annette he said i know how persistent my little brother can be im sure you did your best to stop him before you get back to work though why dont you go on home and change that sweater its not appropriate for the office the receptionist hesitated a beat her lower lip quivering then she turned and hurried away now then frank said glancing at his watch what on earth could be important enough to take you away from your packing zack moved to sit down but frank stopped him with a raised hand dont get comfortable sport he said just say what you want to say and leave he motioned to the computer number six now zacko six out of nearly two hundred administrators nationwide not bad if i do say so myself no siree not bad at all vell then youd better listen to me frank because ive learned something that could bring this place crashing down about your ears if you dont do something about it there was no more than a flicker of interest oh its that anesthe ic frank the one i tried to tell you about before go on i just came from speaking with mrs nelms the mother of the boy in icu i know who she is frank said well i was going over some of my concerns with her and you what frank just calm down and listen no you listen do you have any idea how much of a nuisance that woman will be if you fill her with all that human experimentation bullshit of yours frank its not bullshit its really happening and youd better help me do something about it or this place will be crawling with lawyers hospitalcertification people and police i promise you dont you dare threaten me well then will you please listen for chrissake suzannes life may be on the line here to say nothing of that poor kid in the icu we dont have much time frank toyed with a paper clip for a few moments straightened it and then snapped it in two okay bro he said finally youve got five minutes theyre experimenting with something frankmainwaring and pearl theyre fooling around with some sort of new general anesthe ic and they think its working fine only it isnt the patients look asleep during their surgery and even think they were asleep afterward but at some level just below their conscious surface they were wide awake experiencing the whole thingthe cutting the blood the pain everything sport i didnt believe you this morning and i dont believe you now py well youd better i have proof oh its the music frank greensleevesthe music mainwaring operates to what in the hell are you mainwaring nearly always works to one piece of music its a classical version of greensleevesyou know the folk song from i know the tune frank said testily well according to mrs nelms every time her kid had one of his seizures he was watching a childrens show where they play that melody thats your proof theres more last week suzanne and i were together when suddenly she went blank totally blank chapter twenty three frank that tune was playing on the radio as soon as i shut it off she snapped out of whatever place she was in and kept on talking as if nothing had ever happened i didnt put together what was going on until just now she was on her way frank im sure now that if i had left the radio on a little longer she would have had a seizure just like the kids she was on her way to reliving her breast operationprobably in some bizarre distorted wayjust the way toby kept reexperiencing his hernia repair this is ridiculous its fact frank listen youve got to help me find mainwaring or at least help me try and reason with pearl no way that child is dying we need to know what they gave him frank picked up the phone and dialed chief clifford frank iverson here he said that restraining order i asked you for ready yet jesus frank you are crazy zack said thats fine chief fine so its effective immediately im going to tell the board whats going on here frankthe board and ultramed and as soon as i find mainwaring im going to chief could you do me a big favor and send a couple of men around now hes here and hes refusing to leave dammit frank thanks cliff oh hes doing as well as could be expected its nice of you to ask john burris the neurosurgeon from concord has transferred him down there frank for chrissake hopefully well be getting a new neurosurgeon in town soon so that we wont have to send folks out who need our help exactly well thanks again cliff when can i expect those men of yours excellent you run a crack operation cliff the best you bet take care now frank laid down the receiver with exaggerated deliberateness youve got about three minutes to get your ass out of my hospital he said and less than a day to get it out of our house id suggest you get home and start packing and i promise you if you so much as set foot in this place or say one word to any of our patients you will be in deep deep shit is that clear frank youre making a big mis i said is that clear without responding zack headed toward the door when he opened it a hospital security guardif anything even larger than the guard henrywas standing there its a little button right down here frank explained gesturing to the base of his desk i never had to use it until now but it just paid for itself tommy would you please see to it that dr iverson here is out of the hospital and off hospital property right away yes sir no stops yes sir its not going to work frank zack said ill take my chances what about that kid that kid will be better off having a doctor who doesnt get drunk when hes on call sport now i see by the ol clock on the mantel that your five minutes are about up he looked out the window oh and there are our friends from the constabulary right on time you are something frank you really are frank smiled broadly yes he said i know greensleeves curious frank fished through his desk drawer for the cassette mainwaring had given him and popped it into his tapedeck it was syrupy spineless musiccertainly far from being any sort of lethal weapon clearly zack had flipped over the edge grasping at any straw in an effort to disrupt his brothers finest hour no way zacko frank murmured no fucking way he snapped off the tape and then watched through his office window as his brother was led across the hospital parking lot to his car by two policemen and the hospital guard it was a scene he would carry with him forever the days of sports trophies and starstruck coeds might be part of the past but this triumph would do quite nicely as he followed zacks battered orange camper down the hill toward town frank knew that the last obstacle toward his achieving every one of his goals was all but disappearing with the judge out of the way and bourque having agreed to a closed vote the final purchase of the hospital by ultramed was a virtual lock and with zack out of the way there was nothing to interfere with the satisfactory conclusion of his dealings with mainwaring he felt at once exhilarated and exhausted it had been a brutal game but with time running out he had just run in for the goahead touchdown and then recovered the fumble on the ensuing kickoff now he had only to hang on to the ball and run out the clock he glanced at his watch the board meeting was less than an hour away he reminded himself that no matter how exhausted he felt this was not the time to let down loose ends he murmured loose ends loose ends he called the guard room and ordered an extra man brought in to patrol the outside of the hospital on the off chance his brother tried anything foolish then he phoned two fencesitting board members to tell them about the closedballot vote and to call in favors he was owed finally he called atlanta and learned that jason mainwaring had left for new england the previous evening and was expected back in atlanta the next day perfect he thought if the secretarys information was correct mainwaring had to be planning to conclude their transaction that afternoon again frank checked the time for the moment there was nothing he could think of to do but wait he returned his attention to the still open hookup with ultrma soon perhaps within a day his access code would be upgraded to that of a regional director and he would be made a party to some of ultrameds most sensitive information regional director with a cool three quarters of a million dollars in the bank frank iverson was within a cats whisker of making it all the way back and then some when she walked out on him lisette had made the biggest fucking mistake of her life by the time the dust settled he would have it allthe position the money the house and goddamn it the children too shed see he had handled the board he had handled his brother and he would handle her just as well only when the knock on his office door grew persistent did frank notice it who is it annette he asked through his intercom annette there was no answer then he remembered having sent the woman home and cursed himself for forgetting that his other secretary was on vacation come in he called out for crying out loud stop that pounding and come in jason mainwaring wearing his customary beige plantation owners suit entered carrying his briefcase little shy on office help arent we he said heading directly for franks liquor supply you know me jason slice off the excess fat everything goes down to the bare bone mainwaring ran his fingertips over the glistening mahogany surface of franks desk yes he drawled i can see that philosophy at work all around me i called atlanta a while ago your secretary said she expected you back there tomorrow youre welcome to use your house for a few more days if you want thanks all the same but ive been here about two years too long already my replacement lined up ready to cut hes due here next wednesday frank felt determined to keep his eagerness in check he knew that mainwaring wanted serenyl at least as much as he wanted mainwarings million if this was their last skirmish he was damned if he was going to let the man leave with the upper hand he crossed to his bookcase and poured himself a glass of tonic then he deliberately set aside mainwarings greensleeves tape which hed been listening to and snapped on a mantovani in its place the surgeon flinched iverson he said are you tryin to bait me hardly jason i just thought that since this might be our last meeting together i might see if i could change your opinion about mantovani this albums called roman holiday what do you think i think we should get this business of ours over with thats what i think irritably the surgeon rose and shut off the tape frank unlocked a drawer of his desk and withdrew a thick envelope here it is jason he said signed sealed and ready to be delivered just as we had it drawn up you were there well then mainwaring set his briefcase on his lap and opened it our chemists have approved dr pearls work and my company has authorized payment to you of the sum we agreed upon that being that being the sum we agreed upon iverson dont play games with me or i swear ill be out that door in that case jason youll be out two years of your life as well frank was feeling glorious it was the sort of scene he had watched his father play any number of times over the years now there was a new iverson pulling the stringsa new iverson at the top of the heap mainwaring hesitated then flipped an envelope onto the desk barclays bank georgetown grand cayman islands he said somewhat wearily they wont release the money to you until they hear from me but if you have doubts about the account numbers feel free to call them that wont be necessary jason i trust you besides ive arranged for my man at the cayman national bank to transfer the funds to accounts there as soon as he hears from me so if youll just check over those papers we can each make a call you are quite the most distasteful man i have ever had dealings with iverson thank you frank said from you ill take that as a compliment now if youll be so kind he slid the phone across to the surgeon then sat back as calmly as he could manage and waited when the calls were completed he dropped mainwarings envelope in his drawer and watched as the surgeon tucked the bill of sale and the patent rights to serenyl into his briefcase a million dollars frank was thinking just like thata million dollars i hope this means were about to see the last of one another mainwaring said well miss you jason frank replied with a straight face we surely will the surgeon stood and gave franks proffered hand an ichthyic shake then he whirled and was gone frank walked to his bathroom washed his face and studied himself in the mirror funny he said straightening his tie and then winking at his reflection you dont look like a millionaire judge youre my father i love you for thatfor the things youve done for me i would give up my life if necessary to protect you lying on his stretcher judge clayton iverson watched the foliage flash past through the rear windows of the ambulance as he reflected on his sons words they had passed through conway five or ten minutes before he guessed so almost certainly they had split off from route and were heading southwest on toward moultonborough and the northern rim of lake winnipesaukee beside him the paramedic a woman with orphan annie hair and an eager childs face was carrying on a running conversation with the driver pausing occasionally to check his pulse and blood pressure it was all so painful the judge acknowledged so confusing one moment he was on top of the world the next he was speeding through town to confront his older son with the facts of his dishonesty and embezzlement and with the reality that once again the man had been given every opportunity and had failed and even more distressing franks pertidy had in effect ripped control of the ultrameddavis situation from the community board and handed it to leigh baron on a plate paralysis may be due to factors other than spinal cord dam age guilt fear grief only you can fill in the blanks judge there was no cause for guilt the judge reasoned desperately beau robillard hadnt done one thing of value his entire life clayton iverson had been elected sterling man of the year six times six besides if blame were to be placed it should go to frank not to him if it werent for frank there would have been no accident if it werent for frank there would have been no drinking no lapse in concentration no missed red light given the information i had to work with last night if the same situation arose again i would make the same choices if it werent for frank zachary would never have been put in the position of having to make such a terrible decision at least zachary had had the guts to face himto face him and to hold his ground y hadnt he appreciated his younger son more before explanations but no excuses that was the way of a real man frank always had excuses now because of frank ultramed would have control of davis forever and with that control a stranglehold on sterling that even clayton iverson would be unable to break there was no sense lingering over the spilled milk that was beau robillard that milk was soured to begin with but the hospital was a different story john burris had told him that trying to attend the board meeting was out of the question and in truth he had wanted to get as far away from both of his sons as possible but now if only he werent so damned helpless if only he could move judge iverson the paramedic said yes what is it sir you just crossed your legs what clayton iverson looked down at his feet they were in fact crossed his left ankle resting on his right gingerly he lifted the upper leg and set it down on the stretcher then he lifted the other his pulse began to pound what time is it he demanded eleven sir where are we just outside of moultonborough tell the driver to turn around excuse me turn around dammit turn around ive got to get back to the hospital sir we cant do you know who i am well then i said turn around i dont have time to argue im paying for this ambulance and i swear if you dont do as i say there will be hell to pay for both of you but now yyes sir the woman knelt beside the driver and after a brief exchange the ambulance swung into a driveway and turned around use your lights and siren and step on it the judge said but sir were not allowed to the siren dammit i assure you nothing bad will happen if you do but everything bad will happen if you dont quickly now lets move the driver hesitated and then switched on the lights and siren and accelerated behind him judge clayton iverson crossed and uncrossed his legs again well ill be damned he muttered ill be goddamned chapter twenty four shortly after she had seen the first several office patients of the morning suzanne sent word to her nurse to try and reschedule as many of the rest as possible it was perhaps the most killing aspect of private practice that a days patients had no way to adjust to their physician having been awake most or all of the previous night and indeed it was doubtful most of them would even want to try they had waited days or even weeks for their appointments and they expectedand deserved as far as suzanne was concernedto have their physician be one hundred percent theirs for the short time they had together normally even after a grueling night she could rev herself up for her office work this morning though try as she might she simply could not hold her concentration together a seventyfiveyearold lady who was taking double the amount of digitalis prescribed had nearly slipped past her a housewife had gotten cross with her for not seeming to take her complaints of fatigue more seriously a pharmacy called because she had neglected to write the strength of a cardiac medicine on one of her prescriptions and she knew her difficulty was not simply one of fatigue a child she felt responsible for and a man she was growing to love were both in serious trouble her thoughts kept ricocheting from one to the other twice already she had called the unit to check on tobys status despite knowing that she would be contacted by owen walsh or the nurses at the first sign of trouble twice already she had interrupted the workday of medical staff members to gauge their response to some sort of job action should frank refuse to back down on his dismissal of zack and overriding even her concern for zack and toby nelms was her growing indignation at the treatment guy beaulieu had apparently received from frank and the mounting likelihood that unauthorized chemical experimentation was being conducted at the hospital for more than two years gratitude for her salvation from paul and her legal entanglements had kept her from voicing any criticism of franks decisions or ultramed policies now it was time to take a stand she buzzed her nurse janice how are we doing with those reschedulings youre clear for the next hour dr cole the woman said i havent been able to reach mr braddock or that new referral from hanover but ill keep trying excellent listen ill be in the unit or on page if you need me there are a few things ive got to get done she left her office and took the glassenclosed walkway from the physicians and surgeons building to the main hospital on her way to the icu she passed the carter conference room two dietary aides were busily arranging the tables for a luncheon meetingalmost certainly she realized the meeting of the community board and the people from ultramed there could be no better time to confront frank with her concerns than right now he would listen and make some major concessions or face the embarrassment and conflict of having her present those misgivings to the meeting franks outer office door was closed suzanne opened it and stepped into the deserted reception area hello frank she called as she tapped on the inner door its suzanne cole frank its open suzanne she was startled to hear his voice through the intercom on one of the desks behind her come in she opened the oor and he rose from behind his desk well now he said shaking her hand this is a pleasant surprise thanks frank im sorry to barge in on you like this but i need to talk with you he glanced at the lucite clock that would be fine suzanne but this just isnt the time you see i have a b i know what you have frank she said taking a seat in one of the pair of oakarmed chairs facing his desk you have a meeting with the community board and the people from ultramed before you go into that meeting i think you should hear what i have to say oh you do his buoyant expression chilled perhaps a degree yes but first i wanted to find out why you fired zachary because i always do what is in the best interests of my hospital and getting rid of a disruptive drunken troublemaker was clearly in the best interests of my hospital speaking of which would you like a drink frank listen to me please two years ago you helped me out of a huge jam im grateful for what you did and ever since ive been here ive done my best to support you and i appreciate it suze youve been great tell you what as soon as this board business is taken care of lets you and i do dinner on ultramed and talk about some sort of increase in your pay suzanne felt her irritability quicken dont patronize me frank i came here to get some issues straight to voice some concerns zack has shared with me and frank if you cant respond to those concerns i intend to go in and raise them at that meeting im afraid i cant let you do that frank was thinking rapidly sorting through his options the votes to finalize the sale were almost certainly there now but they were shaky and of even greater concern were the clauses mainwarings corporate lawyers had forced into their contract requiring legal reprisals or an immediate return of their investment should there be any deceptionor even suggestion of deceptionregarding the properties of serenyl no siree baby he concluded im afraid i cant let you do that at all he propped his elbows on the desk and his chin on his hands okay shoot he said thats better well i have two requests i would like your word on frank go on first of all i want your promise to allow the medical staff to determine whether or not zack has been disruptive enough to be fired from the hospital done he said what you have my word as soon as possible next wednesdays meeting if you want well present our cases to the medical staff and let them decide satisfied i guess so good now whats number two well number two has to do with some concerns zack has raised regarding jason and jaek pearl ah yes the infamous anesthe ic you dont believe him of course i dont believe him suzanne but i am investigating his allegations you are frank was hardly acting like the man zack had described meeting with earlier that morning and despite herself suzanne once again felt a spur of doubt regarding what she had been told absolutely frank was saying i have already contacted the members of the medical ethics committee as well as jason and jack and have scheduled a meeting for the first thing next week call them and check on that if you want ill be happy to have both you and my brother present if you wish i wish but what about toby nelms what about him frank if what zack believes is true that child might not have until the first thing next week is there any way you could try and reason with jason and jack just in case jasons away but if it will make you feel better about things you and i can meet with jack at say five oclock today right here thank you would you mind if zack comes too if you insist suzanne youre one of the best things that has ever happened to this place i would do anything i could to keep you here and happy but now if youll pardon me there is a meeting room filling up with people we can plan on getting together again at five oclock by then his thoughts continued im sure i will have come up with some more permanent way of dealing with both you and my brother frank i appreciate all of this very much she said rising in that moment inexplicably she began to sense that something was wrongvery wrong the whole session had gone much too smoothly there was too great a difference between the man zack had described firing him and the one she was confronting now hey no problem frank was saying his hand extended im as committed as you are to making sure this place is the best suzanne took his hand and for just a few seconds continued to hold it there was an unnatural feel to ita coolness a tension frank tell me one last thing she said releasing his hand but keeping her eyes firmly fixed on his were you responsible for all those rumors and stories that circulated about guy frank held her gaze unwaveringly absolutely not he said in that instant suzanne knew the unflinching darkness in his eyes the earnest set of his faceit was a look that had confronted her before many times before it was paul frank youre lying to me arent you she said nonsense he forced calm into his voice but beneath his lightweight suit he had begun to sweat there was no way he reaffirmed even more strongly that suzanne cole was going to that board meeting in the back of his desk drawer was a small revolver carefully frank eased the drawer open then he stopped if zack was right there was an easier far easier means of regaining control of the situation it was certainly worth a try suzanne sit down please he said calmly rising from his own chair puzzled she did as he asked theres something i want you to listen to okay but i dont see what please aall right she followed him with her eyes as he crossed to his stereo switched on the tape deck and replaced the cassette that he had listened to earlier after just a few notes she recognized the music have you heard this before frank asked returning to his desk and opening the drawer another inch suzanne did not answer instead she began to stare at the large aerial photo of the hospital complex the colors were growing more and more intense get up her mind screamed get up and run her legs would not respond well have you he asked again his voice was rumbling and muted his face twisted in a strange bemused smile well ill be damned she heard him say suzanne rubbed at her eyes the sounds in the roomfranks breathing her own gave way to the music which itself drifted farther and farther away then she heard the voiceslow and patient and reassuring all right suzanne now i want you to count back from one hundred one hundred she heard herself say go on go on ninetynine ninetyeight the blue johnny covering her was pulled away exposing her breasts she shivered at her nakedness and the sudden chill ninetyseven ninetysix shes under jason excellent lets get started then no jason she begged as russet anesthe ic was swabbed over her breast please wait it hasnt worked yet the anesthe ic hasnt worked turn the music up a bit fine thats fine okay then knife no wait ninetyfive ninetyfour please hurry please work overhead the bright saucer light flashed on gloved hands appeared just below jason mainwarings sterile blue eyes nestled in the right hand was a scalpel in agonizing slow motion it drifted down toward her jason no she screamed as the blade cut into the skin by her shoulder releasing a spurt of crimson the pain intensified as the scalpel began slicing a slow arc around the base of her breast but before she could scream a gag was pulled tightly between her teeth and tied behind her head and her arms were bound just as vigorously to her sides soundlessly praying for the relief of unconsciousness suzanne endured the agony of the surgical removal of her breast and when the dissection was complete she looked down at herself in wideeyed terror where once there had been skin and breast tissue and a nipple now there was only a gaping bloody crater in that moment amidst a final silent scream blackness mercifully intervened fascinated by what he was observing frank set the stereo playing fantasia on greensleeves for automatic repeat and turned up the volume for once at least his goddamn brother had been something of a help suzanne lay semiconscious on her back on the rug twitching and shuddering from time to time and crying out as much as the handleerchief tied tightly through her mouth would allow frank loosened the sleeves of his suitcoat which he had used to bind her arms and then cut a bath towel into strips it was probably overkill he realized even to bother tying her up mainwarings syrupy music was doing as fine a job of immobilizing her as any truss still at least until she could be removed from the hospital to some safeand permanentresting place it was worth the extra precaution he rolled her onto her side and bound her hands tightly behind her then he laid her back and secured her ankles her eyes remained closed but her restless movements had increasedalmost in reflection to the intensity of the music frank knelt beside her even under such difficult circumstances she was a real beauty brains and looksleigh baron without the hard edge when suzanne had first come to sterling he had made several carefully gauged attempts to start something up between them each time she had politely but firmly refused him it angered him that after just a few weeks in town his brother was already getting inside her pants well so be it he thought the two of them deserved one another and as soon as the board meeting was over he would set about seeing to it that they got to spend an eternity together he had tried to play it easy with both of them but that approach had nearly blown up in his face they had forced him to take off the gloves and now they would see what kind of competitor frank iverson really was he had always played to win and now there was far far too much at stake even to think of backing off he reached down and ran his fingertips over suzannes face and then down over her breasts she really did have a phenomenal body phenomenal lisette suzannezack was spiteful enough to be planning on screwing them both if he hadnt done so already no way zacko frank thought as he dragged suzanne into his bathroom and set her on the damp floor of his shower stall no way youre ever going to humiliate me like that he smoothed out his suitcoat and then combed his hair the music reverberated through the tiled room behind him reflected in the mirror suzanne continued to jerk spasmodically perhaps frank thought after the meeting before he set about arranging an accident of some sort for her and his brother he would take a few minutes to enjoy the favors she had denied him to miss such an opportunity would be a shame besides he mused as he checked himself in the mirror a moment before setting off for the board meeting it would be a crime to waste such romantic music chapter twentyfive im sorry dr iverson but as i told you before im under strict instructions from mr iverson that no calls from you are to be put through to anyone at the hospital except him but all i want you to do is to page dr cole for me ask her to call me an hour had passed since zack had been fired and ushered out of the hospital he had expected to work in for the rest of his professional life he had driven home with the patrol car following him right into his driveway and then had tried to reach suzanne at her office after a number of busy signals he had gotten a tape saying that the office would be closed until one he bad tried his own office but the line had already been disconnected now after a fruitless call to the hospital switchboard and a noanswer try at suzannes home he was giving the page operator one last shot i understand what you are asking doctor the operator said and even when i tell you its a medical emergency you wont do it mr iverson was quite specific whats your name janine well janine i appreciate that you have your orders but how is mr iverson to know if you just put this one call through for me youd be amazed at the things mr iverson finds out doctor and if he does its my job now please ive got to get back to my board janine wait damn zack slammed the receiver down and then snatched it up for another attempt this time he stopped before the switchboard operator could even answer frank had put an airtight sea on the hospital that no simple phone call was going to breach nor did it help matters that his decision to forsake his fathers care in favor of the town derelict had reduced his influence around ultrameddavis to near zero still he had to get back into the hospitalto tell suzanne of the trigger and he hoped to enlist her help in confronting jack pearl he had given up on even trying to speak at the board meeting frank would have him in a cell before he could get close to the door but toby nelms was a different matter without cooperation from pearl without the mans willingness to admit what he and mainwaring were doing he felt quite certain the boy was as good as dead perhaps he began to think the board meeting might be the key with frank inside the conference room and his security people stationed nearby there might be some other unguarded way inside the hospital he scratched out a crude drawing of the building as best he could remember it there was he was nearly sure a delivery entrance outside the cafeteriaone that had to be open assuming suzanne was in the icu he could enter the hospital through the kitchen and reach the icu by a back staircase he checked the time the board meeting if not already under way would be starting any minute he could park on the highway and circle through the woods to the delivery entrance police or no police it was worth a try he tied cheap dog on his run and then lurched the camper out of the drive and down the hill toward the hospital hoping that the time for tobys transfer to boston had not been moved up as he drove he pictured the boy sitting crosslegged on the rug in his house watching his favorite hero cavorting across the screen urging him to join in a song extolling the virtues of the letter p alas my love you do me wrong how many others jack he said to himself practicing the words he would use how many other time bombs have you and wnwaring planted in your patients the hospital was located on the opposite side of town from zacks house ordinarily he took the highway bypass around main street this day lost in thought he missed the turnoff and was well into town before he realized it traffic was heavier than usual and it seemed from the long line of cars at the corner of birch that the light was malfunctioning after a moments debate he backed up a foot and made a uturn narrowly missing a twotone oldsmobile that was speeding past it took several seconds before he realized the driver of the oldsmobile was jason mainwaring zack began honking and waving but it was several blocks before mainwaring became aware of him and pulled over they confronted one another in a small street side park circumscribed by an arc of slatted benches arranged about a marble pedestal and bust of one of sterlings founding fathers several grizzled men sat on two of the benches smoking cigarettes watching the passing scene and occasionally sharing surreptitious sips from a brown bag they watched curiously as the two welldressed men approached one another jason zack began somewhat breathlessly god am i glad to see you the surgeon looked at him strangely im sorry iverson he said after a beat but ive signed out to greg ormesby if yall need any surgical help im afraid youll have to call this has nothing to do with surgical help jason we need to talk ive been trying to locate you for several days ive been at home in georgia i know he glanced over at the old men and then motioned to the bench farthest from them please jason what i need to speak with you about is pretty urgent and very private could we talk over there well iverson im afraid im in a bit of a rush why dont we get together say its about the anesthe ic mainwarings color drained i beg your pardon he said over there zack again motioned toward the bench by the time they sat down the surgeon appeared as composed as ever now then he drawled just what anesthe ic are you talkin about its the one you and jack pearl have been using on your cases jason the one that allows them to get out of the recovery room three times faster than anyone elses cases im afraid i dont understand mainwaring said but zack could see from his eyes that he did i dont have time to play games he said a child is dying and i have reason good reason to believe that your anesthe ic is at fault a minute tic developed at the corner of mainwarings eye be hint of understanding disappeared from his face this time zack felt certain the man was genuinely surprised look iverson he said i just dont have time for this nonsense if you have something to accuse me or jack pearl of then id suggest you do it through channels i would also suggest you have a shitload of proof jason please zack said trying desperately to keep civility in his tone this isnt ethics or charges were talking about its a childs life please listen item by item in a near whisper he reviewed his investigation into the case of toby nelms mainwaring listened impassively only at the mention of darryl tarberry did zack detect any reaction so thats where things stand he concluded the boys mother is certain that at least several times he was watching this childrens show when he had his seizures its a show that features a version of greensleevesthe same music you use in the operating room if i could just get my hands on whatever it is you were using for anesthesia i think i might be able to help that kid oh you do its a long shot but right now its his only chance well then mainwaring said it would appear that the boy has no chance at all because ysee iverson there is no mystery anesthe ic zack stared at the man in disbelief iverson just who have you shared these charges with the surgeon asked jason these arent charges a child is dy who the childs mother that all suzanne she believe you she was willing to listen but i spoke to her before i learned about the triggerthe music now jason please i asked if she believed you not completely but after i tell her what ive learned im certain shell not completely mainwaring cut in snidely iverson i sure hope you have one hell of a lawyer have you mentioned this nonsense to your brother zack glanced at his watch the board meeting was already under way mainwaring this isnt nonsense if that child dies if anyone who received that drug dies then its murder dont threaten me the surgeon said shaking a finger at zack dont you ever threaten me now i asked if you had shared this hokum with your brother i did dammit mainwaring doesnt any of this have an impact on when did you tell him just a while ago and his response mainwaring theres no time for this what was his response he ignored me just as i intend to do mainwaring said now if youll excuse me he rose mainwaring you cant do this zack said loudly the grizzled observers interest heightened and one of them sputtered on the contents of the brown bag can and am mainwaring said just as loudly now you just quiet down iverson or youll have even more charges to deal with than you already do mainwaring are you some kind of fucking monster the surgeon turned and headed for his car well are you zack screamed after him mainwaring now at his car turned back and shook a finger at him watch it he said venomously just fuckin watch it the sun which had been gliding in and out of hiding all morning slid behind a dense billow of gray cloud instantly cooling the air zack pulled the camper onto a dirt track off the androscoggin road and worked his way upward through a forest still sodden by the midnight rain he felt ill over his unsuccessful encounter with mainwaring and could not dispel his angernot only at the surgeon but at his own handling of the man had he been too aggressive too abrasive would his arguments have been more effective if he had simply brought mainwating to the hospital and let him see toby nelms for himself the questions burned in his thoughts as he picked his way uphill toward the dortb side of the hospital only one thing was certain now with frank an enemy and mainwaring unwilling to expose himself to charges jack pearl was all the hope the child had left and without either of the other two men to back him up in a confrontation with the anesthesiologist that hope was slim indeed through the trees ahead zack could see the top two floors of the hospital the broad glass windows were he noticed for the first time tinted just enough to give them an ebony cast the effect was cold and uninviting he moved up to the edge of the forest and flattened himself against a thick beech tree to his left just beyond an expanse of grass and past the corner of the building was the patio of the cafeteria a group of nurses sat laughing and talking at the only table in his line of sight the entire north side of the hospital was deserted cautiously he picked his way along the treeline toward the corner farthest from the patio he would have to dash across perhaps twenty yards of lawn to reach the delivery door from there he would walk nonchalantly through the kitchen searching for a route to the corridor that did not take him through the crowded cafeteria itself ahead of him the tinted windows of the hospital glinted ominously in the muted midday light if there were faces behind those windows watching him he would have no way of knowing his heart was pounding in his ears more so than even on the most treacherous climbs a crouch a final check of the building line and zack bolted ahead he saw the blur of movement and color to his right at virtually the same moment he heard the barked command stop right there right now startled zack stumbled forward slamming heavily against the brick facing and nearly falling as he spun toward the voice standing not ten feet away brandishing a heavy nightstick was the security guard henry the pockmarked behemoth who had been present at guys death and again at his funeral i been following you doc he said rubbing a hand over the side of his nearly nonexistent neck from that window right there i been following you all the way across jesus henry you just scared the hell out of me zack said still gasping for breath his shoulder was throbbing viciously at the point where it had collided with the building gingerly he raised his arm pain stopped it just below a horizontal position hed almost dislocated it a firstdegree separation at least he guessed didnt mean to scare ya doc the huge guard said lowering his stick nearly but not completely to his side just to stop ya henry ive got to get in there zack said mr iverson left strict orders not to let you thats why i was called in theres a kid dying in there henry a kid that only i can help youve got to let me pass cant the man said simply if i do its my job no discussion no excuses thats what my boss said i got three kids and nothin to support em with exceptin what god gave me from the neck down jobs like this one dont come along that often to a man like me zack started to argue but then just as quickly stopped himself he pictured the guard at guys funeralhis illfitting blue suit his quiet anxious little wife the man was right the job probably was a godsend to them and their children and too many people had been hurt already he would find another way to contact suzanne or perhaps a way to lure jack pearl outside the protection of the building all right henry he said i wont try to argue with you he turned and started back toward the woods doc wait zack looked back over his injured shoulder how olds the kid hes eight henry i see my kennys almost nine doc what in the heck happened between you and your brother anyhow zack laughed ruefully its a long story henry you know hes not a very nice man your brother no henry zack said i guess he isnt he doesnt think much of people like me perhaps he doesnt for a few moments there was only the sound of the wind through the leaves overhead doc the guard said suddenly why dont you just go ahead on in there and do whatever it is you have to do zack eyed the man you mean that talking to me and my wife the way you did at doc beaulieus funeralthat was a really nice thing to do henry your job may be on the line ill find another one if i have to you know i really did think i was responsible for doc beaulieus death im big and im tough when i have to be but im not mean i couldnt eat or sleep after he diedthat is until you talked to me if anyone was responsible henry zack said it was my brother hes the one who started all those rumors about dr beaulieu i believe it you go on in there zack started toward the door you sure he asked do it for doc beaulieu henry said fonynine years had guy lived clothilde beaulieu suddenly realized they would have celebrated their fortyninth anniversary in just one week how strange that now standing behind her chair surveying the room of blank bored and patronizing faces she should feel as close to her husband as she had at any time during those five decades he had stood in rooms like this one many times over the past two years confronting these faces or faces like them and although she had never been there with him clothilde knew that she was feeling exactly as he had she knew too that even though there was little or no chance she would prevail he was at that moment by her side and he was proud for many years after my husband opened his practice in sterling she was saying he was one of only three doctors in town and the only surgeon for almost a hundred miles he was a kind and skilled and caring man who did nothingnothingto deserve the kind of treatment he was to receive from the administration of this institution and the corporation whose philosophy it has adopted seated across from the woman frank iverson shaded in portions of the geometric design he was developing on a napkin and checked the time it would be a laughable irony if guy beaulieus widow were allowed to drone on past the twelve oclock deadline rendering the vote of the board legally meaningless regardless of its outcome no not laughable he decidedperfect it was all he could do to keep from smiling at the notion the carter room was set up in its conference modethirty chairs arranged around an open rectangle of sandlewood tables at the back of the room near the gallery of past medical staff presidents a serving table was set with coffee danish and bowls of fruit hidden beneath the draping linen cloth of that table awaiting the inevitable several bottles of premium french champagne were chilling in sterling silver ice buckets the magic number was ten of the twentytwo members of the davis hospital board of trustees nineteen were present absent from the group were a real estate agent who was vacationing in europe the ceo of the carter paper company who had never attended a board meeting since his first one years before and board chairman clayton iverson in the judges absence whitney bourque had been presiding over the meeting frank sat beside leigh baron at the corner of the arrangement farthest from bourque they were flanked by a trio of lawyers two representing ultramed and the third the hospital across from them stood clothilde beaulieu someone must realize that in a civilized society such as ours she was saying the best available medical care must not be doled out as a privilege the right to live ones life as free from disease as possible must be extended to all regardless of their ability to pay it was my husbands belief and it is mine that the ultramed hospitals corporation has failed in that sacred obligation by selecting only those who can pay for treatment by influencing the therapeutic decisions of physicians who have studied many years to develop their craft the corporation has reduced the delivery of medical care to the level of of automobile mechanics frank glanced over at gary garrison proprietor of garrisons chevrolet sales and service just in time to see the man smile and whisper a remark to the board member seated next to him more irony garrisons vote was one of those that frank had not absolutely locked up given enough time it was possible that clothilde beaulieu could insult enough members on the board to make the vote unanimous frank made his fifth head count of the session when he had left his fathers office less than a week before he was certain of only five votes six at the most now thanks in large measure to the judges absence and his refusal to use his influence on the board he had eleven one over the magic number gary garrison would make twelve and with the closed ballot whitey bourque had promised him there might even be one or two more you look concerned leigh whispered frank smiled no sweat he whispered back i hope so frank were counting on you thats the way i like it over the past two years guy beaulieu fought back against the attempts of ultramed to drive him from practice unfortunately as i said earlier much of the evidence he accumulated is not available today i have done my best without it to present our position to you i leave you now with this petition signed by sixtyseven residents of this area requesting the return of our hospital to community control i greatly appreciate the opportunity you have given me to represent my husbands interests this day i know just as he did that the age of the country doctor making house calls and sharing the most intimate details of his patients lives is all but over in this country but i issue to you in his name and in the name of those on this petition one final plea that you do what you can to stop the juggernaut of technology and profit from robbing medicine of so much of its dignity compassion and sacred trust thank you and god bless you for listening so patiently to this old woman several members of the board applauded lightly and bill crook seated on clothildes right patted her on the arm whitey bourque who had unabashedly checked his watch half a dozen times during the final few minutes of her speech sighed audibly and tapped his gavel on the table as he stood by his chair so he said there you have it frank has had his say and now mrs beaulieu has had hers any other comments in the few minutes we have left good enough well in view of the seriousness of this repurchase matter it has been suggested and i agree that we vote on the issue by closed ballot any objections okay then youll each find a ballot in your folder just mark whatever you think is right and pass your vote over to me across the room frank subconsciously nodded his approval beneath the table his leg was jouncing in nervous anticipation after immobilizing suzanne cole he had called annette dolan and insisted that she stay home for the remainder of the day next he had worked out an exquisite scenario for zack and suzanne which would take both of them out of his hair for good and place the blame for their accident squarely on the shoulders of his brother he couldnt have scripted things better first mainwarings million now the vote and later a call to zack and one final test of serenylthis time at the edge of the fourhundredfoot dropoff at christmas point it would be the perfect ending to a perfect day the game hadnt been easy but he had met and overcome every obstacle and now at long last frankie iverson was about to be on top again in the back of his mind the cheerleaders chant had begun to build frank frank hes our man with henry checking the corridors and stairways ahead of him zack moved easily through the kitchen and up the north stairway to the icu the pain from his shoulder while tolerable was continuing to make its existence known especially when he tried to raise his ann good luck in there doc the guard said barely able to contain his enthusiasm at the decision he had made ill be around the hospital if you need me just have me paged zack shook his hand gratefully youve done a good thing henry he said a really good thing ill page you if i need you readying himself for the struggle ahead he turned and entered the icu the unit was virtually as he had left it two hours before except that neither suzanne nor owen walsh was there half of the glassenclosed cubicles were empty and what activity there was continued to center about toby nelms the nurses eyed him uncomfortably as he approached off to his right he saw the unit secretary snatch up the receiver of her phone and then slowly set it back down again as if unwilling to take sole responsibility for reporting his appearance in the hospital bernice rimmer the nurse assigned to tobys care bad actually been a classmate of zacks from early childhood through high school she was the mother of three children now but still looked nearly as slim and buoyant as she had during her teens she was also a nurses nurse tough on the outside but with a core of honeyand smart her presence this day was zack realized no less fortunate for him than his encounter with henry if any nurse would give him a break it was she as he approached bernice almost as if reading his thoughts sent the aide who was working with her out of tobys cubicle hi bernie zack said funny she responded you dont look like public enemy number one im not tell that to your brother i never thought the two of you got along all that well but this is something else she took a folded sheet of paper from her uniform pocket smoothed it out on tobys bed and passed it over zack was not surprised at the content of the memo only at its viciousness in essence frank had outlined a set of charges against him that would have made attila the hun proud and had threatened summary dismissal for anyone not immediately reporting his presence in the hospital frank and i are having a few problems he said guess hows toby doing about the same his temps staying around pupils are still equal no change in his consciousness she gestured at the memo you do all those things zack shook his head frank doesnt want to believe that the anesthesia this child received for his hernia operation is responsible for his problem is it yes i bernice rimmer studied him for a time and then she gazed down at her charge reached over and stroked the boys forehead finally she looked past zack to the unit secretary and shook her head so what do you propose to do about it she asked zack started to thank her but the look in her eyes stopped him she wanted action not platitudes he conducted a brief neurologic check of toby i need to have a few words with jack pearl he said hes in the o r thats okay but before i see him i need to go over some things with suzanne do you know where she is no idea she called a while ago to say shed be down here shortly but she hasnt showed i think dr walsh paged her once but as far as i know she never answered hes gone to his office could you have her paged again please also try the e r just in case shes tied up there hey waited several minutes for suzanne to answer then once again zack tried calling her at home this is very weird he said does she fail to answer pages often never wers the security guard ask him to come here you want security not securityhenry its okay and please thank the rest of the staff for holding off on reporting me henry flowers arrived at the unit in less than two minutes howm i doing zack asked the massive guard shrugged as far as i can tell no one knows youre here im trying to find dr cole you know her of course i just heard her paged that was me she didnt answer so id like you to start looking around for her if you could i dont think id last very long out there okay check her office in the p ands building first then maybe the cardiac lab henry stroked his pocked cheeks i saw her he said thoughtfully when where not too long ago i i cant remember where though doc lets see i started my rounds on the front lawn and then crossed through the lobby and then suddenly he brightened i remember now i remember where i saw her then just as suddenly his expression darkened henry where zack asked it was in the west wing he said distantly she she was going into mr iversons office zack felt an instant chill henry get me there he said he turned to the nurse bemie could you please find out whos on for anesthesia beside dr pearl call whoever it is and ask them to stand by dont tell them its for me with henry resuming his role as scout they left the unit and made their way down to the subbasement then across the hospital to the westwing staircase and up zack flattened himself against the stairwell wall henry he whispered i think my brother is in a meeting but he has two receptionists yeah i know the knockout twins exactly talk to them see if they remember when suzanne left or better still where she might have gone also find out if frank was with her when she went subconsciously the huge guard straightened his tie adjusted the lapels on his uniform and pushed his massive shoulders back a notch then he slipped out the stairway door to confront the knockout twins half a minute later he was back no one there he said no one nope he appeared disappointed not the blonde not the darkhaired one no one i even took a chance because there was music playing inside and unlocked the outer office door and listened at mr iversons door for voices music violins pretty music but it must be on awful loud to be able to hear it through two closed doors henry i want to go back there okay but zack was already through the stairway door the guard shrugged and followed closely just outside franks outer office zack stopped and listened as henry had said the music coming from the inner office was quite audible it took just a few seconds for zack to recognize the piece jesus henry open this up please the guard did as asked the music much louder now brought a sickening tightness to zacks gut he knocked on the door and called out once but knew there would be no answer this door henry open it please cant henry its important i think dr coles in there and i think shes in trouble no key only mr iverson has a key to that door henry weve got to get in there the guard hesitated please well he said finally i guess i cant get fired more than once can he took a single step forward and then hit the heavy door with such force that the entire frame shattered the door itself crushed where his shoulder had made contact fell to the floor like a playing card fantasia on greensleeves was playing at a neardeafening level zack snapped off the tape glanced about the office for a moment then raced into the bathroom henry he yelled get in here no longer mindful of being seen zack raced ahead as henry carried suzanne tbrougb the corridors of the hospital and up the stairs to the icu she was motionless unresponsive and soaked with perspiration her level of coma was deep and her elevated temperature quite apparent bernice rimmers surprise at their arrival lasted only seconds before she was in action stripping suzannes clothes off getting a blood pressure cuff around her arm and ordering a ringers lactate iv from one of the other nurses she remind you of anyone bernie zack asked she got the same anesthesia as toby you believe me now i believed you before the nurse said listening to suzannes chest you probably dont remember this but i once asked you to cheat on a latin translation for me and you refused i figured that if you were such an honest nerd then you couldnt have changed all that much whos pearls backup the nurse anesthe ist shes in obstetrics call her please tell her to meet me by the operating room doors in two minutes tell her its a lifeanddeath emergency also order some labs and blood gases on suzanneeverything stat and give her decadron ten milligrams iv done ill be back shortly get ready pearl you bastard he murmured as he slammed through the unit doors this crap has gone on long enough im coming for you chapter twentysix frank knew as he watched whitey bourque separate the ballots into two piles that the vote was going to be closer than he had wanted he counted exactly ten ballots in one pile and nine in the other by insisting on a closed vote it had been his hope to minimize any influence the judge might still have had on certain members now it appeared he had succeeded more in minimizing his own fuck you garrison he thought watching the last of the ballots smoothed open starting next year it will be fords for this hospital bank on it well bourque said as he and the member seated next to him finished a cooperative tabulation of the votes i make it ten to nine you get that too charlie good he banged his gavel in that case i am pleased to announce that the daviser excuse me the ultrameddavis board of trustees has by a vote of ten to nine approved the finalization of the sale of this hospital to the ultramed division of riata international several members applauded many others simply shrugged leigh baron accepted the congratulations of the attorneys and then turned to frank that was close she said frank smiled hand grenades and horseshoes he said giddily pardon oh just a little phrase my father drummed into my head well frank it would appear that you are to be excuse me but i wondered if the acting chairman could delay the celebration long enough to listen to one more point of view like the gallery at a tennis match every head in the room swung in unison toward the door the judge a blanket over his lap sat in a wheelchair just inside the room pale but smiling grimly whitey bourque raced around and shook his hand god judge its good to see you up like this you all right i mean can you i can move em whitey not very much yet but more every minute somewhat painfully he demonstrated by lifting his right foot several inches off its support frank too stunned by the sudden intrusion even to react glanced down at his watch it was eight minutes till noon at that moment he realized his father was watching him good to see you judge he managed hoarsely the judge nodded at him and then exchanged a prolonged look with leigh baron id like to address the board if i might he said of course judge whitey bourque replied why dont you just let me wheel you up front judge frank said the votings over is it im afraid so judge bourque said ten to nine it was in favor of ultramed well perhaps i can change a mind or two thats not legal sir one of the ultramed lawyers said the votes done clayton iverson fixed him with a glare that would have melted block iee dont you dare tell me whats legal and whats not young man he rasped i was a lawyer and a judge while your mommy was still wiping your behind our contract with you people says that we have until noon today to repurchase this hospital by a majority vote of the board thats what it says no more no less and unless somethings wrong with my timepiece here i make it seven of ashen frank watched as his father was wheeled up to the chairmans table he was desperately sorting through disruptions he could instigate that might carry the meeting past the deadline but before he could light on a specific action the judge was speaking ill make this short he began i had promised many of you that i would do the legwork necessary to ensure that it was to the benefit of our community to finalize our temporary arrangement with the ultramed people because of my accident and for other reasons which i have neither the time nor inclination to go into now i decided to withhold my conclusions about this business and let the chips fall where they may well i have come back at this time to tell you that my reaction was unfairto you my friends and colleagues and to the city of sterling as well i have learned enough to appear before you now and tell you categorically that while we may have benefited in the short run from ultrameds involvement with our hospital it would be a grave mistake to turn davis regional over to them permanently my housekeeper annie doucette almost died because of a policyan ultramed corporate policythat rewards physicians for transferring patients out of the hospital as early as possible and rewards them even more if that transfer is to an ultramedowned nursing home patients who helped build this hospital are being shunted off to clarion county because they havent got enough insurance theres moremuch morehe glanced at leigh baronbut because of the time im going to ask you to trust me on that now we have three minutes until noon if it is agreeable with whitey here i would like to call for another vote on this question any objections bourque asked yes frank said standing i object well im sorry frank bourque countered but youre not a board member n we dont have time for any outside objections frank hesitated and then sank numbly to his seat okay then bourque said you all have a second ballot in your folders i put one there knowin that at least some of you were bound to screw up the first one a brief volley of laughter gave way to dense silence as the twenty board members marked their ballots folded them and passed them toward the front of the room leigh baron her back to frank sat staring stonily at the gallery of presidents as the last of the ballots reached whitey bourque and was counted the steeple bells of st annes began tolling the noon hour sara newton the nurse anesthe ist was a mousy young woman with braces that had yet to correct a striking overbite she had been asleep in maternity awaiting a delivery and arrived at the doors to the operating suite only moments after zack breathless blearyeyed and disheveled wheres the emergency she panted tugging at a kink in her bra in the unit zack said his shoulder was throbbing from the dash through the hospital and he had resorted to partially splinting it by jamming his thumb through a belt loop the unit well then lets get going say are you okay you look a little pale im fine a little stressed out is all thats right there was a notice sent around that youve been fired ive been rehired sara i need jack pearl its a case hes familiar with id like you to take over his case in or so he can leave the woman was astonished dr iverson i cant do that listen sara zack said sharply i dont have time to argue i know youre very good at your job and if i thought you could do what i need i wouldnt hesitate but this is pearls affair his and mine and at least two lives are on the line now please whwhat can i do she asked shaken get a fresh set of scrubs on and be outside o r i as quickly as you can ill signal you when its okay to come in jack will never agree to something like this you leave jack to me now please hurry zack raced into the surgeons locker room and painfully undressed he threw his clothes into his locker and pulled on a scrub suit a paper hair cover mask and shoe covers and he hurried past the sinks in the prep room and into o r i greg ormesby the surgeon on the case looked up and took several seconds to recognize who he was iverson he asked somewhat coolly that is you under there isnt it at the mention of zacks name all activity in the room came to an instant halt jack pearl who was hunched over his instruments looked up and paled sorry to bust in like this greg zack said with forced calm but i need to talk to jack here im busy pearl muttered well whatever it is will just have to wait ormesby said well be done in half an hour now if you please iverson zack bent over pearl and laid his right hand at the base of the mans neck jack he whispered its suzanne shes in the icu right now and shes having a seizure just like tobys shes reliving her operation and shes screaming out your name yours and jasons even wearing a mask and hair cover the frail anesthesiologist oked ill that cant be pearl whispered back i want you up there with me right now youre crazy zack slipped his fingers around the sides of pearls neck and applied just a bit of pressure shes the second case jack the one you were holding out for im not going anyplace now let go of me youre hurting me zack looked up just as sara newton appeared outside the door he motioned her in with a snap of his head and tightened his grip digging his sinewy fingers into the nerves alongside pearls neck iverson what in the hell is going on here ormesby demanded are you crazy somebody call security iverson for crying out loud theres a goddamn woman opened up on the table here cant you see that im sorry to do things this way greg zack said raising the little anesthesiologist to his feet but theres trouble in the icu that only jack can help with thats crazy pearl cried out hes crazy ow youre hurting me iverson let go greg ormesby and the surgical team watched in stunned silence as zack pulled the little man away from his console and gestured sara newton into his place iverson stop this right now ormesby shouted youre endangering my patient nonsense sara here is an excellent anesthe ist and you know it shell take good care of your patient im sorry to have to do things this way but i just dont have time to explain right now i will though greg i promise oh for gods sake will somebody call security iverson this is madness zack did not respond the pain in his shoulder partially numbed by his own adrenaline he dragged pearl through the scrub room and slammed him against the bank of lockers pinning him by the throat so that he was up on the tips of his toes iverson greg ormesby hollered i see now that what everyone is saying about you is true ill get you for this ill see you up on charges okay jack zack said ignoring the surgeons bellowing this is it now tell me there is an experimental drug isnt there he augmented his grip with his injured arm and hoisted the anesthesiologist up another fraction of an inch pearls toes came off the carpet well isnt there pearb either too frightened or too obstinate to answer did not respond his face was violet his eyes now nearly level with zacks were bulging at that moment a security guard burst into the locker room and without a word struck zack with his nightsticka blow that glanced off the side of his head and landed squarely on his injured shoulder crying out from the pain zack dropped heavily to the carpet clutching his arm as jack pearl slithered down the locker and moaning collapsed in a heap nearby the guard knelt on the small of zacks back and raised his stick preparing for another blow stop that right now startled the guard came off zack and whirled toward the voice zack reacted more slowly he turned and through tears of pain saw jason mainwaring hands on hips standing by the door mainwaring he gasped its suzanne shes in the unit and i know i just came from there mainwaring turned to the guard everythings under control here now you can go but i said things are under control yyes sir the guard backed from the room with mainwarings iceblue eyes helping him along okay jack the surgeon said as the door swung shut give iverson whatever he wants jason i cant dammit jack do it there are two people in deep trouble in the unit up there i may have made some mistakes in this business but im no murderer if serenyls responsible for their condition then i want iverson here to get whatever he needs to help them now pearl stumbled to his feet zack tried to rise fell heavily and then tried againthis time with shaky success thanks mainwaring he said i didnt think id gotten through to you just remember iverson that just because im here doesnt mean im admitting to anything he glanced over at the anesthesiologist and then added in a voice too soft for the man to bear im no monster iverson if pearls drug has hurt some people i want to do whatever i can to help out you remember that now you remember i did that yeah sure mainwaring zack said ill remember frank sat alone to one side of the carter conference room and watched as whitey bourque the last remaining board member wheeled his father away for readmission to the hospital the revote had been an impressive fourteen to six in favor of repurchase as he neared the door the judge looked back at him and mouthed the words im sorry frank across from frank leigh baron shared a final exchange with her lawyers and sent them off then she turned and surveyed the near empty room and the vestiges of the meeting just past well he beat you she said finally he beat you too frank retorted hes one of the hardest men ive ever dealt with tell me about it leigh paced to one side of the room and then back unfortunately she said that is unfortunately for you your fathers actions have placed me in a rather ticklish position you see frank three years ago you did a very stupid very amateurish thing you took money from us a good deal of money shocked frank stared up at her i i dont know what youre talking about he managed oh frank she said sardonically you disappoint me so she crossed the room and laid the accountants report in front of him we were a little worried about this vote today she explained so last night i visited with your father you what i shared the contents of that folder with him and promised that it would be incinerated as soon as the sale of the hospital was complete thats insane no frank she said calmly thats business what kind of person are you do you know that you probably were the cause of his accident i know nothing of the kind but what i do know is that your father made his choice and now we must make ours you can expect charges of embezzlement to be brought against you first thing next week you cant do that can and will she said i i was about to put that money back i have the cash right now right in the bank too late youre an insensitive bitch oh thats wonderful frank so witty so articulate ill ill double what i took he said five hundred thousand i can have it in your hands this afternoon frank you dont understand if it was the money you would have been buried three years ago when we first became aware of what you had done in that case he said suddenly seeing a crack of daylight and racing toward it if i go down your company goes down with me big time what are you talking about im talking about some work that has been going on at this hospitalat your hospital the testing of a new and unapproved anesthe ic its work involving your administrator and one of your surgeons and one of your anesthesiologists and it hasnt come out too well if you need proof stop by the icu and check out a kid named nelms and i promise you that if i get charged with anything ill smear ultrameds name until your stock isnt worth using as toilet paper i dont believe you she said but frank could tell that she did like i said just stop by the unit im sure the childs parents and their lawyers would love to know that a multibilliondollar company was responsible for their sons condition youve been allowing this to go on without our knowledge frank felt the shift in momentum allowing it hell ive been in charge of it how do you think i was planning on coming up with that much money in fact the work is already done ive been paid off and fortunatelyfor all of usonly i know that it hasnt come out all that well now do we have a mexican standoff or not leigh baron spent several seconds sizing him up but he knew that he had won how many patients she asked oh five hundred he said give or take i intend to check up on what youve told me feel free just be careful when you do if this blows it blows in your face frank youre pathetic ah ah now whos being articulate one word frank if so much as one word about this this stupidity touches ultramed i swear ill bury you what youve done is horrible frank grinned broadly no its not he said with a wink its business the article studies in the reversal of the delayed toxicity of lysergic acid diethylamine lsd had been written by a scottish neurologist named clarkin and published almost fifteen years before in the littleread british journal of neuropsychology it was an anecdotal report not a scientific study in the true sense of the word zack had stumbled onto the work during his first year of residency and had saved it because the notion of treating lsd flashbacks with lsd both amused and fascinated him in most of his cases clarkin had used a highdensity salineflotation isolation tank with no such device at hand they would simply have to make do and while the scotsmans concepts were intriguing the data presented were too scant to justify many of his conclusions it was frightening to realize that with no other promising options clarkins theories were all that suzanne and toby nelms had going for them as he supervised the nurses transfer of suzanne to a water mattressthe first step in reducing her sensory input to the absolute minimumzack wondered about the neurologist and his work was it a mistake not to try and locate him was he even still alive still practicing was he a scholar or a fraud had he received acclaim for his theolies or scorn but most of all zack wondered if he might be endangering his two patients by what he was attempting to do over the years of his training he had developed total implicit faith in his clinical judgment now having difficulty focusing past the pain in his shoulder and with the nightmare of the past twentyfour hours so fresh in his mind he was having doubts be diligent be meticulous be honest account for every variable zack stared down at suzanne bound for the moment by fourpoint leather restraints shortly after arriving in the icu her coma had lightened and she had become combative and disoriented her symptoms were identical in many ways to tobys but were clearly evolving more rapidly and virulentlythe result zack was certain of franks vicious treatment of her although she was groggy from valium she had received it was apparent that she was still locked in her psychosis totally out of touch with reality her temperature had risen to almost was there another way he had been so sure of himself before the judges accident sure enough to charge in and insist on applying clarkins anecdotal work to toby nelms now even with mainwarings and pearls validation of his theories about an experimental drug he felt himself on the knifes edge of panic be meticulous account for every variable zack rubbed at his shoulder the swelling was increasing even the slightest movement of his arm was now sending numbing metallic pain up into his neck and down to his fingertips fatigue and tension were battling for control of his mind across from him in quiet resignation jack pearl was readying his instruments and syringes off to one side jason mainwaring stood alone watching as zack finished placing patches over suzannes eyes and oilsoaked cotton in her ears mainwaring motioned him over he looked uncharacteristically rumpled gray and drawn and the concern in his eyes was it seemed genuine iverson you know im sorry this is happening he whispered you should be ive never been one to make excuses for myself but before you n pearl get started there are two things id like you to know first of all that woman you learned about from tarberrythe one who died in my office yes she died of a coronary not any allergic reaction she never got anything but plain olxylocaine and thats the truth i had some some enemies at the hospital who had learned about my involvement with a pharmaceutical company they were determined to get me and mrs grimess unfortunate death gave them the chance i wont deny doin some work in my office with an experimental local anesthe ic but mrs grimes got xylocaine zack glanced over at suzanne mainwaring he said coolly i appreciate your coming back here the way you did but dont look for any exoneration from me what you twoyou threehave done here was beyond stupid and beyond wrong ive never been one to cut corners but our company was failing we we were desperate serenyl would have saved us zack gestured toward the two comatose patients do you think they care he asked mainwaring had no response zack were all set bernice rimmer called over coming throughout the ordeal the nurse had been a rock quietly stemming the concerns of the rest of the unit staff and promising to take full responsibility should anything go wrong she was so quick so efficient and compassionate zack found himself trying to remember what she had been like during their years together at school the only image he could conjure was of a plain softspoken girl pleasant enough but well or itside of the in crowd how meaningless all of that seemed now all right he said to the staff before we start i want you all to know how much how much all three of usappreciate what youre doing here i know you have questions about whats going on and i promise that when things settle down well answer as many of them as we can the plan is to put suzanne to sleep with a new anesthe ic in hopes of ending her seizure after were done well do the same thing to toby exactly what do you expect to have happen one of the other nurses asked ideally well i guess we hope that whatever chemical molecules are poisoning their central nervous systems will be washed away and theyll both just wake up but it may take some time are there dangers zack looked over at jack pearl who was drawing up the contents of one of his vials into a syringe well jack pearl shook his head no he muttered no dangers the nurse seemed satisfied okay then zack said feeling his pulse beginning to quicken lets go remember no light no sound no movement the nurses began cutting the lights and equipment noise to a minimum zack motioned jack pearl off to one side remember jack he said play this straight serenyls not responsible for this pearl growled jack dont start with me just do this right dammit it wont work iverson youre crazy youre absolutely right jack his back to the others zack glared down at the man i am crazy and dont you for one goddamn second forget that together they returned to suzannes bedside the nurses settled down in the darkness as pearl inserted a needle into the rubber bulb of suzannes iv line then he hesitated do it jack zack rasped this may be your only tidket out of hell for gods sake do it now the anesthesiologists hands were trembling so badly he needed both of them to hold the syringe dammit jack slowly pearl depressed the plunger frank perched on one of the tables of the carter conference room and watched as leigh baron gathered her things she would no doubt stop by the unit to verify his claims about toby nelms but then with any luck she would be out of his life for good his heartbeat continued to race and there remained a persistent sandpaper tightness in his throat but that was understandable he had narrowly dodged a bullet still as he had learned countless times over his years as the quarterback although his lastsecond victory wasnt a pretty one a win was a win and a win this most certainly was his expectations of a regional directorship were gone but the additional money in his bank account more than compensated for the termination of his association with ultramed and leigh baron it was interesting he mused how suddenly unattractive the woman looked in defeat the bridge of her nose the shape of her hips the stiff unfeminine way she moved it was absurd that at one time he had found her so desirable he could do bettermuch better remember frank leigh said snapping her briefcase closed assuming what youve told me is true i dont want one word of it to get anywhere near ultramed sure baby sure even her orders sounded diffierentgroveling hollow damn you frank she muttered before he could respond she turned and was gone gradually the unpleasant tightness in franks throat began to subside he was pleased to find he could breathe deeply again he even managed a thin smile he was on a roll another challenge had arisen and been dealt with still he cautioned himself this was no time to celebrate not yet soon though he thought as soon as suzanne cole and one zachary iverson had been dispatched there would be all the time in the world he pushed himself off the table and headed toward his office reviewing the plan he had devised removing suzanne from the hospital was the only tricky part and that could easily be accomplished with one of the hospitals laundry hampers he had always been a handson administrator it was hardly unusual for him to be seen carrying tools to a job or moving a piece of furniture so even if he were seen with the hamper it was doubtful any questions would be raised the rest was elegantly simple a call to zack a meeting at christmas point and an accident he had even thought to stop by central supply and appropriate some intravenous alcohol starting an iv lineespecially one that needed to last only minuteswas no big deal once zack was immobilized either with an injection of screnyl or the butt of his revolver he would infuse enough of the alcohol to leave no doubt in anyones mind what had happenedespecially since he had already seen to it that zacks drinking the night before was common knowledge around the hospital inspired elegant simple lost in thought frank hurried along the firstfloor corridor toward the new wing nearly colliding with the judges wheelchair as it was pushed out of the admissions office clayton iverson eyed him grimly and then turned to the young candy striper who was transporting him kathy dear this is my son if you dont mind i need to talk to him ill send for you if i need you again thank you he waited until the girl had left and then used his cast and his good hand to wheel himself past the doorway i want you to know that it hurt me to do what i had to do in there frank he said nonsense judge frank said i wouldnt have expected anything less of my father clayton iverson looked up at him in surprise im pleased to bear you say that frank unfortunately i wish that was all there was to it once again frank saw daylight dad listen he said i just finished speaking with leigh baron i know the spot she put you in you do three years ago some people from boston came to me with a onceinalifetime chance to get in on a land deal they were so goddamn smooth so well organized that i fell for their crap hook line and sinker i borrowed the money from the hospital expecting to pay it back in a matter of a week or two it it was the stupidest thing ive ever done frank knelt on one knee and forced a tremble into his voice i was so frightened so ashamed i frank you should have come to me i know that dad i know that now easy not too much not too thick but but youd already helped me out of that mess in concord and his voice broke as he stared down at his hands what did leigh baron say the judge asked say about the money oh well she was pretty reasonable all things considered you see ive been working on some dealsa second mortgage on the house the sale of that lot on winnipesaukeeand i can get together at least part of what i owe she understands that i meant to repay the money and that im probably out of a job so shes promised to put the matter to rest providing i can come up with the full amount in the next few weeks and can you i i can try how short are you frank struggled to mask his excitement i judge i want to handle this myself and just how do you expect to do that with a wife and two children and no job ill manage well manage ill catch on somewhere i may have made a stupid mistake but im still a damn good administrator the best thanks for saying that and leigh baron has promised that if you replace the money shell be off your back thats what she said how much judge please how much more do you need aabout a hundred thousand i see dad its my problem nonsense frank im very pleased with the way youre dealing with all this i was angry as hell at you but now i understand you made a mistake you admitted it and youre trying to make good thats all i could ever ask of you ill see to it that you get the money as soon as i get out of here but again frank stared down at his hands first mainwaring then leigh baron and now the judge himself no buts the judge went on you can pay me back when things get better believe me it will be worth it not to have to explain all of this to your mother judge i i dont know what to say well for starters you can stand up and promise me that as the administrator of davis regional hospital youll never let anything like this happen again slowly frank straightened up carefully monitoring every muscle of his face who says you cant have it all he was thinking no says you cant have it all and more you mean that he asked with just the right mix of incredulity and gratitude frank i dont think theres a single member of the board who wouldnt vote to retain youthat is provided youd agree to stay on finally frank allowed himself a smile i think ill be able to manage that he said now i think its time you got out of that chair and into a bed you look a little pale what room did they give you i asked for the third floor they gave me perfect the best in the house come on ill wheel you up frank pushed his father toward the elevator as they reached the corridor to the new wing he stopped listen judge he said if you dont mind waiting here for just a moment theres something i need to check on in my office no problem the judge said take your time the door to franks outer office was less than twenty feet away frank left the wheelchair against a wall crossed to the door and inserted the key at the same moment he realized there was no music coming from within henry flowers entered the corridor from the stairway shes not there mr iverson he said what frank felt a sudden vicious chill dr cole shes not there frank threw open the door revealing the gaping hole to his inner office shes in the intensive care unit with dr mainwaring and your brother the giant guard explained and you ought to be ashamed of the way no you tied her up and frank shoved the man aside and bolted past him nooo he bellowed again as he slammed through the stairway door two minutes seated beside toby nelmss bed zack mouthed the words and held two fingers in the beam of his penlight for jack pearl to see pearl nodded and let up on the serenyl infusion they had kept suzanne anesthe ized with the drug for nine minutes besides the cessation of all voluntary movement the only sign of any change had been an almost immediate drop in her pulse rate from to sixty and although it was now more than twelve minutes since the anesthe ic had been stopped she had not awakened rather than wait zack had decided to leave bernice rimmer in with her and to move on to toby the child too had responded to his anesthesia with a dramatic drop in pulse now he lay in the eerie darkness motionless except for the minute respiratory rise and fall of his chest beneath two thin blankets as zack monitored the surreal scene he struggled against the mounting foreboding that it was already too late for the boy and possibly for suzanne as well desperately he tried reminding himself that he was too tired and in far too much pain to maintain any semblance of a positive objective outlook perhaps it would take several hours to see any real change perhaps several days and perhaps he acknowledged it was better anyhow to expect the worst one minute he signaled with his flash and glanced about the unit mainwaring pearl suzanne toby it was all so bizarre so sad he had come back to sterling with such high hopes so many expectations thirty seconds never he vowed no more expectations he heard the doors to the darkened icu glide open then there were footsteps fifteen seconds he turned and peered through the darkness past mainwaring toward the doors just inside the glass he could see the silhouette of a woman in a business suit barreling past her was frank wake him up jack zack whispered urgently quick wake him up what in the hell is going on here frank bellowed turn these lights on turn them on right now jack pearl stepped back from tobys bed the plastic syringe slipped from his fingers and clattered to the floor just as the lights in the unit came on frank his fists balled at his side stood beside the nurses station youve been fired he snapped at zack get the fuck out of this hospital before i call the police no way frank frank turned to the unit secretary call security and then call the police tell them that a physician who has been fired from this hospital is refusing to leave the woman did not move do it beneath his tan frank was livid one nurse rushed to close the glass partitions to other patients rooms zack stepped from tobys cubicle to confront his brother frank listen he said shut up frank shouted looking wildly about leigh baron moved a few steps closer behind her a wheelchair appeared i tried to tell you frank jack pearl whined i tried to tell you we should have waited jack shut up we should have been doing a retrospective study goddamn you jack but you wouldnt listen you wouldnt give me a chance to fix my serenyl frank stepped forward and punched the anesthesiologist squarely in the face pearls head shot back blood sprayed across his face as he dropped to the floor franks fine features were twisted and distorted with rage get out he screamed all of you youre fired this is my hospital dammit youre all fired frank stop zack said quietly its over stop and listen youve done terrible things heresad and very terrible things frank dont you see look around look at all these people dont you see that its over for you now its over damn you frank shrieked as he hurtled over a chair and leapt at his brother ill kill you i swear ill fucking kill you the force of his attack sent both men smashing through the plate glass partition of an empty cubicle a nurse screamed zacks injured shoulder struck the floor exploding with nauseating pain dazed he rolled to one side over a mass of broken glass that cut into his arms and back he stumbled to his feet staggering drunkenly before his vision could clear frank was on him again snarling like an animal his hands viselike around zacks throat driving him backward powerless zacks arms went limp the pressure of franks thumbs against his windpipe was inexorable and he knew as he listened for the snap of his own larynx that he was going to die at the moment that his legs gave out he soiled himself the pain gave way and he sensed himself falling drifting then the back of his head slammed against the corner of the metal bedframe there was a blinding searing flash and then instantly there was nothing the light a soft warm glow washed over the darkness in waves one by one faces began floating through the void zack followed the images with a detached curiosity pleased when he was able to spot an old teacher or relative or classmate among them gradually the faces grew more definedand more current an anatomy professor at yale a wellesley coed fromfrom where a climbing partner in wyoming then annie doucette toby suzanne and finally frank his face pinched and crimson with hatred spinning through the glow like a dervish ill kill you ill kill you ill kill you ill kill you at first the voice was franks then it was zacks own moaning the words over and over again iverson iverson open your eyes its all right youve had a concussion concussion thats right iverson look up here zacks eyes fluttered and then opened for several seconds the face above him remained blurred then its features grew more distinct ormesby the surgeon nodded you hit your head youve been out for over an hour an hour suzanne he struggled to rise but quickly fell back easy iverson easy ormesby put a calming hand on his arm zacks thoughts began to clear he was in bed on a monitor in the intensive care unit an iv was draining into his arm did i have a seizure from what i hear you did probably from the concussion the ct scanners warmed up and waiting for us right now dont need one iverson youre the patient here not the doctor got that ive changed my mind about your being a nut case dont make me change it back zack nodded meekly his bead was throbbing and jabs of pain were beginning to spark from half a dozen other places on his body the discomfort helped clear his mind suzanne he said did she right there iverson just turn your head to the right through a brief machinegun burst zack did as the surgeon asked suzanne wrapped in a blanket her fv on a transport pole waved at him from a chair not four feet away she looked pale but otherwise seemed none the worse for her ordeal hi doc she said you come here often god bless you clarkin zack murmured what oh nothing hows toby still out zack but hes lighter i think he may be coming around but its hard to tell the people from boston are due here any minute to get him behind suzanne near the nurses station zack could see the judge watching intently listen ormesby said im going to get them ready for your scan afterward i have a few dozen stitches to put in you my shoulder i think its we know sam christians already seen you now just relax will you wheres frank in jail by now i would guess you owe that big guard over there a hell of a thankyou iverson apparently everyone was sort of paralyzed if he hadnt pulled frank off you when he did i think your ticketmight have been canceled bless you henry zack rasped rubbing at the soreness in his neck now just stay put ill be back stay put zack echoed he waited until the surgeon had left and then reached over for suzannes hand she inched her chair closer to him sorry i cant get up she said i get dizzy when i try why dont you go back to bed well talk later you okay i feel like shit if you want to know the truth but im okay fucking frank nearly killed us both almost but its over now zack what time is it anyway two almost two damn what is it the board meeting do you know what happened there she squeezed his hand i think your father wants to talk to you about that ill see you after your test sure meanwhile stay away from the radio suzanne smiled not to worry she said sooner or later though im going to have to um face the music she motioned to bernice rimmer who brought a wheelchair over took her iv pole and wheeled her from the room moments later the judge appeared at zacks bedside you were right about my legs he said im glad zachary dont feel bad about frank i do judge he hurt a lot of people hes very sick i know he stole a great deal of money from the hospital apparently this business with jack pearl and that mainwaring was an attempt to replace it lord i found out about it for sure yesterday but ive suspected he was in trouble for some time frank never could put anything over on me i i just dont know where he could have gone so wrong try at birth zack wanted to say he looked at the bewilderment in his fathers face and knew that there was no percentage in responding judge the board meeting he said did you go i went they had already voted to sell out but i had just enough time to turn things around after the vote frank had the temerity to ask me if we might keep him on as administrator much as it hurt me i told him absolutely not great zack said with no enthusiasm he should have known better than to try and hide the truth from me he was always trying he never could i have no tolerance for his kind of deceit no tolerance at all he sighed i had such hopes for him i gave your brother every chance zachary every chance you know that dont you zack closed his eyes and instantly he was on the slalom run tumbling over and over again down the snqwy mountainside his knee screaming with pain the accident had eliminated him from competitive sports and it seemed from much of his fathers interest as well at the time it was the worst thing that had ever happened to him now he could see it well might have been his salvation of course you did judge he said looking away of course you did epilogue as if they could quantitate a miracle leaf by leaf the meteorologists had proclaimed october the peak day of the foliage season in north central new hampshire and in fact as the daya wednesdayevolved with acre upon acre of crimson orange burgundy and gold sparkling beneath a cloudless azure sky not even those oldtimers who always had a different opinion of such things could argue in the small atriumlike auditorium of the holiday inn of sterling sunlight streamed through glass panels bathing the hundred or so hospital officials board members and physicians in a warmth that made the northern new england winter seem still remote throughout the hall there was an air of excitement and history they had come together from communities across the northern part of the state and had met for three days around conference tables and in back rooms hammering out the framework of a new consortium of hospitals now in minutes the fruits of those efforts would be presented to the gathering and a new era in community medicine would begin the hospitals involvedseven in allwould be banded together in a way that would give them enormous purchasing power without the sacrifice of one bit of autonomy judge clayton iverson his wife at his side wandered about the milling crowd exchanging greetings and handshakes with the other attendees most of whom knew that he was about to be announced as the first chairman of the board of the consortium his selection for the post had been virtually unanimous the search committee had established experience and absolute integrity as the prime qualifications for the post and through his handling of the davis regionalultramed disaster the judge had proven himself amply endowed with both most impressive to the group had been the judges refusal to intervene in the trial and sentencing of his son frank on myriad charges ranging from coconspiracy in testing the unauthorized drug serenyl to assault with intent to murder then there was his handling of the surgeon jason mainwaring after demanding and obtaining the surrender of mainwarings medical license the judge had gotten the charges against the man diminished in exchange for the liquidation of his pharmaceutical company from the proceeds a fund would be set up to aid those patients found to have been harmfully affected by the anesthe ic and finally there was the leadership role he had played in the reclamation of davis regional hospital from ultramed not only had the judge supervised the transition back to community control but dissatisfied with the amount raised from the sale of mainwarings beleaguered drug firm he had convinced the ultramed directors of the sagacity of augmenting the serenyl settlement fund with a multimilliondollar contribution of their own though he was constantly smiling and seemed relaxed in between handshakes the judge continued to glance toward the doors at the rear of the hall do you see him cinnie asked no you did speak to his girlfriend didnt you yes dear i did i told her you had been selected and asked her to try and convince zachary to be here for the announcement a nd and she said shed try but that she doubted he would come she drew him off to one side away from the crowd clayton please she said theres still time please reconsider this and lets go to florida just for the winter no but why lisette has moved away with the girls and zachary almost never comes by anymore we havent had a sunday dinner in i dont know how long we have friends down there i clayton i dont want to spend another winter here please absolutely not zachary will come around youll see i dont know hes been so distant since that terrible business with frank i ask him why almost evcry time we speak and all he ever says is that there are things he has to work out he says hes not even sure yet that hes going to stay in sterling oh hell stay hes moved in with that suzanne does that sound like hes planning to leave no she said no i suppose it doesnt take your seats everybody please take your seats the conference chairperson announced tapping on her microphone this is what youve all been waiting for hell be here cynthia the judge said youll see his brother never appreciated the things i did for him but in the end zachary will hell be here to share this clayton please no and not another word about it ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to officially announce the birth of the northern new hampshire community hospital consortium there was a burst of applause again the judge turned toward the rear doors face it clayton cinnie said hes not coming damn him clayton muttered the ungrateful damn them both and as our first order of business i would like to introduce to you the man chosen by our search committee to head our new consortium he is a man of accomplishment and integrity a man known to many in this room for his tireless work on behalf of his community and his hospital he is a devoted man dedicated uncompromisingly to the principles of fairness six miles south of the holiday inn resting on the deserted field known as the meadows the engine of a crimson model plane screeched to life a young boy raced across the golden autumn grass hand in hand with a young girl jennifer wants to learn zack he said clutching the radio control box can i show her all by myself can i show her how to fly it how about another quick coin trick first oh noi mean how about later on zack she really wants to learn zack leaned back on his elbows and breathe in the fragrant mountain air then he turned to suzanne and brushed his lips against her ear i think the kids got a crush on your daughter he whispered so it would seem she replied toby do you have a license to fly that thing a what nothing nothing can i zack the boy asked again sure kiddo zack said of course you can with jennifer cole watching intently toby nelms eased back on the tiny control stick instantly the fleet shot forward across the field and up into the perfect noonday sky
