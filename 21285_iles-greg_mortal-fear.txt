lap long enough to get it done all mistakes are mine prologue dear father we landed in new orleans yesterday evening a humid city flat low dispersed a single grouping of tall buildings in the distance the taxi driver was a cajun surprisingly a thin brown wrinkled man rather like getting a chinese cabbie in chinatown i expected an eastern european as i see everywhere else he kept glancing into the rearview mirror as we passed through a town he called metrya place where the whites once fled to escape da niggas now they flee across lake pontchartrain i worked at the computer in my lap but kept an ear open to his words night descended over a rising moon as we swept onto an elevated section of freeway and passed the superdome kali must have been a black shadow to him beside me in the backseat a shadow with bright black eyes she wanted to kill the driver i could feel it in her handbag the scarfsacred weapon i see an image in her mind he stops at a traffic light as we descend the ramp to the lower world of surface streets she slips the noose around his throat and silently steals his life i lay a hand lightly on her wrist and feel a twitch that verifies my sense she is ready i know that if i slide my hand beneath her sari i will find her moist she lives for these nights i hope the security is no tighter than i expect i slide my hand beneath her sari she is wet burning time is fire so opposite we are so perfectly opposite i understand restraint control the defiance of it kali understands only being she lets her head loll back on the car seat black eyes glittering beneath halfclosed lids i move my hand as we descend the ramp onto poydras possibly saving the drivers life we move toward canal and the french quarter kali climaxes soundlessly the driver smells her pungent fierce i see alertness in the back of his neck the angle of his head his eyes dart to the rearview mirror a whore he wonders kali smiles at him in the mirror there is death in her smile death that a man might walk willingly into she is startlingly beautiful and so she should be you paid her father good money for her we exited the taxi at galatoires entered the restaurant then left and changed cabs twice again tiresome but effective security was heavy at the mansion but no worse than i had expected a small army as befits an american cult figure bodyguards hired from godknowswhat agencyprobably some outfit run by an expoliceman who swilled jax on the job for twenty years the ironwork of the fence was exquisite the french influence i let my right hand graze the points as we moved along it they would bruise me i knew but i felt fit almost reckless the grillwork matched that on the secondstory balconies quaint the street was crowded with all manner of tourists gawkers most of them i inclined my head as we passed the gate guards one nodded slightly glanced at my briefcase the other followed kali with his eyes even the billowing sari could not hide the hard contours of her body after we turn the corner she asked if the crowd thins when we turned the corner the crowd melted away as though scattered by a stage manager kali bunched up her sari and was over the ironwork in seconds into the palm fronds and banana trees i was more careful i passed the briefcase through the bars then worked my way over we stood together in the dripping trees looking at the floodlit face of the mansion solid stonework like an outbuilding of versailles kalis hand dropped to my distended zipper she lightly squeezed me a nurse checking a pulse i shivered we must wait a short intake of breath how long i crouched in the tenebrous foliage booted up the computer and logged back onto eros shes still at her computer shes searching for me then let her find you i shut off the computer and put it back into the case the rightmost upper window i said recalling the photocopied blueprints that the archives so dutifully sent me now crossing the open ground between fence and mansion was daunting for me for kali nothing she believes we are invisible in such moments less than shadows we are our intent i opened my briefcase beneath the side balcony kali took out the rope and hurled the rubberized hook over the ironwork of the balcony rail she climbs like a thief i tossed up the briefcase a rape kit police would call it but it is so much more i came prepared for resistance but the french doors on the balcony were open so often it happens that way evil is an invited guest kali pulled the rope up after us we moved up the hallway together thick carpeting conditioned air whispering out of the ceiling somewhere the regular groan of a ceiling fan slowly turning i followed the groan it led us to the master bedroom kali took up her post beside the door i see it again and again fate unraveling into chaos i open the door as softly as possible the patient is seated before her computer her back to me she wears a long flowing garment like something from one of her early novels you should tape a penny to one of the blades to stop that noise i want to say but i dont instead i say i have come karin the chair tips onto the carpet as she bounds out of it in voiceless terror her eyes mostly white behind her glasses she is heavier than her publicity pictures the eyes dart to my exposed hand searching for a knife or a gun but it is empty how did you get in she whispers i do not dignify this whwho are you prometheus her eyes widen beyond the point i believe possible but i was just she looks back at her computer how it is not important i have come for you at last to give you what you most desire she stares her brain obviously thrumming behind the glassy eyes how do you have a car for us she asks finally i thought you might call for one of yours yes she says much too quickly if youll just let me get some things no she freezes near her bedside table her eyes dart downward then back to my face it is breaking down kali was right fantasy and reality are alternate universes i come to save but who can grasp great purpose with vision clouded by terror my hopes crash around me like shattered icons i slip my right hand behind my back and grip the butt of the pistol karin i plead offering one last chance then her mask cracks revealing her panic as she stabs a hand at the bedside table i see a button there an alarm i have no choice but to fire the feathers of the dart bloom in the midline just above where her navel must be the patient looks down with animal incomprehension and pulls out the dart but it is much too late for that then she runs the brave ones usually do she runs right at me not actually at me but toward me because i stand between her and the door i let her run past me she gasps i turn kali stands in the doorway faithful kali saffron sari nutbrown skin jet hair blacker eyes she holds a dagger wickedly curved a fearsome instrument simple effective in two dimensions the physical and the psychological the patient turns to me for some explanation how powerfully her heart must be beating kali i say regretting every moment the patient starts at the sound of kali closing the door watches the young woman move lithely across the floor with my briefcase like a dark angel kali sets the case on the floor then stands and unfastens her sari it falls to the carpet leaving her utterly naked i watch the patient trying to work out what is happening as the ketamine cocktail courses through her system why is the indian woman undressing just before she loses consciousness she might work it out that kali is undressing to keep her clothes free of blood i must disrobe as well but first i walk to the computer log off type a few commands and shut off the machine then i return to the patient kneel and open my briefcase whats in there she asks dully sitting down on the floor my instruments i lift a stainless steel rongeur from the case and try to smile but my heart is a black hole the patient has done enough research for her novels to recognize the rongeur in blind panic she breaks once more for the door scrambling on all fours like an infant but kali channels her flat onto her stomach i watch silently until i see the dagger flash and press against the patients throat dont dare i say alarmed by the blood lust in her eyes command rises into my throat strip her we took our time with the patient we could afford to as karin allowed no guards inside the mansion but our options were limited how i longed to spend myself within that still body but of course it was impossible this time i forced kali to be careful to get no blood on her feet after she finished and i had collected my specimen we retired to the shower genuine marble we wear rubber caps to keep as many hairs as possible out of the drain trap the blood slipped off our shaved skin and swirled on the white stone at last i could allow myself release selfcontrol is so important kali knelt before me in the hot spray i had held back so long that neither her expertise nor her diligence were required she swallowed every drop of evidence as she must she may have left traces of her own arousal but what will the police make of that they will be confused enough as it is as we stole out of the estate carrying not only the briefcase but also the rubber bag now filled i recalled the patient so much potential there for my work for public relations all lost and for what more homogenate but i must not dwell on failure great souls rejoice in adversity tomorrow is another day chapter life is simple the more complicated you believe yours is the less you know of your true condition for a long time i did not understand this now i do you are hungry or you are full you are healthy or you are sick you are faithful to your wife or you are not you are alive or you are dead i am alive we complain about complexity about moral shades of gray but we take refuge in these things complexity offers refuge from choice and thus from action in most situations most of us would prefer to do nothing sic transit gloria mundi something is wrong i stare at the phone number of the new orleans police department which i have just taken down from directory assistance i have known something is wrong for some time at some level but it took what happened today to make me face it squarely to override the opposition i have information about the karin wheat murder i say when the call goes through ill connect you to homicide says a female voice i glance up from my desk to the small color television i keep tuned to cnn sixteen hours a day theyre into the international hour it was cnn that brought me news of the murder detective mozingo says a male voice i have information relevant to the karin wheat case whats your name harper cole address im calling from rain mississippi a pause where its a farming area in the delta how do you know anything about the wheat case the body was just discovered six hours ago i saw it on cnn they cut into a regular newscast to show wheats estate i guess she was more famous than i thought i hear the detective sigh and mutter something that sounds like freakin high profile away from the phone are you working on that case i ask him no thank god mayeuxs got it but ill take the information what do you think you know i think i know how she was killed we know how she was killed sir nowadays i dont trust anyone who calls me sir im sorry i mean how the killer got to her how hechose her another silence a suspicious one its sort of complicated i tell him i work as a sysopim sorry a system operatorfor an online computer service are you familiar with what that is not really the detective says warily youve heard of america online compuserve yeah the internet right close enough the online service i work for is called eros it deals exclusively with sex you mean like phone sex jesus maybe i should wait and talk to detectivemayeux was it yeah hes still at the scene though just give me what youve got and mozingo is still talking but i am no longer listening i am staring astonished into the face of a man that the cnn caption line identifies as nopd detective michael mayeux his shirt drenched with sweat he stands beside the tall black wroughtiron gate of the mansion that belonged to karin wheat i recognize it from the earlier broadcast the sidewalk before the gate is cordoned off with bright yellow police tapes but against the tapes stand at least a hundred people ranging in age from fifteen to fifty more women than men fans detective mayeux looks irritably at a black female reporter and says i cant comment on that at this time he is a tanned man of medium height in his early forties maybe ten pounds overweight the reporter thrusts the mike into his face what about the reports that ms wheats body was sexually mutilated mayeux looks pained i can categorically deny that charvel he says seeming to brighten as disappointment flickers in her eyes are you there barks a voice in my ear im here i murmur watching mayeux motion for a patrolwoman to keep the crowd back im watching the guy right now what guy your guy mayeux theyre showing him live on cnn right this second christ he gets all the face time listen i say deciding i like mayeuxs look better than mozingos voice does detective mayeux have voice mail the detective covers the phone with his palm and then shouts something ill transfer you a digital female voice tells me i can leave a message as long as ten minutes my name is harper cole i say slowly im calling from mississippi then i stop i cant just leave my name and number with a murder like this one on his hands mayeux might not get around to calling me for days i say my phone number twice then pause and gather my thoughts im calling because i think this murderthe karin wheat murdermay be connected to some other not murders but possible murders i guess i work as a system operator for an online computer servicea national servicecalled eros over the past few months ive noticed that some women have left the network abruptly for unexplained reasons they could have simply terminated service but i dont think they did the company wouldnt want me to call you like this but i felt i had to its too complicated to explain to a machine but im afraid something may have happened to those other women as well something like what happened to karin wheat i think maybe the same person could be involved you see karin wheat was a client of eros thats confidential information by the way you wont understand until you talk to me id appreciate a call as soon as possible im always home i work from here and i stay up pretty late thanks on tv mayeux has disappeared from the wroughtiron gate the crowd is larger than before the camera pans across several male faces painted with eye shadow and eyeliner disciples of karin wheats esoteric prose a blackandwhite photo of the author appears filling onefourth of the screen its the publicity shot from her latest book i recognize it because i have that novelisison one of my bookshelves i bought it after i began having online conversations with karin very interesting conversations karin wheat was a twisted lady i get up from the desk and go to my minifridge for an icecold tab i use them to break the monotony of diet coke not only do they pack a more powerful fizz rush but i actually like the stuff ive drunk half the can by the time i sit down at my gateway price quotes from the chicago mercantile exchange scroll slowly down the screen this is my real job trading futures bonds indexes even agriculturals i do it from my house with only my own money keeps it simple no suicidal clients to deal with im holding a ten lot of sp contracts right now but nothings in crisis mode i swig some more tab and glance across at the postmodern black table that supports the eros computer and satellite video link its late afternoon and online traffic is light mostly housewives right now bodiceripper stuff the real freaks are on their way home from work my wife should be as well today shes working in jackson the state capital eighty minutes away from our farmhouse in the flat delta cotton fields drewe is a doctor three blessed years out of her residency and the same age i amthirtythree im thinking i should start cooking us some supper when the phone rings hello this is detective michael mayeux nopd his voice has the radio tinniness that cell phones arent supposed to have but usually do thanks for calling back so fast just checked my voice mail he explains ive got twentyeight nutcase calls already vampires killed her mummies one guy claims hes an incubus and that he killed her so why did you call me you sounded slightly less nutty than the rest you said you were calling from mississippi thats right erosthe company i sysop foris based in new york city but i do my job from right here im listening mr cole you know what online services are sure aol compuserve delphi but your message didnt give me the feeling were talking about people using muds or booking vacations by modem no youre right i tell him relieved to have found someone who doesnt need spoonfeeding so whats this eros live chat email roleplaying all that stuff exactly my kids a computer fiend i log onto compuserve every now and then im no expert though keep it at the idiot level thats my natural level detective i told your machine that karin wheat was a member of eros and you said it was confidential information it is i mean according to the rules of the membership agreement legally were forbidden to give out any clients true identity there are a lot of married people online with us who dont want their spouses to know quite a few celebrities too but you gave me wheats name i wanted you to know how serious i am hang oncut over to chartres harry im back mr cole you said you thought wheats death might be connected to some other women disappearances or something right what id like to dofor now at leastis give you the names of those women and see if you can check them out on the sly sort of you can do that right mayeux doesnt answer for a moment you mean check and see if theyre alive right yeah we can do that but why havent you done that if youre so concerned you have their phone numbers dont you yes and i thought about doing it but frankly i was told not to by who someone in the company look can you just take the names maybe im nuts but id feel better okay shoot i read the names and numbers from a notepad mayeux repeats them as i give them i assume he is speaking into a pocket recorder thats five different states he notes six women five states spread across the country information superhighway i remind him no shit well ill get back to you if anything comes of this gotta go mr cole time to talk to the fairies and the vampires the conversation leaves me strangely excited after weeks of suspicion i have finally done something i am tempted to call miles in manhattan and tell him exactly what ive done but i dont if miles turner turns out to be rightif all those women have slipped contentedly back into the roles of happy housewives or fulfilled career womenthen i dont want to give him the satisfaction but if i turn out to be rightif those women are less than healthy right now im not sure i want miles to know i know that this realization shocks me a little i have known miles turner for more than twenty years since grade school he was eccentric then and during the last fifteen yearssince he left mississippi for mit in i have seen very little of him it was miles who got me working for eros in the first place but i cant blame him i was a willing faust hearing the solid doorchunk of drewes acura outside i hunch low over the keyboard of the gateway assuming the posture that announces to my wife that i have been manically trading commodities contracts for the last eight hours who were you talking to on the phone she calls from the hallway busted during her commute she must have tried me on her cellular she often does as the sight of summer cotton fields lazing by the car windows gets monotonous after the first ten seconds or so drewe leans into my office pointedly refusingas she has done for the last few weeksto enter the domain of the eros computer my wife like many wives is jealous of my time but there is more to this conflict than a wife and a computer eros is not merely a computer but the nexus of a network of five thousand people half of them women who spend quite a bit of their waking hours thinking about sex i picked up some chicken breasts drewe says arching her eyebrows like a comic french chef great i say give me a minute and ill get them going its not that drewe doesnt think about sex she does and its not that she doesnt enjoy sex she does that too its just that lately she has begun thinking about sex in a whole new way as a means to an end by that i mean its natural end children she smiles childless at thirtythree drewe still possesses the tightness of skin and muscle of a woman in her twenties her breasts are still high her face free of wrinkles save laugh lines i love this about her i know how selfish it is wanting to preserve her physical youth but part of me wants that her hair is auburn her skin fair her eyes green her beauty is not that of a fashion model her younger sister erin was the model nor the pampered aerobicized overly madeup elegance of a young junior leaguer drewes distinctive allure emanates from her eyes not only the eyes themselves which are deep set and clear but from her brows which are finely curved yet strong like the ribs of a ship what emanates from her eyes is pure intelligence cool quantitative uncommon sense drewe cole is smart her smile widens to a pixie grinsomething i havent seen much latelyand then she heads off for the kitchen i take a last look at the chicago figures and follow our house would be something of a curiosity to anyone not born into a farm family it began seventyfive years ago as a square onestory structure just large enough to shelter my maternal grandfather and grandmother who married at the ages of nineteen and sixteen respectively and the first children they expected but as the farm prospered and more children arrived my grandfather began adding on roomsfirst with a doggedly logical symmetry later apparently anywhere he could most easily tack them on the result is something like a wooden house of cards built by an eightyearold moving from room to room often involves a sudden stepping up or down to a slightly different elevation though since i grew up in this house i no longer sense these changes consciously the heart of the house is the kitchen it is a long room and too narrow i once thought of tearing out a wall and expanding it but a black carpenter friend told me that since the entire house seemed held to this core by some form of redneck magic id do better to enjoy rubbing asses with my wife whenever we passed between the stove and the opposite counter at the same time that turned out to be good advice are we richer or poorer today drewe asks from the sink she is already rinsing off the chicken about even i say taking a heavy castiron skillet out of the oven and laying it on a hot gas burner her question is perfunctory the truth is that with ten contracts in play which is about average for me these days i could onlyin the absolute worst contingencylose about fifty thousand dollars this would not seriously affect us i am good at my real job save any lives today i ask my question is not perfunctory drewe is an obgyn she delivers the babies that my father a family practitioner would have delivered thirty years ago she doesnt usually deal with car accidents or shootings but she often handles traumatic births she answers my question with a quick shake of her head and plops the chicken breasts into the sizzling skillet i am peppering them liberally when she asks what about erox she has purposefully botched the acronym pronouncing it as a disc jockey would erocks eros stands for erotic realtime online stimulation drewe substitutes the x to emphasize the prurient nature of the network nine months ago she did not do this she was as fascinated by the forum as i was and our sex life had blossomed with her fascination nine months ago she spoke of eros in a tone befitting the greek god of love and desire now it ranks just above phone sex barely something really bad happened i tell her drewe looks up from a can of lesueur peas with apprehension in her eyes family she is thinking who died karin wheat was murdered last night her eyes widen the author new orleans karin wheat i nod it was on cnn you believe that sure anybody whos had movies made of their booksand has fans as weird as she doesis bound to rate some national airtime i bet itll be on hard copy in an hour shes probably right should i watch i know from experience that facts will be sparse and titillation rampant on the other hand drewe cant stand more than ten minutes of crossfire you sound really upset she says eyeing me with genuine concern i look away for a moment disguising my mental stocktaking with an appraising glance at the chicken how much to tell she was on eros i say not wanting to sound guilty but knowing i do what why didnt you tell me i look up some defiance in my eyes you havent wanted to hear anything about eros for months drewe karin only joined a few weeks ago she lifts her chin and studies me so its karin she says finally youve talked to her online sure the usual sysop guidance please she fits the pea can into the opener and drowns any reply with a grinding flourish i go back to the chicken have you had sex with her online she asks not looking at me i sigh angrily the woman is dead drewe jesus she says and dumps the peas into a pot i should be on hard copy my husband fucks famous females electronically i surrender drewe is even angrier about eros than i thought do they know who did it she asks in a deadpan voice no i flip the chicken breasts but i think i might chapter drewe and i watch hard copy with a mixture of fascination and disgust dramatic camera angles sexual innuendo and spooky blackandwhite video of karin wheats new orleans mansion complete with artificially generated fog give the broadcast a victorian jacktheripper feel drewe does not comment as the segment runs and i find myself rehashing my dinnertable interrogation i answered her incisive questions between bites of chicken and dirty rice taking care not to set her off by revealing more than necessary she wanted to know why i would even notice six women terminating service among five thousand subscribers i focused on the technical side of it explaining that these six women had been active users who suddenly disappeared from the forums yet continued paying their eros fees which are expensive by anyones standard i mentioned nothing about blinddraft accounts or my close relationships with some of the women thankfully drewe focused on miles turner and his successful attempt to prevent me from initiating an internal investigation by eros itself she too has known miles since our childhood he based his objections to an investigation on the issue of privacyclient confidentiality in his wordsand his argument holds water the female ceo of eros is serious enough about privacy to insure the secrecy of each subscribers identity to one million dollars this unique step in the world of online services went a long way to ensure the exponential growth of her small and costly corner of the digital world i can only guess what kind of explosion my decision to involve the police will cause at eros headquarters in new york when hard copy cuts to commercial drewe commandeers the kitchen table and telephone to remotely dictate the past few days accumulation of medical charts for some reason patient charts are the one duty my superorganized spouse cannot or will not deal with in a timely manner the colorcoded stacks she brings home from her office are often covered with threatening postit notes penned by the hospital records administrator warning in draconian tones that drewes staff privileges are about to be revoked as her monotonic dictation voice drifts through the house i retreat to my office and pick up one of the five guitars hanging on the wall above the twin bed i crash on when im in manic trading mode i choose a martin ds with a classicalwidth neck but steel strings i slip through some chord changes without thought letting my mind and fingers run where they will the music would surprise a casual listener i am a good guitar player not quite a natural but smooth enough to make a living at it this is my old job i am a failed musician the memories of that career still sting i pick up the instrument more often now but three years ago i did not touch a guitar or sing for twelve straight months even now i never play my own songs i just do what im doing now letting whatever part of my brain that controls this function have free rein and set my mood on automatic pilot sometimes i surprise myself like now i have somehow wound a soft jazz thing full of arpeggios and chord extensions into the intro of still crazy after all these years i realize i love the sneaky seventh at the end of that line i met my oold lover on the street last nightwhang what the hell i think singing on through the song and ending up quite unintentionally with potential murder now i sit by my window and i watch the cars and i fear ill do some damage one fine day but i would not be convicted by a jury of my peers as i finish to a nonexistent ovation i realize drewe is standing inside the door of my office its her first time in six weeks sounds good she says really good it feels good thinking about an old lover no a jury of my peers where do you think they all went she smiles ruefully they grew up got married and had kids like most men i have blindly blundered back into our running argument having a baby i suppose a lot of couples our age are in the midst of this debate up north and out west anyway down south most couples still tend to have their kids in their twenties not us our careers are partly to blame itinerant musicians and exhausted medical students are rarely in an ideal position to start a family even if they are married which drewe and i werent until i gave up music but thats not all of it for the past three yearsour total married lifewe have led a fairly settled existence and our combined incomes are almost embarrassingly large my parents are dead but drewes recently crossed the line from gentle jibes to outright questioning of my reproductive capabilities if only my sperm count were the problem like a lot of people i have my secrets some are small born in moments when i could have been painfully frank but chose not to be others are more serious and invariably involve women other than my wife dont jump to conclusions from the moment drewe and i took our marriage vows i have not touched another womans naked flesh but somehow that is small comfort for the secret that haunts me now is more dangerous than adultery more shameful if i were catholic i suppose i would call it a mortal sin no im not gay but i am afraid when the telephone finally rings drewe and i have been asleep for hours i spring awake in a sitting position like one of my scottish ancestors groping for his sword but find a cordless phone in my hand instead hello mr cole i blink trying to clear my eyes and brain simultaneously um what this is detective michael mayeux nopd we spoke this afternoon drewes sleeping body blocks my line of sight to the clock radio what time is it threetwenty in the morning sorry but i just got around to checking those names you gave me those six women sure i sense a strange gravity in mayeuxs voice harper drewe sits up in bed and points at the window theres someone outside look prickly flesh rises on my shoulders as i realize that our curtains are being backlit by what must be car headlights we never have visitors at this hour we rarely have visitors at all stay here i tell her ill get a gun please dont do that mr cole mayeuxs voice startles me if youll look out your window i think youll see a patrol car cairo county doesnt have a police department i say moving warily toward the window part of your farm is in yazoo county mayeux replies that should be sheriff buckner from yazoo city know him i know who he is parting the curtains slightly i see a white chevrolet caprice cruiser sitting in the gravel drive before our house what the hell is he doing in my driveway at three in the morning calm down mr cole sheriff buckner is there to ensure your safety rightwhy dont i believe that detective he is silent too long i signal drewe not to speak what the hell is going on mayeux those women you told me about theyre all dead there is sweat on my face an instant ago it was not there i feel it in my hair on my forearms behind my knees that small intuitive part of me that always suspected the worst has taken possession of my body i was right i was right and i should have acted sooner all six of them i ask my voice barely audible every one was murdered in the last nine months mr cole and ive got to tell you there are a lot of people around the country right nowpolice officerswho want to talk to you about those women i do not even try to convert the chemical cyclone in my brain into coherent words only two of those murders had been connected before tonight mr cole they were both in california i close my eyes juliet nicholson tara morgan what wed like you to do mayeux says in a friendly voice if youre not busy tomorrow that isis drive down to the main station here in new orleans and talk to us what do you say to that i look back through the window sheriff buckners cruiser is still there idling low and catlike in the humid darkness you think i killed them i say in a monotone again mayeux pauses too long to tell you the truth mr cole we dont know what to think ive been telling people that you called me with this information and that if youre the one who murdered them youd be the last one to do that damn right on the other hand some people tell me that things like that have happened before a lot more than youd think is this one of those strange cases mr cole i was stupid to call you i say meaning it miles was right miles who mayeuxs tone telegraphs an image of him holding a pen over a notebook do i need a lawyer detective what drewe gets out of bed and hurries to the closet for a housecoat take it easy mayeux says my gut tells me youre just joe citizen in this thing trying to do whats right and getting tangled up in the process that happens more often than it should ill tell you right now if you want a lawyer you bring one along with you he pauses a beat but if you want my advice id save the money we just want to know what you know mr cole if youve got nothing to hide you dont need a lawyer mayeuxs voice drops in volume besides first impressions are important youll look a lot more innocent to certain people if you dont have a lawyer from the getgo one things for sure detective michael mayeux didnt just float into new orleans on a shrimp boat he is very good at getting people to do what he wants them to do this is a talent that i share and i note the fact like a fighter noting the strength of a potential opponent i suppose you expect me to ride down with sheriff buckner no sir bring your own car fly a crop duster whatever you want just try to make it before noon youve got a very anxious audience down here i make a rapid decision listen detective no way am i going to fall back asleep after this call im going to talk to my wife then get dressed and drive straight down there the sooner im out of all this the better ill feel good answer mr cole see you in about five hours ill be waiting for you by the time i finish explaining the situation to drewe sheriff buckners cruiser has quietly disappeared my wife wants to accompany me to new orleans but i talk her out of it for one thing she has patients scheduled for another i am not sure how deeply the questions of the police will probe i doubt any man would want his life examined microscopically in the presence of his wife but lately one of my secrets like the old shotgun pellet in my calf has worked its way nearer and nearer the surface one question with the right edge could slice right through i consider calling miles in new york to tell him what is afoot then discard the idea on this point drewe and i agree by revealing the name of an eros client to the police i have almost certainly exposed myself to a lawsuit i reassure myself that my perception of lethal danger to other eros clients justified this breach but in s america who is to say jan krislov the fiftysixyearold widow who owns eros is a nationally known advocate for the right to privacy she also has more money than god better lawyers anyway yet beneath this anxiety flows a deeper sense of reservation drewe feels it as well early in our lives miles turner and i were almost like brothers then for many years we hardly saw each other not quite a year ago he came back into my life brought me into eros expand your horizons said my own personal mephistopheles arent you tired of making money yet challenge yourself its more fun than youve had since we talked our babysitter into taking off her bra i am not having fun now chapter dear father we landed in michigan in the afternoon so gray after the decadent green of new orleans as gray as our fatigue my joints ached constantly we had to fly through the black heart of a storm i varied the transport this time and the technique i learned from my mistake with karin how disconcerting to recognize naivete in oneself even after years of cynicism i was drunk with anticipation our seduction had been a long and baroque one a progression from the sacred to the profane i sat on the patients patio with the notebook and the cell phone knowing she believed she was interacting with a man thousands of miles distant a faceless lover and me sitting less than twenty feet away i crept to her window and watched her typing her responses kali stroked me as i watched spilling my seed in the flower bed will the fbi look there i wonder for footprints yes for semen no they will find that where they expect to find it but of course it will not be mine i could not resist telling rosalind i was there there was no risk she could not call the police while linked to eros and kali was already inside terror was absolute paralyzing kali demonstrated exemplary control reassuring after the blood lust of new orleans and this time i left a note a passage you read me long ago i have reached the limits of endurance my back is to the wall i can retreat no further i have found god but he is insufficient i am only spiritually dead physically i am alive morally i am free the world which i have departed is a menagerie the dawn is breaking on a new world a jungle world in which the lean spirits roam with sharp claws if i am a hyena i am a lean and hungry one i go forth to fatten myself i know i know but im tired of leaving biological refuse why not mislead with a little flair you of all people should appreciate that this is just the kind of rot they salivate over at quantico it will be the only file written in french but nevertheless i signed it henri subtlety is wasted on the police by the time they translate it the procedure will be complete the lab work tonight a day to collect the next patient another to rest my joints to steady my fingers then i cut my way into valhalla chapter three hours of hard driving put me over the louisiana state line with dawn breaking over my left shoulder and new orleans seventy miles ahead the last two hundred miles were a slowmotion strobe of darkness and glaring truckstop light on any other night i would have taken highway not many people do these days they choose speed over scenery as i was forced to do tonight i runs straight as a pipeline and most travelers on it never give a thought to the older more indirect arteries that lie just to the west highway a blacktop track of history lined with scorched chimneys like sentinels guarding unquiet land and beyond the levee the aorta of the continent the milewide tide of river that ran before man set foot here and will run long after he is gone but in this breaking dawn i can afford only the straightest distance between two points on the passenger seat beside me sits a briefcase full of laserprinted papertranscripts of the killer seducing his victimsand my best hope of absolution in the matter of the six dead women seven i think remembering karin wheat at la place i jump down onto i for the final twentyminute run into new orleans the august sun is fully up now past eight oclock and the shallow soupy water of the bonnet carre spillway simmers under its lidless gaze cranking down the explorers windows i catch an airborne wave of decaying water plants and fish from lake pontchartrain during the past four hours i have recalled every step on the mental path that led me to this physical journey what the police hope to learn from me i am not sure but the most sensitive question for me is this why didnt i report my suspicions sooner i am not quite sure myself i can only hope that what i have to say will shock the police sufficiently to divert them from that question at least for a while locating the main new orleans police station is easy its near drewes alma mater the tulane medical school just behind the orleans parish criminal court building locating detective michael mayeux is easier still homicide is on the third floor the moment i mention my name to the desk sergeantwho sits behind a window of armored glassi am whisked through a heavy door through a squad room down a corridor and into a small office mayeux is seated at a scarred and cluttered metal desk speaking urgently into a wire telephone the office has no windows it does have a computer an overcrowded bookshelf and enshrined in the single clearing amid the chaos a coffeemaker a torn red sack of community dark roast with chicory sits on top of it help you mayeux asks hanging up the phone and taking a bite from a sugardusted beignet i hadnt noticed im harper cole he freezes in midbite then sets down the beignet stands and begins chewing quickly as he ushers me back into the hall and to another door he is five eight or so with good shoulders noticeable love handles and a bald spot on the back of his head at the door he stops and turns back to me his dark brown eyes reassuring like those of a coach before an important game just tell these people what you know mr cole take your time and dont leave anything out if you get hungry or you need to take a leak nod your head at me and well break it might get pretty intense all of a sudden theres a lot riding on what you have to say about these women hold on i say raising my hands i thought i was coming down to talk to you whos in there he gives me a crooked smile dont worry ill be beside you the whole time so will my partner so will the chief mayeux meant to reassure me but hes accomplished the opposite and his eyes move off my face the other guys will be feds fbi fbi what for these guys are from the investigative support unit what used to be called behavioral science one special agent and a shrink plus two fibbies from the local office remember what i told you two of the dead women were killed in californiaone in la one in san francisco because their bodies were mutilated in a specific way and for other reasons the police out there decided they might be looking at some type of cult murders they called in the investigative support unit to assist them in coming up with a profile of their unsub their what unsub unknown subject anyway soon as i queried the names of those two dead california women the unit was on us like you know what when they heard about you and the other women they started foaming at the mouth they think were looking at a serial murderer here maybe a whole new kind of killer we got detectives flying in from all over the country right now this is majorleague stuff so much for our friendly little chat mayeux starts to turn the doorknob then hesitates a spark of cajun mischief twinkles in his eyes dont take the shitty vibes personally chief tobin officially requested the units assistancehe knows their chiefbut nopd and the local bureau office have bad blood from way back not your problem just tell your story mayeux winks show time cher chapter detective mayeuxs warning understated the tension level the bare police conference room reminds me of nothing so much as a room full of lead vocalists egos bumping against each other like tethered balloons as their owners strike practiced poses unaware of any agenda but their own four men in business suits sit in a protective phalanx at the far end of a rectangular table they might as well be wearing lapel tags that read fbi the new orleans police chief an enormous black man sports a starched white duty shirt that strains under his bulk four stars adorn the blue boards on each hamlike shoulder to the right of the chief sits a rail of a guy who has to be mayeuxs partner he looks like lukewarm hell eyes like quarter slots on a coke machine hands quivering with the irregular tremor that signals serious sleep deprivation i know the symptoms well there is a busty hispanic secretary beside him her left ear is cocked toward the chief but her eyes stay on the young fbi agents gentlemen says detective mayeux mr harper cole mayeux is telling me names but they dont find a permanent memory address three of the fbi agents wear blue suits the fourth charcoal gray does this mean hes in charge hes clearly the oldest yet he wears his graying hair longer than the others mayeux speaks his name softly giving it unintended emphasis arthur lenz doctor arthur lenz of course lenz is the shrink whenever i meet interesting strangers i find myself casting them as standins for the stars of my memory sometimes i meet an edmond obrien or a george sanders maybe a robert ryan i remember those guys from when i was a kid staying up late with my dad watching channel out of new orleans so its a habit trying to slot strangers into the celluloid templates in my head some people are just extras like mayeuxs partner and the secretary but every once in a while i meet the genuine article someone who doesnt just remind me of say fredric march he couldbe the man doctor lenz might be the genuine article he is physically tallthis is obvious even though he is seatedand yet he is limited like an actor who never made the jump to the big screen perpetually middleaged wasp or wasp wannabe expensive suit heavy on control his charisma is undeniable but somehow he finishes out more tv than film in the uncomfortable silence that follows the introductions one of the bluesuited fbi menbaxter i thinkgives the police chief an annoyed glance then he looks me in the eye and says good morning mr cole giving the mister that special and contemptuous stress that military men reserve for civilians im special agent daniel baxter i didnt notice baxter at first because sizewise he blends with the other two bluesuits but i see him now and i get the feeling hes hiding in the biblical sense as in hiding his light under a bushel hes got weight behind his dark eyes but hes not a leading man hes a toughasnails sergeant from a blackandwhite war movie thrust into command by the death of his lieutenant as if summoned to life by agent baxters words the police chief greets me in a startling james earl jones basso mr cole im chief sidney tobin i thank you for coming down so early today needless to say were all very interested in whatever you might have to say about these murders you have our undivided attention detective mayeux sits offering me the chair at the head of the table as he does but i remain standing i am six feet and one inch tall pounds and i know my size gives me a psychological edge when i choose to use it today i figure i need any edge i can get before i say anything i begin there is one very important thing i didnt tell detective mayeux on the phone whats that rumbles the chief im pretty sure i know who killed those women astonished silence blankets the room dr lenz breaks the impasse you have a name mr cole and an address christ cries mayeux give it to me i open my briefcase and remove a single sheet of paper from it i read david m strobekker thats strobekker fourteenohtwo moorland avenue edina minnesota its a suburb of minneapolis what else you know about this guy barks mayeuxs partner he has a checking account at the norwest bank in minneapolis thats all i know for sure run it through the computer mike commands the chief right now i can access the bureau computers by phone one of the younger fbi men tells mayeux who shoots me a furious glance on his way out i could be sued for giving you that name i tell them let us worry about that says baxter the fbi will provide lawyers to defend me in a civil case arthur lenzs face shows a trace of bemusement lets stick to these murders says the police chief tell us how you came to know those six names and why you suspected the women might be in trouble the door opens and closes behind me mayeux reclaims his chair on the right side of the table kieshas checking on strobekker chief stop me if i say something you dont understand i tell them the two younger fbi agents smirk at this but im fairly certain theyll soon be strafing me with stupid questions i work for a company called eros i say slowly thats an acronymeroswhich stands for erotic realtime online stimulation seeing a couple of leers i ignore the mythological connection and push on were an online service that caters to a wide range of clients interested in human sexuality eros is a new yorkbased corporation legally chartered in the state of delaware who owns it interrupts baxter a widow named jan krislov what from the sick look on daniel baxters face i can see that hes familiar with jan krislov in some capacity a flash of instinct tells me its her fierce championship of electronic privacy rights please continue mr cole instructs chief tobin anyone in the continental us can have full online access to eros twentyfour hours a day we also have european subscribers who reach us through the internet there are three levels of forum traffic which people access under aliasescode namesthat ensure complete anonymity level one is the most diverse clients use it to discuss all sorts of sexual topics from psychology to medical problems to privacy issues jan fucking krislov mutters baxter i take a breath hearing no questions i focus on mayeux and continue level two is the first of the two fantasy forums in level two clients write about their fantasies correspond with each other through forum messages and email or sometimes just eavesdrop on the fantasies of other subscribers the exchanges can be group or if a client prefers he or she can switch down to oneonone contact completely private we call that a private room there are also files available at all times from the online library popular exchanges from past sessions stuff like that stroke files says mayeuxs partner opening his red eyes in a glare of challenge right theyre not talking to anybody realtime so their hands are free jackoff time right the man is crude but not far off the mark thats probably a fair assessment what about level three asks doctor lenz his eyes alight with fascination level three i often stumble here when explaining eros to anyone outside the company i never know quite how to describe level three to be honest i dont monitor it that much at least i didnt until i began to have my suspicions about the missing women most level three traffic is nocturnal and thus miless gig thats another reason i allowed him to persuade me to put off acting for as long as i did level three i say again is what you might call the major league of sexual forums the dialogues are pretty heavy basically noholdsbarred dont get the wrong ideaits not kiddy porn or anything but its hot dr lenz finishes pretty hot yeah until three weeks ago we didnt even allow transmission of graphic images but believe me words alone are powerful enough were talking bondage s and m homoerotic sex you name it straight sex too of course how much does it cost to join eros asks baxter a thousand dollars to join mayeux whistles long and low plus five hundred a month flat fee after that with various payment arrangements for women its three hundred a month eros has oneeight hundred access numbers so nobody has any longdistance charges to worry about all the women but wheat were in their twenties says baxter where did they get that kind of money inherited it i reply a lot of rich girls on eros we get a lot of trophy wives too they marry moneyold moneyfake orgasms at night and log onto eros during the day its safer than adultery especially in the age of aids karin wheat was a member of this eros thing chief tobin interrupts yes for about three months now and those other women all of them were members right most of them had been subscribing for more than a year at the time they dropped off the net what exactly do you mean by dropped off lenz asks just a minute doctor says chief tobin reasserting the temporary supremacy he enjoys in his headquarters mr cole you mean to tell me all these murder victims were members of this superexpensive computer club or whatever it is and no homicide cop in la or san francisco or houston or portland or the other places managed to link these crimes with billing receipts from your company i can explain that i pause realizing im more interested in asking questions than answering them honestly im more surprised by the fact that the murders werent linked before now by physical evidence no offense but isnt that what you guys do goddamn growls mayeuxs partner plenty of reasons for that injects one of the fbi agents different weapon in every case says his bluesuited cousin forensic evidence indicating multiple perps multiple perps at the same scene adds the first agent which is rare says baxter glaring at the younger men highly unusual were still getting in evidence reports chief says mayeux but the mo does seem to have varied a great deal in almost every case as did the signature says baxter the killer left notes i ask baxter shakes his head signature is the offenders behavior at the crime scene he looks at me closely as if judging whether to continue behavior beyond that strictly necessary to commit the crime individualized behavior oh thereis no signature in these cases dr lenz says imperiously its all staging but the trophies in california varied not an iota trophies i echo what kind of trophies why dont you tell us mayeuxs partner asks pointing an index finger at my chest the room goes silent and in that instant i feel the first ripple of real fear in my chest am i a suspect in this case several looks are exchanged none directed at me do i need to call an attorney finally baxter breaks the silence mr cole im going to go out on a limb here i am not merely a special agent im the chief of the fbis investigative support unit we profile and help the police hunt violent serial offenders whether theyre killers rapists arsonists bombers or kidnappers when crimes of this nature are committed the individual who reports any of them is always considered a suspect serial offenders frequently report their own crimes as part of an attempt to avoid being found out or to gain enjoyment by assisting in an investigation of themselves in this case youve reported all the crimes when i was apprised of this situation last night the unit began an exhaustive check of your background including all your movements during the past two years it sounds drastic but its standard procedure baxter glances at his watch which he wears with the face inside the wrist military style dr lenz and i have spent the past few hours putting together a preliminary profile of the offender in these murders and frankly its one of the most difficult jobs weve ever undertaken at this point i wont say why but dr lenz believes that you are probably not the killer in this case i concur im not saying you couldnt be involved in some wayit would be irresponsible of me to rule you outbut im willing to proceed today on the assumption that you are what you claim to bea good samaritan coming forward in an attempt to see justice done obviously other womens lives are at risk as we speak an atmosphere of cooperation is the best thing for all of us at this point if you wish to consult an attorney that is your right but at this time no one herebaxter fires a sharp glance at the new orleans police officersintends to charge you with any crime when he finishes no one speaks everyone but baxter and lenz seems to be looking at his shoes i may be making the worst mistake of my life but i decide to trust baxter at least to the extent of not calling an attorney what kind of trophies i ask again an unusual one baxter says thoughtfully maybe hes a taxidermist cracks mayeuxs partner winking at mayeux make a note of that maria says chief tobin and watches the brunette pounce on her notepad taxidermists do not mount glands dr lenz says scornfully houston pd says he took the whole goddamn head snaps mayeux unwilling to tolerate the psychiatrists superior tone and thats what he did here i am looking for a place to sit down but no one notices i whisper someone cut off karin wheatshead thats classified information says baxter mayeux snorts at the spookspeak that is not accurate mr cole corrects chief tobin someone did cut off ms wheats head but that information is not classified still i would strongly suggest that you keep the knowledge to yourself the chief shoots me a very clear look if you fuck up my investigation in any way i will hound you to a paupers grave now he says his gentle bass voice filling the conference room like soft light what about my question credit card receipts from eros canceled checks phone bills and suchlike why didnt this link the crimes chief says baxter despite our best efforts to familiarize city police departments with our vicap program we still have a pretty poor compliance rate not nearly enough officers take the time to fill out their violent offender profiles and send them in this eros connection is exactly the kind of thing that slips through the cracks i wouldnt be surprised if homicide detectives in one or more of the involved departments have just such a receipt in an evidence drawer somewhere but have no idea that detectives in any other cities have the same thing all our fault as usual grumbles mayeuxs partner five of these six cases were sent in to vicap says mayeux giving his partner covering fire but they werent linked no eros connection showed up all had computers in their homes but nothing related to eros on their drives why not well i say finally regaining sufficient composure to rejoin the conversation as long as the killer wasnt rushed he could erase the eros software from the victims computers and take away any manuals they had although it would take a real wizard to wipe every trace from the hard disks you might have one of your people look into that baxter gives me a wry smile no traces so far karin wheat paid eros with her visa card says mayeux i checked as soon as you told me she was a member shell be the only one that did i tell him how do you know that asks dr lenz his heavylidded eyes probing mine because every other womanvictim i meanhad set up her account on the blinddraft account system whats that asks the chief a direct bank draft yes but not the kind you imagine a lot of eros subscribersparticularly womenare married and dont want their spouses to know theyre online with us some log on only from their workplace others from home but only when their husbands are away ms krislov makes every effort to ensure that any woman who wants to connect with us has the ability to do so without stigma to facilitate this she came up with the blinddraft policy if a woman doesnt want her husband to know shes onlineor vice versawe advise the user to set up a checking account at a bank not used by the spousean outoftown bank if possibleand use a po box as her address we then arrange to draft this secret account directly for payment of the monthly fee son of a bitch says mayeuxs partner every one of the murdered women was on a secret account mayeux asks except karin wheat but three of them werent married mayeux points out who were they hiding from boyfriends or girlfriends says dr lenz what about phone bills asks mayeux wouldnt connecttime show up on the phone bills of all the victims its an eight hundred number remember shit so after they were killed their secret accounts eventually dropped to zero eventuallyis exactly why i got suspicious eros isnt like compuserve or america online where you might lose interest but keep paying the nine ninetyfive per month thinking youll get back into it were talking three to five hundred bucks a month eros users may be wealthy but when they get bored they close those directdraft accounts and the murdered women didnt says mayeux right and two particular womenthe third and fourth victimswere very active online then poof one day they were gone but their bank drafts kept coming in that didnt fit the pattern im not saying it had never happened beforeit had thats why i didnt call the police immediately but the longer the accounts stayed active without the women showing up online the more uncomfortable i got i started probing the accounting program to see how many blinddraft clients were paying regularly but not logging onto the system there were about fifty enough to make me think i might be paranoid and enough for the company to decide not to investigate but then i remembered that victims three and four had talked to this strobekker guy a lot so i started watching for him then i started printing out his exchanges i also asked about him in private email thats how i came up with the names of the first and second victims and while i was doing that he was setting up and killing five and six he was also talking to at least twenty other women during this period as well doesnt the company try to contact people when their accounts drop to zero mayeux asks in case it was just an oversight no its understood by both parties that if a blinddraft account has insufficient funds for even a single payment the company assumes the client no longer desires its services and access is immediately terminated i dont buy that says mayeuxs partner i dont believe any company would kiss off that kind of bread without making sure the client wanted to quit how can i explain this to them jan krislov is the sole owner of eros and whether you believe it or not shes not in it for the money oh i believe it mutters baxter then why does she charge so damn much for the service mayeuxs partner asks doggedly a faint smile crosses arthur lenzs patrician face this alone draws all eyes to him the high fee functions as a crude screening system he says softly correct mr cole what kind of screening system asks mayeuxs partner lenz answers for me by charging an exorbitant rate ms krislov ensures that her online environment is accessible only to those who have attained a certain position in life flawed system says mayeux it assumes rich people arent assholes i said it was crude lenz admits but i imagine it works fairly well it works perfectly i say unable to keep the admiration out of my voice because there are other constraints on membership curiosity flares in lenzs eyes such as eros is open to any woman who can pay the fee but any man who wants to join has to submit a writing sample for evaluation who evaluates the sample jan krislov what are the criteria unable to resist i point at mayeuxs partner he wouldnt make the cut mayeux lays an arm across his partners chest and asks how many people belong to this thing five thousand half of them male half female the numerical relation is strictly maintained gays allowed lenz asks encouraged and contained within that ratio mayeux shakes his head youre telling us this krislov woman has personally evaluated twentyfive hundred writing samples from men writing about sex personally approved twentyfive hundred samples shes evaluated a lot more than that theres a waiting list of twentyeight hundred men at this moment so jan krislov sits up at night reading her own personalpenthouse letters baxter says in a gloating voice i know some senators wholl eat that up probably beats watching leno pipes up the local fbi agent for a woman i mean he adds hastily dr lenz leans forward in his chair i doubt these samples are as crude as you assume are they mr cole no there are some gifted people on eros mayeuxs partner snorts to wit karin wheat says lenz one more thing i add not all the men on eros are wealthy certain men have submitted writing samples that impressed ms krislov so much that she gives them access free of charge sort of a scholarship program she says it improves the overall experience for the women the secretary nods her head in a gesture i read as right on girl id be very interested in studying some of these online exchanges lenz says you have some in that briefcase yes baxter asks does anything stand out in your mind that these women had in common i pause for a moment most of them spent a lot of time in level twomy level their fantasies were fairly conventional by which i mean they involved more romance than sex they could get kinky but they werent sickos no torture or revolting bodily substances the truth is i dont know anything about these women in real life only their fantasies their fantasies may be the most important thing about them says lenz maybe i allow but thats not the sense i got im not sure why what did they have in common in real life none of your goddamn business snaps mayeuxs partner i see well i guess thats my position too dr lenz inclines his head toward baxter who says all the victims were under twentysix years old except karin wheat who was fortyseven all were college educated all caucasian except one who was indian native american asks chief tobin indian indian says mayeuxs partner tapping a file on the table dot on the fucking forehead i dont recall an indian name i say almost to myself pinky millstein says baxter maiden name jathar married to a litigation attorney who traveled a lot there was also an indian hair found at one of the other crime scenes does that mean anything to you well one of strobekkers aliases is shiva thats indian isnt it yes it is dr lenz says softly shiva the destroyer what are his other aliases prometheus hermes the psychiatrist remains impassive what about the victims does anything come to mind that links their online code names not that i could see what else stands out in your mind asks baxter strobekker himself no matter what alias he uses his style is unmistakable how so hes very literate for one thing intuitive as well one minute hes writing extemporaneous poetry the next he cuts right to the bone with some insight into a womans character almost as though he can answer whatever question is in her mind before she asks it but the strangest thing is this he must be the best damned typist in the world lightning fast and he never makes a mistake never lenz asks leaning forward not in the first eightyfive percent of contact what do you mean with the sixth victim and with karin wheat i realized that strobekker began making typographic errorsjust like anyone elsea few days before each woman dropped offline when i went back and studied my printouts of the killervictim exchanges i saw that the typos began at about the eightyfive percent point in each relationship of course i didnt know anyone was being killed you sound like youve distilled this thing down to a science says baxter i work with numbers running this sex thing asks mayeux i chuckle bitterly no i got into eros for fun you believe that i earn my living trading futures my audience stares as if ive announced that i am an alchemist in a dink farmhouse in the mississippi delta asks one of the young fbi agents who are your clients farmers hedging their crops i only have one client who mayeux asks suspiciously himself says arthur lenz dr lenz is obviously the alchemist here thats right i only trade my own account you some kind of millionaire asks mayeuxs partner a goddamn gentleman farmer or something keep a civil tongue poché snaps the chief i do all right what about the final fifteen percent of contact lenz asks plainly irritated by the squabbling he makes mistakes about as many as anyone else and his typing gets slower a lot slower maybe he starts jacking off with one hand as he gets closer to the time of the hit suggests poché the chief frowns but lets that pass dr lenz strikes a pose of intense meditation as the door behind me opens swiftly i turn and see a black woman in her twenties holding a computer printout in her hand there is handwriting scrawled across it in blue ink what is it kiesha asks the chief we traced strobekker david m a cumulative catching of breath in the conference room rap sheet mayeux asks tentatively no minnesota dmv no citations had one cara mercedesbut the plate expired last year so who is the guy an accountant for a glitzy firm in minneapolis minnesota i realize that kiesha is trying to communicate something to chief tobin through eye contact alone despite her telepathic urgency she is unsuccessful what is it dear asks arthur lenz as though he has known the woman since childhood hes dead she says almost as if against her will david m strobekker was beaten to death in an alley in minneapolis eleven months ago a hot tingle races across my forearms holy shit says mayeux what are we dealing with here daniel baxter points a finger as thick as a colt python barrel at kiesha details minneapolis homicide says it looked like a mugging gone bad strobekker was single probably homosexual he was slumming on a bad stretch of hennepin avenue his skull was so pulped his boss couldnt recognize his face dr lenz emits a small sound of what i can only interpret as pleasure positive id asks mayeux dental records and a thumbprint kiesha replies his company kept thumbprint files dont ask me why but it was strobekker for sure not for sure i say surprised to hear my own voice why not baxter asks sharply well say strobekker is the killer say he decided to fake his own death so that hed never be suspected in later crimes he takes a thumbprint from a wino puts that in his own personnel file then kills the wino and pulps his face what about the dental records asks baxter i shrug im just thinking out loud you watch too many movies i must see the body immediately lenz says to baxter his eyes still on me jeff call the minneapolis field office orders baxter we want a judge wholl give us an exhumation order asap then call the airport and book the first flight up there what are you looking for i ask a pineal gland among other things says lenz watching me closely ever heard of it i shake my head while i memorize the term my knowledge of anatomy is limited but my wifes is encyclopedic the two women who died in california were linked because a pathologist from san fransisco happened to mention an unsolved homicide case to a colleague at a convention a woman had been murdered by strangulation then had both eyes removed and wooden stakes driven through the sockets when the pathologist sectioned the brain he found that the points of both stakes terminated in the third ventricle of the braina little too perfectly for him stranger still he found that part of the pineal gland was missing which the stakes would not account for the colleague who heard thisa pathologist from los angeleshad an unsolved homicide that was completely different in almost every respect a woman had been beaten to death with a claw hammer probably by someone she knew her brain sustained horrific damage but this did not explain why much of her pineal gland was gone this chance conversation ultimately linked the crimes then the police promptly charged down the wrong track and decided they were dealing with cult murders lenzs tone of voice when he says police earns him few friends in this room he points his index finger at me you tied those two victims to four others through eros all four of those women also died from severe head wounds or sustained postmortem head trauma pistol shot shotgun blast lethal fall one was decapitated as was karin wheat were exhuming the first three and conducting repeat autopsies on the heads if the condition of the brains permits it i strongly suspect we will find that these women are missing all or part of their pineal glands the psychiatrist is staring at me as though he expects me to start filling in gaps for him what the hell does the pineal gland do i ask as lenz and baxter stare silently at me my survival instinct tells me its time to test the bars on this cage look i say directing my words to chief tobin i think you guys have definitely stepped out of my area of expertise can i go home now not just yet tobin says do people ever use their real names on this sex network i try to suppress the feeling that im going to be spending the night in a new orleans hotel if not jail almost never the code names are what allow them the freedom to say and be whatever they wish they might exchange phone numbers to facilitate an ff meeting but whats f f asks the chief facetoface oh so did the victims give him their numbers not in the conversations ive printed out so how do you think hes learning their names i think hes somehow gained access to our accounting files theres a master client list in the companys administrative computer with account numbers addresses everything thats where i got strobekkers name who has access to that list asks baxter myself miles turner jan krislov maybe a few techs thats it the computer handles the billing automatically its a pretty sophisticated system who is miles turner asks lenz hes the primary sysop we grew up together in mississippi but he lives in new york now hes the one who got me into this job so you think the killer is hacking into the accounting database says baxter i dont know miles tells me its impossible that the list is protected like nuclear launch codes but as far as i can see its the only way the killer could get the names he must have seen that master list at least once maybe printed it out not the only way interrupts mayeuxs partner you or this miles character could have given the list to someone orsold it to them im on the verge of telling this guy to fuck himself when baxter asks who does security for eros miles i reply still watching mayeuxs scowling partner this miles turner is highly proficient with computers asks baxter highly doesnt come close he has a degree mit serious program says one of the younger fbi agents graduate degree baxter presses degrees plural i dont know the exact names but his specialty is computational physics if hes so damned smart asks mayeuxs partner how did strobekker break through his security its clear that everyone detests this little rat as much as i do but his question is a good one i dont know and he refuses to believe anyone has how many techs are there asks baxter four five im not positive they have access to the master list but i think if they wanted to see it they could figure a way theyre good miles handpicked every one the two younger fbi agents are murmuring between themselves from the lips of one with whippet eyes i catch nail that fuck with a phone trace subcontract some nsa geeks next logon no time before baxter silences them with a glare mr cole he says gently if you dont mind wed like you to draw us a floor plan of the eros offices before you go this startles me i cant do that why not ive never been there never theyre obsessively private about the place why do you need that anyway no one answers youre not gearing up for some kind of waco thing are you this is nothing like that theres a reason for all the secrecy we have very famous clients relax baxter says were not the atf youre all initials to me mr baxter we can arrest your ass right now yells mayeuxs partner finally losing control i dont know why the hell we havent already go ahead i shout back my anger boiling over you want to arrest me for linking these homicides for you the press might be real interested to hear a story like that in fact my wife knows one of the tv news anchors here from her school days maybe i should give her a call letseverybody just calm down chief tobin booms with his department under fire from all quarters for corruption the last thing he needs is more press scrutiny now can i go home i ask again the chief looks hard at baxter who in turn looks to lenz lenz finally gives a reserved nod baxter reaches into his inside jacket pocket and passes me a card this is the number of our headquarters in quantico virginia i want you to check in once a day for the next few days obviously well need to speak with you again possibly at some length mayeuxs partner looks like he just swallowed a cigarette butt with his coffee but chief tobins hard gaze keeps him muzzled id like to study your eros printouts on the plane says lenz you are going to leave them with me i open my case lift out the thick stack of pages and drop it at the center of the table theyre all yours but when jan krislov lands on me with both feet and a dozen lawyers im going to expect some payback from you guys leave krislov to us says baxter measuring daniel baxter against my mental image of eross coldblooded ceo i stifle a retort and turn to go one foot is outside the doorway when lenz says mr cole i turn back expecting some columbo trick just as i taste freedom lenz smiles oddly what instrument do you play the question throws me off balance is this some bullshit barbara walters question what kind of tree would i like to be but of course its not i do play an instrument and somehow lenz knows that guitar i answer blankly the psychiatrist nods a trace of disappointment in his eyes do you sing some people think so i never did the rest of the group looks from me to lenz then back again trying to understand this odd coda to our meeting my bewilderment holds me in place until the psychiatrist says calluses mr cole you have welldeveloped calluses on the fingertips of your left hand the hand closes involuntarily i squint at lenz imprinting his face in my memory then turn and step into the hall on my way out of the station i pass a knot of middleaged men in sweatstained suits they are obviously waiting for something their angry voices mark them as anything but southerners and before i am out of earshot i realize they are waiting for me i quicken my steps once outside i reflect on dr lenzs little performance hes an observant man but is he smart a smart man would simply have noted the calluses and bade me farewell unless he felt that quickly discovering what instrument i play was important but even then a smart man would have remained silent after i answered his question leaving me mystified by his deductive skills yet arthur lenz insisted on doing a sherlock holmes impression for his captive audience of lestrades why the doctor was showing off i dont know why but this is somehow important i cannot escape the feeling that the entire lowkey meeting was a carefully orchestrated interrogation designed to look and feel like anything but that baxter and lenz playing good cop while the nopd played the heavy or maybe its more complicated than that but if they really suspect me why not arrest me and give me the third degree or throw me to the outofstate wolves who were waiting for me one thing is certain the fbi controlled that meeting i am free because they want me free why do they want that could the fbilike chief tobinbe afraid of the media its possible after seven murderseight including strobekkerthe bureaus elite serial killer unit has managed to link exactly none of the crimes wrongly accusing the good citizen who connected the murders for them might make their precious unit an object of ridicule on nightline not to mention hard copy which is already feeding on the case i have only intuition to go on but the voiceless voice in my head has rarely failed me as i pull the inevitable parking ticket off the windshield of my explorer and drop the crumpled ball into the gutter that voice is saying one thing loud and clear you have more problems today than you had yesterday chapter one of my office telephones is ringing when i turn the key in the front door of the farmhouse thinking its drewe i race to catch it hello snitch this is not drewe the voice in the earpiece is at once strange and familiar it belongs to miles turner youve really shaken things up havent you he says what have you heard i ask shocked at the saunalevel heat that has accumulated inside the house during the day jan is very upset with you i figured did the fbi call her i hear a faint tsk did they phone her no harper that would be much too easy for the federal bureau of incompetence they showed up at the door of our offices with a search warrant what at eros when two hours ago special agents from the new york office what did they see not much jan locked the master client list in the file room the minute reception buzzed her and said the fbi was in the building she refused to give them a key and that room is like a vault actually itis a vault it reminds me of your grandfathers bomb sheltereisenhower chic its got a time lock seventytwo hours before that monster opens i guess the fbi could blow it open or cut it with a blowtorch but they havent tried they just posted two men outside it they didnt even confiscate our servers jan thinks the raid was pure intimidation i dont think so miles all six of those women i told you about were murdered this year karin wheat makes seven and david strobekker the man i thought was the killer makes eight so says the fbi comeon man wake up and smell the fucking coffee i overheard one guy whispering about phone traces bringing in the nsa george orwell stuff as a matter of fact jan is about to give the fbi permission to set up tracing equipment right here in the office this stops me but you just said she hid the master client list from them she did but jans no fool she knows shes walking a fine legal line there is apparently some question of a duty to warn warn the subscribers i mean she feels that by cooperating with the fbi in tracing strobekkeror whoever he isshe demonstrates that shes not obstructing the fbi merely for the sake of doing it at least somebody up there is thinking straight how long do they think it will take to trace strobekker if he does log on again if hes stupid no time at all personally i dont believe they have a chance in hell you sound glad about it damn it miles laughs softly i havent heard you this excited in a while did karins death affect you so deeply i swallow you knew her of course we exchanged quite a few messages during the wee hours karin was one of the pillars of level three a thoroughly interesting woman i think quickly i i know that but but you never saw any of my aliases in exchanges with her right thats what youre thinking yes i have many names harper even you dont know them all he pauses you dont always tell women youre a sysop do you that you know who they really are that would spoil the fun wouldnt it its amazing how the perceived anonymity of a code name lets them open up isnt it especially the actresses theres nothing quite like boffing a threemilliondollar thespian online while she thinks you think shes someone else is there you can play them like your guitar then cant you i say nothing and how is drewe welby md taking all of this did she finally break the camels back and send you running to the fbi i didnt go to the fbi i snap i called the new orleans police the fbi was already on the case damn it miles were talking about murder so so eros is like an organic system harper constantly evolving powerful emotions flow through it every day sexual emotions were accustomed to monitoring massive levels of input or throughput if you will but output has always been a possibility and sex has always been integrally bound up with death why anyone should be surprised by all this is beyond me miles put aside your bullshit philosophizing for a minute dont you realize that eross primary obligation is to protect the security of its clients youre the one who trivialized that obligation by revealing the names of subscribers to the police i shake my head youve finally flipped out man you realize he says coolly that youve exposed yourself to litigation by your action your employment contract is quite specific about that i would feel derelict as a friend if i didnt warn you that you will almost certainly be hearing from elaine abrams in the next few days i would speak to my attorney it suddenly strikes me that miles turnerwho grew up in rain mississippiis speaking without a trace of southern accent he has finally succeeded in his lifelong goal of erasing his roots listen to me miles i implore reaching for some vestige of the boy i once knew so well innocent women are being killed and mutilated im trying to stop that if you and krislov dont understand that youre going to get steamrollered by the fbi ive met the guys running this investigation theyre from the investigative support unitthe serial killer guysand they are serious people i gather they are he says finally showing a touch of pique and you and i are their prime targets i am silent surely you see that harper you and i are the only two menapart from my technical staffwho have access to the real names of the subscribers obviously the master client list is the map the killer is using to choose his victims obviously so how did he get access to it im looking into that you told me those files were protected like nuclear launch codes my system architecture is ironclad he snaps still even the best operating systems sometimes have flaws no one knows about they come that way from the factory how many technicians are there miles six more than id thought if the killer isnt hacking his way through your security and you or i didnt do the killings that means one of those six guys did no how do you know i just do this stops me when miles turner sounds this certain he is always right the police would never accept that of course but i do but how can he know trying not to slide too far down that neural pathway i say look am i fired or what fired he echoes as if the notion has never crossed his mind you just said krislov was pissed at me its not like im essential to the running of the network of course you are you and i are the only two fullduty sysops what about raquel hirsch shes licking her lesbian lips off on montserrat not due back for another week besides shes only parttime and doesnt know enough about technical matters to defrag a hard drive what if i quit you cant my contract says i can i made sure of that this was only going to be a trial thing anyway remember a goof miless voice lowers to its snakecharming register but youve stayed at it all these months havent you youlike it besides if you quit youll lose your fiftyyardline seat jesus i dont need the aggravation miles no what about your online friends then or should i say lovers are you ready to tell them goodbye forever your employment contract does forbid you from ever trying to contact them in person if you quit ill probably have to remind elaine abrams about that clause fuck you i quit what about eleanor rigby i exhale slowly my grip tightening on the phone what do you know about eleanor i know shed be positively despondent if you dropped off of eros without explanation miles knows he has me the truth is i dont really want to quit after summoning the nerve to go public with my suspicionsand being proved correcti want resolution miles just pisses me off ill stay until raquel gets back i tell him my voice tight good man oh youd better start getting your alibis organized your fbi friends will be asking and it can be difficult to remember where one was on so many different nights so many months ago i have nothing to hide i say firmly im innocent there is a long silence then a strange muffled sigh when miles finally answers his voice seems burdened by age beyond his years harper have you learned so little during your time with eros you speak of innocence with such conviction are any of us then he hangs up the phone i look around the office at the familiar landmarks of my existence the eros computer custom built by miles the gateway i use to make my futures trades two laser printers the antique laboratory table that functions as my desk the twin bed i crash on during marathon trading sessions the guitars hanging over the bed lifting my feet from the floor i spin the swivel chair in a circle the window flashes past again and again merging with reflections from framed prints antique maps the unsheathed civil war sword carried by one of my maternal ancestors at brices cross roads when i stop spinning i am facing a sport coat my fathers coat it droops from a wire hanger on a nail driven straight into the wall the jacket appears to be cashmere with thin vertical stripes of black and wine it is absolutely motionless there is a reason for this the coat is made of wood i commissioned this piece from a sculptor i discovered one summer in florida he is a big blond guy named fraser smith and he sculpts nothing but clothes quilts and old suitcases the day i met him i compulsively bought two of his pieces and in the aftersale chatter learned that he was originally from mississippi i dont know why his work affects me so strongly but i dont question it things actually worth buying are rare my fathers taste in clothes was exceptionally bad as a rulemostly synthetic fabrics in loud colorsbut he bought this jacket while serving as an army doctor in germany in the year i was born all i can figure is that the store was out of electric plaids leaving him no choice but to buy this jewel for warmth twenty years later he gave it to me after i remarked on its quality and i wore it often ten years after thata year after he diedi carefully boxed it up and sent it ups to tampa florida where smith kept it four months then shipped both the jacket and the sculpture back to me with a bill for fifteen thousand dollars it was worth every cent why i dont know maybe because the jacket says something to me about the permanence of the apparently transitory for what is that jacket but an articulated memory as surely as the jacket is here with me my father is here with me and for all his failings which were many he was a man of principle when it came to the big things and i know as i sit here worrying about the consequences of my recent actions that i am doing only and exactly what my father would have donethe consequences be damned maybe thats miless problem he had no such anchor miless father left him and his mother to fend for themselves when miles was five people said miles was his spitting image but since mrs turner kept no pictures of that nocount sob in the house we could never confirm or deny this he certainly didnt look like his mother a petite harried woman he was tall even as a child all bones and tendons which in a small town usually leads to school sports but miles was apathy personified when one coach tried to talk him into playing basketball he just stared until the man walked away that was a common adult reaction miless eyes are grayish blue and you cant see anything in them if he doesnt want you to theyre like background pieces in a stainedglass window nothing there but space yet like the sky they can come alive with everything from thunderheads to blazing blue light according to local legend miless father was a mean drunk and a gifted engineer who helped the army corps of engineers figure out how to stop a bad sand boil in the levee west of mayersville in because of that people said miles got his brains from his father miles hated them for that he hated anybody who ever said it i think he took it as some sort of insult to his mother who was no rocket scientist to be fair to the gossips yet annie turner was clever in her own way she never remarried or even divorced for all the town knew but she did manage to become involved with certain solvent gentlemen railroad men for example who happened to be passing through rain during times of financial distress miles never talked about any of those men when they were around we knew to stay away from his house from noontime on once shooting squirrels out of season we ran into the turner kitchen to grab some bullets from the drawer and saw a man standing in the kitchen with his shirt off drinking milk from a halfgallon carton he looked old as the hills to us at twelve and had milk dribbling down his chin when we got outside and miles fumbled the bullets into the his eyes sort of glazed over and he took a couple of steps back toward the house and before i could spit he put two bullets through the top pane of the kitchen window when i crashed into his back and pulled him down i felt his shoulders shaking like the flanks of a horse run almost to death i had to hit him in the face to get the gun away and then we ran like hell until we couldnt hear anyone screaming behind us miles didnt say anything for about two hours after that we just walked along the weedy turnrows dividing the cotton fields rapping the hard knobbed stalks everybody called nigger knockers against the rusty barbed wire i went home at dark i dont know if miles went home at all but they made out okay annie even managed to pay miless way through private school until she realized that the school would pay to have him because miles turner was a genius i say that because though i did well in school without much effort miles did not tryat all in the ninth grade he could answer reading problems in algebra after scanning them once he never put anything on paper after we all took the armed services vocational aptitude battery some army major from washington telephoned down to the school talked to the principal and asked to speak to miles he said something about miles having a home in the army just as soon as he came of age miles told the major he wouldnt join the army unless russian paratroopers landed in his mothers yard the major said that might not be such a remote possibility he also told miles that greenville was a confirmed russian nuclear target because of its bridge over the mississippi river miles said if the russians wanted to nuke greenville he might consider joining the army after all the russian army okay he was a smartass but that doesnt make him a killer he was just born in the wrong town and he knew it we both graduated high school as national merit scholars and could have gone to college anywhere in the united states for next to nothing but there our paths diverged i was so into girls that summer that i hardly gave college a thought and since my parents were having their own problems at the timefinancial and maritalthey ignored the issue as well id always done well in school thus i always would in the end i went to ole miss sight unseen and because i had waited so long to decide my father even had to pay for the privilege miles applied for and was awarded a full academic scholarship to the massachusetts institute of technology while i farted around oxford mississippi with scatterbrained venusshaped sorority girls and drunken young republicans miles turner was fanatically programming tearing apart and rebuilding big clumsy metal boxes that i would not even have recognized in computers it seems natural now but at the time it was odd he spoke the language of bits and drives and floating memory at a time when those words were as foreign to the general public as attic greek the really odd thing is that miles thinks im smarter than he is i have no idea why this is not false modesty i will frankly admit that i have aboveaverage intelligence just as i will admit i have a poor sense of direction i can look at a problem analyze itfor patterns usuallyand given enough time solve it miles doesnt analyze anything he looks at something and he just knows he grasps physics and numbers the way i do people and musicwholly by intuition its as though his asocial childhood allowed him to tune into some subrational channel of information that is beyond the rest of us when i took the sysop job i was looking forward to getting to know him again id only seen him a handful of times in the past fifteen years but for whatever reason it hasnt worked out that way we occasionally exchange emailsometimes using the satellite video link that his techs installed here when i took the jobslashhobbybut on balance i know him no better now than i did when we were kids maybe my hopes were misplaced maybe you can never know anyone more deeply than you know them in childhood by the time drewe arrives ive put together a bastardized stirfry of broccoli and pork and lemon we eat it on the front porch which is thick with heat despite the falling darkness but mercifully free of mosquitoes as soon as we sit drewe asks for a playbyplay of the meeting in new orleans i give it to her glad not to have to keep anything back she takes in every word with the machinelike precision that carried her through medical school with honors and when i am done she says nothing i have held one detail until the end hoping for a silence like this one whats the pineal gland i ask she finds my eyes in the gloom the pineal body i guess yeah its a small glandular structure at the core of the brain in the third ventricle i think its about the size of a pea what does it do until about thirty years ago nobody thought it did anything it was considered a vestigial organ like the appendix scientists knew the pineal made melatonin but no one knew what melatonin did what does the pineal have to do with anything the fbi says the killer cut off karin wheats head to get to her pineal gland what sick huh the other victims might be missing theirs too or else their whole heads drewe grimaces can you think of any reason why someone would want pineal glands do they have any medical use i dont think so there were some pineal experiments going on at tulane when i was there related to breast cancer i think but i dont remember what the findings were she pauses you can buy melatonin in health food stores though god this reminds me of those pbs shows where they talk about oriental medicine you know how japanese men pay poachers hundreds of thousands of dollars for rhinoceros horns and tiger testicles and things all to cure impotence or restore their lost youth or something my opinion of my wifes mental acuity has been reaffirmed yet again she has already broached a theory that seems more logical than that of the police in california who believe the eros murders may be the work of a cult so whatis melatonin i ask what does it do its a hormone that regulates your sleep cycle your circadian rhythms you know what causes jet lag some people take it to prevent or relieve jet lag symptoms can you remember anything else about it drewe touches her forefinger to the tip of her nose and fixes her gaze somewhere out in the darkness i know this posture well concentration mode i think it controls the release of serotonin maybe some other hormones i seem to recall something from one of the journals neurobiological stuff something to do with the pineal and the aging process weird how that fits with the oriental thing isnt it but that doesnt mean anything murderers dont read jama or journal of neuroscience why not well i guess its possible drewe grimaces and says men are scum a routine comic line of hers that doesnt sound so funny tonight so whats the plan i ask lightly falling into our usual banter more dictation she stretches both arms above her head my personal cross to bear she begins gathering up the plates which reminds me tomorrow you face yours i feel a sudden chill what are you talking about take it easy she says giving me an odd look i meant the biweekly burden sunday dinner with your inlaws she turns away and moves through the screen door but my chill does not dissipate over her shoulder she says lately youve acted like its a trip to the dentist or something if only it were i rise from the porch and head for my office combined with the stress of the past weeks the trip to new orleans has exhausted me after months of anxiety i have finally done what i should have done long ago for months ive stayed up far too many hours and slept too few lurking in level three in the hope of recognizing the errorfree transmissions of david strobekker but tonight i will sleep as i strip off my clothes drewes last comment echoes in my mind lately youve acted like its a trip to the dentist or something in reality the trip to her parents house is a trip into a minefield a place where one wrong word or too open glance could cause instant devastation drewe does not know this like the most dangerous mines these were laid long ago by people who scarcely knew what they were doing no maps exist and disarming them is impossible once i thought it might be but now i know the truth when we seek to resurrect the past it eludes us when we seek to elude the past it reaches out with fingers that can destroy all we know and love tonight i leave david strobekker to the fbi i have my own demon chapter dear father we landed near virginia beach at dusk riding the scent of ocean to the earth we misdirected taxis to bring us within range of the patients house then walked no eros dalliances with this one shes a navy girl young and simple and tough i was lucky to have kali with me we entered while she showered and what a specimen she was firm pink skin shining in the spray for a moment i wished we were there for the old protocol but after her scream died i tried a little humor hello jenny were from donornet ill bet you didnt think we made house calls she tried to fight us in the bedroom making for a dresser in which i later found a pistol kali brought her down with a knife slash to the thigh lots of blood but essentially a superficial wound it will have no effect on her role in the procedure kali helped her dress then forced her to give us her car keys jenny didnt whine or beg like some she was trying to think of a way out i drove her car to the airstrip kali guarding her in the backseat at the plane id planned to inject a mild sedative but despite my reassurances the patient would not submit i was forced to shoot her with a ketamine dart i also had to leave her car at the runway eventually it will be found but there is no record of our landing no note no trace of our passing another question mark for the police kali has the controls now my dark shakti shepherds me through the stars we hurtle into history at two hundred miles per hour the patient lies bound behind us silent as death as blissfully unaware of the contribution she will make as the monkey that gave salk his poliomyelitis vaccine ive been thinking that i should present an edited version of these letters as an addendum to my official findings or perhaps they belong with my curriculum vitae shocking to the unprepared mind i suppose but highly edifying for the medical historian but enough of that things are where they are and as fate has willed so shall they be fulfilled chapter its that damned nigger contractor says bob anderson robert not in front of holly scolds margaret his wife bob anderson is my fatherinlaw he points across his mexican tile patio toward a small girl child splashing in the shallow end of the swimming pool she cant hear me marg and no matter how you cut it it all comes back to that nigger contractor patrick graham my brotherinlaw rolls his eyes at me while carefully making sure i am the only one who can see him patrick and i went to school together and are exactly the same age an oncologist in jackson mississippi he is married to erin my wifes younger sister his rolling eyes sum up a feeling too complex for words one common to our generation of southerners they say we may not like it but theres nothing we can do about it except argue and its not worth arguing about with our fatherinlaw because he wont ever change no matter what it being racism of course what are you jabbering about daddy drewe asks my wife is wearing a yellow sundress and standing over the wroughtiron table that holds the remains of the barbecued ribs we just devoured erin excluded of course my wifes sister is a strict vegetarian which in mississippi still rates up there with being a hare krishna this gettogether is a biweekly family ritual sunday dinner at the inlaws who live twenty miles from rain on the outskirts of yazoo city we do it rain or shine and today its shine ninetysix degrees in the shade dont get him started honey my motherinlaw says wearily margaret anderson has taken refuge from the heat beneath a widebrimmed straw hat im talking about my new office baby bob tells drewe ignoring margaret bob anderson is a veterinarian and an institution in this part of the delta his practice thrives but that is not what pays for the columned greek revival house that towers over the patio we are sitting on in the last twenty years bob has invested with unerring instinct in every scheme that made any money in the delta most notably catfish farming money from all over the world pours into mississippi in exchange for farmraised catfishenough money to put the longmaligned catfish in the same league with cotton a not insignificant portion of that money pours into bob andersons pockets he is a short man but seems tall even to those who have known him for years though he is balding his forearms are thick and hairy he walks with a selfassured forwardleaning tilt his chin cocked back with a military air he is a natural hand with all things mechanical carpenter work motors welding plumbing a half dozen sports its easy to imagine him with one strong arm buried up to the shoulder in the womb of a mare a wide grin on his sweaty face bob anderson is a racist he is also a good father a faithful husband and a dead shot with a rifle i took bids on my building he says looking back over his shirtless shoulder at drewe all the local boys made their plays ocourse firstclass job like that and all their bids were close to even then i get a bid from this nigger out of jackson name of boyte his bid was eight thousand less than the lowest of the local boys did you take it patrick asks erin grahampatricks wifeturns from her perch at poolside she has been sitting with her tanned back to us her long legs dangling in the water watching her threeyearold daughter with an eagle eye erins dark eyes glower at her father but bob pretends not to notice not yet he says see the local boys somehow got wind of what the nigger bid somehow drewe echoes expressing her suspicion that her father told his cronies about their minority competition anyhow bob plows on it turns out the reason this nigger can afford to bid so low is that hes getting some kind of cheap money from the government some kind of incentive read handoutwhich naturally aint available to your white contractors now i ask you is that fair im all for letting the nigger compete right alongside jack and nub but for the government to use our tax money to help him undercut hardworking men like that are you sure the black contractors getting government help drewe asks hell yes im sure nub told me himself so what are you going to do asks patrick as if he really cares which i know he does not what can i do bob says haplessly ive got to give it to the nigger dont i daddy that is enough patrick and i look up startled by the shrill voice erin has stood up beside the pool and she is pointing a long finger at her father you may do and say as you wish at your house any time you wishexcept when my daughter is present holly will not grow up handicapped by the prejudices of this state bob looks at patrick and me and rolls his eyes which from long experience we sonsinlaw have no trouble translating as what do you expect from a girl who ran off to new york city when she turned eighteen and lived among yankees calm down honey bob says to you hes an african american five years ago he was black before that a negro before that colored how am i supposed to keep up to me hes a nigger his own friends call him nigger whats the difference holly wont remember any of this in five minutes anyway to be fair bob anderson would never use this kind of language in mixed companymixed racial companyor in front of whites he did not know and feel comfortable with unless of course someone made him mad to bob anderson politically correct means you salute the flag work your butt off pay your taxes pray in school and you by god go when uncle sam calls you no questions asked i could ridicule his views but i wont guys like bob anderson fought and died for this country years before i was born guys like bob anderson liberated nordhausen and buchenwald bob himself fought in korea so i keep my thirtythreeyearold mouth shut but erin doesnt goddamn it daddy im serious she snaps her tanned cheeks quivering hollys like a sponge and you know it bobs face glows pink he half rises from his reclining lawn chair you hear that margaret your daughter just took the lords name in vain and shes on me for calling a spade a spade i think any civilized person would agree that blasphemy is far worse than saying nigger now and again margaret anderson snores beneath her straw hat no its not daddy drewe says softly from the table but youll never understand why i am enthralled by the continuing role reversal erin and drewe have been undergoing since they were kids when they were teenagers it was drewe who almost daily pushed her father to the point that he locked her in her room or thrashed her with his belt she constantly tested her limits proving only that she was as stubborn as he was erin was a creature of equanimity slipping through life with no resistance at all yet now that erin is a mother it is she who faces down bob without fear or second thoughts as a child drewe was a tomboy curious competitive and tough after puberty she began to soften into a more feminine figure at the same time her intelligence put her at the top of her ninthgrade class to prevent the inevitable taunts of being too good for everyone else drewe evolved a unique strategy she became the wildest girl in the class or at least she seemed to and one of her most convincing moves in this game of social survival was dating the wildest boy in her classme and so it was that i alone knew her secret while the other girls were perpetually awed by the craziness of some of the things drewe did i knew for example that on those occasions when we managed to spend nearly all night together in bed she stopped our passionate groping well short of going all the way yet she was perfectly content to let her friends think otherwise and in the whirlwind of our relationship no one seemed to notice that she maintained a average in all subjects erin was just as deceptive but she took the opposite tack a year behind drewe she effortlessly convinced every parent and teacher within thirty miles that she was a perfect angel while actually having sex with any guy who took her fancy from cleancut quarterbacks to potsmoking cowboy rebels her grades were middling at best but on the other hand they were irrelevant erins secret was her looks i gaze past patrick and bob erin has finally turned back toward the shimmering pool i am now looking at what was once described as the finest ass in the state of mississippi and it still manages to make the onepiece bathing suit that covers it seem more revealing than a thong bikini even now i am convinced that this thirtytwoyearold mother could give any high school senior a run for her money during erin andersons face appeared on the covers of six national magazines four days after she graduated from high school she left rain mississippi for new york with five hundred dollars and the name of a modeling agent in her purse two months later she had signed a contract with the ford agency in quick succession came runway work the six magazine covers some tv spots then came a brief hiatus and after that it was the inner pages of the magazines another hiatus then mostly they used her hands feet breasts and hair no tragic accident had disfigured her face if looks alone were the criterion erin would still be gazing out from the racks at the supermarket checkout instead of gathering up her child from the shallow end of her parents swimming pool erins problems were inside her head not outside but first the exterior where drewe is fair erin is dark i lay that at the feet of genetics bob anderson came from scotsenglish blood margaret cajun french drewe got her fathers genes erin her mothers and the differences hold true right down the line drewes hair is thick auburn and slightly curly erins is fine and straight and so brown it is almost black drewes eyes are green and bright with quick intelligence erins are almondshaped as black and deep as smoldering louisiana bottomland drew has a pert nose while erins is long and straight with catlike flared nostrils and where drewes lips are pink like brush strokes on a royal doulton figurine erins are full and brown her upper lip dusted with fine tawny down both girls are somewhere around five foot nine but erin is long i dont mean to shortchange my wife any man with functioning retinas would call drewe a beauty she is also demureexcept while workingand her strength and smarts give an edge to her elegance she is a doctor after all erin is a former model turned jetset girlfriend turned housewife but as i watch erin leading her child by the hand to the wroughtiron table the physical difference comes clear drewe is feminine erin is feline this is a difficult art watching another woman without your wife noticing you look with unrestricted freedom for the early part of your life then suddenly you have to learn to conceal your interest the battle is hopeless like a physicist trying to train iron filings not to follow a magnet but with erin i have had lots of practice since i dated drewe in high school erin and i were almost natural enemies we constantly razzed each other behaving as if related ourselves i grew adept at ignoring her stunning legs as we hung around the pool in the summers but sometimes ignoring her was impossible once at a high school lake party some of the seniors got drunk enough to start skinnydipping dusk was falling and a few of the girls felt safe enough or bold enough to slip off their suits in the growing shadows and dive off the pier into the silver water when drewe saw this she silently stood up threw her wild act to the winds and started walking back toward the car she obviously had no intention of stripping nude in front of strangers no matter how drunk they might be besides her coolness quotient was secure she didnt look back at me but i knew she expected me to follow and i meant to but as i stood up i heard a voice say softly harper i turned around to see erin standing behind me she wore the bottom half of a bikini but her brownnippled breasts were exposed with her eyes locked on mine she hooked a finger in the side of her suit and stepped lazily out of it she was glorious and she knew it i stood blinking in the dusk trying to take in what i was seeing looking back now i realize that trying to seetruly see a naked woman in her entirety is like trying to take in the carnage at a traffic accident your brain simply cannot process all the input being channeled like floodwater through your eyes i saw bits of her collarbones like sculpted braces inside a guitar her flat brown oiled belly beaded with pearls of lake water descending to a stark tan line where a lighter brownness descended again to the rough black triangle blurring the wide cleft between her thighs and always her eyes how long did i stare five seconds ten i heard a long reverent whistle from the water below the pier then erins gaze floated above my shoulder and she simply stepped off the pier and dropped into the lake when i turned around and looked up to the house i saw no one but after i reached the car drewe remained silent all the way back to rain uncle harrrrp startled i look away from erin and into the face of holly her daughter what is it punkin wheres your git tar bob chuckles i didnt bring it today play me a sawng commands the threeyearold i cant i guess i could sing one a cappella what do you want to hear blackbirdie she squeals laughing she means blackbird by paul mccartney sometimes patrick whistles birdcalls while i play the song which drives holly into fits of laughter sorry scooter i say i need the git tar for that one whats your second choice barney she screeches christ whispers patrick i thought she got over barney last year uh marg bob says softly didnt you tell me ol barney got killed in a car wreck yesterday what holly asks her eyes round daddy drewe snaps to prevent bloodshed i begin the anthem adored by most humans under three and reviled by most above that age holly sits entranced she actually resembles drewe more than erin the scotsenglish genes apparently overpowered the cajun i give the barney theme a soulgospel ending holly claps and giggles and even margaret lifts the brim of her hat and applauds did you hear about karin wheat my motherinlaw asks me softly while i consider my answer she takes a sip of halfmelted bloody mary shivers and says gruesome i did hear about that i say noncommittally feeling drewes gaze on the back of my neck i was just reading isis margaret goes on ill bet one of her crazy fans killed her that book was chock full of perversion didnt stop you from reading though did it bob snickers whats happening on the porno box harper porno box is bobs nickname for the eros computer same old seven and six i say though i would give a lot to know whether the strobekker account has gone active in the last few hours and if so whether the fbi was able to trace the connection bob shakes his head i still dont get why anybodyeven sex maniacswould pay that much money for a box that wont even transmit pictures actually it will now i tell him there was so much demand for it jan krislov decided to give in ill be damned erin slips on a terry cloth robe and leads holly away from this conversation onto the perfectly manicured lawn bob keeps all eight acres as immaculate as a golf green and does all the work himself i heard on a current affair that the killer cut off her head margaret adds i force myself to look disinterested this is one time im gonna surprise you pinkoliberals bob says with good humor ill guarantee you it was a white man killed that writer woman drewe raises her eyebrows why do you say that cause a nigger dont kill that way bob replies seriously oh theyll cut you or shoot you but its an impulse thing a nigger gets mad quick kills quick gets over it quick hes likely to be feeling sorry about it five minutes after he did it white mans different a white man can nurse a hate a long time a white man likes to hate gives him a mission a reason to live and a murder like that thing in new orleansmutilation i meanit takes a long time to build up an anger like that we are all staring intently at bob anderson course it was new orleans he adds philosophically god knows anything can happen there after a thoughtful silence margaret asks drewe about some policy change at one of the jackson hospitals drewe and patrick both have staff privileges there and strong opinions about the issue every now and then bob chimes in with an unsolicited expert opinion while they banter back and forth my eyes wander back to erin and holly they move like exotic animals over the dappled lawn erin graceful as a gazelle holly like a sprite risen from the grass as i watch i let my eyes take on the thoughtful cast i have practiced so often at this gathering everyone assumes i am thinking about bond trades or commodities before long bob will ask me if i made any killings this week but for now i am granted a dispensation i try to keep my mind clear but the effort is vain as always my secret rises unbidden it is always there beating like a second heart within my brain the ceaseless tattoo grows louder pulsing in my ears throbbing in my temples causing little storms of numbness along my upper forearms these are parasthesias i looked up the symptom late one night in one of drewes medical books parasthesias are caused by extraordinary levels of stress everyone has a different tolerance i suppose what would terrify an equestrienne would not faze a bull rider i have carried my secret for a long time and consequently thought i had learned to live with it like a benign growth of some sort then three months ago i discovered that my secret had far more frightful consequences than i ever imagined that my guilt is far greater than my capacity for rationalization and my skill at deception is crumbling beyond this i have an irrational feeling that my secret has taken on a life of its ownthat it is trying to get out it flutters at the edge of patricks consciousness polishes the fine blade of drewes mistrust i sometimes wonder whether she knows already but lives in a denial based on fear even greater than mine is this possible no drewe could not know this thing and not act look at her sitting in the black iron lawn chair speaking with calm authority words precise back straight green eyes focused erin joins hands with holly as they dance across the grass now closer now farther away they spin like dervishes in the august heat the drone of medicopolitical conversation presses against my eardrums blending with the sound of bobs bees in bobs bushes comparing drewe and erin now i see beyond the physical their innermost differences are stark essential they can be divided by single words drewe is control erin chaos drewe is achievement erin accident erins eyes catch mine for the briefest instant i try to blank my mind to shake my preoccupation and smile but i cannot she spins more slowly her eyes catching mine each time she turns what is in those eyes compassion i believe so in these fleeting moments i sense an intimacy of such painful intensity that it seems almost in danger of arcing between usof ionizing the air dividing our eyes and bodies and letting that which resides separately in both our souls unite as someday it inevitably must what is this power that burns so for unity that threatens to declare itself without invitation what is it but the truth a knowledge that erin and i alone possess of things as they really are and what is the truth of things as they really are holly graham is my daughter chapter did you sense something wrong with patrick asks drewe we are already five miles from her parents house rolling down the twolane blacktop toward our farm which is still ten miles away with every mile we cover my anxiety lessens no i answer he seemed like his usual weekend self glad to be away from the hospital wishing he was playing golf instead of sitting at your parents house drewe clicks her tongue i think he and erin are having problems what i say a little too sharply in fact i know erin and patrick are having problems they seemed fine to me drewe looks at me but thankfully her gaze is only on half power i guess youre right sometimes i just get the feeling that erins new lifeher domesticity i meanis really just a front that in her mind she never really left new york and all that other stuff behind new life its been three years drewe thats a lot of commitment just for an act she smiles youre right god holly gets more beautiful every week doesnt she she sure does and erins so good with her did you hear her jump on daddy about his racism i think she really embarrassed him impossible she punches me on the shoulder i was pretty impressed with you too what do you mean you had holly wrapped around your finger here it comes you know she saysand despite her effort to sound as casual as she did a moment ago i detect the tonal changeive been off the pill over five months now i know exactly how long she has been off the pill i can trace the date by the fight we had when she made this unilateral decision my wife is not one to equivocate when she decides on a goal she takes the shortest path to it in her mind the time has come for us to have children if i am opposed it must be because im nostalgically clinging to my irresponsible youth which is pointless neither of us ever liked using a condom or anything else during sex thus she assumed that when she stopped taking the pill it would be only a matter of weeks until she conceived the first four months were the grace period required for the artificial hormones to be purged from her system at that time she had a vested interestgeneticin keeping our sexual contact to a minimum but we are at the fiveandahalfmonth mark now and despite her confidence in my uncontrollable lust drewe has yet to conceive this is not due to a flaw in her judgment of my character its just that she forgot to reckon eros into her calculations the computer forumsand certain women on themhave proved to be a vicarious but satisfactory outlet for my sexual energy i think drewe suspects this and it accounts for her bitter resentment of the time i spend sysoping the forum you love holly so much she says and i feel her looking right at me i can see it i dont understand why you dont want a child of your own i do want one i say truthfully i want two but what just not yet harper im thirtythree at thirtyfive the odds for downs syndrome and a hundred other things go up dramatically as neutrally as possible i say weve had this discussion before drewe the temperature in the car drops ten degrees and now were having it again when i dont respond she sighs and looks out at the dusty cotton fields drifting by the ocean of white covers the land as far as the eye can see i know im pressuring you she says in measured tones but i just dont understand your reasoning and i hope you never will after a silent mile she says are we ever going to make love again as if the situation isnt complicated enough five minutes after discussing having children and being off the pill she makes a sexual overture that by her tone i am supposed to interpret as passion i do actually miss it you know she says looking straight through the windshield me too i murmur what else can i say doubting my motives i can tell by her voice that she has turned to face me again hearing a rustle of cloth i look across the seat drewe has opened her blouse her bra attaches at the front and she opens that too twice in the past month advances like this have led to serious arguments however her nipples confirm her tone of voice maybe this is an honest approach she turns sideways in her seat lifts one bare foot over the explorers console and lets it fall into my lap she is very good with that foot giggling like a schoolgirl she manages to unfasten the belt snap and zipper of my jeans obviously you miss it too she says they teach you that in medical school in case you have a hand injury mmmhm we practiced on interns the young handsome ones okay okay in one smooth motion she hitches up her sundress and climbs over the console then facing me she plants a foot on either side of my seat and lowers herself between my body and the steering wheel i glance away from the road long enough to see her pull aside her white cotton panties and slide effortlessly down onto me the sudden grating of gravel under the right front tire tells me we are going off the road i jerk the wheel left and look up then floor the accelerator and whip around a mammoth green cotton picker drewe is laughing and kissing my neck and pressing down harder jesus youre ruthless i tell her you can pull out she whispers sure we have been home less than ten minutes when the telephone rings it is bob anderson did we leave something over there i ask feeling my back pocket for my wallet nothing like that bob falls silent after ten seconds or so i ask him if anythings wrong i dont know harp he drawls but fifteen minutes after you left the house bill buckner called the yazoo county sheriff right he told mestrictly as a favorthat he got several longdistance calls last night and again today calls about you shit me bob gives me more of the silent treatment i blink first look dr anderson i can probably guess what this is about he offers nothing weve had a little trouble on the eros network trouble theres been a murder moren one from what bill says bad too drewe is staring at me inquisitively look dr anderson i met with the new orleans police yesterday and im pretty sure everythings under control bill said a couple of the calls were from the fbi i met with them too bob mulls this over at length he says harper do you need help son thanks dr anderson but i really think everythings under control i know a lot of people he says in a voice that makes it clear he does not like talking this way in a lot of places im sure you do and if there was real trouble youd be the first person id call bob waits some more then says well i guess you know best in a tone that says he guesses anything but that you keep me posted son ill do that and you take care of my little girl yes sir i hang up your dad i tell drewe what is it hes worried the yazoo county sheriff called him buckners been getting calls from the fbi asking about me drewe shakes her head her eyes locked on mine god harper do they actually think youre involved in these murders i dont know miles and i are two of only nine people who have access to the real identities of eros subscribers anybody who has that access is a suspect until they can prove theyre innocent that shouldnt be hard for you for three of the murders no and with your help i hope i can prove it for all of them what do you mean youre always here with me when did these murders happen i dont know exactly they started about a year ago most happened within the last nine months the problem is that for the past few months you and i havent been spending that much time together drewe looks away quickly she is an intensely private person and i know she is wondering what i told the police about our relationship harper damn you she closes her hand around my wrist no matter whats going on between us im your alibi dont you know that thank you but the cops wont necessarily believe you ill make them believe me this from a woman who has told women her mothers age that they have less than a year to live friends that their newborn babies are deformed or dying the certainty in her voice is powerful enough to resuscitate my flagging confidence possibly even enough to sway a jury if not the fbi thank you i say again trying to distance my mind from the idea of police questioning drewe your dad offered to use his connections if we need them he must really be upset hes just worried about you does he really have connections high enough to help in something like this she shrugs he knows the governor can a state governor influence the fbi i shake my head i dont know lets hope we never have to find out she goes to the refrigerator and pulls out a lemon pie that a churchy baptist neighbor brought over yesterday drewe was raised methodist but since she rarely attends church her baptist patients never cease trying to pull her into their fold they know im a hopeless case drewe and i attack the pie for a couple of minutes in silence more than making up for the calories we burned in the truck this is sinful she mumbles through a huge bite of pale yellow filling she always scoops out the filling and leaves the crust praise god i manage to reply in a mocking mushmouth she flicks her fork at me plopping a piece of meringue onto my cheek when she laughs her eyes sparkle like stars and in that moment i feel the weight of my secret lift from my shoulders just long enough to sense the lightness of peace then something closes around my heart with suffocating power its like a chinese torture the better things are the worse they are whats the matter drewe is studying me as she might a patient having a sudden stroke nothing i just remembered something i need to take care of a couple of long positions in singapore boring but necessary oh the realization that tomorrow is a workday instantly manifests itself throughout her frame her shoulders hunch slightly her eyelids fall she sighs with resignation but more dispiriting than work is the realization that our unusual moment of closeness is over im whipped she says you coming to bed i shake my head averting my eyes id better check the singapore exchange she looks long enough to let me know she knows i am at least partially lying then she turns and walks toward the bedroom i move quickly toward my office ive got to talk to miles chapter when i check my email i find two messages from miles i click the mouse and open the first seeing the length of the text i push altv to activate the most unique feature on my eros computerits voice the first time i heard eros speak i felt strange then i realized it was not the first time i had heard a computer talk the telephone companys computers had been talking to me for years i had toyed with digital sampling keyboards that could exactly reproduce anything from a thundering bass to a contralto soprano the voice chip inside the eros computer is similar however it is not voicerecognition technology getting a computer to verbalize text displayed on its screen is relatively simple getting one to recognize millions of different voices speaking with hundreds of different accentseven in one languageis currently taxing the best brains in the r and d departments of the worlds top hightech firms eros cannot hear but it does talk its voice can take on any pitch between twenty and twenty thousand hertz which is slightly superfluous since my multimedia speakers bottom out at around one hundred and my rockandrolldamaged eardrums probably top out at ten thousand also the pitch versatility is misleading eross voice is not unlike drewes when she is dictating charts whether i select a baritone or tenor frequency the words will be repeated at that single pitcha perfect monotoneuntil the listener believes he is trapped inside the tincan robot from lost in space and vocal monotony is not conducive to sexual fantasy unless your idea of hot sex is having an interspecies relationship with a machine eross voice program does have whats called a lexical stress feature but it sucks it makes the voice sound like a saxophone played by a drunk who accents all the wrong notes a couple of months ago miles sent me a package containing circuit boards he claimed would give my computer not only a better voice but also the holy grail voicerecognition capability naturally those circuit boards are still sealed inside their antistatic bags in the box they came in for my purposelistening to lengthy email messagesthe droning digital voice eros already has is good enough scanning miless messages i set the frequency to a medium baritonemiless registerand lie down on the twin bed to listen hello snitch heres an update from serial killer central ive finally met the elusive dr arthur lenz and i am impressed though not as impressed as he is with himself if you dont already know and how could you there is a massive bureaucratic battle afoot between the fbi and the various police departments involved in what they are vulgarly calling the eros murders is vulgarly a word i defer to the grammarians on that the instinct of the police i use police collectively for houston san francisco new orleans minneapolis et al is to shut down eros for the foreseeable future this is obviously shortterm thinking they apparently believe that shutting us down will keep strobekker whoever he really is off the playing field the fbi read lenz quite rightly understands that shutting down eros will only send our predator to greener pasturesor at least different ones i give lenz credit for understanding that the digital fields of the lord are quite expansive and that our beast at play is well versed in traveling them segue while writing this i have recalled a bit of high school emerson if the red slayer thinks he slays or if the slain thinks he is slain they know not well the subtle paths i keep and pass and turn again from brahma i believe come to think of it from now on when i refer to the killer i shall call him brahma strobekker makes me picture a pastyfaced minnesotan of swedish descent killing with the same knife he uses during the graveyard shift at the meatpacking plant i think lenz plans to lure brahma to his destruction by somehow manipulating our network the police argue the obvious that every minute eros is up and running is another minute women are at risk but lenz has used your session printouts to good advantage he points out that brahma not only has a recognizable prose style online but also that his messages which are errorfree for eightyfive percent of the exchanges with his victims become full of errors as the dates of the murders approach lenz didnt know why that might be so i decided to throw him a bone i think brahma is using an advanced voicerecognition unit which allows him to simply speak his words rather than type them maybe he works for a computer company and has access to prototype equipment a unit like that might not be easily portable and he probably couldnt use it remotely because of cellular dropouts so when he takes his show on the road hes got to type like everybody else anyway lenz realized that the fbi can use this errorrate flag as an earlywarning system to know when brahma is on the move and women are in imminent danger he also points out that except for karin wheat only women on the blinddraft billing system have been killed so far this group represents a significant but minority number of total female subscribers approximately twentythree percent five hundred seventyeight women lenz also argues that allowing brahma to continue on eros will give the fbi time to track him through the phone lines which agent baxter assures both jan and myself will be but a matter of a day or two the local police departments seem to have a lot of faith in this argument and will probably relent bureaucratic panic always gives weight to the quickfix solution but i dont share baxters faith in the phonetrace strategy brahma has been killing women for some time he had enough forethought to murder a man for his online identity surely he realized that the day would come when the police would attempt to trace him to his lair by phone nestce pas i have my own theories about brahmas modus operandi but i choose not to share them with lenz at this point the time may come when i need bargaining chips with this man ciao hearing miless flamboyant email style repeated by a mindless android voice is singularly unsettling yet even through the insectile drone i heard one thing distinctly miles turner is having fun his second message is much briefer the strobekker account went active under the alias shiva at pm baxters techs traced the call from our office through a couple of internet nodes in the midwest to new jersey through a transatlantic satellite to london then back into new jersey by that time hed dropped off theyre pulling out the stops and theyre faster at it than i thought possible but they dont know much more than they did before they started the atmosphere is like mission impossiblea bunch of guys in suits and ties playing with gadgets do you think brahma wears a tie ciao i roll off the bed and sit down at the eros computer feeling more than a little paranoid i print out hard copies of miless messages then delete them from the computers memory part of me wants to log onto level three and lurk in the background searching for traces of strobekker or shiva or brahma or whoever he is but something has been itching at the back of my brain since i talked to the fbi ever since i realized baxter and lenz might leave eros up and running despite the fact that women are in danger i have friends on eros more than friends and no matter what miles or jan or the fbi think is prudent i have a duty to warn those people my closest friend on eros is a woman who calls herself eleanor rigby her choice of alias was probably influenced by one of the stranger informal customs that has developed on eros for some reason wild or obscure code names like electric blue or leather bitch or phiber phreakso common on other networkswere absent on eros from the beginning it wasnt company policy to discourage them but somehow a loose convention evolved and was enforced by community consensus more a matter of style than anything else apparently eros subscribers prefer their correspondents to possess actual names for aliases rather than surreal quasiidentities all in all i think this has benefited the network it has kept things more human the interesting thing is that while outlandish noms de plume are discouraged the practice of assuming names made famous by literary musical or film works is very popular i frequently see messages addressed from holden caulfield to smilla jaspersen from the marquis de sade to oscar wilde or from elvis presley to polythene pam moreover it seems that at least some of the subscribers choose their famous or infamous pseudonyms to fit their own personalities in the case of eleanor rigbyan alias that belongs to a woman named eleanor caine markhamim positive the name was chosen out of a deep affinity for the character in the beatles song eleanor markham is a moderately successful mystery writer from los angeles who except for a second job rarely leaves her house the same melancholy sense of loneliness that pervades the lennonmccartney tune shadows more than a few of her messages yet eleanors second job seems wholly out of character with this first image to supplement her income she sometimes works as a body double for major actresses who have reached that exalted status where they do not have to agree to remove their clothes onscreen to win roles i know its sexist but i always imagined women who had these jobs as airheaded blondes with exquisite bodies but common faces who spent their days at the spa working on their legs and abs or at their plastic surgeons getting their boobs reinflated i have never seen eleanor markhams faceher mystery novels carry no jacket photosbut everything i have learned about her confirms an opposite truth when eleanor is not exposing her derriere or breasts or whatever for the camera she is sitting in her santa monica beach house writing very literate wry whodunits or talking to anonymous friends via her computer her explanation for these seemingly contradictory lifestyles is that she has a sister who is confined to a wheelchair for life by spinal injuries received in a traffic accident eleanor feels her sacred duty is to take care of this sister as her parents would have were they still alive i cannot fault her reasoning all that said let me confess the obvious eleanor rigby is my online lover my digital squeeze what do i know about her other than what ive already revealed she is thirty years old she has never had plastic surgery she describes her face not as plain but as realmore audrey hepburn than michelle pfeiffer but not as ethereal as audrey she has a wit like a razor and she is uniquely gifted at describing sex in words she is also generous eleanor knows that twoway conversations are fine for foreplay but that typing requires the use of at least one hand thus when she is getting me off she is quite willing to type endless lines of charged erotica until the moment that i signal her with a relieved and heartfelt banality such as wow i return the favor in a different way eleanor does not usually stimulate herself while online she prefers that i compose lengthy email messages that she can print out and peruse free from any constraints on time or dexterity im sure the proximity of her disabled sister has something to do with this this is also why eleanor is registered to eros on a blinddraft account she apparently reads many of my printed messages while locked in the bath tonight i query her the moment i log on eleanor frequently lurks in silence eavesdropping on the conversations of others searching for material for her novels she tells me and so is often present when i send out my usual query i type harper father mackenzie calling eleanor is the only eros client with whom i use my real name there is a delay of thirty seconds or so then eleanor rigby hello harper dear what are you in the mood for harper i need to talk to you eleanor rigby talk as in talk g the g symbol stands for grin the lines preceding and following a word indicate emphasis in place of italics harper yes just talk meet me in room eleanor rigby hmm i guess the little woman talked you into it this week eh yes like a corporeal mistress eleanor knows my marital situation some of it anyway with a twinge of guilt i mouse into the private room designated room and type harper no present erection thank you eleanor rigby too bad should i sharpen up my pencil harper no this is serious eleanor rigby how ominous is this a dear john letter harper no eleanor rigby well then harper you must keep what i am about to tell you absolutely between us eleanor rigby my lips are sealed and if you make a horrid male pun i shall disconnect harper youre in danger eleanor she doesnt respond for several beats eleanor rigby what kind of danger harper physical danger theres been i am typing but suddenly nothing is going through to eleanor i stare at the screen in puzzlement until this message appears in large block letters shame on you snitch my puzzlement turns to fury this message can only be from miles and its sudden insertion into my private chat with eleanor tells me something that makes my blood boil miles has the ability to read my private communications whenever he pleases i blink as further characters appear sorry to intrude but we cant have you scaring the paying customers loose cannon and all that please find some other way to get eleanor off the net if you must ciao the next words that appear are eleanor rigby what just happened she must not have seen miless message i type harper a glitch in my modem what now do i ignore miles go ahead and warn eleanor and a few others my anger says yes but what will be the result a networkwide panic probably eleanor and i are very close but she has a writers imagination and love of drama could she really keep secret the possibility that there is a murderer stalking the female clients of eros eleanor rigby you said i was in danger physical danger what were you talking about harper you misunderstood that was the start of a fantasy file i wrote for you this morning it was sort of a mata hari thing spies and sex with you in the lead role eleanor rigby well if thats the case send it through harper my modems on the blink pretty embarrassing for the sysop isnt it ill have it fixed by tomorrow ill put the file through then sorry to interrupt you for nothing eleanor rigby wait harper i hate to confess this but knowing you dont need me right now makes me need you could you possibly conjure up some stimulating prose for a lonely yearold spinster with an itch harper you mean realtime eleanor rigby yes harper unusual for you how stimulating eleanor rigby my sister is at a film with her one friend i have the house all to my selfish self please make it hot enough for an online conclusion ie once we get to the good stuff please dont stop until i signal with a shriek of ecstasy i pause trying to rein in my thoughts i honestly dont feel like this tonight especially after drewe and i had our actualreality interlude in the explorer but eleanor has done me this favor many nights harper romantic or dangerous eleanor rigby romantic and dangerous harper all right we are finally meeting face to face seeing each other for the first time eleanor rigby where harper the peabody hotel memphis tennessee were in the lobby a huge open room with a bar and a grand piano and ducks and tons of atmosphere eleanor rigby ducks harper symbol of the hotel trust me eleanor rigby oh i do harper im not as handsome as you have imagined me but you arent disappointed i have a certain power over you that you didnt expect you want to please me and this makes you a little angry you understand eleanor rigby perfectly what do you think of me harper mercy fuck eleanor rigby harper harper sorry youre more beautiful than i imagined your bodydoubles body was a given but your symmetry still surprises me petite and your face more feminine than i could envision eleanor rigby feminine how harper the blend of curve and angle softs and hards cheek and jaw defined brows nebulous eyes dusk is falling on the memphis streets over the river yellow lamps come up inside and light you like a painters hand eleanor rigby what am i wearing harper white linen appropriate for a deflowering eleanor rigby you give me far too much credit g harper i intend to boldly go where no man has gone before eleanor rigby dare i ask harper no eleanor rigby yummy harper i see shadows of your nipples through the linen they look more brown than pink eleanor rigby how do you like my breasts harper champagneglass size exquisitely shaped eleanor rigby what do we talk about harper inanities eleanor rigby how long do we talk harper not very weve said all we have to say on eros havent we eleanor rigby do we diddle under the table victorian teasing harper no i sign the suite number on the bill and lead you by the hand across the highceilinged lobby to the bank of elevators in the elevator we kiss for the first time eleanor rigby a long kiss harper when the door opens were still kissing an older couple is staring at us like we are crazy eleanor rigby im already wet harper not yet eleanor rigby im speaking in the present tense dear offline harper fine but were not going to rush when the stupid credit card key finally works i pull you inside the room but do not turn on the light eleanor rigby we havent been in the suite until now harper no before you can say anything i close the door and slip past you in the darkness pulling my shoes off as i walk you call out to me but i dont answer i hear you bang your foot into a chair you curse were going to play a game i say what kind of game you ask i stop typing for a few moments letting the images flow freely in my head harper a hunting game i reply im going to hunt you in the dark suite and the first rule is we cant talk to each other even when i find you we cannot speak and theres another catch i should have mentioned it earlier but well theres another person in the room what you ask nervously who dont be frightened heor sheis standing silentlyor sittingsomewhere in the room but only watching how you ask simple hes wearing a nightvision headset i brought to the hotel during the afternoon you giggle nervously but im not joking this person can see us right now and will watch us when i finally find you you dont believe me let down the top of your dress a few seconds later a whispered voice from across the room says beautiful i can almost feel your heart stutter from the shock stay calm i say reassuringly this person is merely an observer all right you stammer far from your normally confident self but who is it you wonder who is it maybe its your sister i say you bastard you hiss maybe its a bellboy i paid a hundred bucks to come upstairs and watch a beautiful woman having sex do you want to go on i ask yes you say softly even if you are seen i can do anything in the dark you say even if the whole city is watching and so we begin the hunt how do you feel now eleanor rigby toi bbusy otype harper please do your best to evade me i tell you but you should know that ill be getting a bit of direction from our guest heshe will whisper warmer or colder every so often you do not answer and so i begin the hunt the first thing i hear is silence blood beating in my ears the suite is large i move deeper into the bedroom to give you room to move then i wait motionless for two minutes i sense you becoming more tense with each passing second you cannot hear me very softly i remove my clothes i feel the air along my body especially on the places usually covered i go down on all fours allowing my body to cover more floor space increasing my odds of touching you if you try to slip past me i move slowly at first colder whispers our guest i change direction where are you i ask in a singsong voice warmer says our guest instinct tells me my back is a few feet from the far corner of the room you are not behind me slowly and soundlessly i work my way across the carpet pausing occasionally to listen and to try to feel any movement of air against my skin nothing theres not much floor space left to cover could you have climbed onto one of the beds no id have heard you wait a rustle of cloth ahead of me a few feet away is she naked i ask no reply i freeze there is water running in the bathroom the sound like a distant cataract in the silence i rise and move quickly toward the soundtoo quicklyand bash my head against the door frame im in the bathroom now but you arent steam coats my face and body like jungle humidity when i reach to shut off the tap i scald my hand yet even as i curse i realize i smell you in the blackness the female smell strongly enough that i suspect you have left this as a calling card this is not turning out the way id planned as i move out of the bathroom something swishes past me in the dark strangely it seemed larger than me then i hear the bathroom door close i try the handle but its locked are you really inside or is this a diversion where is she i ask the darkness no answer warmer or colder i ask nothing then through the bathroom door i hear new sounds a woman softly moaning a man rhythmically groaning first i think you are teasing me confused i feel my way to the wall and break a rule switch on the light my assistant is gone the noises are louder it sounds as though you are using my draftee in the bathroom and have locked me out this isnt what i had in mind at all but you sound like youre having the time of your life i ask what you are doing but he answers insolently she cant talk with her mouth full suddenly i am angry i kick the door twice near the knob and it splinters open flooding the bathroom with light at first glance i feel relief seeing that you still have your linen dress on but a millisecond later the positions register youre sitting on the edge of the tub and you have your hand around him and are working diligently though your eyes are locked on mine and he seems very close to release its the least i could do for him you say but what youre really saying is that you have no intention of letting me manipulate you with some kinky game like this and im standing there with a stupid look on my face while you finish him and he groans and you look into my eyes with barefaced defiance while he squirts copiously and again and you run your hands under the bath tap while he slips out the door of the room but not before he gives me a look like you must be an idiot to share this lady with anybody and then you lift the linen dress over your head and say take me to the bed please so i do this is finally lovemaking as you are eleanor rigby shriek of ecstasy im done i know that was quick but i was reading some pretty steamy threads before you queried at least your fingers wont be too sore harper i was just getting to the good part the part ive really fantasized about eleanor rigby sorry you shouldnt have let me near that insolent voyeurbellboystranger he was huge in my hand by the way i dont like that in intercourse fyi but since i was merely servicing him manually i liked that my hand wouldnt nearly go all the way around the thickest part of him harper youre embellishing my scenario eleanor rigby certainly dear dont feel threatened he was huge but dumb as a doorpostas well as being hard as one g harper feeling better i take it eleanor rigby lovely although i consider that subject sacred to be honest harper what eleanor rigby our first ff meeting i would never want a third person present for that harper sorry if i tainted your fantasy i should have realized eleanor rigby no its fine but you are my secret friend harper that is sacred to me you have no idea harper i do have an idea eleanor you know that eleanor well dont be a stranger it was too long between rendezvous this time meet me tomorrow harper well talk soon and alone this time eleanor i like that better bye harper bye i thrust my chair away from the keyboard and focus on the sculpture of my fathers coat why would i thrust someone between myself and eleanor like that i suddenly want to warn her again but i know miles is looking over my virtual shoulder and then i realize something very disturbing the bellboy in the bathroom was miles what the hell is going on in my brain and how long has that son of a bitch been spying on my email everythings under control i hear myself saying to bob anderson who do i think im kidding ive been lying in bed less than five minutes when it hits me miles has made a far more serious mistake than reading my email and ive got to tell him about it its an hour later in new york but i dont really give a damn hes usually awake all night anyway monitoring level three after four rings he answers turner in a voice that makes it clear he does not like being bothered by mere human beings how long have you been spying on my email shithead i hear a soft laugh dont worry i hardly ever look but since you started talking to the fbi i figured you might be getting antsy about warning some of your online friends which you definitely do not need to do theyre in no danger well skip that argument for now i want to know how youve been reading my mail ive never been able to access yours another laugh but you tried right there are a couple of system privileges you dont have harper one is called superpostmaster its like the postmaster privilege but it gives you access to sysop mail as well even jans mail what if strobekker got the victims real names by hacking into a sysop account into superpostmaster miles hesitates i dont think thats possible but im still assessing the system it would have taken only one deep penetration to get the master client list and it could have happened months ago that makes forensic analysis of the disks very difficult but you dont know it was only one penetration if hes in the system now and he has the superpostmaster privilege that means he could have read your messages to me which would tell him the fbi was onto him there is a long silence brahma is not in the system now but even if he were he could only have read my messages during the interval between my posting them and your picking them up unless you saved them to a file did you do that no i printed hard copies and deleted them what time did you do that just before i talked to eleanor so stop worrying and get off my case all it would take is basic postmaster for brahma to read your warning to eleanor miles is right you just stop looking over my shoulder goddamn it i cant guarantee that at least hes honest miles i want the superpostmaster privilege and any others i dont know about i cant give you that jan has already blocked your access to the accounting database what what did you expect harper listen to me if strobekker or brahma or whoever is still roaming our system ive got to know i can see everything he can if i cant im off eros as of now let me think about it the fbi phone traces are going nowhere but ive been going back over some of brahmas old email how did you get that i pulled it out of your computer what dont get your panties in a wad it was necessary ive got other sources too the thing is brahmas using an anonymous remailer for his email what does that mean in practical terms regular email is traceable you can look at the packet headers and get a user name or at least take backbearings and get a rough physical location but brahma doesnt use the erosmail feature he sends his email to our servers via the anonymous remailer which is in finland and then through the internet the remailer strips off his address and adds a random one i spoke to its operator about a half hour ago have you told the fbi oh sure were like boris and natasha here man can they get info on brahma from the remailing service theres a precedent for getting cooperation from the police in some countries in extreme cases but the guy who runs this service sounded like a wild man a real anarchist hes probably destroying all his records right now thats why brahma chose him obviously brahmas a clever boy harper too clever for baxters techs i fear miles is clearly enjoying himself weve still got fbi agents camped out up here theyre guarding our file vault like its the tomb of christ waiting for the time lock to open and give them the master client list great now were back to where we were when you changed the subject give me the superpostmaster privilege or im shutting down my eros interface he doesnt answer for some time then he says type siddhartha after your password at the sysop prompt got it siddhartha as in the herman hesse novel as in the buddha but thats close enough i think youve gone weird on me man i always was harper you know that ciao and he is gone i sit thinking in the soft glow of the eros screen siddhartha brahma i dont know or care much about eastern religions but miles certainly seems to and though i do not know the significance of this or whether it has significance at all i am suddenly reminded of drewes speculation about oriental medicine and the use of bizarre trophies to restore vitality i always related such things to japan and buddha fits with japan though the buddha himself was indian brahma and shiva make me think of india too i remember from my meeting in new orleans that the only murder victim who was not caucasian was indian also that an indian hair was found at one of the crime scenes i see no tangible links between these facts yet i know too well that my knowledge of such things does not even rate as sketchy they could easily be connected just beyond my myopic mental vision life would be much simpler if the fbi could follow a trail of digital bread crumbs back to the lair of the killer but miles has little faith that this will happen and something tells me he is right that we have yet to make out even the silhouette of the creature behind these murders i hunted when i was a boy i gave it up the day my cousin put four number shotgun pellets into my right calf it was a late february afternoon and wed gotten separated i was following what i thought was a rabbit into a thicket my cousin heard a noise and thought fate had handed him an outofseason deer i dont blame him for shooting five seconds later and i might have shot him neither of us could see what we were after thats the way it goes sometimes but ive often wondered what would have happened had it been something other than rabbits we were chasing a bear say something that would have seen me lying there bleeding on the ground and come over to finish the job thats the way it goes sometimes too it all depends on the quarry you choose to hunt chapter dear father panikkar telephoned early this morning saying he had to see me i feared the worst and i was not far wrong when he arrived i was in the basement settling jenny in after i came up i found him waiting in the study with kali panikkar told me that he and bhagat had endured all they couldhis words i expected next to hear him say that he had gone to the police who would arrive at any minute how wrong i was instead of delivering a sermon of moral outrage he demanded more money he must have thought i was ripe for fleecing with the procedure so close the mendacity of man is his undoing i was prepared to pay but when panikkar mentioned the amount it stunned me as i tried to explain my position i saw movement in the shadows behind him like a mantis kali swung her thin brown arm over his shoulder and plunged her dagger into his belly there was nothing i could do it was plain from the spray that the first stroke had pierced the abdominal descending aorta before i could utter three sentences she had eviscerated him while panikkar stared at his butchered belly in horror true to her namesake kali removed his head and hung it by the hair from her belt i realized how dangerous this development was of course but it was oddly satisfying after all panikkars grousing thank god it was him rather than bhagat anesthesia is a nice luxury especially for the patient in future i can do the typing myself i feared that when panikkar did not contact bhagat with news of our meeting bhagat would go to the police but kali knew what to do she called bhagat and told him the procedure would be performed tonight as planned bhagat asked to speak to panikkar but kali told him panikkar was busy with me in the basement she said bhagat could collect the bonus that panikkar had negotiated but only after the procedure was completed when bhagat expressed anxiety kali told him to park outside the rear door panikkar would assure him that all was well when bhagat pulled up kali switched on the interior light and held panikkars severed head up to our door window on a pole from outside all bhagat saw was panikkars face which was never very animated anyway and a beckoning hand the fool parked his car and entered with a smile kali sat him down and explained in their language what had transpired all the while with panikkars head hanging from her belt the expression on bhagats face defied description not a word passed his lips when he rose to leave kali informed him that the procedure would proceed as scheduled he had two hours to rest before getting into his scrubs panikkar be damned tonight i go in chapter i come awake expecting to see fine blue lines of daylight around my heavy window blinds but there is only darkness my telephone is ringing i have to get up to answer it sweat cools on my skin as i feel my way across the airconditioned office to the phone hello is this hopper school asks a whisper of a voice what the whisper gets louder is this harper cole yes who the hell is this if youre a cop call me in the morning im not a cop the voice sounds nervous nervous and young im sleeping what do you want this is david charles do you remember me no you talked to me a couple of times on the phone im one of the techs at eros my eyes click open yeah i remember you no you dont thats okay im one of miless assistants what can i do for you david im not sure i just thought id better talk to you you know the fbi is up here right yes trying to do phone traces yeah the atmosphere is really tense theyve got agents guarding the file vault and miles is acting really weird hes pretty paranoid about the government im listening well the thing is your access to the accounting database was cut off right yes jan krislov ordered that if im not mistaken you are miles did it i mean he told me to do it i feel a strange giddiness what are you trying to tell me david well i just thought you should know about two hours ago i realized that another blinddraft account had been terminated for insufficient funds it happened this morning it belonged to a woman i feel my mouth go dry named rosalind may shes from mill creek michigan at first i didnt think anything about it but then i realized she was on a list i saw in miless office shit it was a list of blinddraft women who havent been logging on but are still paying their fees there are about fifty of them anyway i decided to check and see whether may had logged on at all in the last few months she seemed to lose interest about three months ago but then i saw that shed logged on every night for five nights starting last week she dropped off again two nights ago and then today her secret account was overdrawn like she needed to make a deposit but wasnt around to do it you know yes i know and the thing is miles hasnt told the fbi yet jesus and since he hasnt told them charles says hesitantly i dont feel too good about walking up to these suits and volunteering the information you know i figured since you first reported the murders you might know how to handle it the weight of this information is too great to absorb quickly harper you were right to call me david ill take care of it you will wow okay man the relief in the techs voice is palpable look i gotta go miles is all over the office right now i dont think hes been to sleep in like fifty hours try to get him to rest i say uselessly yeah okay i will and uh try to keep me out of this okay he hangs up i switch on my halogen desk lamp and dig through my wallet for daniel baxters card i dial the number before i have time to secondguess myself investigative support unit quantico says a crisp female voice i need to speak to daniel baxter immediately your name harper cole its about the eros case hold please a muzak confection of old carpenters tunes assaults my ears for nearly two minutes before baxter comes on the line an outoftune violin is still ringing in my head when he says cole what you got its five am i say looking at my desk clock you work all night its six am here what you got im pretty busy youre about to be a lot busier baxter catches his breath spit it out son i just learned that another blinddraft account went to zero it was terminated today it belonged to a woman jesus christ not this soon you got a name rosalind may mill creek michigan rosalind like in shakespeare or rosalynn like rosalynn carter i dont know howd you find out about it i remember david charless plea for protection worry about that later cant you just check the name ill do it right now anything else i should know no as soon as you find out anything please give me a call i mean immediately you owe me that much ill buzz you im going to call the mill creek pd right now i get up from the halogen glow and walk down the hall to check on drewe she left the bedroom door open when she went to bed a good sign as she snores softly i discern her face in the moonlight trickling through the window her mouth is slightly open her skin luminous in the shadows i dont know how long i stand there but the muted chirping of my office phone snaps me out of my trance and i slip quickly back up the hall to get it this is harper its bad cole my blood pressure drops so rapidly i grab the desk to steady myself shes dead worse what whats worse than dead rosalind may has been missing for fifty to sixty hours thats rosalind with a d two nights ago she was dropped off at her home by a date at eleven pm sometime during the night she apparently let someone into her house or else voluntarily left to meet them she hasnt been seen since in my experience thats worse than dead it means very painful things oh god you think it was our guy strobekker baxter hesitates i dont know id say yes but theres one thing that doesnt fit one very big thing what rosalind may is fifty years old she has two grown sons all the other victims were twentysix or under except karin wheat i remind him she was fortyseven yeah and one other thing what this unsub left a note the police didnt find it until last night one of their detectives decided to poke through her computer there was eros software on the drive i cut in no just like the other cases anyway this michigan detective was poking through her computer and he found a wordperfect file he couldnt read it was encrypted not digitally it was in french french youre sure the unsub left it you tell me the translations about a paragraph long but the end of it reads the dawn is breaking on a new world a jungle world in which the lean spirits roam with sharp claws if i am a hyena i am a lean and hungry one i go forth to fatten myself mean anything to you the skin on the back of my neck is tingling yes i mean i recognize the passage its henry miller the porn author miller wasnt really a porn author not as you think of it but thats not important the passage is from tropic of cancer how do you know that nobody here did dr lenz must not be there he would have known it youre right hes out of pocket just now tropic of canceris a classic of erotic literature im sure its still in print which means anybody could walk into a bookstore and buy one probably not any bookstore not the chains youd probably find it in stores that cater to a literary crowd or else in erotic bookstores thanks that helps what kind of killer leaves notes in french mr baxter you ever see that before never the translator in michigan said it was probably written by a highly educated french native very elegant he said ive sent it to a psycholinguistics specialist at syracuse he wont be able to look at it before morning though the mill creek police arent telling the press about the note by the way theyre using it to screen false confessions hey im not talking to a soul ive got a really bad feeling about this one he says almost to himself why i ask not admitting that i have the same feeling the unsub has killed all the other victims at the scenes now he takes one away no signs of violence if this is our guyand my gut tells me it ishes varying his behavior more than any killer ive ever seen he could be starting to come apart to lose control of whats driving him but i dont think so he seems able to choose whatever crime signature he wants which means hes not driven beyond the point of control if you hadnt called with rosalind mays name we never would have connected this crime to the others you understand too well i appreciate the help cole its nice to know someone at eros realizes were the good guys i say nothing talked to your friend turner lately no i mean not directly he sent me some email nothing important baxter waits right what will you do now pray he makes a mistake chapter dear father the procedure failed that is not wholly accurate i was prevented from finishing by an unrelated accident as kali brought out the patient she showed signs of hysteria unlike the navy girl jenny who adapted quickly this one seemed not to have settled her nerves since we took her kali told me privately that jenny had attempted to calm and reassure may during the night quite ironic considering the respective fates that awaited them but the older woman would not be comforted id had to sedate her at gunpoint the first night to get her to sleep at all i took the precaution of using curare prior to jennys euthanization to prevent her screaming or making any other sounds that might alarm may but it was no use as bhagat and kali struggled to get may onto the table she spied a few drops of blood that had resulted from jennys procedure she began to shriek and flail using her bound hands like a club even kali could not frighten her into submission it was then that i made my mistake i imagined that if i explained the simplicity of the procedure and the remarkable benefits that would likely accrue to her because of it may would calm down but my speech had the opposite effect when she heard me explain the necessity of opening the sternum her face went white and she gripped her left arm needless to say i attempted to save her but it was useless in four minutes she was dead she died of a massive myocardial infarction and no one could have been more surprised than i there were no relevant risk factors in her history as unscientific as it may sound i believe the woman died of pure terror when she flatlined doubt assailed me like a shadow should i stop should i go on then i thought of ponce de leon thrashing through the buginfested jungles of florida fighting the mosquitoes and the mud and the alligators and the natives and disease searching ever searching for the mystical mythical fountain of youth how the image of it must have burned inside his brain gushing with pure shining water liquid with restorative power holding out its promise to mankind the possibility of revoking gods harshest decree and all the time that poor spaniard was carrying the true fountain with him inside his head millimeters from the very space where his seductive vision burned we know that now soon i shall stand alone at the pinnacle of the species the only man with the courage to reach into the fountain soon i shall spit in the face of god chapter its tenthirty am and i am tired of talking to cops houston cops la cops oregon cops san francisco cops mill creek michigan cops ive repeated the same story i told the new orleans police and the fbi so many times that i know it like the lords prayer and to detectives who seemed to be writing each word with the slowness of fourth graders practicing penmanship stupid sons of bitches i shout to my empty office you never heard of tape recorders i feel a little better some of the cops i talked to want to arrest me i could tell me miles and the other seven people who have access to the master client list all of them asked why we havent shut down eros and some yelled while they asked me the michigan cops were the worst probably because theyre dealing with a kidnapping rather than a murder i referred them all to daniel baxter of the fbi let them take their complaints to the great stone face when the phone rings again i grab it as if to smash it against my desk but i restrain myself and put it to my ear harper its me drewes voice is tight with pentup emotion what is it what happened a lot of things a wave of heat rolls up my back and neck as an image of erin flashes in my mind where are you womans hospital can you talk what is it the fbi she says quietly what they called you no they called my bosses they called my friends what and not just the fbi a detective from new orleans called the hospital administrator and asked permission to question colleagues about me mayeuxwhat kind of questions are they asking embarrassing ones do i drink heavily do i ever bring you around the hospital or even to jackson how you and i get along why dont we have any kids her voice cracks slightly at that harper this is not acceptable i know babe goddamn it ill try to see if i can do something about it youve got to do something about it my world isnt isolated like yours the good opinion of these people is a prerequisite for keeping my privileges i get the message drewe let me make some phone calls please do that im being paged and she is gone let me make some phone callsi said it with such confidence who the hell was i kidding am i going to call a new orleans homicide detective and say listen shrimphead leave my wife alone or take the fucking consequences no am i going to call bob anderson and say dr anderson it turns out i actually cant take care of your little girl so could you please call the governor and ask him to get the fbi off our backs hell no am i going to call the fbi and say could you please stop questioning my wife about this murder case she doesnt like it maybe i take baxters card from my wallet punch in the number of quantico and ask for agent baxter special agent baxter is in the field at this time says a robotic female voice would you like to leave voice mail i decide to wake her up my name is harper cole i say too loudly i met with baxter and dr lenz about the karin wheat murder and they told me to call immediately if i remembered anything vital to the case well i have where are you mr cole says a slightly less controlled voice home and i dont have much time the voice finally becomes human could you give me your number please mr cole baxter has it i snap and hang up the phone that ought to light a fire under somebody i sit down at the eros computer log in as sysop and begin scanning the level two messages as they are posted eros traffic is basically unmoderated which means we sysops do not screen or censor the communications of clients this freedom is what allows miles and me to run the busy service without much help certain types of communication are prohibited on eros and they are filtered by a simple but efficient program designed by miles he calls it ward cleaver as messages are posted to the various areas of our servers ward automatically searches out all binary graphic files and references to children and deposits them in a special file called the dumpster actually ward lost his graphic filter three weeks ago at his leisure miles then attemptsusually with successto track down the originators of these forbidden files he doesnt turn them over to the cops or anything he just likes letting them know he can find them theoretically im supposed to be monitoring the various areas of eros on a roundrobin basis doing what i can to assist new clients and helping to foster a sense of online community but in the past few weeks i have become rather casual about that duty more than a few of this mornings messages are about karin wheats death the themes are consistent shock denial anger of course none of the authors of these messages has any idea that karin was an eros client they knew her only through her novels which would interest most eros clients as they dealt with the darker side of the human psyche when my phone rings i pick it up prepared to give daniel baxter a piece of my mind but instead i find myself listening to the flat vowels of dr arthur lenz youve remembered something of value mr cole he says wheres baxter hes not available just now where are you doctor is that relevant did you go to minnesota to see strobekkers body exhumed do you doubt that i did i think you went straight to new york to try to crack jan krislov didnt you as a matter of fact i personally observed the postmortem on david strobekker was he missing his pineal gland oddly enough no now what was the purpose of your call am i a prime suspect in these murders doctor lenz pauses youre a suspect yes why you have access to eross master client list that makes you a member of a very exclusive group have you got access to the list yet no maybe i can help you how maybe i have a copy of the list do you or dont you its my turn to play coy what do you want lenz asks i want the fbi to stop hassling my wife ah daniels agents can be clumsy on occasion they are causing you problems theyre bothering my wife at work i see and anybody who bothers my wife de facto pisses me off yes what can you do about that lenz says nothing for a while you realize i could go public with all this at any time i tell him that would only aggravate the very situation you seek to alleviate the disruption of your wifes life would increase exponentially hes right of course but perhaps i can be of assistance he says its true that the various police departments involved in the caseparticularly the michigan departmentare ready to have both you and mr turner arrested i however do not share their enthusiasm get to it doctor i think perhaps we can help each other mr cole if you will agree to help me in a limited capacity i think i could have both bureau and police pressure removed from your life what kind of capacity i want the master client list of course can you get it maybe ill take that as a no damn this guy why take that as a no if you had a copy of your own you would have destroyed it by now and you no longer have access to the accounting database which you would need to get a new copy how does he know that however you still have something i want whats that your thoughts what and then he tells me how long he has been planning this i dont know maybe this was the whole point of putting pressure on drewe of not throwing me to the michigan police because lenz wants exactly what they want to fly me up to washington so he can question me with no one else around he says something about an informal version of his standard criminalprofiling technique but i dont really listen we both know the bottom line if i want the pressure taken off ive got to play his game how soon do you want to do this ill have a ticket for you waiting in jackson mississippi its tenfifty can you get to the airport by noon noon today of course if i drop everything and walk out the front door without a toothbrush then i remember drewes voice tight with anxiety yeah i can get there you think theres a flight if there isnt a direct flight youll find a connecting ticket ask for messages at the american airlines desk okay id better get going just a moment at the meeting in new orleans you mentioned that eros is patronized by many celebrities i cant tell you any names fine fine but what level of celebrities are we talking about well karin wheat was pretty famous yes but authors dont get the kind of adulation that hollywood stars or sports figures do not many sports figures on eros doctor the iq level tends to run a little higher than that so what level of star are we talking about the top of the business and not just actors directors producers agents the works he digests this in silence arent you any different from the paparazzi doctor i thought you were trying to solve these murders not root up juicy tidbits about hollywood in all honesty i find the whole concept of eros fascinating however there is a point to my questions jan krislov refuses to reveal anything about her clients thanks to you i realize she is not grandstanding but prudently shielding people who have a great vested interest in protecting their public images people who would not hesitate to sue ms krislov and have the funds to pursue such a lawsuit to its bitter end no doubt about it hell there are celebrity lawyers on that master client list jan krislov is a lot of things but shes no fool do you have any more eros session printouts lenz asks no more of the murder victims or strobekker ill take anything you have im following a rather twisted trail and id like all the signposts i can get ill bring you what i have excellent lenz says hell fax me directions to his office in case i miss the fbi agents he plans to have waiting at the washington airport then he says may i give you some unsolicited advice mr cole people do it all the time youre an experienced futures trader however if i were you id clear my current positions dump all contracts until this mess is resolved youre not me quite well ill see you this afternoon while lenzs fax comes through i call drewe in jackson and explain what im about to do and why she warns me to be careful then goes back to her patients i pack a briefcase with a toothbrush five hundred dollars in cash and a few eros folders from my file cabinet before i leave the office i almost pick up the phone and follow lenzs advice getting out of the market now would cost me money but thats not what keeps me from doing it the truth is i feel a simple bullheaded resistance to letting arthur lenz tell me what to do if i lose a few thousand bucks because im in a daze so be it its happened before i am almost to the explorer when i remember lenzs fax running back inside to get it i hear the phone its my office line i debate whether or not to answer then pick up hello moneypenny this is bond james bond what is it miles im in a hurry brahma went back online five minutes ago have they traced the call yes and no they took a chance and started at the second jersey line they wound up at last time att long line anyway the connection twisted all around the country but they finally tracked it to wyoming wyoming yeah place called lake champion its a tiny little nothing of a town i feel my heart pumping so are they going to arrest him or what not that easy im afraid youre not going to believe this lake champion wyoming is one of the last towns in america with electromechanical phone switching its like the dark ages they actually have these complicated metal gizmos that spin around making physical connections and there are rows and rows of them stacked on top of each other from floor to ceiling what does that mean as far as tracing brahma miles chuckles softly it means it takes an actual human being running up and down the aisles between those switches to trace the connections with digital tracing you can move through twenty states in a couple of minutes without getting permission from anybody but to authorize an actual human being to chase down mechanical connections in one of these little towns you have to have a court order what miles is laughing harder heres the brilliant part to get that court order you have to prove that a crime is being committed in the state where that town is its one hell of a buffer system and brahma knows it rather than going higher and higher techwhich is what most hackers do and which is ultimately a nowin gamehe goes to the simplest possible solution he goes analog its exactly what id do man exactly what id do so what happens now baxter is strongarming a wyoming judge as we speak trying to get permission for a local yokel phone guy to do the trace how long will that take hello miles sighs with almost sexual satisfaction your question just became academic the strobekker account just went dead brahmas history miless voice rises to the exaggerated bellow of a game show announcer the switches in wyoming are no longer connected i picture bluesuited fbi agents in the eros office staring at miles with murder in their eyes what alias was he using kali this time i havent seen that one before cali nok ali whos kali the hindu mother goddess consort of shiva which is one of his other aliases kalis an ugly black bitch wears a belt of skulls carries a severed head and a knife has six arms shes the betrayer the terrible one of many names weird that hed log on with a female alias severed head christ are you an expert in this eastern stuff or what ive dabbled read the vedas the upanishads some other things they make a lot more sense than the chickenshit dualism of christianity you know you really should i dont have time for it miles neither do i someone just told me the wise and wonderful oz wants me on another line oz arthur lenz hes the man behind the curtain on this thing isnt he i guess ive got to run miles keep me posted but use my answering machine not email dont sweat it nobody reads my email if i dont want them to not even god i tear off lenzs fax and run for the explorer i believe nobody reads miless email if he doesnt want them to but what im thinking as i crank the engine is this maybe somebody should chapter i am crossing the washington beltway in a yellow taxi driven by a black lay preacher lenz told me i would be met at dulles airport by fbi agents but none showed so i took the cab the driver tries to make conversationhe still knows a lot of people from down home meaning the southbut i am too absorbed in the object of my journey to keep up my end of the exchange lenzs private office is supposed to be in mclean virginia all i know is that my lay preacher is leading me deep into upscale suburbia old money suburbia colonial homes mercedeses beemers series matched lexi tasteful retail and office space the driver pulls into the redbrick courtyard of a threestory building and stops you could probably buy five acres of delta farmland for the monthly rent on lenzs office the first floor of the building is deserted but for ferns its walls covered with abstract paintings that look purchased by the square yard a bronzelettered notice board directs me to the third floor when the elevator door opens on three i am facing a short corridor with a door at the end no letters on the door beyond the door i find a small wellappointed waiting room theres a lot of indirect light but the only window faces the billing office a darkskinned receptionist sits behind the window i am not looking at her im looking at a pale gangly longhaired young man folded oddly across a wing chair and ottoman he is snoring miles i say softly he does not stir a hewlettpackard notebook computer and a cellular telephone lie on the floor beside him the computer screen swirls with a psychedelic screensaver program miles the snoring stops miles turner flips the hair out of his eyes and looks up at me without surprise his eyes are the same distant blue they have always been hello snitch he says whats in the briefcase the names of everybody who works at eros fresh underwear what the hell are you doing here same as you i guess the mad doctor wants to pry open my skull see what he can find i hope hes in the mood for drama i certainly am i cant believe you agreed to come a fleeting smile touches his lips didnt have any choice did i ive got an old drug charge hanging over my head all lenz has to do is tell his sidekickbaxterto push the button and i go to jail do not pass go et cetera jesus miles leans his angular head back with a theatrical flourish and tries to catch the eye of the receptionist i take the opportunity to study him more closely its been four years since i saw him in the flesh miles long ago vowed never to set foot in mississippi again when i saw him last in new orleans he had short hair and wore fairly conservative clothes no polo or khakis of course but your basic gap in basic black hes wearing black again today but his hair hangs over his shoulders his sweater is not only torn but looks cheap and he is dirty i dont smell himyetbut he plainly hasnt bathed for at least a couple of days staring is rude he says his eyes still on the window to my left dont you read your amy vanderbilt or is it gloria vanderbilt miles what the hell is going on you look terrible whats happening with the case he smiles conspiratorially and brings a warning finger to his lips his eyebrows shimmy up and down as he says in a stage whisper shhhh the walls have ears when i stare blankly he adds but then their ears have walls so perhaps it doesnt matter are you telling me you think this waiting room is bugged why not lenz works for the fbi they could bug this room in the time it took you to wake me up how do you know how long that took touché whats the computer for keeping up with developments of course baxter just got the court order to do the trace in wyoming he must have blackmailed the judge i think its a standard fbi tactic has brahma logged on again once about an hour ago but baxter didnt have the court order then he was only on for a couple minutes they did manage to trace digitally back to the wyoming phone company again lake champion how do you know that miles smiles with satisfaction then replies in a vintage hollywood nazi accent i haf my sources herr cole what about the kidnapping rosalind may anything on that nada by the way i didnt know you had a mole among my faithful what are you talking about he smiles again how else could the fbi have found out about rosalind may dont you care about these women miles i care about all women suddenly he is whispering so that i can barely hear i sit beside him theyre going to call one of us in there soon he says why dont we make a little deal right now i say nothing to lenz about you you say nothing about me this shocks me more than anything ive seen or heard yet you think you have to spell it out like that you think id tell these people anything about you his lips narrow in a shadow of the smile jesus must have given peter when he prophesied the disciples betrayal humans do strange things under stress harper why dont we just shake hands on it i look down at the proffered hand and surprise myself by taking it you want to grab a bite to eat after this he asks lightly tie on the old feed bag as they say back home sure i want to find out what the hells going on with this manhunt whoever goes first waits for the other cool sure mr turner the receptionist has slid open her window but she is seated and i see only a tight black bun atop her head dr lenz will see you first she says in a husky almost luminous voice go through the door and down the corridor the doctor is waiting miles stands slowly looks through the billing window and says you have spooky eyes then he picks up his computer and his cellular phone and disappears through the door like a tall and undernourished white rabbit chapter when the receptionist finally calls my name miles has not yet reappeared perhaps lenz wants to talk to us together as i get up and move toward the door that bars the office proper i turn to get a closer look at the receptionist she is no longer there the door leads into a short hallway carpeted in royal blue to my left is the empty receptionists cubicle at the end of the hall another door i open it without knocking arthur lenz is seated behind a cherry desk in a worn leather chair much like the one my father used in his medical office but lenz smells of cigarettes not cigars and his office is spartan compared to the dickensian clutter of my fathers sanctum sanctorum my first thought when lenz looks up is that i pegged him wrong in new orleans there he seemed a handsomer version of william f buckley jr now seated silently behind the ornate desk with his iron gray hair and goldrimmed spectacles he seems to have morphed into a more sinister characterdonald sutherland in one of his heavier roles lenz gives me a perfunctory smile and motions me toward a sleek black couch that reminds me of an orthodontists chair did you transport miles to an alternate dimension i ask he looks puzzled here are your printouts i say quickly dumping the contents of my briefcase on the center of his desk lenz gives the laserprinted pages a quick scan then slips them into a desk drawer i was about to have some tea sent in he says care for some so this is how he means to play it two supercivilized males sitting here sipping tea got any tabs tabs you know the drinktab tasted shitty in the seventies now its just palatable thats what i drink the psychiatrists mouth crinkles with distaste theres a vending machine in the building next door i suppose i could send my receptionist over for some fine normally id be gracious but since youre the one picking my brain i insist i need some caffeine tea has caffeine but it aint got fizz lenz pushes a button on a desk intercom and makes the request it reminds me of the old bob newhart show i almost laugh at the memory whats funny mr cole nothing everything youre wasting time talking to me your unsub could be out there killing another woman right this second yes he could but you dont seem to grasp the fact that you and mr turner are the only direct lines into this case and as for wasting time i frequently spend hours interviewing janitors or postmen whose only connection to a case may be that they walked past the crime scene i dont respond to this lenz smiles like hes my favorite uncle or something i know the couch seems camp but it does tend to concentrate the mind he takes a pencil from the pocket of his pinpoint cotton shirt and taps the eraser on a blank notepad in front of him lie back and relax mr cole the soft leather couch wraps itself around my back like beach sand which tells me it does anything but concentrate the mind lenzs ceiling tiles tell me his roof has leaked before he modulates his deep voice into a fatherly masterpiece theatre register but behind it i sense an unblinking gaze this is not a formal interview he says psychological profiling is not an exact science any wetnosed fbi trainee could question you about the homicidal triangle bedwetting fire starting cruelty to animals i use a different approach despite the attempts of thousands to discredit sigmund freud i still believe the old grouch was onto something regarding the importance of sexual experiences uhhuh are you familiar with nietzsches epigram that tired old saw about monsters and the abyss no this suddenly lenz is speaking harsh german that sounds like erich von stroheim in five graves to cairo i didnt catch that doctor forgive me the degree and kind of a mans sexuality reach up into the ultimate pinnacle of his spirit ive seen that on eros i happen to believe it im going to ask you some very personal questions i hope youll answer frankly you may feel a bit harried i tend to jump from subject to subject following my nose as it were please try to remember that there is no personal motive behind my questions right you just want to put me in line for a lethal injection fine i say aloud lets do it what is the worst thing youve ever done mr cole the question takes me off guard im not sure i understand what could be simpler please answer you dont waste much time on foreplay do you what is the worst thing youve ever done next question lenz sighs in frustration but i dont really care very well what moment are you proudest of in your life what is this i ask trying to get some idea of how to handle this guy mr cole did you come here expecting to look at rorschach blots perhaps to say the first thing that popped into your head when i said words like breast or hate i guess i thought you were going to ask me about eros eros you turnerits all one package isnt it for the moment im concerned with you personally moments of shame and pride are frequently things people keep to themselves the acts that cause these emotions often illuminate the extreme boundaries of the personality if i know the extremes i know the man so please try to answer frankly yes okay would you consider yourself what laymen call a control freak yes i guess that makes two of us do you masturbate regularly dont you is that a yes im still waiting for your answer lenz gives a faint smile do you masturbate while communicating on eros occasionally would you say most subscribers use eros as an aid to masturbation im sure most of them have i wouldnt say thats their primary use for it eros is more for your head than your body what do you think about when you masturbate thats my business mr cole women of course women doing what what do you think that youre being evasive what the hell do you want to know do you have violent fantasies such as women bound for example no women making sounds of supplication no women in pain no do you ever make mental connections between sex and blood hell no this may be a sensitive question but i must ask it you grew up in a rural area have you ever had sex with an animal of any kind have you ever had someone pound the living shit out of you jesus lenz marks on his notepad would it surprise you to learn that over a third of all males raised in rural areas have had intercourse with some type of animal to the point of orgasm its not something ive ever thought about okay and id like to keep it that way i hope you can control your temper mr cole there is a method to my madness i assure you now what is your first sexual memory what do you mean like as a kid your first sexual memory of any kind well trying to peek under my mothers nightgown while she was sleeping i guess what did you see not much it was dark after that playing doctor in a tree house with girls or boys girls one girl the same age as you yes what age i dont know definitely little kids innocent stuff any genital touching nah just showandtell what about samesex play i hesitate a little one boy or several together several just neighborhood buddies how old were you older still young though any fear that you were a homosexual because of it we didnt even know what a homosexual was discovering my dads stash of playboy s was like unearthing the rosetta stone have you had online sex with other men not knowingly what do you mean a lot of men pretend to be women online on regular networks its because theres a shortage of women but on eros that doesnt apply some men still do it there so i guess i could unknowingly have fantasized sex with a man but youve never pretended to be a woman online once my wife told me i should try it to see what it felt like i did and i didnt like it why its like youre assaulted from every side even on eros which is the most civilized online service being a woman means youre constantly approached by men its the loss of control i guess how old were you when you first had sex with a woman all the way complete intercourse serious foreplay touching of genitals probably thirteen with a couple of curious girls the same age when i was fourteen this other girl and i did pretty much everything but intercourse we were in love though jesus like holding hands and kissing and touching each other was some kind of new religion an indescribable intensity of feeling your heart pounding like it would punch through your chest she was a year older than me how did that relationship end she broke my heart after seven months i still remember that funny huh seven months i was physically sick i think that warped me i was never willing to fall totally for a girl after that i knew what could happen how did that color your relationship with other girls you were angry i dont think so when did you first have sexual intercourse fifteen the girl was eighteen a onetime experience are you kidding once i got a taste of that it was nonstop day and night sneaking out of the house anywhere we could find a place what kind of places did you usually find outside mostly or in the car you know not in her parents house no we had a little respect what do you remember most about that relationship i close my eyes later a couple of years later i heard shed become a slut id really started to care for her after a while she was country but she read poetry like that she was a real person just a little lost she had feelings nobody knew about it was sad what makes you say that well i read her diary once she let you read her diary not exactly i went over to her house one time and nobody answered the door i went in anyway the door was open no the few times id sneaked in to see her i went though her window so i did that i looked around the house her room especially i found this little calendar where shed written really small in the day spaces like a diary what had she written all kinds of things she had codes simple ones there were xs on the days when she had her periods that was easy then there were some initials which i figured out were guys she knewguys her age then there was ml on some days which stood for made love i knew that because id been with her on those days all of them not all how did you feel reading that diary like a spy you put it back where you found it no i took it stole it mmhm there were a few of them i just took the one do you still have it no when did you get rid of it just after i got married with a bunch of old letters and stuff i didnt want drewe finding that kind of thing stuff from old girlfriends you know some of it was pretty explicit and she knew some of the girls why did you keep those letters so long all is vanity right lenz scribbles something on his notepad how many women have you slept with in your life i pause fifteen approximately fifteen or fifteen exactly exactly you could write down all their names here and now i mean yeah but i wont but youve written down their names before yes ever rated their performances their looks what they did things like that any guy who says he hasnt is probably lying lenz chuckles a quick deep rumble odd isnt it this compulsion to prove what we have done were you in love with these women i thought i was with some of them some not i guess i just wanted to know they wanted me enough to do that onenight stands not my thing lenz scribbles some more on his pad what experience would you say constitutes the best sex youve ever had the best sex well i guess the best sexi mean the most uninhibited unrestrained sexi had with women who were a little crazy what do you mean i mean very intense women very jealous or if not jealous then kind of haunted driven doomed maybe doomed to what i dont know unhappiness unfulfillment can you elaborate im talking about purely physical sex now not necessarily loving sex i dont know if i can explain i think once you start down the road toward pure pleasure some things get left behind i know the pc line how the best sex can only happen in the context of love all that but from an existential point of view id disagree the most intense sex takes place where there is no psychological limit no moral limit the word no has never been uttered so possibility is infinite and that covers a lot of territory you know please go on im talking about exploration discovery crossing thresholds and once you cross some thresholds im not sure you can get back sex engages the whole psyche doesnt it selfrespect is involved and your respect for the other person love lust obsession it all blurs some women do things they might never ordinarily do because they want to be unique in your experience they want to prove they love you more than anyone else ever did or could and they do that by venturing onto erotically scary territory and you pretend theyre unique because to tell them the truth would probably deny you the physical pleasure of the act and also devalue their gift to you in their eyes yet these acts these roads you travel down arent a place you want to be all your life a sexual relationship has an organic curve the more intense the experience the shorter the curve youre saying you dont have or want these types of experiences with your wife i guess i am maybe a taste of it now and then but you cant push sexual limits for thirty or forty years with one person eventually you run into a wall i think you have to come to an accommodation a nice warm place where there is heat and light though maybe a little less fire it sounds provincial as hell i know but theres a lot more to marriage than sex lenz taps the end of his pen against his lower lip which is gray and bloodless at length he says what are you hiding from your wife my cheeks burning i try to hide my embarrassment in anger what the hell are you talking about he looks at me like a state trooper watching a drunk driver claim hes sober after tapping the pen some more he says you just described a problem of intimacy with your wife bullshit another tired sigh the intense sexual experiences you described are essentially adolescent in character the aggrandizement of the self and the depersonalization of the woman in pursuit of physical ecstasy ive seen a photograph of your wife shes where did you get a picture of my wife a beautiful woman he continues and obviously intelligent youve been married only three years and have no children yet you recall premarital sexual adventures with more than mere wistfulness furthermore you spend a great deal of time pursuing relationships with other women through your computer acting out virtual sexual fantasies with famous actresses who have no idea you know who they are did miles tell you that i heave myself up into a sitting position mr cole i suggest that there is something preventing you from fully accepting the love of your wife and thus from entering into a fully mature and satisfying sexual relationship with her i doubt whether anything you could tell me would do more to exonerate you of these crimes in my eyes than what that is look doctor ive done just about anything sexual i ever wanted to in real life do i miss sex for its own sake sure married sex is different it gets weighted down by everyday life i dont care how imaginative you are everybody thinks hes an expert on sex from the frigid old schoolteacher to the great arthur lenz but everybody has the same problem men want more sex and women want more love were hardwired differently do drewe and i have a perfect relationship no do we have a good one yes next question lenz seems about to argue further then thinks better of it have you ever struck a woman he asks once i reply forcing myself to lie back down what prompted it she tried to kill me why jealousy how did she try to kill you once with a car another time with a rifle i dont think she really knew who she wanted to kill me or her where is this woman now married with kids do you consider yourself a handsome man handsome in a regular kind of way i guess i dont think it was necessarily my looks that attracted women to me if thats what youre getting at what was it i knew how to talk to them a sudden heightening of awareness what do you mean you were smooth you had a good line as they say god no i understood them is all i could talk to them like their female friends did but probably more honestly than their friends would you know what i mean tell me most guys are into things i have no interest in sports hunting like that i mean i played sports but i could care less about watching them you know vicarious thrills arent for me you like to participate right have you ever participated in a murder is that your idea of a trick question will you answer it please hell no ive never committed murder ever thought about it sure ive known a couple of dyedinthe wool sons of bitches who deserved it they never get it though its the good people that get it right doctor define good people i mean regular folks people who try to obey the rules little kids minding their own business and trying just to grow up i think anybody that purposefully hurts a person like that has forfeited his right to much consideration people say the worlds gone gray but thats bullshit theres still a line and anybody who crosses that line deserves whatever they get how do you feel about capital punishment in firstdegree murder cases the murder of a child like that yes fry the fuckers instant karma lenz writes on his notepad again you think i sound like some reactionary southern redneck right let me tell you doctor where i live im considered a liberal if this nut kills a woman down my way hed better get clear in a hurry theres still a lot of old testament justice down south and im not sure thats such a bad thing he killed a woman in new orleans with impunity its my turn to chuckle new orleans isnt the south im talking about i get the feeling you believe the killer is not from the south youre right why for one thing he doesnt write like a southerner he is remarkably literate fuck you doctor ever read faulkner thomas harris i meant for a serial murderer mr cole no need to get defensive a soft knock sounds at the door i look over quickly half expecting miles when the door opens a slender woman with cinnamon skin enters soundlessly and places a silver tea service on lenzs desk the sweating pink tab can looks incongruous on the gleaming tray without meeting my eyes she offers me a glass of ice but i take only the can pop the top and drink half the contents in a few long swallows her black eyes rise to mine with disapproval i try for a moment to guess her race but find myself at a loss living in mississippi doesnt give you much practice for this there its either black or white with a smattering of vietnamese chinese lebanese and hispanic lenz watches the dark woman pour his tea without comment after she exits he says why dont we leave sex and violence for a moment fine do you earn a lot of money making moneys not a crime yet is it were your parents wealthy i lie back on the couch and focus on the stained ceiling tiles my mother grew up on a farm that didnt have electricity until she was fourteen years old she picked cotton with her own hands all the way through college in case you dont know wealthy people dont pick cotton is money important to you is that a serious question your friend mr turner seems to think you place an inordinate value on it he talked to you about me a bit i lean up on one elbow tell me one thing he told you he told me you keep a cache of gold buried beneath your land that lying son of a bitch its not true about the gold yeah its true my grandfather grant put in a nuclear bomb shelter at the farm during the fifties some company was traveling through mississippi selling plans big concrete bastard sunk into the ground i keep some gold there why i lie back down and think for several moments i was raised by people who grew up during the depression i think the memory of that time stayed so real to my parents that it somehow entered me not the physical deprivation but the knowledge that it could actually happen that the whole social and financial structure of this country could implode and leave nothing but hungry and confused people you feel anxiety about something similar happening again i work in financial markets doctor most of the guys i know in chicago have no real conception of the depression they know the word but the only mental reference point they have is and that was over in a couple of days they leverage positions to the moon trade derivatives they dont understand tear apart companies in a day that took decades to build and dont see any farther than next weeks paycheck youre asking me if i think it could happen again you should be asking when this hoarded gold is insurance against some sort of final collapse laugh if you want ask the russians how important gold is right this minute well given these apocalyptic feelings you seem like the last man in the world whod be playing a game as risky as futures trading i dont mind risk because im not playing a game what do you mean no one who trades commodities has any intention of taking delivery of anything they buy or sell its all a paper illusion a numbers game until that fatal margin call anyway one day i decided id take delivery on something just to find out if any of it was real id heard of an old guy in baton rouge who took delivery of a truckload of soybeans for the same reason i chose gold they delivered it too and right now its locked in the bottom of that bomb shelter next to some fortyyearold cans of spam remarkable what does that tell you about me paranoias in my genes ive always known that i consider it a darwinian advantage is paranoia the reason a man of your youth and wealth chooses to live in such an isolated place i raise my hands as if echoing his question lets try another tack why did you wait so long to go into the career for which you seem so singularly suited i dont know lenzs voice swings back at me like a pendulum im sure you do does everybody with a green thumb run out and become a gardener he folds his notepad shut and leans back in his chair lets say a man is a gifted mathematician he may not choose mathematics as his career but he will likely choose a related field such as architecture or engineering i didnt of course you did music is fundamentally a mathematical art thats what ive always heard usually from people who dont know diddly about music what do you mean sure you can break music down into mathematics classical music especially but doctor ive sat on the porches of tarpaper shacks with guys playing stuff you wouldnt believe it old arthritic black guys playing outoftune guitars and just effortlessly bending the notes into tune playing with their eyes shut and it didnt matter anyway cause they couldnt read a note they play between the numbers man and thats just blues think about jazz music is math what a load of crap youre a romantic cole music is romantic not all music mine is the music of my generation and the one before somebodyoscar wilde i thinksaid that when trying to describe the act of love humans have two choices the language of science or the language of the gutter both of which are inadequate but rock and roll split the difference thats why it endures it says the unsayable rage angst alienation a dozen emotions but the core of it is sex doctor sex love and obsession an interesting thesis thats no thesis its just life id like to get back to your family for a moment did we ever leave your father was a physician how did that affect you growing up i never had any anxiety about what my dad did for a living what does your dad do hes a doctor end of conversation negatives i think a moment he wasnt home a lot of the time and when he was it could be weird i remember times i cut my legs needed stitches stuff like that id run in the house yelling hed be watching the saints play or something hed take a look through all the blood then send me off with my mom to clean it up while he waited for the end of the first half then wed finally go down to his office and sew it up that bugged me when i was young but i guess it taught me something too a lot of injuries that look bad arent really no need to panic you know what else uh speeding tickets im sorry after i got my drivers license id get stopped by the sheriff or the yazoo city cops like every other kid theyd be writing me a ticket then theyd look up like they just realized something and say are you dr coles son most times theyd just tear up the ticket and let me go my way at first i thought they were letting me go because they thought my dad was the greatest guy in the world and some of them did the black ones especially but even the white ones let me go guys that probably hated my dad then i figured out the deal dad had been the police doctor for a while back several years before a lot of these guys owed him money he never would have tried to collect but they didnt know that they figured i write this kid a twentydollar ticket i get a bill for eight hundred bucks or whatever why did these white police officers hate your father i take a long weary breath and exhale slowly youve arrived back at your second question only you dont know it which question what am i proudest of ah will you answer it now i dont see the relevance please let me decide whats relevant you think im going to spill my guts to you in the naive belief that youd honor doctorpatient confidentiality lenz straightens at his desk i honor patient confidences absolutely yeah propelled by some contrary impulse i take out my wallet withdraw a hundreddollar bill cross the room and stuff the bill into lenzs breast pocket youre hired youre testing my patience mr cole and i give you a cminus you want to turn off the tape recorder now i do not tape my sessions he says indignantly thank you doctor nixon lenz looks genuinely indignant youre making me angry cole i back over to the couch and lie down again im now officially your patient what if i tell you i killed those seven women he catches his breath did you answer my question first lenz nervously pushes up the nosepiece of his glasses if youre telling me that you did well my honest answer would be that i i would try to find some other way of proving your guilt than violating doctorpatient confidentiality what if you couldnt do that and you knew i was going to kill again i dont know you could always kill me yourself then doctorpatient privilege would no longer be in effect right youre as bad as your friend what do you mean the levels of deviousness i dont know whether to tell daniel to arrest turner or to hire him as a consultant i think hes already figured out more about the eros killer than the bureau has that wouldnt surprise me again i wonder if the fbi arrested miles right on this couch and hauled him off to jail on the other hand maybe miles knows so much because he is the killer lenz doesnt bite a telephone on the desk emits a soft chirp and the psychiatrist answers his eyes still focused on me he listens then covers the transmitter and says would you mind leaving the room until im done i stand up and step into the hall lenzs sonorous voice resumes behind me muted by the heavy door the darkskinned receptionist is still awol from the billing office i open the waitingroom door on the off chance that miles may be there but he isnt thinking i might catch drewe on her cellular i step over to the receptionists desk i am reaching for her phone when i notice an envelope with my name on it at the center of the desk without hesitation i pick it up and scan the few handwritten words on the paper inside harper brahma just logged back onto eros under alias shiva with that wyoming court order baxter now has the power he needs to trace the call ill talk to you when i can ciao as i slip the note back into the envelope the waitingroom door opens and a blond squarejawed yuppie in a blue business suit steps inside i crush the envelope into my pants pocket and head back toward lenzs office the psychiatrist almost bowls me over as he hurries up the hallway tugging on his jacket to the jingle of car keys sorry cole he says his voice clipped were going to have to talk on the move this is special agent peter schmidt i ignore agent schmidt as he steps up behind me what are you talking about where are we going that was daniel baxter on the phone theres been a new development im needed at quantico and he told me to bring you along what kind of development i ask thinking of miless message they may have found rosalind may my heart thumps dead we dont know look ive got a flight to catch tonight remember cole need i remind you that you are currently a suspect in seven capital murders you know i didnt kill those women what i think doesnt matter at this point a womans life is at stake youre lying doctor what you think is all that matters lenz looks at agent schmidt then at the floor then back at me our unsubs in dallas texas its your choice fly home and be out of it or watch the killer you smoked out get whats coming to him in that moment all the hours i spent reading david strobekkers dark seductions alone in my office come back to me beyond that the horror and guilt of watching the first cnn report of karin wheats murder twists in my gut like a strand of barbed wire i have no choice lets go chapter lenz leads agent schmidt and me across the parking lot to a midnight blue mercedes sl schmidt starts to get in but the psychiatrist pulls him aside and speaks softly and he disappears lenz drives with assurance keeping just under the speed limit as he makes for a distant overpass bristling with green metal signs afternoon is wearing toward evening the gray over our heads fading downward to a deep blue were about thirtyfive miles from quantico he says punching a button on his cellular phone apparently to make sure its working if everythings happening in dallas why are we going to quantico they have certain facilities there he threads the mercedes through a thicket of cars youll know more soon nice ride i comment a gift from my wife he says in a taut voice at that moment lenzs cellular rings and the speed with which he snatches it up betrays the tension he feels he listens for twenty seconds says yes twice and then hangs up come on i say sharply they traced strobekkers call through wyoming to dallas right and they just got an exact address he looks over in astonishment how ah turner of course he stares at me another few seconds they traced the call from the lake champion phone exchange to the wats line of a mining company in that town the wats was connected to dallas texas to an apartment rented under the name of david m strobekker holy shit whats going to happen dallas fbi and police swat teams have already surrounded the complex and evacuated the nearby apartments strobekkers still online an fbi hostage rescue team is en route from kansas city via jet they were waiting on alert there so that they could reach any us destination in the shortest possible time dont you need to be in dallas in case theres a standoff or something to try to talk the guy out daniel has authorized explosive entry rosalind may could be inside and strobekker has already proved hell kill without mercy hostage rescue blows down the doors as soon as they get there eta eighty minutes what if strobekker tries to leave before they get there dallas swat takes him down you mean they kill him i hope it doesnt come to that where were going ill be able to speak directly to whoevers in the apartment if necessary i sit back heavily in my seat ten minutes ago i was angry and tired now i taste the euphoria of my name being cleared of my life getting back to its normal anxiety level lenz gooses the mercedes up an onramp and joins the southbound stream of traffic on cole i need your help and you need mine the best way for you to avoid trouble in this case is to assist with the investigation but before i can use you i have to be sure youre not involved but theyre about to nail the guy perhaps perhaps not the evidence in this case suggests a group of offenders working in concert is strobekker himself in that apartment or is it the owner of that indian hair found at one of the crime scenes great what do you want from me answers i think youre a good man haunted by a bad thing the question is is that thing related to this case or not its not okay isnt my word enough im afraid not goddamn it i reported the murders and so far all ive gotten for my trouble is more trouble the psychiatrist looks away from the darkening road long enough to fix me with a disquieting stare his face looks like my fathers did the first time he confessed money problems to me one minute i was looking at a man in his primeresponsible circumspect in chargethe next at a drawn visage haunted by failure and doubt a face about to confide secrets that would change my life forever ive been a forensic psychiatrist more than thirty years lenz says in a voice stripped of all affect thirty years of listening to men describe how they tortured and violated children watching videotapes of men tearing women into bloody pieces in vans and basements he lowers his head almost defensively my work is the benchmark by which others are measured but not long ago i reached a point where the compass that had led me thus far no longer functioned i had problems at home my work had become an endless round of tedium do you have any idea what the investigative support unit actually does cole catches serial killers right wrong it does exactly what its title says gives support the movie image of fbi agents singlehandedly tracking down serial killers is pure fantasy we advise local police do the physical work make the arrest and get the credit i watch lenz from the corner of my eye killers are monotonous as a rule he goes on variations on a theme i testify at their trials seal their fates then recede back into the shadows its just rote the whole goddamned profession is being corrupted by greed ambition men ive trained peddle my ideas to the masses in the form of sensational books lectures and hollywood consulting none of which i ever had a taste for im a scientist do you understand a physician the integrity in lenzs voice is almost embarrassing i understand doctor the only thing that kept me working was that the prospect of retirement seemed even less appealing you just spoke in the past tense what changed it you lenz turns to me with new light in his eyes the eros killer has already murdered seven women we know of with the corpses found in every case yet he staged each crime but two in such a way that they were not linked and homicide detectives look for staging believe me were it not for your coming forwardcourageously against the wishes of your companyhe would still be killing without any risk of being caught lenz may be manipulating me but it feels pretty good to finally hear someone recognize my effort serial murderers normally operate on an emotional cycle he explains they kill cool off kill again generally the period between kills gets shorter and shorter until the murderer begins to decompensate or come unstrung in laymans terms this is generally what allows him to be caught you with me im with you the eros killer is different he operates with utter calm and deliberation hes not even close to decompensating serial offenders frequently communicate with police he has not done so what about the henry miller quote that was more staging not real communication in the stakesthroughtheeyesockets case he smeared the words now she can see on the bedroom mirror with feces pure theater this man has harnessed computer technology not only to select his victims but also to probe their minds and emotions before he strikes miles turner is a computer genius yet he cannot or will not explain how strobekker got hold of the eros master client list thats why you suspect miles i cut in this guy is like miles would be if he decided to start killing people exactly and now he has kidnapped a woman do you know why no something to do with the pineal gland almost certainly this may sound crazy doctor but could he be killing these women for some perfectly logical reason something we cant understand because we lack the information crimes of this type are always eminently logical to the man who commits them cole keep one thing in mind in serial murder selection is everything how does the killer choose his victims what fantasy do they fulfill if you can parse that out you have your man or at least his profile he uses eros to select them thats merely method what are his criteria the printouts you gave me are interesting but theyre basically seductions they reveal no critical similarities among victims neither do studies of the victims bodies or daily lives they all had pineal glands yes but of what sexual importance is the pineal i dont know does it have to be sexual ultimately yes all murders of this type are sexually motivated its just that the sexual component may be deeply repressed the taking of the pineal conjures images of cults or mad scientists but in the end all this will resolve into some variant of oldfashioned lust mr strobekker is what we called in the bad old days a lust killer cole a sex killer thats why you asked so much about my sex life he nods distractedly his head swaying slightly from side to side as he drives when he speaks again his voice carries startling certitude im the only man alive who can stop him cole he glances over as if to reassure me no i havent lost my head all my life ive been training for this moment you should see some of the profiles the junior men in the unit have turned in not even close strobekker has them all chasing their tails why because hes a new species cole they dont have little crib sheets that fit him and you do i dont need any lenz taps his fingers excitedly on the wheel i wrote the books the police wont stop strobekker because he wont make a conventional mistake hes not some traumatized human robot composted from the dregs of society he has a brain and hes using it lenz falls silent apparently lost in a reverie this time he says almost to himself im going to do something no one in the unit has ever done that no psychiatrist has ever done im going to catch this one myself i keep my eyes averted surprised by the emotion he has invested in this case unless hostage rescue gets him in i glance at my watchsixty minutes you mean of course he says looking at me ive been speaking in terms of a single person but the evidence points to a teamoffender situation thats what underlies the police interest in you and turner and thats what makes dallas such an interesting development think about it who is inside that apartment i just dont see what you want from me you will ive been studying the printouts you gave me and im convinced i can trap strobekker how by creating a fictional woman then becoming that woman on eros to be frank im almost done with her i am trying to digest lenzs words but the implications are too complex to take in at once she fits the new victim profile almost exactly he adds new profile you mean youre making her like karin wheat instead of the younger victims yes its rare for a killer to establish so clear a pattern and then break it if wheat were merely a crime of opportunity id discard her from the group but she wasnt wheat represents a new paradigm and my function smoothing my entry into the eros community you dont know what youre getting into doctor god only knows what databases this guy can access to check out people who approach him online lenz chuckles dont worry about that daniels men are very good at paperwork my personal eliza doolittle is in the process of coming to official life as we speak social security number dmv voter registration credit cards credit history a house and a car in a matter of hours shell be as real as your wife whats this fictitious womans name anne bridges but thats irrelevant its the alias that matters correct hes right whats the alias something primal lenz says obviously pleased with himself archetypal biblical what the hell is it youre interested now dont worry youll know soon enough if you cooperate i could care less about the alias but i do want to know who is in that dallas apartment after all it was i who first detected strobekkers deadly passage through the digital universe but you dont know anything about how eros really works i point out there are all kinds of esoteric abbreviations informal practices things that are understood only by the members lenz smiles you just argued yourself into the job you really think you can fool peoplenot just people but him into thinking youre a woman thats what makes it worthwhile how much insight do i truly have into the female mind this will be the acid test he blinks his headlights twice and roars past a semitruck were over halfway to quantico cole lets hear your secret if i decide its unrelated to the case you get me started on eros then you go home with no more police problems i turn and look out the passenger window halfway to quantico halfway to the hostage rescue team knocking down brahmas door in dallas lenz wants answers to his little questions snapshots of my soul before im allowed into the inner circle of the investigation what am i proudest of most ashamed of the answer to the first question is private but not really secret and it will get me to quantico the other answer can wait until that door goes down in dallas it can wait forever i played music professionally for eight years i say evenly lenz settles back in his seat were you successful depends on your definition i made a living but as far as reaching my dreams no im a good songwriter and guitar player but only a fair singer some people thought i was better than i did but i always felt i needed someone else up front as lead vocalist and this dependence led to conflict resentment yeah ill skip five years of wasted time the last band i was in had majorlabel interest but by the time wed gotten that far the group was ready to selfdestruct i was writing the best material and the singera good friend of minecouldnt stand my getting that part of the glory forget that he got all the spotlight time he wanted it to be him singing his stuff or nothing so so it was nothing hes still out there singing his stuff the clubs are bigger but hes on the same treadmill when that group split i decided id never again put myself into a situation where my destiny was controlled to any degree by another person now i understand the commodities trading lenz says no messy humans to deal with you got it and you got rich youre damn right you sound angry good assessment lenz drives silently for a half mile and im glad for the delay finally he says and before all that i went to college like most of my friends majored in finance the whole thing but id wanted to play music since i was a kid i used to ride up to leland and clarksdale and play blues with the old black catsson thomas sam chatmon those guys when i got out of college i went home and told my parents that before i got a job or went to graduate school i was going to play music for a while how did they respond not well when i was a kid they were really supportive of my music but during my senior year of high school things changed what happened the second act of a tragedy that started fifteen years before summer of sixtyfour the freedom summer the year they killed those three civil rights workers in neshoba county lenz nods schwerner chaney and goodman he says the names softly as if those longdead kids were friends of his for the first time i suspect lenz might be jewish right i tell him buried them in that dam anyway a new york college sent some civil rights workers down to cairo county where our farm is my dad being who he was decided to invite a couple of them over excuse me being who he was he wasnt a native mississippian he was from louisiana down below the hardshell baptist parishes he was raised strict but not prejudiced you know he was a doctor but he came from working class people grew up working right alongside blacks go on these civil rights workers would come in from a day of running the back roads teaching blacks how to answer the voting questionnaire or whatever and my dad would feed them hed talk medicine theyd talk politics or maybe theyd talk baseball i got this from my mother you understand much later keep going anyway the local yahoos the klan or whoever didnt like my dad having these guys over to the house they warned him but dad didnt pay any attention then this colored guy got killed at a church outside itta bena they blew him up in his car he was a patient of my fathers hed served in action in korea dad put a lot of stock in a man serving his country in battle hed turned a blind eye to a lot that the klan and the citizens council did in those days like everybody else but he couldnt stomach the murder of this black vet he sat down and wrote an editorial that would blister the hide off a rattlesnake he told it like it was and he named names he sent that piece to the greenville paper the liberal paper owned by hodding carter the paper printed it and lo there came a shitstorm lenz smiles in the dark ill be damned my mother just sat around the house waiting to be firebombed but it didnt happen dad had been so public with his accusations that the klan was afraid to do anything too soon after the piece appeared the fact that my mother was from an old delta family helped it wasnt a wealthy family but her peoplethe grantshad been in the delta about as long as anybody but the indians quite a few white patients stopped coming to my father but blacks took their places just as fast so that didnt matter much after about a year it was all forgotten at least by my family but not by the klan i wouldnt necessarily say the klan the klan doesnt even exist in mississippi anymore not in any meaningful way its just a bunch of bitter old drunks now anyway a lot of time passed and during that time another facet of my dads character emerged though we knew nothing about it i wonder how far we are from quantico but i dont dare break the flow to ask my dad was a doctor of the old school all he cared about was treating peoples sickness he never thought about money some years he didnt collect fifty percent of what he was owed and hed accept anything as payment when he did collect green beans catfish peaches venison collard greens whatever he was still making house calls in lenz leans his head back and flips on the mercedess headlights a dying breed he says softly a dead breed and the countrys worse off for it anyway his entire financial planning strategy was his belief that if a doctor worked hard in america hed make enough money to raise his family and pay for his whiskey and cigars and send in the next patient please get the picture a common failing among practitioners of his generation yeah well it didnt take long for that failing to get him into serious trouble by he was a year behind on his income taxes that meant that every aprilevery yearhe had to go to the bank and borrow the full amount of his taxes to pay off the governmentsomething like sixty or seventy thousand dollars at whatever the interest rate happened to be and after hed paid he would still be a year behind he did that for twenty years my god talk about pressure but he didnt tell a soul about it it was a secret between him and his banker who was thrilled by the arrangement of course there was enough cash flow that nobody felt the pinch but it was all an illusion what about an equity loan lenz asks a home mortgage not a chance all he could have used as collateral was the farm or the house sitting on it and both had been in my mothers family for generations she didnt have any brothers so hers was the first generation of grants that hadnt farmed the land they leased it out anyway dad felt the debt was his cross to bear he just worked harder and harder my junior year of high school things came to a head the people we leased the farm to had had two bad harvests in a row dads income was stretched to the breaking point and when he went into the bank and asked for his annual tax loan they said no theyd never demanded collateral before because they knew he could cover the debt but this time they did he was stunned he went to another bank and got the same story after a while he figured it out the chickens from had come home to roost lenz is shaking his head you can see the rest dad had to put up the farm as collateral carter was president interest rates were twenty percent when dad finally told my mother how things stood she didnt hesitate to sign the papers but it almost killed her her father had never believed in borrowing money and she didnt either i mean never dad worked harder that year than he ever had in his life he was nearly fifty then and he was working hundredhour weeks seventytwohour shifts in emergency rooms out of town seven months into it he had a coronary he survived but the cash dried up i worked my mother worked but it wasnt any good the people we leased to had their third bad year and we lost the farm all of it we managed to keep the home place where my wife and i live now everything else the bank took they put it up for auction but somehow the bank president himself bought it for about half what it was worth he was a smug redneck son of a bitch named crump he loved taking that land he was about sixtyfive then how did this affect your mother the memory of my mother in those years is something i would prefer to forget she became a ghost i say softly i beg your pardon a ghost of herself lenz nods silently so you can imagine what happened when i arrived home from college four years later with my honors degree in finance and announced my intention to roam the country playing guitar they werent exactly thrilled yet you did it anyway not immediately for a couple of weeks i just moped around then i got mad i saw that their whole view of the world had been warped and beaten down by bastards like crump and worse that it was going to affect my whole life if i let it did you confront crump what good would that have done i had no leverage no power i packed up my clothes my textbooks and my life savingsfive grandand took the amtrak to chicago one of my professors wangled me a job at a company with seats on the board of trade after a week of trading for the company i started trading for myself and i was fearless i cant explain it i was trading like i played music purely on instinct balls to the wall sometimes risking everything on single trades id have a stroke if i tried that now im a system traderi cover every conceivable angle before i make a move but back then i was high on rage everything id ever learned had somehow been recalled and slaved to my anger i was like mr spock possessed by a pissedoff captain kirk a fucking superman my pulse races just remembering that rush the market was different then too especially the sp index you could leverage your position to an unbelievable point it was like showing up at the indy with a ford pinto handing them your keys and them saying son these pinto keys qualify you to drive a maserati for the duration of the race of course if you wreck the car youll have to pay for it but well worry about that when it happens please try not to kill yourself and then they let you drive out onto the track and you won the race i kicked ass doctor after five months i resigned from the firm and a twelvehour train ride later i was back in the delta i went straight to the bank and asked to see crump i must have looked like shit on a stick after that train ride but he didnt bat an eye he was past seventy by then i told him i wanted to buy back our farm crump said the land wasnt for sale i told him id give him a good price he told me not to let the door hit my ass on the way out i knew what fair market value was so i named a figure double thatfour times what hed paid for it crump said no sale i was starting to lose my temper but i didnt show it i told him he ought to be sensible that everything had a price he told me that wasnt always the case that stumped me id been relying on his greed and hed made a statement that indicated i might have misjudged him he was staring at me the way a hunter looks at a treed coon and i decided then that my only chance was to go for broke i told that son of a bitch id pay him four times market value for the farman eight hundred percent profit but that the offer was good for only sixty minutes i said id be back in one hour and if he wanted the money hed better have the papers ready i walked out to a cafe had three slow cups of coffee took a leak and walked back to the bank and and crump had his lawyer and two witnesses and the contract sitting there waiting for my signature after i signed the papers he told me i was the dumbest egg sucker that ever walked through his door i said maybe i was but that i had ten thousand bucks left and id have given him that and the shirt off my back for that land and i hoped he died a damned lonely death lenz has turned his head to me he is staring with new eyes is that story true it sounds like something from its a wonderful life an rrated version maybe its true all right life doesnt give you many chances like that he nods life didnt give you that cole you took it a barber drove me out to the farmhouse mom was in the kitchen smoking a cigarette and drinking a cold cup of coffee when i laid that deed down on the table in front of her she stared at it for nearly a minute then she looked up and asked me if it was real if it was real when i told her it was she broke into pieces she just it was too much she was shaking and crying and trying to hug me and right then goddamn it i knew what it felt like to be a man you know i finally understood that being a man means taking care of the people you love no matter how you do it even if you have to die to do it how did your father take the news i guess relief was the main thing for four years hed lived knowing hed failed my mother and would never be able to make it right my getting back the land changed things for the better but a lot of damage had already been done dad had spent four years thinking he was worth more dead than alive to the people he loved businesswise his life insurance policy was about the only thing hed done right he figured dying was the only way he could take care of his own hed started drinking heavily it wasnt a perfect happy ending or anything lenz raises a finger and points to a turn in the road at the limit of his high beams but the best ending possible under the circumstances in my view you have my respect cole the mercedes takes the curve with the grace of a racing hound and glides toward a lighted gatehouse in the distance a lot of men go through life the way your father did silent desperation right thoreau knew a thing or two actually thats james taylor thoreau said quiet desperation lenz snorts my mistake the mercedes stops at the gate long enough for a uniformed marine to come to the window check lenzs pass and wave us through before weve driven fifty yards the rattle of gunfire rolls out of the darkness i feel as though were moving through a ghostly skirmish in these historic virginia woods but it must be marines on night maneuvers after we pass a second gate a complex of lighted buildings much like a college campus appears lenz picks up his cellular and hits a speeddial code mutters into the phone then hangs up and makes a sharp turn off the main drive hostage rescue touches down in dallas in twenty minutes he says theyll be at the apartment in thirtyfive maximum strobekkers still online i shudder with the sudden exhilaration of impending action this is unbelievable lenz nods and were going to have a frontrow seat what do you mean wait he stops the mercedes near the rear of a parked semitruck and looks at me i hear a heavy metallic ching then watch in amazement as the rear panel of the semitrailer rises into the roof and dim red light bleeds out around the silhouette of a man i have only seen him once in my life but every fiber of my instinct tells me that black shadow belongs to daniel baxter chief of the investigative support unit we drove all this way to get to a truck lenz chuckles softly dont say that word anywhere near the people youre about to meet they call this vehicle doctor cop for mdcpmobile digital command post youre about to see interactive media like you never imagined cole as close as the fbi ever gets to hollywood chapter the silhouette at the back of the truck does belong to daniel baxter after shaking hands with me he leads us into the strangest environment i have ever entered the interior of dr copthe mobile digital command postfeels like a mobile home from some worlds fair exhibition fifty years in the future it is long and narrow and stuffed to the ceiling with rackmounted shockcushioned computers crts satellite receivers surveillance gear and pale technicians with bona fide nerd packs in the pockets of their shortsleeve polycotton shirts a constant thrumming vibrates the floor of the command post soft radio chatter emanates from several sets of speakers none of it in sync i assume the nerds are somehow following all of this baxter leads us along a cramped walk space to a curved bank of video screens most are blank but two show blackandwhite views of what appears to be a detached apartment building much like the ones i lived in during college is that it lenz asks baxter nods two apartments per unit strobekker is six seventytwo six seventythree is empty thank god is that a live feed i ask he nods the resolutions unbelievable digital video were getting it encrypted over a secure channel baxter points at a screen notice the windows of the apartment covered with aluminum foil on the inside bad sign says lenz how long until hrt gets there touchdown in five minutes at love field another ten give or take to get on site the complex is about halfway between love and dallasfort worth international just one in a sea of complexes anonymous as you can get anything i can do before hostage rescue goes in baxter shakes his head hes using the only phone so we cant call and ask him to come out i dont think i would anyway he might do the hostage lenz nods mr cole and i need to speak privately any chance i cant believe lenz is this persistent baxter motions for us to follow him through a narrow door at the end of the aisle beyond it is a dim room with six bunks shelved up the walls in groups of three and a microwave kitchenette between i want you with me when they go in arthur baxter says if our unsub is as smart as hes been so far he may catch on and barricade himself wouldnt miss it says lenz when the door closes after baxter the psychiatrist takes a seat on one of the bottom bunks pulls a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lights one which must be breaking about a dozen rules in this hightech government vehicle no alarm goes off he blows smoke away from us and says you talked your way in lets finish up doctor nothing i could tell you has anything to do with the eros murders then the sooner you tell me the sooner youll be in the clear my eyes remain on his face but my mind is far away he takes another drag in silence then gets up from the bed and squats before a small refrigerator the opening door fills the room with sickly fluorescent light eureka he says in a deadpan voice it seems that daniels boys share your taste for orally administered carcinogens lenz holds a pink tab can covered with icy condensation over his shoulder i take it pop the top and suck down half its contents in four quick swallows the peppery sting of caffeinespiked carbonation burns my gums and throat and makes my eyes water i feel twice as good as i did ten seconds ago i want to tell lenz that there is no secret that ive never done anything to really be ashamed of but of course that would be absurd he knows theres something there he knows theres always something you still dont understand whats happening do you he says sitting back on the bed with a bottle of evian i know a womans life is at stake his face is a gray outline behind gray smoke thats not what i mean somethings eating you up inside cole id say its been eating at you for a long time you need to tell me this thing dont you feel that the maddening thing is that lenz is right i dont especially want to tell him but lately some part of me has been bursting to rid itself of this psychic weight relax he says i carry more secrets around in my head than any ten priests theres hardly room in there for sins like yours between the rapes and the child abuse and the murders none of those give you leverage over me i point out my voice brittle he smiles a little at that you think i dont have leverage now i shrug in that moment lenzs eyes look older than any ive ever seen older than the eyes of crooked black women in the delta older than the eyes of men whove survived combat its your wifes sister he says softly isnt it no feigned reaction will deceive those eyes fury at miles boils like acid up into my chest dont blame turner lenz says gently he doesnt even know he knows i think hes half in love with the girl himself i say nothing lenz takes a drag from his cigarette i know youre no murderer he laughs your sense of guilt is far too well developed for that what do you think im fishing for information to ruin your marriage to force you to work for me like the threat of arrest or ten years of tax audits wouldnt be enough he stands suddenly and pats me on the shoulder take it easy cole lets go watch some tv one way or another everythings going to look a lot different in a few minutes with that he opens the door and leads me back into the main room a small crowd has gathered around the video bank but it parts like the red sea for lenz i slipstream behind him one of the nerds has taken up station in a chair before the monitor bank a headset over his ears both hands on control knobs i hear a burst of static then a southernaccented voice saying this is deke smith dallas swat advising hostage rescue has arrived the acknowledgment is lost beneath daniel baxters okay lets do it he nods anxiously at the screens did they lock and load in the van the nerd in the chair repeats the question like a submarine officer relaying the orders of his captain he listens to his headset then replies locked and loaded approaching the local command post damn it i want to hear everything snaps baxter put it all on the squawk box the nerd flips a couple of switches and suddenly the trailer is alive with the voices of the dallas fbi swat team the dallas police an fbi command post and the wireless communications of the fbi hostage rescue team bravo leader checking in testes testes one two someone behind me emits a truncated laugh thats joe payne hostage rescue commander baxter says either for my benefit or lenzs theyre bravo team the remainder of paynes unit checks in which sounds like between eight and twelve men its hard to tell because they all talk at once we live to alpha someone asks over the radio payne i think baxter hits the nerd on the shoulder the nerd mutters into his headset mike someone onsite tells payne he is live to alpha are we alpha i ask a tech opposite me rolls his eyes is the target still on the phone asks payne someone farther along the trailer yells affirmative an eros tech in new york confirms unsub interacting with a female subscriber prospective victim number eight says baxter no point in waiting crackles paynes voice cant see anything through the windows lets mount up what about video asks baxter you got a camera going in the nerd relays the question and payne says camera goes in right after the guns unable to bear the delay baxter yanks the headset off the nerds head and puts it on joe this is dan baxter you dont want to slip a pinhole camera under the door and check the layout not this time dallas pd did a good job staying out of sight i dont think this guy knows the cavalrys here i dont want anyone approaching that door until we go up with the sledgehammers the manager wouldnt give up a key sledgehammers are faster says payne were busting off the hinges in case he has hardened dead bolts im holding a floor plan now lastminute advice baxter turns to lenz arthur whoevers in there says lenz id like to see them get out alive we could learn a lot i heard that says payne you tell your shrink no guarantees this guy throws down on us we take him out can they go for a disabling wound asks lenz baxter starts to explain something about body armor but paynes reply drowns him out if my men shoot they shoot for the head good luck joe says baxter ill watch the reruns with you tonight says payne you bring the beer youre on suddenly the camaraderie is gone now the radio exchanges sound like snippets from a world war ii combat movie curt questions clipped replies i hear several sighs of satisfaction around me as a third video screen lights up on it is a blackandwhite image that looks like its being shot by a fiveyearold nothing but black boots then the frame rises and focuses on the back of a black upsstyle truck on the spare wheel housing stenciled in gold are six words that make it clear that this truck does not belong to a shipping company bad company any time any place jesus mutters baxter but when he turns to lenz he is smiling the dallas fbi swat motto the short ugly snout of a submachine gun passes into the frame wiggles and disappears cameramans carrying says a tech good for him says baxter hes probably seen those civil war movies where the flag bearer charges with nothing but a flag at least he learned something the new video image suddenly begins to jerk a flash of sidewalk then im moving along it the way you do when youre watching a horror film the camera rises showing us the back and shoulders of a man walking ahead of it then others in file ahead of him moving quickly now theyre clad from boots to balaclava helmets in bulky black jumpsuits with ripstop nylon and kevlar and guns strapped all over them they look like paratroopers go ninjas whispers someone near the video monitors the entire team suddenly appears on one of the static screens theyre standing behind the wall of the apartment building nearest strobekkers their backs to the camera over their shoulders strobekkers front door is clearly visible it looks no more than twenty feet away but then i remember how camera angles can distort distance its like watching a baseball pitcher from a camera placed behind the catcher you think you could reach out and touch him but hes over sixty feet away this is bravo leader says payne ten seconds on the static view the hostage rescue team lines up in a formation not unlike a football team in front stand two men with blackpainted sledgehammers in their hands five seconds says payne rock and roll murmurs baxter go paynes barked command seems to propel the two point men across the open ground by volume alone they move quickly but anyone who has ever lifted a sledgehammer knows that a fullspeed sprint while carrying one is out of the question go go gosomeone shouts when the lead agents reach strobekkers door the mobile video camera begins to move everyone in the trailer is racing across the open space with the second element of the assault team on the static image i see the apartment door go down like a piece of styrofoam federal agents federal agents scream wild voices and by then at least five men have gone through the door drop your weapon on the floor right now jesus i grab baxters coat they got him shut up cole cameras in a tech says softly holy shit someone hisses the mobile camera shows an apartment as bare as a spinsters cupboard men are still yelling federal agents but as the camera swings around the apartment i see no one but the commandos of the hostage rescue team locked door someone screams strobekker just went offline shouts a voice from inside the trailer i hear a crash as the locked door goes down but the camera does not follow dont shoot him shouts lenz for gods sake dont fire i am stunned beyond words when baxter turns and shoves arthur lenz out of range of the mike brahmas fate is in the hands of soldiers now what the fuck says a shocked voice did he go out the window negative someone answers this is dallas swat leader no rabbits closets empty screams a shaky young voice what the fuck get the camera in there yells baxter whats going on joe alpha theres nothing in this apartment but a computer and a phone weve been had what theres no monitor attached to the computer but it appears to be powered up no keyboard either get the goddamn camera in there finally the mobile camera squeezes through the crowd of broad black shoulders and shows us the room payne is right there is nothing inside but a harmlesslooking white pc sitting on the floor beside a telephone what goods a computer without a monitor or keyboard he asks shit i say not wanting to believe what i am seeing but i am seeing it what asks baxter turning to me the drive light the hard drive is active goddamn it curses a tech the drives reformatting itself erasing itself as i watch the tiny flashing dot of the drive light i know that the tech is wrong i dont know why but i know pull the plug shouts the tech wait i say holding up my hands thats joe yells baxter pull the fucking plug no i scream get your men out everybody out now baxter whirls on me with fury in his eyes then comprehension dawns he opens his mouth and yells joe get but he is too late a blackclad figure has leaped at the electrical socket with his arm extended reaching into a white flash that seems to sear the screen as it goes blank oh my god says a flat voice the two static cameras continue recording as yellow flame blasts out the windows on one side of strobekkers apartment building the sound of the explosion is muted after being filtered through countless circuits to arrive here in quantico but its effect in the trailer could not be more profound baxter gapes at the video bank while screams of anguish pour from the speakers disjointed voices from the dallas command post shout at each other to call paramedics and the fire department other voicesalmost unrecognizable from shock and panicscream to get the wounded out of the smokefilled building what in gods name just happened baxter asks then he snaps out of whatever trance he was in and begins shouting questions and commands over the link to dallas the technicians behind him are conspicuously silent was that joe who reached for the plug he asks no one volunteers an answer on the two remaining live screens wounded or dead men are being dragged from the smoking apartment i know some are alive because their agonized shrieks are being transmitted over the radio net dan croaks a voice this is joe everyone in the trailer freezes near the apartment building a blacksuited agent has held up his right arm and waved broadly at one of the static cameras thank god mutters baxter whats your situation joe fubar i just wanted to let you know i made it payne rips off his balaclava and bends over to catch his breath im gonna be busy for a few minutes ill get back to you when i can do what you have to do buddy when daniel baxter turns around to face the technicians his rage is fearsome to behold what the hell just happened he asks his eyes flicking from man to man he knew i say he couldnt have known not about this raid but he knew youd be coming eventually and he prepared for it one of the nerds says tell them to check the front door chief look for an alarm trip wire something baxter turns back to the screens but issues no orders theres no point until the tragic opera on the video bank is brought under control hrt commandos crouch over their prostrate comrades giving what help they can from first aid kits the radio chatter focuses on the danger of fire until some dallas swat officers go in with extinguishers and hose down the apartments interior with chemical foam the mood in the trailer reminds me of the hotel lobby i was in when i saw the challenger explode after launch suddenly in a moment of dead air a broken voice says hes gone the radio chatter stutters dies onscreen a crouching fbi agent wipes a hand across his eyes then removes his coat and lays it over the face of a man on the ground god in heaven baxter murmurs as the paramedics arrive and load the casualties into ambulance bays a blacksuited commando with bloody hands and a scorched black face steps up to one of the static cameras the whites of his eyes seem to give off their own light dan he says panting like a man who has run five miles right here joe what can i do i was about to ask you the same thing whats the status of your men four took shrapnel we got everybody out but pete carelli died on the ground if it hadnt been for the body armor we wouldve had four kia what about you joe i was outside the bedroom i caught some stuff in my arms and hands nothing to write home about any way you can get in there to check some things payne nods wearily then turns and hustles five men together using hand signals baxter says were looking for trip wires alarms you know the drill payne grunts into his mike there is no mobile camera this time but seconds later we hear him and his men and tearing through the apartment son of a bitch cries a young voice ive got it photoelectric beam standard alarm kit were following the wire says payne runs along a baseboard got another beam on the bedroom door calls out another voice window too says a third okay dan says payne we got a rectangular black box in the closet of the adjoining bedroom good work joe gimme a sec baxter turns back to his techs somebody lay it out for me no one offers anything i guess i have the least to lose here that apartments nothing but a wire with tin cans tied to it i tell him a perimeter paynes team broke the beam and the black box alerted the computer the computer sent out a message to strobekker wherever he really isthats why it didnt blow immediatelyand then it selfdestructed he knows youre after him now mr baxter or he will soon but how could he not be there we traced the call to that apartment he was somewhere else the whole time you said the apartment next door is empty right baxters eyes narrow joe did dallas swat check the apartment next door negative the manager said no one lived there so i issued orders from the plane do not approach under any circumstances didnt want to risk the unsub seeing or hearing anything check it now but for gods sake be careful you heard him says payne we wait in a distinctly uncomfortable silence lenz stands sipping his evian water about five feet from the crowd when he notices me watching he gives me a mock salute goddamn it says a voice over the speaker theres another phone over here by the wall adjoining the target apartment the things blasted to hell but its a phone theres a modem too and some other kind of gray box looks homemade i will have someones ass says baxter wheres the manager of the complex outside alpha says a different voice put that son of a bitch on camera a command is barked then two dallas swat officers pull a middleaged man with dark skin and black hair into view he looks like an arab arrest and mirandize him says baxter i stare as a dallas police officer arrests the terrified apartment manager and reads his miranda rights put a headset on him baxter orders when this is done he asks whats your name the man swallows and says patel mohandas patel i close my eyes in disbelief an indian you manage these apartments mr patel i own them with my brother resident of houston one of the murders was in houston says one of the nerds baxter asks why did you tell the police that apartment was empty mr patel i did not say that i said no one lived there theres a telephone inside that apartment sir someone must have put it there someone who rented the apartment patels eyes brighten ah yes apartment was rented but no one ever moved in they pay the rent i dont ask questions police ask who lives in that unit i tell them no one i tell them correctly yes baxter expels air trying to suppress a fury i can only guess at who rented that apartment mr patel nice lady he says a lady from my own country an indian woman yes sir a sigh of satisfaction from dr lenzs direction how old was she asks baxter patel rocks his head from left to right estimating from memory between forty and fifty hard to tell these days wellspoken lady very lovely who rented the other apartment mr strobekker almost a year ago what did he look like i already described him for the police describe him again patel hesitates then looks at each of the officers holding his arms both are at least a foot taller than he is i believe i would like to call my brother he says in a shaky voice at least he didnt ask for a lawyer murmurs a voice behind me my brother is an attorney adds patel driving the final nail into baxters interrogation alpha this is bravo leader says payne his voice cool and professional again dallas police advise they do a lot of business at this complex highdollar call girls drug busts you name it the rent is high but it buys privacy damn baxter mutters someone pulls the headset off patel what you want us to do with him asks a heavy texas accent the voice of a cowboy book him says baxter let him call his brother then sweat them both threaten them with rico terrorism whatever it takes ill send my regional profiler over to consult weve got a hostage out there somewhere copy that yessir says the cowboy lets take this one back to the barn boys this is bravo dan says payne off camera you want us back in kansas city baxter thinks for a few seconds no get your wounded squared away then get back here asap sorry buddy no problem we may doze but we never close mount up girls the video screens wink out why didnt we trace through to that second phone baxter asks turning toward the techs he could have blocked it one answers with the right equipment some kind of relay probably that gray box equipment notwithstanding says a calm voice on the periphery i believe mr strobekkers ruse worked on a deeper level its lenz of course he led us through a dozen states overseas then through that little burg in wyomingwhich we assumed was his pièce de résistanceand finally to the dallas apartment that was the first actual residence we tracked him to so we assumed it was where he lived ill bet the technicians didnt even try to look beyond it i think i see a couple of sheepish faces among the techs the question says baxter is can we trace the call now that its been terminated therell definitely be a record a tech says brightly i dont want to rain on your parade guys i chime in but i think youre going to find that telephone simply dialed an internet onramp and from there sent a message to some anonymous bulletin board a thousand miles away strobekker dropping offline during the raid was probably coincidence he wouldnt risk a direct link to his physical location if you get the phone records you can find out where that computer sent its warning message to but if its a big bbs thousands of people will log on over the next few days and see it and youll never be able to track them all baxters face tightens with frustration we have access to some excellent cryptanalysts if we could find the message we might be able to break it down thats not the point we already know what it says it might be only one character it might be a test message of which there are thousands it might even say dear daddy somebody just blew me up goddamn it curses baxter his anger like a kerosene heater in the room you need miles turner i say bluntly he can nail this bastard for you turner may be this bastard says lenz stepping through the tech desks bullshit doctor baxter is studying me intently is turner that good he is truly scary mr baxter ill hire him as a consultant plenty of precedent not turner lenz says firmly baxter waves his hand and the crowd of techs scatter like leaves when they are sufficiently dispersed he says on a low voice weve taken casualties arthur weve got a hostage out there hopefully alive youve got a proactive plan but its a long game weve got to get this sob before he kills rosalind may or anybody else using turner would be a mistake daniel if you want an electronics wizard call the nsa if you want strobekker give me cole baxter considers this long enough for me to get edgy then he says the bureau was slow to get on the computer crime bandwagon arthur and im not ready to say weve caught up cole came close to saving a life today and he says turners better than he is daniel lenz says evenly if my past work means anything to you trust me now baxter bites his bottom lip and probes lenzs eyes a silent conversation is taking place based on years of professional association and maybe more than that it might as well be in farsi lenz is the first to speak aloud hows my alter ego coming baxter does not respond then almost grudgingly he says another hour should do it its tough to get access to some of those offices after hours while i have baxter close i take a chance mr baxter im ready and willing to assist dr lenz but id like to do as much of it as i can from home theres no reason we cant work together that way and quite frankly i promised my wife id be back by morning baxters mind is miles away how long do you need cole to get you started arthur impossible to say lenz glares at me he wont make a commercial flight anyway not back to mississippi baxter checks his watch then looks at lenz id prefer not to use the regional swat teams for this at ohone hundred hours im deploying a second hostage rescue unit from quantico to a more southernlying city jan krislov offered us the use of her corporate jet and i took her up on it cole you get dr lenz set up and running in three hours you can hitch with hrt ill have the pilot set you down in jackson good enough thats where my truck is i appreciate it sir lenz looks like he might argue but baxter doesnt give him the chance with a curt nod he is away and reaching for a telephone lenz motions me toward the door of the command post keeping my arms close to my body i move carefully down the narrow aisle between the shelves of humming equipment past baxter past the shortsleeve polycotton shirts glowing in the pixel light someone rises to let me out of the trailer and when my feet hit the pavement i expel the conditioned air from my lungs and drink in the cool forest breeze hearing the scrape of a shoe behind me i turn and find the squarejawed face of special agent schmidt staring from the darkness why dont you wait in the car he suggests opening the door of lenzs mercedes two minutes after schmidt closes me inside lenz slides into the drivers seat holding a fresh tab in one hand and an evian in the other he sets both in a plastic drink caddy then cranks the engine and closes the door while i wipe the top of the tab can on my shirt he lights a cigarette then exhales into the virginia night very smooth he says very smooth indeed chapter dear father the barbarians are at the gate it was inevitable of course and i have no fear that they will locate me but i shall have to exercise greater caution when procuring patients i must assume that the justice department will shut down eros or that the company will shut itself down for legal reasons of course the list makes that academic i must remember to thank turner properly or will they shut it down perhaps jan krislov will resist it could become quite a cause célèbre another battle in her crusade for electronic privacy someday ill have to show her just how private her little universe really is my god such noise from the basement i should never have let levy catch sight of the or he should quiet himself or ill be forced to send kali down to quiet him but first things first i need new patients and i suppose my next move depends on the fbi will they enter the digital forests of the night or will they simply try to fence me out no matter i shall burn all the brighter now chapter lenzs mercedes shunts us through the night like spores on a wind he says were headed back to mclean virginia to an fbi safe house from which his digital decoy operation will be run in the delta i can drive for miles at night and see no light but moon and stars but tonight im thankful for the busy interstate the glaring lights and motion help me to suppress the image of the exploding pc and the screams of wounded men in the dallas apartment are we somewhere near the manassas battlefield i ask recalling a golden summer years ago when my father and i climbed henry hill in the chill morning mist to see the spot where stonewall jackson earned his nom de guerre ten or fifteen miles to the west lenz replies is it a disney world now no they finally killed that thank god the first uplifting news of a very long day back there i say hesitantly at the trailer i was thinking that strobekker or whoever he is didnt really mean to kill anybody what do you mean i mean the explosion was pretty much confined to the computer he could have flattened that whole building if hed wanted to lenz ponders this for a few seconds that helps with the profile but in the larger scheme it doesnt make a bit of difference when he killed that hostage rescue man he practically signed his own death warrant if he doesnt surrender the instant we locate him hes a corpse lenz lights a fresh cigarette why dont we talk about it the case no this thing thats eating you jesus dont you ever let up believe it or not cole im trying to help you you fear my knowing anything about you having leverage over you but if youd really listened to me earlier youd know this case means life to me its my personal resurrection dont you see the leverage that gives you one anonymous email message to strobekker and he knows anne bridges is me id never be able to prove you did it but id never do that and id never betray a confidence from you he cracks his window slightly and blows a stream of smoke at the opening i respect you cole you risked civil prosecutionmaybe financial ruinto come forward with the names of these women turner didnt krislov didnt i dont know that they ever would have so long as they werent staring the corpses in the face i start to argue but lenz may be right guilt is a funny thing he says a sense of guilt i mean its what separates you from strobekker ironic isnt it this cross you bear makes you a better man i ask you to talk about it only because i know the pain of secrets so intimately ive seen what it does to people dont get me wrong i dont advocate unburdening yourself to your wife that would make you feel better but it would make her feel much worse the noble thing is to bear the weight yourself but that doesnt mean you cant share it a little even christ did that i study lenzs face for any trace of cynicism but he seems sincere i dont think i could just tell you you or anybody the bare reality of it is i dont know too simple just start talking these things have their own rhythm anything else is just facts you dont want facts facts are for men like daniel im a truth man and thats altogether different after a slow breath i push my hands back through my hair and say you know my wife is an obgyn yes you probably dont know we were high school sweethearts youve been married that long no we were high school sweethearts who got married twelve years after high school weve only been married three years no other marriages before that no i give lenz a thumbnail sketch of erin and drewes family history focusing on the opposite personalities of the sisters and the deceptions they used to hide them the glow of lenzs cigarette bobs up and down as i try to describe erins unique combination of beauty and sensuality but im not sure he gets it he seems more interested in drewe she graduated first in her class at tulane medical school tied for first no mean accomplishment you never slept with her in high school plenty of times a lot of making out fooling around but we only actually had intercourse once and it was a disaster i think she just wanted to get the whole virgin thing out of the way it was a mistake you didnt have sex with other girls during this time too many did your wife know this eventually and she knew some of the girls like i said small school was her sister one of these girls no erin and i were enemies then almost like brother and sister what life path did erin take four days after she graduated she left mississippi for manhattan and never looked back a guy saw her in a restaurant and wham she was a model she went through the usual celebrity arcwhos erin anderson get me erin anderson get me someone like erin anderson whos erin andersonbut at ten times the usual speed a year after she left home she was drying out in a clinic in new hampshire with a very wealthy friend footing the bill for the next few years she kicked around new york and la on the arms of various actors artists musicians i actually ran into her a couple of times on the road but we just played the roles wed played since childhood lenz stubs out his cigarette and lights another how so friendly but sarcastic she made fun of drewe the saintly sister pursuing her medical degree with the commitment of a nun she joked about my waiting for drewe were you i dont know i had affairs during those years long badly ended relationships did you have sex with erin then hell no i told you yes but its obvious that theres always been a strong attraction between you and your wifes sister any man who sees my wifes sister feels a strong attraction to her okay but erin doesnt feel reciprocal attraction to these masses of other men does she not the kind of attraction she felt for you i didnt know that at the time of course you did continue no matter what relationships i was in during those years i always stayed in contact with drewe sometimes a year would go by without our seeing each other just a couple of latenight calls but other times shed call me in tears about something and i would drop whatever i was doing and drive ten or twelve hours to new orleans to be with her still no sex between you not in the complete sense shes a different sort of girl very oldfashioned was she involved with other men during these years she dated but it never worked out i dont think she ever meant for it to when drewe didnt put out after a few dates the guys usually went elsewhere but you werent holding to a similar code of abstinence didnt even try it was the classic dilemma she wanted total commitment from me before giving up what she held precious i wanted what she held precious as proof of her love smart woman okay okay cut ahead a few years to when my last band selfdestructed where do you think i ran to lick my wounds when that happened new orleans naturally drewe was entering her final year of residency at tulane my career was in flames it was start over or get out for good what do you think happened she started sleeping with you youve heard all this before i guess not quite in this way but im starting to feel as though i know your wife lenz allows himself a smile i like her i asked drewe to marry me but she said we had a year before real life started she said we should use that time to make sure we were sure what she really meant was i had a year to make sure i was sure i reach down to the drink caddy and take a long swig of tab i did a repeat of what id done after high school packed up my clothes twenty grand id saved from gigging and headed north to chicago i was going to relearn everything i ever forgot about the markets and earn our stake for the future i took a tiny apartment near the board of trade a bed and a tv no guitar books stacked waisthigh everywhere even in the bathroom drewe and i had planned to see each other as often as possible but we only managed it twice the timing was too tough but we talked on the phone constantly i feel a last flush of anxiety but i force myself to go on and then it happened erin appeared magically in chicago standing in my hallway in the dead of winter without even a coat she was flying crosscountry with some actor had a layover in chicago and she just walked off the plane as beautiful as ever more so white linen blouse buttoned to the throat black jeans plain silver earrings sandals on her tanned feet you slept with her that night no we just talked i lent her a ski jacket and gloves and took her out to dinner we took a cab up and down michigan avenue rode the elevator to the top of the hancock like a couple of tourists i was lonelier than i knew i found myself holding erins hand as she looked out over lake michigan the intimacy of it was i dont know thirty seconds of connectedness in a winter when my only connections had been with greedy assholes and numbers she didnt look at me while we held hands but she squeezed hard before she let go and walked back to the elevator i stop talking for a moment and watch the constellations of headlights around us racing toward us overtaking us from behind you want details or just the jack webb version oh details please but for the details mourning becomes electra would be no different than the oresteia i grope for the allusions but all i come up with is an absurd image of jack nicholson trying to get diane keaton to sleep with him in reds we talked some more at the apartment sitting on the floor and drinking coffee laced with bourbon to keep warm we talked about erins time in new york her getting clean my giving up music she seemed surprised drewe and i had only seen each other twice she had no grasp of the demands of medical school when she fell asleep i tucked her in my bed then slept in an easy chair id bought thirdhand from another tenant the next morning i forced myself out of the chair brushed my teeth and got in the shower i felt like hell i turned the water as hot as i could stand it then i felt a quick draft of cold air the bathroom door had opened and closed i heard erin say i couldnt wait i pulled the shower curtain away from the wall and saw her sitting stark naked on the commode with her elbows on her knees and her chin propped on her hands she shooed me away with one hand when she realized i was watching i let go of the curtain and started washing my hair a few seconds later she stepped into the shower id seen her naked once before in high school skinnydipping and her body looked no older than that in chicago her skin was much darker than mine her hair almost black long and thick falling over those shoulders and the same you know lots of it she looked up and smiled then hugged me and laid her cheek against my chest as if she meant to go back to sleep standing there in the spray i didnt hug her back but i wanted to im sure it all sounds calculated now but then it seemed like the most natural thing in the world unavoidable lenz makes no comment she was so casual about it like walking in to pee as if i wasnt there like wed been married for years she just didnt worry about things like that propriety that affected me seeing her on the commode like that affected me weird maybe but its the truth and she she just wasnt like other women she kissed my nipples before she ever kissed my mouth she seemed to sense it had been a long time since id had a woman long enough that any serious lovemaking would have to wait until shed gotten that first release out of the way she used her mouth for that and her hands she knew before i did where i was you know and when i started to finish she didnt pull away she just i trail off unable to find words to communicate the experience afterward she stood up and hugged me again she didnt speak but i saw she somehow knew her sister didnt complete that act in the way she just had i thought of drewe then but she seemed removed from all this wholly apart from it it was as though erin and i were meeting in some place where drewe didnt exist the way it might be if erin found herself in grand rounds at the hospital with drewe in that environment erin simply would not exist the analogy isnt perfect drewe certainly has a sexual identity of her own but i understand you want me to skip ahead its you or the radio lenz says in a strangely thick voice just keep going from the shower a bleak image from fahrenheit suddenly passes behind my eyes i see myself driving through its wooded film location a living book spouting my softcore text for lenzs strange pleasure look i cant explain what made erin so unique what i said before about exploration crossing thresholds even that fails with her i doubt theres any erotic space shes never been except maybe pure love but her sexual presence her magnetism jesus bottomless eyes scalloped collarbones small darknippled breasts that made a mockery of all the surgically enhanced architecture i saw every day at the board of trade i think she realized i was being overcome by her beauty for the first time and she was determined to give me access to all of it she must have seen a lot of men get lost in her like that but i could tell this meant more to her for more reasons than you could imagine cole the first time we made love in the bed she came about ten seconds before i did then she cradled my face in her hands andi still remember what she said lenz turns to me his eyes tiny points of light i love you no she said its so easy isnt it and then she smiled when i emptied into her a mona lisa smile no other way to describe it like she knew all the secrets of creation how long did she stay in chicago four days we hardly left the apartment the most she ever wore was one of my shirts she watched movies without comment unless laughter or tears is comment once we saw an eyeliner commercial that had used her eyes i never once looked up to find her watching me yet when i caught myself staring at her she would turn to me with a half smile that told me she knew i was watching it was like living with a wild creature she never once put on a spot of makeup she seemed to stay perpetually wet i mean she never got she was a fantasy lover lenz says softly no she was real i meant in the sense that the erotic activity was directed toward your satisfaction rather than hers i consider this for a few moments i dont think thats true she got her share of surprises as well the car seat groans slightly as lenz repositions himself what do you mean sometimesat the moment of orgasmshe passed out i mean out we werent drinking at all but she would literally lose consciousness it only happened three times but the first time i was actually dialing nineoneone when she woke up lenz chuckles softly your reaction isnt unique it happened to you alas no ive never seen it personally le petite mort does that mean little death thelittle death yes its a phrase from french poetry thats what erin said she told me it had never happened to her before but i didnt believe her i mean how would she have known about it otherwise shes not the type to read french poetry lenz makes a noncommittal sound in her circle she might have heard it described did you enjoy le petite mort after that first time im not sure but i saw how right the expression was at the moment of greatest intensity when her chest was mottled red and her face flushed she just snapped right out of the world the last time when she came out of it she told me that shed felt pure peace one of the only times shed felt it in her life as if she had just been spit out of the womb whole and new and yes she said she thought being dead might not be a bad thing she was serious later she even talked about her funeral how she wanted it to be there was this song of mine shed heard on a tape i made for drewe shed dubbed a copy for herself its called all i want is everything she said it was about her and that she wanted me to play it at her funeral what did you say i said sure and changed the subject lenz purses his lips and cuts across two lanes of traffic the lights of suburbia are almost continuous now so we must be getting somewhere how long did this erotic interlude last he asks drewe called on the fourth night ah erin was lying beside me in the bed in the time it took drewe to explain that she was calling from the hospital and that a patient she was close to had just died erin became her sister again not some ethereal beingdrewes little sister shed risen up and was mouthing is that drewe while drewe said something about a pulmonary embolism i dont remember what i said to get off the phone but i knew i had failed drewe in a time of emotional crisis what i do remember clearly is what erin said the moment i hung up what lenz asks how are we going to tell her i wasnt sure id heard right so i asked what she meant she leaned back against the headboard exposing those perfect breasts but for once i wasnt looking at her body she said how are we going to tell drewe about us i was in shock i climbed out of bed and said something like jesus where did this come from where she asked me what have we been doing the last four days shaking hands before i could answer she said fucking then she jerked up the covers and let me have it i thought you were different i thought you understood some things about women about me what do you think i came out to the frozen wastes of chicago for sport sex i can get all of that i want anywhere on the planet thank you very much and so on i was more stunned by the pain in her voice than by her venom i thought shed come out because she was at a place in her life where she needed a friend after hearing how dumb that sounded i said what did you come out here for she let the covers fall stood up naked on my hardwood floor and said to marry you you asshole how unfortunate says lenz as if commenting on some distant village destroyed by a typhoon with a smooth motion he exits from the interstate and turns into a broad avenue so you had an affair with your wifes sister while you were engaged we werent engaged not technically youre splitting hairs you had committed yourself to drewe yes but she never learned of the affair no lenz shrugs im missing something this betrayal weighs heavily upon you on a daily basis oh youre definitely missing something that night erin left chicago two months later i heard she had married a guy named patrick graham hes an oncologist now but he went to high school with the rest of us everybody knew patrick had been in love with erin since we were kids and by a seeming miracle his dream girl had suddenly decided she loved him erin lost no time getting pregnant and plunging into a domesticity that would shame martha stewart a few months later i left chicago and married drewe we werent sure where we wanted to settle so we moved into my parents farmhouse in rain they were dead by then quite a detail to omit nothing oedipal about it anyway drewe and i still live in rain while erin and patrick and holly their daughter live in jackson thats the state capital seventy miles away we see them a good bit usually at drewe and erins folks place in yazoo city did you resume your affair with erin god no i felt queasy from guilt whenever she was around she seemed stable but i knew she was capable of anything under stress i thought she might even blurt out the truth one day in an argument with drewe or patrick just for spite did she no but if id known the real truth i wouldnt have been afraid of that you see her childhollyis my daughter for once lenz has no comment he rubs his chin for a few moments takes a deep drag on his cigarette and blows out the smoke that is a serious problem try catastrophic how long have you known this three months does patrick know the child is yours no does he know the child is not his yes erin told him she was pregnant before she agreed to marry him but she made him promise never to ask who the father was patrick was so blinded by love that he agreed lenz makes another turn this time onto a wooded twolane road but as time passed the question began to prey upon his mind thats my guess who knows what their problems are with erin it could be anything and for the last three months youve lived in terror that their imploding marriage will spit your dark secret up into the light you got it he shakes his head im surprised you havent developed hives im having some pretty bad headaches drewe wants a baby and she doesnt understand why i dont you dont want a child by your wife of course i do but i feel like taking that step while this other situation is unresolved would be the worst betrayal of all how so well youre married right i have a wife and a son but you dont want to extrapolate from my marital relationship youll know what i mean though you know how when you first get married even though youre totally in love theres still this tacit sense that if you both decided it was a horrible mistake you could just shake hands and walk away i know that sounds shallow but my wife is as oldfashioned as they come and i know she feels this too having that first child is the final step you know thats the true marriage its irrevocable the two of you can never be truly separate again youre joined in the flesh to wit erin and yourself jesus dont even talk about it like that but this is why drewe so passionately wants to have your child shes an intelligent woman she senses a formless but disturbing threat she knows a child will bind the two of you against that i dont think she senses the threat well maybe but not from erin no way im sure of that i think you would be making a mistake to underestimate your wife in any way hey i know that better than anybody lenz looks lost in thought any great insights doctor well unlike many psychiatric patients you have a real problem in the physical sense i mean that child is a living symbol of a secret relationship you love the child im sure and the mother must mustsometimes look at you and wish that you were the man raising her in my opinion the truth will eventually come out regardless of what you do you can choose the time thats all lenz states his opinion with the conviction of an oracle and the catharsis id begun to feel with the act of confession dissipates like smoke in a wind let me change the subject for a moment he says would you answer one question about miles turner it sounds like he answered enough about me when i asked him the worst thing he had ever done he refused to answer but he did say he would tell me the worst thing that ever happened to him he said he once spent sixty seconds facetoface with a pit viper i feel the skin on the back of my neck prickle thats all he would say lenz adds can you supply any details that old drug charge wasnt enough to make him tell you lenz looks genuinely surprised is that what he told you that you coerced him yeah you didnt i did but not with a drug charge it was assault and battery i feel the nausea of a sudden descent assault yes ive reviewed the case file but the details are sketchy it happened outside a gay bar in manhattan two men verbally abused a friend of mr turnersa homosexual friendand turner abused back the sequence of events is unclear after that but the upshot is that both men were beaten severely by mr turner he apparently has some martial arts training my anger at miles for talking about me is vanquished by a question that has badgered me for a long time doctor do you think miles is gay lenz smiles with bright irony doctorpatient privilege cole however theres no legal stricture keeping you from telling me what you know i start to refuse but if miles didnt want me to talk about it why did he mention it to lenz at all we were kids i say eleven or twelve best friends miles didnt have many he was hard to like some of the older guys actually hated him he was twice as smart as they were and he didnt mind making them look like idiots in school it was summer the two of us were hunting for arrowheads on a little indian mound out in a cotton field some kids had built a fort in a stand of trees on the mound it was just a hole in the ground with a foothigh wall of logs around it and a scraptin roof laid over the hole stayed full of water most of the time we were looking at the fort when four older kids came screaming up to us on their bikes they started teasing us especially miles miles made a smartass remark and that was it they hit him a few times then the ringleader said he was going to teach miles a lesson he said there were water moccasins nesting in the fort and unless miles swore by his nogood daddy that he loved sucking nigger dicks he was going into that hole miles was scared to death but he wouldnt say what they wanted i think it was the part about his father that got him not sucking dicks finally they forced him kicking and screaming through the little entrance to the fort i heard a splash then nothing the guy said if miles came out before dark theyd break his arm it was bad doctor i wanted to help him but i knew if i tried theyd just throw me in there with him i was hoping theyd get bored and go away when i heard a sound that froze my blood there was a snake in that pit but it wasnt any moccasin moccasins dont make noise they just bite you this was a rattlesnake two seconds after it rattled those assholes jumped on their bikes and hauled tail i screamed at miles to get out of there but he didnt come up then i heard a tiny little voice whimper i cant i jumped down beside the entrance hole and started whispering at him to back slowly toward my voice but he just kept whimpering i couldnt see a goddamn thing after about a minute i got up my nerve and reached my hand into that hole i mean slow my whole arm was tingling even at eleven years old i knew a rattlesnake was a pit viper and they see heat not objects and i knew my hand was a lot warmer than the wall of that wet hole i edged my hand along the dirt for what seemed like an hour then my fingers felt cotton i grabbed miless arm and yanked him up out of there his face was covered with tears and his jeans were soaked with piss he was shaking like an epileptic i wipe stinging sweat out of my eyes after he calmed down he told me very quietly that one day those bastards would regret what theyd done to him are you all right cole orderly rows of soft yellow lights passing my window finally break through telling me were in a residential area sure is there more to the story i consider holding back but for whatever reason i dont several years later the ringleader of that little gang had a strange accident he was bitten four times by a cottonmouth water moccasin or twice each by two cottonmouths anyway he ended up losing a foot lenz catches his breath how did that happen the guy was going to college at delta state about a hundred miles north of rain he got into his car late one afternoon and these snakes just started hitting him around the ankles somehow theyd got into his car they were lying under the drivers seat baking in the hot shade the guy had left his window open i guess they just dropped in from a tree limb they do that you know lenz stops the mercedes at a turn and looks at me are you saying turner put those snakes in that mans car i choose my words carefully im telling you that if cops could trace snakes they would have traced them right back to that little fort on the indian mound my god how many years after the initial incident was this six or seven at least thats one thing about miles he follows through im not saying hes a killer after all those guys had terrorized him he was just giving back some of what theyd given him sort of a southern tradition i crush my tab can flat and drop it on the floor look are we there or what i want to get this over with in time to make that swat plane lenz turns onto still another residential street the houses here are large not as large as bob andersons but undoubtedly more expensive at last he swings the mercedes into a bricked drive and parks cole he says in the sudden silence you reported the missing women because you knew something was terribly wrong are you ready to help me make it right isnt that clear by now he just sits letting the engine tick even if the trail leads to miles turner yes but it wont miles could kill maybe but not like that i dont think its in him do you im afraid i havent ruled it out lenz gets out of the car and i do the same but as i follow him around to a side door i see nothing of the house or grounds i merely track his shoes using the same trancelike vision that keeps my car on the road when my mind is a million miles from reality can lenz count on me if the trail leads to miles i answered yes but it was a reflex response because what i was thinking at that moment was how after that delta state guy was bitten by the cottonmouths the state police showed up in rain to question annie turner about her son theyd heard some strange things about the kid and wanted to know his whereabouts on the day the guy was bitten annie turner didnt know but i did and i did what any friend would do under the circumstances i lied chapter when lenz opens the door to the fbi safe house what i see in the glow of the porch light bears little resemblance to the mental picture i had but then i suppose that picture was generated by trash fiction and bad films pretty swank i comment this is the safe house no no he says in a strangely soft voice this is my home i need some files from my desk some clothes i intended to have an agent pick them up but i left it until too late my wifes probably sleeping i can wait out here no problem no no you shouldnt be out here alone afraid ill call a cab from your car phone nonsense come along lenz creeps through his own house with the stealth of a burglar i realize im doing the same as we pass through a laundry room and into a dark kitchen with copper pots and utensils hanging like ancient weapons above our heads at the far end of the kitchen stands a wide arch that leads into a breakfast area a dim bulb in the stove hood throws a yellow pool of light on the floor lenz points to a chair ill only be a minute make yourself at home then he disappears through the arch a low beating sound tells me he is going upstairs yes please do says a womans voice sending a cold shock up between my shoulder blades all my senses on full power i focus on the table beyond the arch against a wallhigh curtain i see the silhouette of a woman sitting in a straightbacked chair a bar glass glints on the table in front of her lenz must have walked right past her janet he calls and i hear his feet coming back down the stairs janet are you awake no im sleepwalking thank god i can still taste my drink where the hell have you been for three days i can see the stairwell now lenzs face drops below the level of the ceiling im working a case for daniel an important case he comes down two more steps and looks at his wife he seems caught between not wanting to invite me up to his office and not wanting to leave me down here with her why the hell didnt he just leave me in the car ill be right down he says finally please take care of mr cole and then he scurries back up the stairwell oh i will says the woman in a slurred voice as she stands up and moves toward me light from the stove falls across her the light is not flattering several years older than her husband janet lenz is wearing some kind of sheer wrap over a filmy undergarment i suppose its meant to be sexy but with the smudged mascara and the smell of stale gin and cigarettes wafting across the kitchen the effect is pathos she is a thin waspish woman with a fading dye job and a spiderwork of wrinkles around her mouth that marks her as a lifelong smoker yet her eyes hold a gimlet glow of cleverness as if her mind retains just enough clarity to be momentarily observant or cruel her voice has an edge reminiscent of schoolteachers who enjoy dispensing discipline a little too much your accent she says it reminds me of north carolina my people are from philadelphia but i attended greensboro an allfemale institution they used to bus in boys from duke though the most charming boys thats nice oh it was she says in a lilting drawl about as authentic as vivien leighs blanche dubois they knew how to be gentlemen those boys but they also knew when to stop being gentlemen you know what i mean mister cole my noncommittal mmmm trails off into an averted gaze mrs lenz demands my attention by tinkling the ice in her glass and clucking her tongue thats something arthur never learned she goes on hes always such a gentleman but the new england version can be so dull dr lenz doesnt seem like the dull type to me maam give him time darling he makes a terrific first impression hes blindingly analytical but hes also numbingly predictable the uncomfortable silence grows more so as she moves closer and smiles with the yellow brilliance of a cheap diamond i have the feeling she is circling me like a scavenger youd think a man who knows freud like the back of his hand would know his way around a bedroom wouldnt you uh i dont think thats any of my business still closer i must have gotten to know a hundred psychiatrists over the past twenty years she says the coldest bunch of jellyfish you ever shared pâté with half of them impotent the other half queer deliverance arrives at last in the form of dr lenz who bounds into the kitchen carrying a suit bag and a briefcase hes probably well aware of what ive been enduring down here i nearly stumble over my shoes making my escape janet lenz trails us to the laundry room as her husband opens the door she says go play your little mind games we cant let any of those wicked boys out there have any fun can we i turn back in time to see lenz slam the door as the mercedes swallows the driveway with a lowthroated growl lenz says as you can see we all have our problems did she make a nuisance of herself not at all just idle chitchat he makes a curious sound in his throat she didnt bring up the relative sizes of caucasian versus negroid sex organs i dont recall it coming up youre lucky whats her problem depression alcohol an emotionally distant husband who is frequently an asshole not necessarily in that order none of my business sorry to put you through it nonetheless lenz is driving well over the speed limit now fast enough that i grip the seat between my thighs were only a short distance from the safe house he says makes it easy for me to commute you can see why i need to be close i nod as if i agree but if i were in his place id have chosen a safe house in los angeles the trip takes less than ten minutes including stops for traffic lights the safe house is more modest than lenzs home but easily worth over a hundred thousand in the mississippi market god knows what it appraised at here as the automatic garage door whirs down behind the mercedes i decide the fbi chose well a woman who could afford the fees for eros wouldnt live in a house less expensive than this inside i am surprised again i expected stern fbi agents pacing around drinking coffee but all i find is pristine cream carpeting functional furniture and framed watercolors that look like they were bought from a hotel chain the place feels like a model home in a tract development doctor lenz calls a womans voice from a hallway that must lead to the firstfloor bedrooms steps a woman in her late twenties she has auburn hair a little coarser than drewes green eyes fair skin and a slim but athletic figure all in all shes a slightly harder version of my wife she takes three steps into the room before i notice the holster and pistol slung tight under her left arm sherrys in the back she tells lenz and the guy from engineering research is in the spare bedroom upstairs her eyes move to me whos this special agent margie ressler meet harper cole hes one of the sysops for eros hes going to help me get started tonight hows trade so far all ive done so far is send out for pizza i ordered enough for everybody agent ressler cannot conceal the excitement in her eyes i figured since you havent gone online yet nobody could be surveiling the house right when lenz merely sighs she adds i got supremes told them to leave off the anchovies just in case you want me to nuke a few slices for you not hungry lenz says distractedly cole ill take some diet coke okay great bring it upstairs lenz instructs her at the bottom of the carpeted staircase he stops and calls back over his shoulder i didnt see a car in the garage margie ressler hurries back into the living room theyre delivering it tonight should be here anytime its an acura legend ninetytwo model confiscated in a drug raid is that okay fine make sure sherry shows you everything you need to know yes sir at the top of the stairs lenz steps into what must have been designed as a bedroom now it sports a wallsize computer cabinet a dell desktop pc a toshiba subnotebook computer with pcmcia modem slotted in and connected a bank of wire telephones a fax machine a cellular phone and a sony television near the bathroom stands a refrigeratorfreezer with a microwave oven on top and against the far wall a twin bed planning to stay awhile i ask as lenz deposits his suit bag in a closet half filled with mens clothing he turns to face me his gaze eerily intense this is where i live until hostage rescue carries mr strobekker out in chains he stares at me until i break eye contact what do you want me to do i ask show me the highways and byways of eros i want you to establish my bona fides he motions to one of two swivel chairs you take the toshiba have you logged on yet i didnt want to risk doing anything stupid lurked any on other services lurked lurking is logging on but not interacting with anyone watching the conversations of other people no but youve installed the eros software the kid in the spare bedroom did okay sit lenz obeys without demur taking the chair before the dell got eross eight hundred number entered into both systems ready to go password chosen done what is it you dont need to know that touchy okay press enter and let the system make the connection its all automatic just like compuserve or aol after checking the toshiba for a keystrokerecording program which would allow fbi technicians to replay everything i type on this computerand disabling the one i findi log on and enter my password what does your status line say doctor checking password logging onto eros at bps welcome lilith lilith thats your great alias just wait where am i the main page now it says downloading image thats the bust of nefertiti my god the color and resolution are wonderful shell start spinning d in a second see okay hit enter and shell go away look at the right side of the main page see those little icons thats how you decide where you want to go into a livechat area or forum maybe the eros library you just move your mouse onto the icon you want and click i know how to use a mouse cole congratulations look at the top line over the page thats your menu bar see the choices thats where you decide what you want to do in those different locationsagain with your mouse you can post messages to forums compose and send email download files from the library access the internet anything you want you can even query the system to ask whos in a given room at a given time of course it will only give you their user names in answer you mean we can query the system to ask whether or not strobekker is online not exactly first of all youre not supposed to know his legal nameif strobekker is his name miles or i can search using the account name but i cant guarantee strobekker wouldnt see us looking for him god only knows what kind of setup he has wherever he is but i can search using his online aliases yes lets query for shiva and kali right now you can only search for one alias at a time the system will tell you whether the person using that name is online but not where he or she is then you can send the person a message but theres no guarantee hell answer the other way is to enter various chat rooms and ask whos here will the other people in the room see you ask that the minute you enter a room they see your name pop up on a list in a little window on their screen how many rooms are there in the system theoretically an infinite number lenz groans i need strobekker to find me as if by accident how can we search an infinite number of rooms its not as bad as it sounds the number of active rooms fluctuates anywhere from a couple of dozen on a monday morning to eight or nine hundred on a friday night that includes socalled private rooms that hold only two people at a given time nine hundred you said you or turner could do a search by the account name can you do that from here yes but im sure miles would already have told the fbi agents at eros if the strobekker account was active lenz gives me a look that makes plain how little faith he has in miless motives from the toshiba i log in as sysop two give my password and run an account search for strobekker david m not among those present i say and push the chair away from the toshiba look i really need to call my wife it wont take more than a couple of minutes well get me started at something lenz says i wave him out of his chair and mouse him into a lobby room with about ten people in it just read what comes up on your screen get a feel for the conversational style if somebody asks you anything ignore them ill be back in no time use my cellular he advises its secure punch sevensevensevensix before you dial your home number and dont put a one in front of the area code and dont take too long i want you right here when i get a nibble a nibble i almost laugh as i step into the hall with the cellular the guy thinks hes fishing and maybe he is i punch in the fbi code then the familiar sixzeroone that encompasses all of mississippi drewe answers after two rings harper yes thank god are you okay i was worried are you calling from a plane no im still in washington virginia really you sound like youre in a plane its too complicated to explain but i should be home before morning any more police harassment no whatever youre doing its working i did get one call though from that new orleans detective mayeux yes hes worried about you he said he didnt know where you were but he had a feeling you were with the fbi he told me to warn you not to trust them harper he said the fbi will use you while they need you then throw you to the dogs i hear a muffled cole from inside lenzs room ive got to go drewe tell your dad everythings under control i know hes worried about all this not right now hes not all he can think about right now is erin my heart stutters erin whys that she and patrick are having problems again when i got home tonight she was sitting on our steps with holly she drove over from jackson because she didnt want to be there when patrick got home we drank coffee and played with holly for hours then she went to mom and dads to spend the night jesus did she tell you what was wrong she wouldnt be specific but its serious patrick called four times and he sounded angrier every time is holly okay she senses the tension but i think erin and patrick know enough not to fight in front of her i wonder the likely source of patricks tension could turn any man violent dont worry about that stuff drewe says buoyantly just take care of the police problem and get back here i love you you know i love you too a brief silence bye bye i shut off lenzs cell phone and lean against the wall my right cheek flush against the cool sheetrock she was sitting on the porch steps with holly wouldnt be specific he sounded angrier every time mr cole you okay special agent margie ressler is standing before me with a tray piled with sliced pizza paper towels a glass of ice and a diet coke she looks like a waitress in a college town where restaurants are blessed with a pool of potential employees overqualified in every department you look like youre in a daze she says im fine when was the last time you ate its been awhile here she holds a slice of pizza within biting distance something about agent ressler encourages informality so i lean forward and take a bite the spicy cheese is a moist explosion in my mouth mmmm better than crawfish étouffée she grimaces id think anything was better than that ever had it no then you dont know what youre slandering she laughs lightly you dont look like most computer jocks i know thats because im not one ive got a knack for applications but thats it i guess its sort of like driving a car im a good driver but i couldnt rebuild an engine if my life depended on it ill bet you can change the oil though are we flirting agent ressler she grins i guess we are call me margie i think im flirting because i know i might be trapped here for a long time it seems like dangerous duty decoy work yes i guess youve done it a lot though no this is my first time ive only been out of the academy a couple of years cole lenz calls his voice like a hand on my sleeve are you out there margie laughs he sounds mad she drops her voice i wouldnt want that bird mad at me hes a strange one he grows on you i smile and slip the cell phone into my pants pocket ill take the tray margie you be careful no sweat she says with a toss of her hair then she turns and trots back down the stairs at the bedroom door i pause id intended to make one other call while out here eleanor rigby miles interrupted my first attempt to warn her off eros and i havent managed to do it since the hard bulge of the cell phone in my pocket offers a chance but instinct tells me that any number i call on the secure fbi phone could later be identified and traced to a name ill have to find another way this is fascinating lenz says as i enter the room these conversations are a freeforall you mean threads i correct him setting down the tray threads thats the online term for conversation on eros anyway on other services chat is the correct term but on eros thread covers pretty much any conversation in special interest forums a thread is where a few people get on one subject and everyone puts in their two cents worth like coping with aids in the gay forum any time of day or night clients can read whats already been said and post a reply if they want i sit down in the swivel chair and begin munching on the pizza lets scan the forum headings just to give you an idea of whats out there i click the mouse on general interest forums and the thread headings appear in a column window abortion rights update acts of love graphic file under construction decoding software required actors studio analism breast cancer not the end of your sex life breast reductionenlargement is it safe brief encounters camille paglia cinema vérité coping with aids paglia says lenz camille paglia is on eros i cant tell you that but clicking on that heading will lead you to a discussion of her works there are over a hundred headings but you get the idea im reaching for my mouse when lenz stops my hand and says id like to see them all i can almost see his eyes focus on the more provocative selections my eyes gravitate to those i know as the more popular or strange coprophilia de sade reconsidered dominant female erotic fine arts graphic file under construction decoding software required erotic literature salon eurotrash bin feminism fetishism subcategories frotteurism gay mans world subcategories god in the bedroom hets only heterosexuals hiv positive incest survivors women only island of lesbos subcategories jan krislov the ceo answers your questions medicalsexual questions mds respond as time permits necrophilia phone sex stuck in adolescence privacy rights subcategories queer nation rape counseling romance sex police urophilia voyeurism younger men older women zoophilia many of these are medical terms lenz observes drewe had to bring home a dsmiiir manual just so i could figure out what some of them meant now i name a lot of the threads myself are there many physicians on eros a fair number how many over a hundred lenz seems to be thinking are these headings permanent some are but the idea of eros is to be dynamic to respond as various needs arise for example island of lesbos is constant but many of its subcategories change every day it covers all kinds of lesbian behavior and interests lets look i click the mouse on lesbos and watch the new window open revealing another column of thread titles whats penetrating discussion some lesbians are into penetration others arent they discuss various objects to use for it whats better natural versus artificial like that i figured you knew all about this stuff i have some lesbian patients who use vegetables for stimulation i sometimes think about it when i walk through the produce section of a grocery thats gardenvariety stuff pardon the pun you know what shocked me they talk about size a lot one woman said most vegetables were too large for her she said the perfect thing to use was an oscar mayer wiener dont laughits true i said isnt that too soft for the job and you know what she said not if you freeze it if you freeze it lenz beams with the pleasure of a man who is rarely shocked but how does she stand the temperature that could damage her tissues thats exactly what i said she told me that when shes ready she just takes one out of the freezer and runs it under hot water for about sixty seconds then its perfect i shake my head im telling you anything you can possibly think of its already been done and posted on eros what about these graphics files thats miless project jan krislov originally wanted eros to be purely textbased she saw that as another way to keep the level of discussion high but the demand for graphics has become so great and the technology so much better that shes had to give in the whole thing is miless baby of course while lenz nods thoughtfully i click out of the forum and into the livechat area i guess wed better start checking room by room for prose that sounds like our man lenz takes something from a drawer im going to tape our session he says pressing a button on a small olympus recorder that way i wont have to make notes of any instructions you give me itll save the psychiatrist jumps as one of the phones on the desk rings he looks to see which number it is then answers while he turns away and speaks too low for me to hear i punch up the eros email window on the toshiba and compose a quick message to eleanor rigby please do not log onto eros again until you hear from me strange things happening will send further mail via internet harper before sending the message i disable the autofile function so that no record of this note will be saved to lenzs hard drive then i click the mouse on send now message mailed flashes just as lenz hangs up the phone that was daniel baxter he says his voice brimming with excitement what is it strobekker just contacted the bureau what he sent a message to daniels personal email address at quantico could that be possible sure if the quantico computers are connected to the internet some are but the units computers are supposed to be sealed off from the outside this message came across the internal email system the same way a secret case memo would the quantico technicians say they cant locate the source of the message daniel is rattled hes faxing us a copy now the fax machine rings on cue and we both stare at the slowly emerging page when lenz is sure no more is to come he tears off the curled sheet and lays it on the desk it reads please stop trying to locate us you cannot succeed you were not even close today in dallas an innocent man died for nothing if you knew what we are trying to accomplish you would not even try to find us you would realize that our work will ultimately benefit all mankind our work is almost complete we will sacrifice no more lives than necessary when the time is right we shall come to you you must trust us and leave us alone thank you ive never seen anything like this lenz says notice the use of the pronoun we often thats a ploy but in this case it fits with the evidence indicating a team offender situation you mean like a cult like the california police were assuming no no forget that drivel you heard in new orleans true cult murders are almost nonexistent ninetynine percent of cult homicides are committed for standard motives for example a cult leader will mask the elimination of a rival as a ceremonial killing more often than not its lawyers and the media who turn homicides into satanic murders lenz touches the fax with his forefinger no were dealing with something altogether different here no threat at all you notice that not even any baiting the author was simply trying to communicate his thoughts he really believes we cannot find himor them as the case may be my gut tells me the author of the note may be right daniel asked whether this might be the work of a disgruntled employee or prankster inside the bureau lenz muses i dont think theres much chance of that but if youve never seen a note like this maybe the killer didnt write it oh he wrote it i perceive the lack of overt threat as more dangerous the work of a more confident and thus more organized personality and here i think he actually believes we might stop hunting him if we understood his work whatever that is i read softly we will sacrifice no more lives than necessary what do you think that means were dealing with some degree of megalomania here a tremendous egoor group of egosthat believes itself a part of some grandiose or holy mission thats fairly common who knows what kind of twisted logic leads him to think that by killing he is saving the human race hitler thought he was sacrificing no more lives than necessary when he murdered six million jews i dont know i say scanning the note again the tone is eerie like jonas salk trying to explain his polio vaccine to a bunch of stone age bushmen you know some of you may be paralyzed from this but in the end its for the greater good albert sabin had the live vaccine lenz says softly but youre right dallas was his early warning system this is his response he invaded the fbis computers to send it that fact alone is his threat hes telling you youre not in his league doctor hes wrong lenz says quietly he waves his arm at the arrayed technology tonight is the commencement de la fin the what the beginning of the end i memorize the message before lenz can set it aside i told daniel id get back to him in an hour with an analysis he says were going to spend that hour on eros are you ready to guide me cole despite my fatigue and my anger at being coerced into my present position a powerful current of excitement is circulating through me the man who killed karin wheat just issued a direct challenge and no southern male is very good at ignoring those it may be juvenile and atavistic but it definitely gets the pulse pounding i take a huge bite of cold pizza and wash it down with diet coke lets nail this arrogant son of a bitch chapter dr lenz and i have been logged onto eros for nearly two hours he went into microsoft word for five minutes to compose an analysis of the strobekker note and fax it to daniel baxter at quantico but aside from that weve been trolling the private chat rooms like bass fishermen on a slow morning casting spinners under likely looking trees and piers dragging artificial worms across dark bottoms with jan krislovs conditional approval miles has given lenz the ability to monitor rooms that the subscribers believe to be private the psychiatrist seems surprised by each new encounter whether a steamy tryst in regency england or a postnuclear têteatête in some virtual retropunk dive all my system queries on the strobekker account have come back subscriber not currently logged on the characters scrolling across my screen turned to alphabet soup long ago and the dotmatrix printer recording them now sounds like a herd of cocaineaddicted gerbils suddenly my eyes come clear and a numbing tingle heats the back of my arms move over i tell lenz jumping up from the toshiba before he can even get out of his chair im clicking the dell out of the room he was in and into the room i was monitoring what is it he asks over my shoulder is it strobekker maybe i reply reclaiming my seat at the toshiba just read and follow along lenz takes his chair and leans forward until his nose is almost against the screen of the dell levon and sarah those arent his aliases i think levon is him why hasnt turner called then read the screen damn it read levon this stuff about god yes look how quickly his responses pop up and not a single error now shut up and read i focus on the dialogue moving down my screen levon if it were given to you to create god what qualities or powers would you give him sarah what do you mean i cant create god god already exists levon but if he didnt exist how would you conceive of him what are those marks lenz asks i saw them in your printouts emphasis yeah like italics sarah well id make him allpowerful like he is levon is he sarah of course levon and what of the devil sarah what about him levon doesnt satan have any power sarah some the power to tempt i guess but god has more levon then why does evil flourish in the world sarah because humans are weak we choose evil levon but why does god let us choose it why have evil at all sarah well to test us because of free will levon but if god made us sarah why must he test us if god is allknowing he must know ahead of time that we are fallible so the test is meaningless isnt it sarah youre confusing me not everyone chooses evil some choose good levon of course we all choose good some of the time but we choose evil sometimes as well havent you done things you were ashamed of sarah i dont like this conversation levon im sorry im a nosey parker arent i what about this if you were creating god what would he look like sarah well fatherly i guess strong strong but fair just levon why not motherly was your mother not just sarah sarah of course she was levon but she wasnt strong sarah she was strong in her way but levon but what sarah not strong like a father not strong enough to protect me levon protect you from what from your father perhaps sarah what are you trying to do levon i didnt mean to offend you sarah but sometimes i sense things pain i sense pain now in you i sense something dark hurtful no one likes to think about those spiritual cubbyholes but we all have them i would make god very different than you would sarah i would make god a woman a mother a strong mother strong enough to make up for the weakness of fathers strong enough to defy fathers there are women like that in the world sarah was your mother like that levon no my mother was like a silk veil in a strong wind it is him lenz whispers his eyes glued to his monitor i remember something like that from your transcripts jesus stay cool doctor weve got to trace him baxters guys are taking care of that im a hell of a lot more concerned about this woman hes talking to hes still got a zero error rate lenz says hes not close to her youd better fucking hope not quiet cole were missing it suddenly a frightening thought hits me i tap out a system search on the toshiba and my fears are confirmed brahma isnt using the strobekker account i grab lenzs arm baxters techs cant trace this connection its not strobekkers account they dont know what to look for call eros right now and give them the new alias and the name of the room lenz hits a speeddial button on the nearest phone i read as fast as i can to catch up with the text that appeared while we were talking levon my name is not levon sarah sarah i know that levon would you like to know my real name sarah i dont know you frighten me a little i like talking to you but you see too much im afraid you want too much levon too much what sarah honesty levon how can one want too much honesty sarah sarah you know what i mean its not human nature we need little white lies to get along with each other levon and to get along with ourselves sarah is that so terrible levon doesnt god demand total honesty sarah sarah thats different levon how sarah god is god he accepts us no matter what he forgives us levon i would accept you no matter what sarah thats easy to say but you dont know you dont really know me levon i dont need to nothing you could possibly say or do would offend me sarah are you so sure levon yes sarah but acceptance isnt the same as forgiveness you can accept someone but still be disappointed in them you can live with them but never forgive them levon not me sarah im not like that sarah how do you mean levon in my eyes you could never do anything that required forgiveness sarah what do you mean levon i mean whatever you could possibly think of doing and then have will enough to carry through that would be your nature i would never wish you to go against your nature sarah but thats crazy thats like saying everything is okay what if i were a mass murderer or a rapist levon i would accept you sarah but what if i were a child molester levon i would fold you into my arms sarah its not my duty to judge you if that is your inclination so be it it is someone elses biological imperative to stop you from molesting children that duty belongs to the parent and if a parent were to kill you for doing that i would accept his or her behavior as well sarah but what if i was the parent the parent and the molester that happens you know levon alas it is the rule but then it is the imperative of the other parent to stop it sarah but what if the other parent cant stop it what if shes too weak what if shes afraid levon your tears are scalding my heart if someone is too weak they either enlist help or they fail sarah help no one can help in situations like that the police dont do anything levon who said anything about police one should always look first inside oneself that is where help lies sarah but what can a woman do in that situation a weak woman a woman whos afraid of guns levon pour strong whiskey on the fathers face and torso while he is sleeping then set him afire with a cigarette sarah my god did you just think of that levon yes but im sure its been done many times there are other ways so much misery builds up in the world because people are afraid to act they would rather endure that is the nature of homo sapiens to endure unmitigated hell and hope that if we sit through enough of it things will change for the better but they never do look at the russian peasants the jews in germany the armenians one must be willing to risk everything at every moment for survival and the more you have to lose the more willing you must be to fight at a moments notice if a man accosts you on the street push him away if he curses you knock him down if he is stronger than you and attacks you shoot him sarah are you really like that levon i do not tolerate impudence my father taught me that sarah are you very rich levon yes sarah that explains it levon no i am rich because i have never taken abuse from anyone sarah i dont know levon you think god takes shit from anyone sarah sarah thats sacrilegious levon is it isnt that what the old testament is really about isnt that what the book of job says i am god and i dont take shit from anybody i dont even take questions sarah thats awful levon but true yes god in the bible is sort of like don corleone isnt he he makes people offers they cant refuse and minor bosses like pharaoh have faith in their own power and they wake up with a horse head in their bed or locusts its all the same sarah i cant believe youre writing this arent you afraid levon of what a lightning bolt now that i think of it god isnt really like don corleone hes more like a film director we think were his actors we think hes in charge of us that he has a plan that he wants good things for us that he is slowly working toward some divinely inspired vision that we actors are too dimwitted to see we think thats why we exist but that isnt it at all sarah we exist because god wants an audience whats the point of being the alpha and the omega the beall and endall if theres no one around to applaud no one to cower in fear or kneel in supplication once in a while god shouts like bob barker sarah come on down and we think we matter for a while but god is the only actor sarah that is the secret we are the audience this guys scary i say under my breath shut up cole this is a forensic gold mine was miles at eros when you called that was him on the phone i feel a sudden release of tension an inexplicable gladness that miles cannot possibly be the man behind levon already the prompt looks different to me sarah i think that kind of talk levon what dont be afraid to speak sarah its what the devil would say to confuse me levon you think im lucifer sarah sarah maybe you are levon im flattered did you know that lucifer is latin for lightbringer something to think about sarah are you trying to scare me levon it would probably frighten you more if i told you i know your real name and address hes never done that i tell lenz hes never told anyone that shut up cole sarah this isnt right levon calm down sarah i was only joking sarah i dont like it im frightened how do i know you dont know my name levon everyones protected on eros sarah thats what we pay all the money for i just wanted you to feel my strength to know i mean it when i say i do not take abuse from anyone and i think you need someone like me someone who could take care of you protect you sarah you make me sound so weak levon we all have needs sarah sarah what do you need levon love sarah what kind of love levon unselfish love the love that a good mother gives her child could you love someone like that sarah i think i could i have a lot of love to give levon i sense that sarah sarah im not beautiful levon i want to tell you that now because i couldnt bear to go further and have you building up all kinds of expectations i couldnt fulfill i mean im not fat or anything im about fiveseven a hundred and twentyfive pounds levon you dont have to tell me this sarah sarah i want to i have to im fortysix years old my hair is brown a little mousy maybe but i have really good skin levon youre a healthy girl arent you sarah i take care of myself if thats what you mean all im trying to say is that i dont look like cindy crawford or anything but im not unattractive i mean i get asked out at work and everything levon do you accept sarah not often im sort of skittish about dating i got hurt by someone a while back and i dont think im completely over it levon someone at work a superior sarah how did you know levon a married man sarah yes though it still hurts to admit it i feel so guilty about his wife and children he said he loved me but he just wanted levon to use you sarah yes i felt so dirty sometimes it seems my whole life has been like that i try to have faith in men but it just never works out levon you are unstained sarah you cannot be dirtied by such men sarah it makes me feel nice when you say that levon it is but the truth sarah i dont want you to get the idea that i have something against sex or anything i mean from what i said about my skittishness i mean i feel strange writing this but i do get stared at a lot i mean because of well men stare at my chest im fairly well endowed in the bosom department not that theyre huge or anything but i never had kids you know and so theyre still well firm and high im not conceited about it i dont even like them sometimes its like people dont see me because of them you know it alienates female friends too but i mean for the right man if he liked that and all it might be nice for both of us would you like that levon the needs of the body are secondary to me sarah sarah oh you mean like sex isnt that big a deal to you levon on the contrary sex is of primary importance sarah im not sure i understand levon i speak of a passion you have yet to experience spiritual refined prolonged sexual union a melding of heart and mind and flesh a marriage of the sacred and the profane sarah wow that sounds i dont know poetical or something levon but my time has ended for tonight sarah i must go now sarah oh will you be back tomorrow levon perhaps i am never far away remember you are far stronger than you believe yourself to be you need no one sarah i think i need you i mean it can you tell me some more about this spiritual sex i mean like describe it levon i must go now sarah when you most need me i will be there sarah ill be waiting levon i know you will goodbye sarah bye and thank you you see that i ask christ one session and hes got this woman ready to do anything he wants he simply played to her needs says lenz as i intend to play to his a little mysticism a little danger a little sex fortysix years old and simpering like a schoolgirl she was practically begging for a chance to tell him where to get her lenz taps his fingers on the desk and exhales heavily thats common with serial killers many times the victim acquiesces to a situation that puts her in harms way often when shes in an environment where she feels no immediate danger such as this one she makes a critical mistake the last one shell ever make its like shes on standby for murder no question about it what are you going to do calm down cole hes not close to her yet ill call turner back and get sarahs real identity then baxter can have the local police department wherever she lives do a driveby at her residence use some pretense to verify that shes okay you really think thats enough lenz punches the speed dial code for eros within four hours well have fbi surveillance on her around the clock if shes in a major city less than one hour daniels already got the budget approved youre relying on the zero error rate to tell you he isnt close to her but what if hes changed his methods he already changed his victim profile you said what if hes changed his hunting method too shit weve got to shut down the network calm down cole you sound like a rookie cop okay okay im just trying to cover every angle lenz speaks to miles in measured tones even hearing only one side of the conversation i can tell the phone trace went nowhere glancing over to make sure lenz isnt watching i send a copy of the entire levonsarah thread to my personal mailbox in eross server sarahs legal name is phoebe tyler announces lenz stabbing another speeddial code she is indeed fortysix years old and a resident of aurora illinois the chicago field office can have a team at her house in thirtyfive minutes theyll use a ruse to ensure that shes okay then organize aroundtheclock surveillance daniel arthur here i am eyeing one of the cold pizza slices when lenz shouts what as i look up he snaps do it and hangs up what is it strobekker again suddenly the pizza i ate two hours ago burns upward toward the center of my chest he hasnt killed phoebe tyler he couldnt have lenz stands up and leans over the fax machine with his hands on the table no he sent daniel another message i close my eyes in relief when thirty seconds after the conversation between levon and sarah ended man does this guy have our number what did the message say daniels faxing it to us now this is clearly a reaction to the bureaus attempts to trace his phone connection yes got to be could strobekker have known we were watching his levonsarah exchange i dont think so i mean if he were in the system as a sysop or had root access miles would know about it but that doesnt mean its impossible a lot of people know a hell of a lot more about computers than i do the fax machine rings lenz picks up the receiver and hits the sendreceive key daniel is considering arresting turner he says without looking up what his eyes stay on the fax machine theres a great deal of pressure from the police departments involved to arrest you both goddamn it im sick of this intimidation dont worry no ones going to arrest you but arresting turner might keep the local gendarmes at bay for a while multijurisdictional investigations are always difficult and this one is worse than most i read the new message as it curls out of the fax machine you have not stopped hunting us i asked nicely if you do not cease i shall be forced to enter your game and at your level i do not think you will like the result remember dallas now the threat says lenz if hes so confident well never find him i ask why is he worried about us hunting him good point notice the pronoun change the i creeps in now note the proper use of shall and no contractions i think this man has considerable education my eyes glance over the fax paper all but unseeing you know what i think i think that whole levonsarah thread was bait mmmm lenz murmurs meaning meaning the whole thing was done just to see whether wed be able to localize him to a chat room or isolate a phone line at eros et cetera to see how far we could get and we did localize him to a room it was luck but he doesnt know that lenz points out no but i dont think you realize what his use of a new alias means either he has gained sysop privileges or he has access to at least oneand possibly hundredsof other legitimate accounts wouldnt a legitimate client quickly complain about an unauthorized person using his or her account no thats the beauty of eros for strobekker i mean were expensive but we charge a flat fee someone who knows my user name and password could log on for hours as me without me being the wiser or even giving a damn if i was you mean i mean if strobekker knows the names and passwords of legitimate account holdersif he really has a copy of the master client list and the clients passwordsyou may never be able to trace him because the only way well know what to trace is by searching room to room for his goddamn prose style you saw how long it took us tonight and we were lucky lenz grunts and turns away from me he stands in silence like a man in defeat but then i see a tensing of his posture what is it i ask softly his right arm rises and points to the dells softly glowing monitor levons back in a lobby the psychiatrist drops into his chair and pulls up to the dell how do i approach him dont just watch him you said yourself wed be lucky to find him and i dont believe in luck lenz clicks his mouse and types something into the dell dont bite doctor hes in control right now i dont see any advantage until we can turn the tables its no use lenzunder the alias lilithhas already invited levon to join him in a private room my fingers tremble as i wait for brahmas response the words appear in a flash without a single error levon i dont believe weve met before got him lenz cries his fingers flying across the keyboard lilith i just joined the network im trying to get a feel for whats out here in cyberspace so far i must confess im a bit disappointed levon how so lilith most of the talk is conventional even the racy stuff is fairly pedestrian i was hoping for more sophisticated fare levon you have to know where to look im intrigued by your name lilith do you know its origin lilith do you levon rest assured that i do lenz pauses then types lilith consider it a test levon ive always tested very well lilith lilith amaze me levon lilith is a hebrew word for demon of the night it was mistranslated in the book of isaiah as screech owl which is probably where your parents picked up the name lilith derives from the babylonian lilitu which itself derives from the semitic word for night later rabbis took this night demon and from her created lilitha beautiful woman who became adams wife before eve was created perhaps your father was learned in the rabbinical tradition lenzs stunned expression tells me brahmas information is dead on im still in shock when lenzs shaking fingers type lilith i am amazed i now consider this months eros fee well spent levon you didnt answer the question about your father lilith i value my privacy levon a sentiment i share good luck tonight and all other nights i must away lilith but we only just met stop i hiss at lenz type bye but hes right here before lenz can type another word i shove his chair away from the dell and type lilith until we meet again youre absolutely right lenz says in a quavering voice i lost control for a moment i felt my fingers on his sleeve you caught buck fever is what you did suddenly lenz is grinning like a hyena by god it was exhilarating wasnt it i think i finally understand the expression thrill of the hunt dont mistake what youre doing with hunting doctor what am i doing then trapping whats the difference if you dont know that youll never get this guy lenz looks at me like i just kicked his dog explain yourself well in hunting the first thing you do is go into the quarrys environment im doing that no youre not not really because the digital environment is an illusion its a virtual world in every sense you cant reach through that screen and touch him remember somewhere out there this killer actually existsin the corporeal world thats where he lives not in this box keep going when you hunt you follow an animals tracks im not doing that no thats what baxters technicians are trying to do and so far theyre failing you personally dont have even the beginnings of the skill required to track strobekkers digital footprints and if he really knows what hes doing there wont be any footprints so what are you saying didnt you ever visit the country when you were a kid shoot sparrows with a bb gun or anything no jesus look hunting is an aggressive activity basically you take yourself to the quarrys territory conceal yourself wait a while or maybe have dogs or beaters drive the game to you and when your quarry happens up within range of your gun or your bow you pop him whamhes dead trapping is completely different its all preparation its all about bait using the right bait placing it in your quarrys path and waiting whats your point lilith is the bait i know that and what is the job of the bait doctor the job of the bait to lure the quarry of course fundamentallywhat is the baits job lenz sighs in exasperation i guess i dont know to be what it is thats all doctor to sit there and do nothing but be what it is you get it bait doesnt walk out to the quarry and say come and get me if its raw meat it just sits there and looks dead and appetizing if its a rabbit tied to a stake it goes berserk for a while then freezes in terror if this situation is more complex than that no its exactly the same everything must happen in the quarrys head your unsub is biologically programmed to want to kill the bait your jobyour only jobis to be what the killer wants forget about baxter and his geeks forget about trying to manipulate the killer into doing anything he knows what to do you just sit here and be that woman talk to other users not him build your personality and then hell come in his own time maybe but hell come and youd better be ready lenz stands up from the chair and stretches with nonchalance so elaborate that it must be feigned he tears off the stream of paper where it meets the printer and lets it fall to the floor im sure youre ready to get back home cole if we hurry youll just have time to make the quantico plane unless you want to spend the night at a hotel and fly commercial in the morning he frowns at me like a flight attendant whos decided he made a mistake by inviting me to sit in the firstclass cabin which is it cole a hotel or ms krislovs jet part of me hates to walk out of this room to withdraw from a game with stakes so high even at the most rarefied level trading futures risks only money not human lives the plane i say standing up from the toshiba and walking past him without another look he follows me down the stairs near the bottom i ask why did you decide to use a young decoy i thought youd decided that strobekker changed his pattern that he wanted older women like karin wheat thats correct i pause at the floor but margie resslers only what twentyeight you should have more faith in me cole as we move across the den toward the kitchen i look over the corian counter and see a full head of brunette hair sherry i presume shes looking at something through the top window of an electric range pretty soft setup i say to lenz cook and everything then the cook turns around and i am looking into the green eyes of special agent margie ressler her eyes are all i recognize in the past two hours she has aged twenty years lines around her eyes and mouth gray in her hair a suddenly sagging bosom and dowdy hips it really works doesnt it she says her eyes sparkling i can tell by your face sherrys a wizard at this stuff she told me some of the actors shes worked on and now i believe her say farewell to mr cole agent ressler lenz says oh hey i really enjoyed meeting you you too margie thanks for the pizza be careful no sweat i warmed up some pizza for you doctor lenz takes my arm and leads me out to the garage the acura margie mentioned earlier has appeared special agent schmidt the ever chipper factotum steps silently from the door behind us i turn back as he walks past me and climbs into lenzs mercedes im going to say it one more time doctor dont push this guy if you spook him youll never get him or worsehe might get you i heard you the first time cole he leads me around to the passenger door and opens it the quantico airstrip schmidt you might have to put some lead in your foot i climb into the car lean back in the seat and address lenz through the window i dont think agent ressler understands how much danger shes in he smiles your southern sexism is creeping in ressler is a trained agent how do you train for something like this the psychiatrist straightens up and walks away he is edging through the narrow margin between the mercedes hood and the front wall when a thought hits me i reach over and beep the horn startling him into the air like a cartoon character what is it he shouts i lean out of the passenger window remember the smiling young lady from niger doctor he stares at me as if im insane she went for a ride on a tiger after the ride she wound up inside with the smile on the face of the tiger i tap special agent schmidt on the arm and he obediently backs the mercedes out of the garage leaving dr lenz staring at us from the bluewhite glare of the headlights he does not squint into the beams as most people would but simply watches us pull away the halogen light on his retinas giving him the burning red eyes of a night creature chapter the jet i boarded at quantico touched down in jackson mississippi at a m central standard time jan krislov would have broken into a nervous sweat had she seen her precious gulfstream filled to its porthole windows with angry fbi hostage rescue commandos i sweated a little myself three hours cooped up with those guys was like riding a bus full of southern baptist ministers on their way to picket a bourbon street strip club most were trying so hard to be professional that their grim frowns seemed on the verge of splitting into fierce grins of anticipation i still dont know whether anyone had told them of my status as a suspect but i didnt volunteer the information two agents watched me throughout the flight their hostile eyes tracking me like those of snipers which is exactly what they were i was never told their destination but by the time the pilot set me down i was damned glad it wasnt my farmhouse two minutes after the jet taxied to a stop i was standing at a pay phone calling miles at eros headquarters to warn him that he might soon be arrested i feared that he might have been taken while i was airborne but nighthawk milesawakened from a cat nap at his monitorfinally picked up the phone and began joking as if nothing more were happening than the usual bitflow of nocturnal erotica he didnt sound surprised by my warning but he did thank me for it he thinks hes safe until eross timelocked file vault opens at one pm tomorrow daniel baxter apparently believes that brahma might be a legitimate eros client if thats true the master client list now locked in the vault would allow the fbi to put brute force methods into the hunt making the resolution of the case only a matter of time and manpower miles told me at least two agents have been guarding the vault since it slammed shut two days ago but he seems to think theyre in for a big surprise after we hung up i tried again to warn eleanor rigby but all i got was her answering machine knowing that her clingy paraplegic sister is the reason she keeps a blinddraft account i felt i couldnt leave a detailed message without screwing up her personal life i resigned myself to warning her by snail mail and jogged for my truck all that happened an hour ago but i am still twenty minutes from home driving a steady sixtyfive miles per hour it feels better than good to be rolling through the dark delta cotton fields with at least the illusion that i am free from the clutches of arthur lenz and daniel baxter though its dead hot outside i roll down the explorers windows and let the air whip through the truck fourthirty in the morning is about as cool as it ever gets in august in mississippi the windshield fogs from the sudden temperature change but the road is straight as a plumb line here and i dont even wipe the glass there is enough moonlight to turn the cotton into a pale purple sea stretching away from the highway in all directions im glad i wont be picking that cotton glad no one will be except a handful of people on the poorest farms twelve hours in the burning sun with bleeding hands and a hundred pounds of itchy sack dragging behind you isnt fit work for man or beast in the cotton field if nowhere else the machine has fulfilled its nineteenthcentury billing as the savior of mankind at last my headlights illuminate the battered green road sign that announces rain ms home of the state basketball champions to an indifferent world dinged by flung beer bottles pierced by bullets fired in boredom drunkenness or anger rusted by the heavensent water the town was named for the old doublesided sign still stirs a strange soup of emotions in my chest when i roar past it in either direction it takes less than a minute to sight the first hints of human habitation blow past the tiny post office and tinier laundromat and sweep back into the long still fields on the other side of rain somewhere out there children are sleeping but the men and women are not they are waking to fry eggs and boil grits and pull on overalls and boots to face the hottest sun in the united states with no more protection than a faded john deere cap i look out to my left and try to sight the crumbling superstructure of the old edinburgh plantation at one time this antebellum monolith dominated the land like a feudal castle all activity for miles around was subordinate to its workings its long shadow falling across slave and master mammy and overseer then sharecropper and bossman and finally the notsoslow decay of the gene line in a burning dry year in the sa year not unlike this onea sober gambler won the entire plantation from a dissolute heir in a midnight poker game the way the storys most often told the gambler raised the stakes beyond the heirs liquid resources the heir used the plantation deed to call the bet and signed a marker in front of a dozen witnesses when the gambler laid down a flush the heir fainted by the time he staggered out of the old slave quarters the divine deliverance of rain was beating dust devils on the drive and the tin roof roared as though a hail of yankee grapeshot had been loosed against the building the heir went home tried twice to shoot himself in the head missed both times and passed out he woke up in time to see the gambler nail a board sign to a horse post out front painted on the sign was the word rain which from that day forward became the new name of the plantation and of the indolent crossroads of commerce that passed for a town my tin mailbox glints at the left margin of my high beams which suddenly fluoresce the legend cole i slow the explorer and sigh in exhaustion knowing i could probably cover the last fifty yards and make the turn with my eyes shut the farmhouse stands about forty yards back from the road shaded by oaks pines and a single weeping willow that hovers near the porch like a giant green mushroom just as i start to turn my headlights flash on something farther up the road something that shouldnt be there its on the left shoulder where there should be only cotton i start to ignore it but the landowners imperative steels my nerves i brake back out of the drive and accelerate slowly toward the silver reflection its a sport utility vehicle a jeep grand cherokee i recognize the distinctive slope of the hood its parked about sixty yards from the house as i move closer i realize something that chills me more deeply than the idea of poachers the jeep has a hinds county license plate on its front bumper that plate and the jeep belong to my brotherinlaw patrick graham without hesitation i reach under the seat take out my smith and wesson and lay it on my lap this act would have been unthinkable three months ago but i know enough about human nature to know that in a domestic dispute anyone can become a target of deranged fury i pull the explorer across the left lane and stop alongside patricks jeep our faces are less than three feet apart separated only by two sheets of glass patrick is handsome in the fraternity president mold short sandy hair parted on the side scrubbed skin great teeth hes one of the few doctors i know who always wears a suit to make evening rounds at the hospital even when he dresses casually his clothes are either ralph lauren or something sent ups from new england but tonight he looks like a ghost of himself he is wearing a polo shirt but it looks like he pulled it out of a dirty clothes hamper his hair is longer than usual and his eyes dont seem able to focus he faces forward when i roll down my window studiously ignoring me i tap on the glass at last he rolls down his window whats going on i ask in the calmest voice i can muster patrick says nothing i tighten my hand around the wooden grip of the you waiting for somebody erins in there where my house he nods i say nothing hoping hell volunteer information but he doesnt holly too he nods again this is like talking to gary cooper i guess things arent going so good huh he keeps staring at the dashboard whats the deal pat i married a slut thats what i blink in disbelief hearing these words from patrick is tantamount to hearing a priest shout god is dead from the pulpit that doesnt sound like you did something happen you think shes sleeping around or something hes nodding steadily now his eyes full of sullen anger shes making a goddamn fool of me she has been from the start what do you mean dont worry about it its between her and me i am worried about it does she know youre out here he shrugs i consider asking him to come into the house and sleep in my office but i have no idea whats transpired in the past few hours well is there anything you want me to tell erin suddenly he turns and his eyes lock onto mine where the fuck have you been all night trying to keep the fbi off my ass this eros thing is out of control theres a guy killing people out there cutting womens heads off blowing up fbi agents you believe that shit he just stares as i sit clenching the a thought rises unbidden you know anything about the pineal gland the pineal gland it has something to do with these murders patrick straightens in his seat its a pretty uncommon tumor site not long ago pineal tumors were real problems because they were often inaccessible to neurosurgeons but with the new microsurgical techniques thats changed completely typical patrick his personal life is going to hell but one medical question puts him into androidmd mode theres a craze right now over one of the hormones it makes he adds melatonin crackpots all over the country are taking it for a dozen different reasons but it hasnt been approved by the fda what do you think about it homeopathic bullshit thats what i figured you sure youre okay out here he faces forward again and nods i start to pull away then stop if patrick is going to blow a gasket id rather he do it out here while im holding a pistol than after im asleep inside listen youre not going to do anything stupid are you i mean erin loves you i know she does youre the best thing that ever happened to her his laugh is hollow and cold im just making sure of something dont worry im good at repressing anger go inside okay take it easy after staring into his eyes a moment longer i execute a threepoint turn and idle back down to the house i park in the gravel turnaround and get out with my briefcase and my gun im on the second step when i spy the rear end of erins toyota land cruiser jutting from behind the right side of the house my watch reads five am drewe and erin are almost certainly asleep i slip through the front door and turn left into my office without turning on any lights as i undress i realize that erin and holly are probably sleeping in the guest room on the other side of my office wall a hundred thoughts and images flood my brain but i am too tired to analyze them i slide the under my mattress then fall facedown onto my pillow and inhale the welcome scent of home but sleep eludes me why is erin in our house what is fraying the bonds of her marriage not the normal frustration that accretes like rust and eats at every relationship if it were patrick would not be parked outside so what remains other than our secret a faint creak causes me to turn over in bed and open my eyes i sometimes hear this sound when the air conditioner kicks on but i dont hear the compressor running then i realize my door is standing open and silhouetted in it is a female form too slender and dark to belong to my wife the whitegowned apparition glides across my floor and stops beside my bed erin without hesitation my wifes sister sits beside me on the twin bed and looks down into my eyes this is the ruthless directness of woman to observe no artificial boundaries to behave as though no time has passed between our coupling three years ago in chicago and now i am supremely conscious of my wife who lies sleeping less than thirty feet away yet erin seems oblivious she scrunches her left flank into my side making more room for herself her face slowly coalesces in the darkness oval planes of sculpted bone and tanned skin eyes a shade darker than her long fine hair she smells just as she always did irresistibly feminine then i see tears glinting in the dark she lowers her head into her hands stifling a sob i want to wrap my arms around her and comfort her but i do not trust myself after three years of selfinflicted guilt i should feel no impulse to anything crazy but the drive that pushed me into erins arms the first time had nothing to do with reason and it remains true to itself what i ask softly what is it everythings coming apart she says much too loudly what do you mean it was a mistake harper it was all a mistake you mean you and me keeping holly what no answer have you left patrick she doesnt speak i take her hand away from her eyes ive tried she whispers to be a good wife a good mother to leave everything i was behind i squeeze her wrist and force her to look into my eyes thats the problem erin you cant leave your past behind thats oprah bullshit ive tried it you have to come to terms with whatever you did and then move forward her eyes widen boring into my soul like youve come to terms with it youre living the same lie i am i look away i know look does patrick know anything specific she covers her eyes and sobs again erin ive got to tell you hes outside patrick hes sitting out there in his jeep her hand grips my wrist like a claw nowhes out there i nod he looks pretty bad too oh god oh god i raise myself enough to put my arms around her and pull her shuddering body to mine her arms close around my back as her wet face burrows into my neck i have a sensation very like falling but falling through time rather than space and even as i hold her i feel her kick her way under the covers and mold herself to me fear and guilt and arousal surge through me in a flood erin i whisper erin shhh she says her weight pressing down on me against me the heat of her long legs electrifying my skin i just want it all to go away make him go away erin i hate it i take a deep breath and try to stay calm i havent held her like this since chicago not even hugs at family dinners now only hours after i tried in vain to describe her unique sensuality to lenz the elusive has become all too tangible erin is crying softly her face still buried in the hollow of my neck with a shaking hand i stroke the silky hair above her ear as i would a childs its going to be okay i murmur even as a taut wire of fear sets to thrumming in my chest she sobs her breast heaving with irregular breaths its already hot enough under the covers that im sweating im about to try to pull back the bedspread when she lifts her head and looks down into my eyes im not going back she whispers her mouth inches from mine i cant erin you she puts a finger to my lips and shakes her head i feel her other hand slip into the hair at the back of my neck mama i freeze mama its holly shes awakened alone in a strange bed erin jerks upright her head alert and rigid like that of a doe sensing danger maaammaa erin slides off the bed with fluid swiftness her sheer white nightgown flashing across the room she stops at the door hovering like a veil then shes moving back toward me quickly but seemingly uncertain of direction a bright scythe of light slices across my floor the hall light drewe daaadeeeholly wails daddy i grope under the mattress for my while erin stops in the middle of the floor obviously torn between protecting her child and being caught in the dark with her sisters husband has patrick broken into the house or is holly calling for him out of habit i hear footsteps in the hall as i stand with the pistol erin vanishes through the door seconds later holly stops crying i press my ear to the wall and hear drewe say everythings okay punkin mama must be in the bathroom then hollys higher voice crusted with sleep mama went to tee tee aunt drewe as though in answer the commode flushes down the hall i hear a quick beat of footsteps then erins voice through the wall im sorry she woke you up i had to pee i didnt think shed wake up i guess its the strange house i didnt see the bathroom light drewe replies ever logical i thought something was wrong a pause im used to finding strange bathrooms in the dark a longer pause then that makes me sad erin the shell of my ear aches from the pressure of the wall but im not about to miss this exchange after a long silence drewe says are you okay is this all going to work out i hope so lets dont talk about it anymore talk about what holly asks in a bleary voice work stuff honey tell me a story mama were going back to sleep punkin i want a story lie down drewe says ill tell you a story and she makes one up on the spot it is a tale of a king with two daughters both beautiful and smart but each of whom believes she lacks one of the two qualities we all listen spellbound recognizing the allegory of drewe and erin as they struggle through myriad trials all of us knowing drewe will ultimately weave the threads into one of the happy endings she so fervently believes in and all of us glad for it this is my wifes transcendent gift her optimism and in the predawn shadows it is proof against despair as she speaks her voice like a lantern in the dark i realize that drewe is a living archetype of maternal love erin and i struggle in states of arrested growth uncertain of our natures or fighting acceptance of them but drewe radiates heat and nurturing love like a warm spring flowing through bedrock even without a natural object for her affections i am the only obstacle to the fulfillment of her dreams and at the deepest level i know that if i have a duty to anything in this world it is to bring those dreams to fruition after the two princesses have laid their parents to rest and agreed to jointly rule the queendoma concept of which hans christian andersen was apparently ignorantdrewe says nightnight to holly i expect her to go back to the master bedroom but instead she appears at my door a flannelclad silhouette against the hall light you back she asks softly yeah just got here everythings okay for you and me anyway but not erin patricks outside what hes parked on the road i dont think hell do anything crazy but wake me up if you hear anything weird this has got to stop drewe says with conviction i dont think i can get back to sleep now you want to come in and give me the playbyplay on your trip im going to make coffee i have no intention of letting my wife peer into my eyes after the events of the last ten minutes im pretty wiped out i tell her i should probably get some sleep she remains at the door ill throw together some lunch for you she says finally im going to try to talk erin into going home this morning thanks good luck you forgot to close your blinds im so tired it doesnt matter night she says then she reaches across the invisible border between our lives and pulls the door shut after her lying motionless in the pale dawn i am overcome by a terrible certainty that barring divine intervention we are all moving toward an explosive revelation of the true and tragic state of affairs and i am not one to look for divine intervention at least of the positive sort retribution is the only cosmic principle i have ever found the capacity to believe in i sleep with the gun under my pillow chapter i slept ten hours last night when i blinked myself awake at threethirty this afternoon i felt like i was stepping out of a recompression chamber after a mild case of the bends finding the house empty i walked out to the roadostensibly to check our mail boxand verified that patricks jeep had disappeared as well i can hardly believe its been only four days since i saw the cnn report of karin wheats death only three days since i faced the police in new orleans and detective mayeux ushered me into the fastforward world of the fbi and its investigative support unit karins body must be in the ground by now god only knows where her head is her burial was probably a circus with hundreds of gawkers dressed like kids for halloween what a grotesque irony karin long believed inor at least wished forphysical immortality and now she lies sans head in a concrete vault in one of the old french cemeteries that lent gothic atmosphere to her dark novels and in some other placeperhaps just as dark and lonelya woman named rosalind may is lying or standing or sitting tied in a chair and the most any of us can do is pray there is breath in her lungs the mill creek michigan police have probably turned their city upside down rousting every homeless drunk and sexual offender within their jurisdiction and coming up with zero i remember baxter telling me may had two grown sons my mind conjures images of them trying to convince themselves that their mother eloped with a secret loveror even that she was kidnapped by some moneyhungry sleazoidbecause to accept anything else is to accept that she is beyond mortal succor the dazed feeling of decompression sickness will not leave me last night driving home from the jackson airport i felt a brief euphoria at successfully extricating myself from the clutches of the fbi but have i really four days ago i disengaged from my normal life with a single phone call and i have yet to reengage its not for lack of trying earlier todayas soon as i saw that patrick was gonei sat down at my gateway to check the status of my futures positions the layer of dust that had accumulated on the keyboard in my absence told me the news would not be good and it wasnt i was several thousand dollars down and the trend was moving against me lenzs suggestion about dumping my contracts looked much better from hindsight my first thought was ill catch back up i always do yet the old conviction wasnt there after a few fruitless minutes of shuffling my options i stood up stripped off my clothes and got into the shower thinking about trading was useless the events of the past days had locked my mind onto a single track the mathematics of the situation are simple one man and seven women are dead one man killed them all rosalind may is missing probably dead the same man kidnapped her the single known element common to all the crimes is eros which i know better than anyone on earth save miles turner in some waysin the human dimensioni may know it better than miles but at that point i stop thinking because to go further is to admit things i do not want to admit returning from the kitchen with a chicken salad sandwich i notice the message light blinking on my answering machine nine messages i must have slept like the dead not to hear the phone ringing all day taking a bite of my sandwich i stare at the digital readout debating whether to play back the tape or just erase the damned thing intuition is a strange thing the red led light is inanimate yet it speaks to me with the urgency of the voices captured as magnetic particles inside that machine i want to ignore it but i cant somewhere in the fluid circuits of my brain a certainty has formed most of those voices will say little i wish to hear but at least one will profoundly change my life or at least my perception of it ill wait as long as i can to play them back suddenly like god laughing at me the machine clicks and the changes into a red horizontal line after a moments hesitation i turn up the volume to hear the caller pick up the goddamn phone cole arthur lenz by now his voice rates up there with the shriek of my college alarm clock your friend turner has flown the coop so youre next on the chopping block youd better listen to what i have to say im here i say picking up this isnt ed mcmahon my friend what did you say about miles hes gone awol slipped his leash what do you mean he walked out of eros headquarters and never came back when about two hours ago how do you know hes not coming back trust me hes history good i think baxter must have had people following him how did he get away thats immaterial it is i thought baxter was going to arrest him you warned him didnt you cole i dont give lenz the satisfaction of hearing me deny it it doesnt matter a half hour ago turners name went out on a nationwide police alert hell be arrested the second hes sighted hes been classified armed and dangerous what you know miles isnt armed theres a ninemillimeter pistol registered in his name in new jersey did you know that goddamn it miles no but you know him doctor hes not dangerous i dont know anything today cole i tried to help you two and against the advice of seasoned police officers now youre just about on your own just about what does that mean it means you should listen closely here it comes im listening i think turner may run in your direction i laugh out loud if thats what you think youre never going to catch him hed go to jail before hed come back to mississippi to him its the same thing and he knows i believe that which is precisely why i think he might do it turners no fool im still listening the situation is fluid now youre going to notice some surveillance around your house what damn it you said you were taking care of the harassment theres only so much i can do daniel must be able to tell the police component of the investigation that hes watching you itll be local law enforcement great our felonious sheriff who cant legally carry a gun no your farm is on the line between cairo and yazoo counties so baxter chose yazoo still i have my doubts about local cops being able to handle turner if he did show up they wouldnt have much trouble spotting him miles would be the only guy within sixty miles wearing all black long hair and any jewelry besides a ring you know better than that cole i still think youre nuts if i were you id watch the airports in nonextradition islands like tenerife lenz hesitates how do you know about tenerife christ youre paranoid i read okay and so does miles does he have money youd know more about that than i would the psychiatrist is silent for several moments heres the deal cole if turner contacts youespecially if he shows up at your dooryou call me first then stall him until someone arrives to pick him up sorry youre asking too much as far as i know you have zero evidence that miles has committed any crime we have a warrant for his arrest on what charge obstruction of justice fine just dont expect me to do your work for you i think youre forgetting the leverage i hold over you lenz says his voice tight so much for patient confidentiality eh damn it cant you see whats at stake here your career rosalind mays life i think rosalind may is dead doctor so do you and you can bet your last buck that if you reveal anything i told you yesterday this entire chinese fire drill of an investigationi mean every pathetic detail starting with the fbis failure even to connect these murders and ending with the gloryhungry shrink and his hotpants alky wifewill be on a current affair by dinnertime tomorrow and if you think im kidding remember one thing miles and i are alike in one very important way when we say something we mean it another icy silence im not happy about this cole call somebody who gives a shit this wins me a brief silence let me ask you something doctor what happened today when the eros file vault opened i thought youd sound happier this afternoon what we found in that vault implicates turner in ways you wouldnt like to think about i have no snide response to this nor any further point to make goodbye doctor lenz and good luck i think youre going to need it i hang up slowly not wanting him to know he rattled me enough to want to smash the phone into pieces so much for normal life the fbi is throwing its weight around again and miles is on the run im surprised he hasnt bolted before now given his pathological mistrust of authority what bothers me is that he hasnt yet discovered how brahma stole our master client list or else hasnt told me that he has the latter is more likely miles is god of the eros universe and if a digital sparrow falls within its bounds he knows it suddenly my office feels about five sizes too small i grab whats left of the sandwich a cold tab and my keys and hit the front door at a trot the explorer roars at the pressure of my foot on the accelerator and fishtails up the gravel drive toward the blacktop two hundred yards to my right parked on the wrong shoulder at the first gentle curve in the road sits a boxy sedan with a gumball light on the roof i look left but see no car there only a turboprop crop duster buzzing over the power lines that border our leased cotton fields my neighbor finished his aerial defoliation several days ago but duster pilots have an affinity for flying on the deck so it may be a pilot in transit my adrenaline surging i gun the motor and drive straight toward the parked car as i draw near i make out the white silhouette of a yazoo county sheriffs department cruiser i keep the explorer at fiftyfive until im almost on top of the car then squeal to a stop beside the drivers window the face is a chubby blur behind the glass slowly the motorized window lowers into the door and a reddish young face with a wad of skoal tucked behind its lower lip smiles at me hey harp i know this guy i played football against him in high school strange place for a speed trap billy deputy billy smiles wider then spits in the nomans land between our vehicles gonna get hot out here before long i comment already hot grounds so goddamn dry its grateful if you take a piss on it i give him a courtesy laugh you know why youre out here billy he bites one side of his distended lower lip and looks down at my front tire waitin for turner to show up aint i you remember him from school billy shrugs saw him around never cared much for the sumbitch myself acted half queer this is about what i expected you really think hed come back cant ever tell folks do strange things on the run sometimes they get the homing instinct like a sick dog not miles he hated this place billy nods distractedly then fiddles with the laser speed gun mounted on his door panel let me ask you something billy straight okay he looks up a little suspiciously okay are you here just to watch for miles or are you supposed to keep tabs on me too he takes a while with this one his beardless chin working around the snuff cant really say sheriff aint talkin much somebody wants turners ass bad though you i dont know but theyre talkin bout you some talking to people who know you like you he smiles again i told em you was all right had a hell of a forearm on you back in seventyseven not enough to handle you though was it he grins wide at this look do you have orders to follow me or not billys answer is the eternally inscrutable smile of the southern law enforcement officer i guess theres only one way to find out i stomp the accelerator of the explorer and leave six feet of smoking rubber beside the door of his cruiser when the speedometer pegs seventy i look in my rearview mirror billys caprice is still sitting where it was hes probably still grinning like junior samples but at least hes not following me driving back from a long and pissedoff run through the cotton fields it occurs to me that deputy billyif he hasnt handed off his stakeout position and headed home for suppermight stop me and demand to look in the cargo area of my explorer he wouldnt have to open the vehicle to do this so i dont suppose hed need a warrant but if i took drewes acura out for a drive one night the only way anyone could be sure i didnt have miles stuffed in the trunk would be to stop me and check would that be legal would i resist its academic now of course but will it remain that way earlier this afternoon i shifted the explorer into fourwheel drive and fought my way across three hundred yards of grassedover tractor ruts that ended at a wide flat bump in the fields this was the indian mound where miles was bullied down into the fort with the rattlesnake i could still see a low pile of deadfall and undergrowth where the fort had been i got out and walked around the mound half looking for arrowheads and tried to remember what it felt like to be that young and have a friend i trusted like i trusted miles turner i couldnt quite do it im a different person now and miles is too were grown men yet somewhere inside he must carry the tough little boy i knew back then just as i carry my own and while he is running for his freedom in new york or tenerife or godknowswhere what that little boy sees in the fbi i am sure is another gang of stupid bullies who want to scare him or hurt him or worse and that makes me afraid of what he might do if they corner him as hard as the murders hit me my experiences with the fbi disturb me more even with their vast material resources they seem powerless to locate brahma using technical or conventional methods daniel baxter as much as admitted to me that they are waiting for the killer to make a mistake but after several months of observing brahma on eros i have no reason to think he will make one dr lenz seems to recognize this yet his response seems more than a little naive his reasoning is sound the surest way to stop a man who cannot be hunted down is to lure him from concealment but is lenz the man to do it could any man do it brahma is the most intuitive person i have ever seen on eros the odds that a man could trick him into believing he was talking to a woman for any length of time are probably nil worse lenz is a neophyte when it comes to eros he knows little about its social customs and nothing about its system architecture if anyone can trap brahma using eros its those who know the system best miles and me ive spent the better part of nine months exploring the digital world that is eros interacting with women lurking over supposedly private conversations learning secrets that caused magnitudinal shifts in my perception of human nature shepherding the evolution of a shadow community built on anonymity and desire miles has done this and more he built the system from the test bench up and there lies the problem miles is the digital sorcerer i am not even an apprentice and so far miles has resisted helping the fbi brahma has already proved himself adept with computers until the riddle of the stolen master client list is solved i have to assume that he may be as proficient asor more proficient thanmiles himself the idea that i could attempt to deceive brahma online without miless help is ludicrous it was this realization that finally brought me some peace on the indian mound dusk is falling as i take the gentle curve going toward our house billy has indeed changed shifts with another deputy just to be an ass i honk and wave as i pass the new guy he replies with a sullen stare braking for the driveway turn i see the low crosssection of drewes acura coming from the other direction like a cruise missile she blinks her headlights european style then cuts in front of my grille and into the drive by the time i roll in behind her she is standing on the porch holding her purse and a covered metal pot shes dressed in khakis tapered to the ankles and an embroidered white blouse silver loops dangle from her earlobes an unusual accessory for her where you been i call moms i trot to the steps hug her around the waist and kiss her cheek erin and holly there too i ask recalling erins vow that she would not return home no they left for jackson a half hour ago i hope erin doesnt get halfway home and then turn around i push open the door and follow drewe to the kitchen whats in the dish chicken and dumplings anna made them yes anna is the maid who raised drewe and erin from infancy even at seventyeight her cooking beats damn near any womans in the county ive been thinking about your case drewe says as she sets the pot on the stove my case the eros murders really what about them the pineal gland remember what about it she surveys me from head to toe why dont you jump in the shower while i heat this up ill tell you when you get out i look down at my clothes i took a shower earlier but my walk in the cotton fields soaked me with sweat i definitely need one i admit ill see you in a minute in my office bathroom i strip then switch on the special exhaust fan i installed to keep steam from escaping around the door mississippi humidity is bad enough for computers but with shower steam thrown in mine would be a lost cause i bang a switch on my waterproof ghetto blaster sending the razorclean guitar riffs of steely dans my old school bouncing around the cubicle with the water set as hot as i can stand it i let the spray scald my back as i sway in time to the horn parts the knowledge that erin has returned home lifts my spirit as much as anything could today except maybe brahma being caught ive almost succeeded in working myself into a good mood when i feel a cold draft of air around the shower curtain drewes voice rises above donald fagens youd better get out here harper her tone says trouble i pull back the curtain and see something i rarely see on her facealarm what is it weve got company cops just hurry i snatch a towel off the rack and shut off the boom box pulling on some jeans i get a quick premonition that our company is michael mayeux the new orleans police detective but when i peek around my window curtains i see no strange car outside geared up for anything i stalk barefoot down the hallway to the kitchen there is a stranger waiting for me hes tall and thin and clad in levis western shirt red wing work boots and an oilstained treflan cap pulled over a sidewall crewcut he stands with his back to me facing drewe who watches him warily from the hot stove two seconds is all i need to place him as one of our lease farmers probably coming to me with some preharvest catastrophe a mutilated worker or some other nightmare that will bring endless years of lawsuits here he is says drewe announcing my arrival when the guy turns around it takes me a minute to understand what i am seeing my skin heats with apprehension impossibly incredibly from beneath the bill of the treflan cap beam the brilliant blue eyes of miles turner like the haircut he asks you crazy son of a bitch his mouth breaks into a wide smile i glance at the window to make sure the curtains are drawn but drewe has already taken care of it how the hell did you get here he almost gave me a coronary drewe snaps miles makes an effort to look contrite the place is surrounded i had to use an unorthodox entry my puzzlement speaks for itself the bomb shelter drewe explains he came through the tunnel in the backyard this i cant believe you came through the old tunnel in the dark mice and roaches and god knows what down there no choice i moved fast you know how i feel about closed spaces with the initial shock wearing off drewes anger boils over my back was to the stove when he popped the latch on the trapdoor in the pantry i almost dumped hot chicken broth all over myself how did you get here so fast i ask still not believing my eyes wisely directing his attention to drewe miles points at our kitchen table and silently asks permission to sit she nods grudgingly he sits the way a man sits after ten hours plowing behind a mule after taking a moment to collect himself he says i rode the train to newark airport paid cash for a delta ticket to atlanta under a false name in atlanta i bought a ticket on a commuter flight to mobile under another name then i gave a mobile cabbie fifty bucks to take me to a juke joint where charter pilots hang out it took about thirty minutes to find a guy who would fly me up here cost me fifteen hundred bucks he thought i was running coke or something where did you land yazoo city hell no we found a grass strip about two miles north of here i saw you a turboprop plane looked like a new crop duster he nods and laughs you landed at the old thornhill place that strip is still good its not good but its usable i saw the sheriffs cars from the air theres one parked to the east of you another to the west out of sight from the strip i walked turnrows till i got within a half mile of your place then i went down on my hands and knees below the cotton im glad the bomb shelter wasnt locked they can see your front and back doors with field glasses i dont understand this says drewe whos after you the fbi put out a warrant for his arrest i explain but why a lot of reasons says miles all bullshit the warrant probably says obstruction of justice it does you both have some explaining to do drewe says lenz called today i tell miles he thought youd run here i told him he was crazy i didnt think youd ever come back it wasnt easy what happened when the vault opened at eros his malicious delight shines through his fatigue i told you they were guarding that vault like the tomb of christ didnt i yeah why do you think i chose that simile because the time lock was set for seventytwo hours youre half right what did they find after the stone was rolled away from jesus tomb nothing miles grins nada but you told me jan sealed the vault when the fbi showed up with the search warrant what did you think she rolled a twohundredpound file cabinet in on a dolly the files are on disk man portable hard drive updated daily and then dumped to the master drive wheres the master drive on the sun workstation that sits in the file vault son of a bitch she ran in there and plugged in the drive then locked the vault uhhuh and one hour later after agents moe larry and curly took up station at the vault door i downloaded every byte of information through the fiberoptic cables that run out of a discreet hole in the floor of the vault i exported them to a computer offsite then remotely wiped out everything on the sun just like brahma did in dallas i didnt blow it up but i definitely put that puppy into helen keller mode great minds think alike jesus dont say that whos brahma asks drewe the guy whos killing these women i answer thats what miles calls him the fbi calls him unsub for unknown subject she gives miles a look of distaste you name a serial killer after a god i guess hes your hero or something no but i do admire his skill you look wiped out i cut in stating the obvious in an attempt to head off useless squabbling miles rubs both hands through his new flattop and sighs im as tired as a pair of jumper cables at a nigger funeral drewe and i gape at each other this slur from the most liberal white boy who ever left mississippi but miles is grinning under the treflan cap just practicing my cover he says i guess being a redneck is like riding a bicycle you were never a redneck my dad was this easy reference to his father surprises me how long have you been awake three four days how did you get out of the eros offices werent baxters people all over the place it wasnt hard just before the vault opened i switched shirts with one of my longhaired assistants then i went into the bathroom with a pair of scissors and a ziploc and lopped off most of my hair when the vault opened and the shit hit the fan my assistant made a break for the front door just as id told him to while they chased the longhaired guy wearing black i slipped out through jans private exit got into a service elevator and hasta la vista baby youre whacked man youre nuts you want some chicken and dumplings drewe asks with her usual practicality miles laughs again since i havent had any for at least ten years i might as well what i really need is some coffee though a whole pot weve got a lot to talk about his eyes wander toward the pantry there are two cases standing by the door one is an expensive briefcase the other a large leather computer bag with multiple compartments whats all that i ask drewe sloshes water into the coffeemaker the whole stinking thing miles says softly the whole case as much as i could get anyway police reports fbi interview transcripts email lab findings you name it dont even tell me where you got that shit ive got to his eyes glaze with sudden desperation i need your help to do what to save myself chapter miles has already drunk two cups of coffee drewe and i one each it took me that long to recount my experiences with the fbi even with heavy editing i dwelt mostly on the tragic raid in dallas and played down lenzs plan of luring the killer to the virginia safe house miles seems more concerned with the psychiatrists suspicion that he might be the killer i admit that lenz still suspects him but before i can qualify my words drewe starts asking questions about the murder victims in answer miles opens his briefcase on our kitchen table inside are neatly banded stacks of laserprinted paper covered with the hieroglyphics of commandline communications between computers in short drewe and i are looking at a cornucopia of the fruits of virtuoso computer hacking i have a lot of information here he says squeezing back into the narrow space between the table and the wall i started as soon as the deaths were confirmed its not nearly everything but what i have is color coded green for city police reports orange for crime lab findings blue for witness interviews red for general fbi stuff youve been into the fbis computer i interrupt computers plural their acronym for the case is ermursfor eros murders no wonder they want to arrest you have you broken into their personal email system ive seen it got some printouts here ive also been in the national crime information center computer and some new thing called nemesis stands for nonlinear evaluationmanipulation of evidence system thats the only system they have thats really elegant and its not officially online the rest are crufty as hell but why take these risks drewe asks cant you just keep your head down until this is all over no because baxter and lenz arent going to catch brahma any time soon and in the absence of real leads the great god momentum will cause them to cast around for the most likely suspect in their book thats me but the only way for me to get these guys off my back is to catch brahma myself something ripples through my chest like a pebble dropping into a still pool miles from anywhere besides he goes on brahma is fucking with my network my system i set it up created it ex nihilo and hes treating it like his personal sandbox not acceptable have you figured out yet how he got in i ask how he got the master client list miles stares furiously at the table no i find this almost impossible to believe but i dont want to press him in front of drewe what about alibis you must have alibis for at least some of the nights the killings took place hell i cant remember a night when you werent sysoping the network he gives me a sidelong glance i dont have to be at the office to sysop you know that all i need is a laptop and a phone connection beyond that i dont care to discuss it drewe and i share a look she takes a sip of coffee and says couldnt you just turn yourself in and put up with whatever hassle they give you until the murderer kills again that would prove youre innocent its not that simple if im arrested brahma could decide not to kill again for a while or if he kept killing the fbi could say a copycat had joined the game they could claim i was part of a group and try to prosecute me on that basis but surely they cant have enough evidence to prosecute you miles shrugs there are some lab findings that are consistent with my blood theres other stuff as well not dna they cant have that he says sharply not legitimately but brahma has successfully planted misleading physical evidence at every murder i have to assume he knows who i am from eros whos to say he hasnt planted something of mine that could give them a dna sample thats impossible drewe says nothings impossible and dont think the fbi is above juggling samples to create dna evidence against me given enough pressure to close this case he slides some dark sheets from beneath his pile of paper and spreads them faceup across the table like playing cards these are the victims none of us speak the sheets are laserprinted grayscale photographs all six show sidebyside photographs of young women two blondes three brunettes one indian in the lefthand photos the eyes are open and glowing with life the lips smiling the hair well fixed in the righthand ones the facesthose that are thereare gray and shapeless the eyes open but blank with glassy stares one of the righthand photos shows a decapitated torso another a head that looks as though it was put through an airplane propeller one shows a face like something from a vampire film with wooden stakes protruding from bloody eye sockets before we take in too much miles sweeps the pages out of sight and says i got these out of nemesis ive got crime scene photos too but you dont want to see them hes right drewe is still staring at the blank spot where the images lay after a few moments she blinks then rises and pours miles a third cup of coffee in a remote voice she asks what do the police think drives this man to murder these women miles drinks deeply from his steaming cup finishing with an audible swallow the case has been running for five days ever since harper called the new orleans police and linked karin wheats murder to six unsolved cases in other parts of the country what parts portland oregon new york houston los angeles nashville and san francisco of course the first killing was david strobekker the man who was murdered for his identity that was minnesota the first one we know about i correct him he nods rosalind may the kidnapped attorney was taken from mill creek michigan shes still missing and theres been no ransom note i think shes dead i tell him ditto i dont drewe says firmly enough to draw looks from both of us at least she might not be why do you say that asks miles a theory id prefer to keep to myself right now how was each of the women killed i mean i saw the photos but what did the autopsies say miles watches her from the corner of his eye brilliant as he is he remembers being aced by my wife many times in school the firstnear portlandwas initially ruled an accidental death she was a rock climber took a fall climbing solo fractured her skull was she missing her pineal gland miless eyes narrow she was exposed for a couple of days before they found her coyotes got to her she was missing a lot more than her pineal gland and the other murders shotgun blast to the face in new york strangulation and beheading in houston claw hammer in los angeles pistol shot in nashville strangulation in san francisco with the eyes removed and stakes driven through the sockets the pistol shot was also to the head right and every woman was missing her pineal gland or her entire head it isnt certain with the shotgun victim it was impossible to tell some victims were missing only part of the gland but the fbi consensus says yes and they assume karin wheat was also no no karins head was found this morning what i cry where some cajun fishermen found it wedged in a cypress stump in the bonnet carre spillway the police figure the killer tossed it out his window while driving across the causeway toward la place that means he drove past the airport going out of town and her pineal gland was missing how was it removed drewe asks her eyes bright does that matter i ask as the reality of karins death hits me all over again of course did someone just reach in with a dull spoon and dig it out or did he know what he was doing i dont know what tool was used miles says i didnt see an actual autopsy report just an fbi memo it said the gland was removed through a hole under wheats upper lip like brahma punched through the sinuses and up into the brain jesus i mutter how big was the hole drewe asks miles checks his papers seven millimeters wide damn thats pretty small isnt it drewe is smiling with satisfaction thats it she says thats what asks miles all those traumatic head wounds were meant to mask the killers real intent but karin wheats head was never meant to be found her wound gives us the truth what do you mean what truth tell me the angle of the pistol shot that killed the woman in nashville miles consults his papers it was fired into the back of her neck at an upward angle near the first cervical vertebra drewe nods and smiles again have you ever seen anyone who was attacked with a claw hammer miles he grimaces have you yes during my residency it puts big holes through the skull and the brain squeezes out through the holes like toothpaste from a tube miles and i look at each other in bewildered horror that sevenmillimeter hole beneath karin wheats upper lip drewe says the one that went all the way up into her brain a neurosurgeon would call that the sublabial transsphenoidal route what miles asks its a standard method of removing pituitary tumors the pituitary gland isnt that close to the pineal in neurological terms but in a dead person you could probably punch right through the pituitary and get where you wanted to go youre saying a doctor could be doing this i ask im saying a doctor is doing it the stakes through the eyes a surgeon could go through the optic foramenwhere the optic nerve passes through the skull into the brainveer to the midline and go straight for the pineal with the claw hammer and the rock fall he could practically reach in and pull the gland out the gunshot wound in nashville he goes up through the foramen magnum the big opening in the bottom of your skull and into the brain the traumatic wounds cover up his tracks the track in wheat was pretty small miles says how do you pull out the gland through such a small hole would that be the reason he only got part of it sometimes the pineal is about the size of a pea drewe explains the problem wouldnt be getting it out but seeing it at all what about a flexible probe with a fiberoptic camera and a cutting tool asks miles youre talking about an endoscope i dont think they have those for neurosurgery but i guess you could use any endoscope if the patient was dead i assume the fbi is looking at doctors as suspects miles nods but doctors are only part of a much wider suspect group every police department has a different theory the california police are working a cult angle theyve seen cult murders in the past where certain body parts were taken no pineal glands but adrenals ovaries testicles all kinds of things dr lenz pretty much dismisses cult murders i tell them almost all of them are committed for some conventional motive baxter has officially classified these murders as normal sexual homicides miles says if there is such a thing all the murdered women were raped after they were dead a short intake of breath from drewe theres a ton of forensic evidence he goes on consulting his printouts bite marks in some cases not others the marks dont match in one case they may have been made by a woman with a couple of victims there was severe skin mutilation the weird thing is that semen samples were found and analyzed in every case and with seven victims theyve found semen from at least four different men sometimes near the victim other times inside the vagina theyre waiting on dna tests now to compare to mine no doubt the hair on my forearms is standing you mean four men raped each victim no no four men spread over all seven cases though in two victims there were two different semen samples found miles shakes his head at drewe i know what youre thinkingone sample from a boyfriend or husband the other from the killer right wrong both samples in each woman were the result of postmortem sex good god i whisper miles takes a sip of coffee the problem with physical evidence is that the behavioral science people basically use a connectthedots approach to murder they have checklists for cops to fill out condition of the body restraints no restraints type of weapon cause of death postoffense behavior antemortem rape or postmortem rape penetration or just masturbation all these things produce vastly differing profiles miles sounds almost saddened by the imperfection of the system a guy who knows the system can put a few extra dots at each crime scene and distort the picture if he puts in enough dotsor takes them awaytheres no picture at all like the radically different head wounds drewe says she pulls at the corner of her mouth with her forefinger what about the physician angle miles shuffles his papers the current unit profile includes butchers dentists doctors male nurses taxidermists veterinarians even people whove worked in slaughterhouses they figure somebodys expanding his horizons in new and exciting wayswith help of course drewe wrinkles her mouth in distaste does anyone think just one man might be responsible for the crimes yes but that presupposes an individual of staggering abilities hed not only have to have medical skill and access to things like blood and semen but also detailed knowledge of law enforcement methods forensics locks security systems not to mention psychology and computers its hard to picture one manparticularly a serial killerhaving that kind of ability why wasnt ted bundy a really smart guy not really i did a nexis search on serial killers and i learned a lot bundy looks clever compared to the mean of his groupserial killersbut put him on a scale with the general population and he was nothing special were talking about a guy who dug up women hed killed weeks before to have sex with their corpses he got a lot of press because he looked halfway preppie and could convince women to trust him the truth is most serial killers are genetic debris not brahma i say youve read some of his stuff havent you hes erudite as hell and he can exploit insecurity like no one ive ever seen drewe looks at miles you agree with that yes but i dont think hes a doctor his computer skill levels too high for that some doctors know computers but not at the level im seeing so what do you think i ask you think hes a hacker no i think he might be a real programmer this silences me whats that asks drewe what miles used to be at mit people the media call hackers get to know operating systems like unix and dos and vms very well their design quirks and flaws but real programmers can build operating systems theyre supercoders they call it programming on bare metal theyre the demigods of hackerdom the problem with that theory miles interrupts is that a real programmer killing people doesnt make sense were talking about a dogmatically nonviolent personality type his entire life is lived between silicon metal and bits someone whos read the lord of the rings sixteen times and whod be glad to spend an evening trying to conjugate elvish verbs with you youre generalizing i tell him if this is a sexual thing it doesnt matter what his career is you should know that better than anybody brahma doesnt have control over whats driving him he could be a priest for gods sake i think he does have control drewe says quietly most of the time anyway i suddenly recall lenz telling me the same thing why asks miles because the murders have an ultimate object she says the pineal gland and because the killer has expended great effort to conceal that fact keep going the fact that the women were raped throws me but drop that from the equation for a minute the pineal gland is the primary object because the killer takes it away with him i mean if his goal were merely to rape dead women he could kill just about anybody and do that so so the killer is a doctor miles looks disappointed proof occams razor drewe counters its the simplest answer therefore the most likely youre resisting it because youre biased against doctors i am not drewe laughs the killer broke into your computer system and you dont know how therefore you assume he must be a member of the secret fraternity of the worlds smartest peoplethose who do what you do but youre shortchanging doctors miless face is red i think youre wrong why else should the killer hide the fact that hes taking pineal glands unless it could somehow lead to him and who does the pineal lead to you said there were no cults known for taking the pineal and in the one victim where there was no major head wound the gland was removed using a standard neurosurgical approach that despite the fantasies of the fbi would not be the likely one chosen by a butcher or dentist drewe begins walking around the kitchen seemingly propelled by the tide of her reasoning look at the areas of expertise you mentioned postulate a brilliant surgeon and medicine is taken care of law enforcement is a technical undertaking usually handled by men from what the fiftieth to eightieth percentile of intelligence miles and i watch her with fascination the logical ruthlessness of a smart woman can be chilling who better than a doctor could plant false biological evidence at crime scenes he could get blood urine semen stool samples hair locks and security systems are childs play compared to microsurgery human psychology again an experienced physician that leaves computers miles finishes drewe stops beside the stove yes now please listen miles if i were to drop all my personal prejudices id have to admit that a person like you a computer genius could have been a brilliant surgeon had he chosen that path and because i believe that i must believe the reverse could be true he looks unconvinced i understand your reasoning but you just dont see that in real life ill tell you why you dont see computer experts becoming surgeons because it requires a minimum of nine sometimes eleven years of postgraduate training the learning curve on computers is much shorter you can jump in and begin working almost immediately because if you screw up youve only killed a machine or a program not a person miles stares stubbornly at the table but once youre really seduced by computers she continues its too late for medicine youre into hardware and software not wetware her accurate use of this computer term for the human brain and by extension human beings surprises us both but surgeon as computer expert she asks moving across the floor again the stereotype of no spare time in medical school is false people do get married have hobbies if we posit a medical student who had little or no social life but an obsession with computers i can easily see him attaining the skill level youre talking about especially if he has the aptitude and a practicing surgeon would have whatever spare time he wanted plus the money to pursue his obsessions miles looks up in defeat the question drewe concludes is what is he taking the pineal gland for what does he do with it what does the fbi think miles drums his long fingers on the table and scans a new sheet of paper possibilities range from eating it to burning it to selling it to asians who render certain hormones from it drewe stops again melatonin thats right says miles do you know what melatonin does it regulates the sleep cycle theres apparently a craze right now where people use it as a natural sleeping pill some think its a magic antiaging pill i know a few computer people who take it along with a hundred other vitamins and herbs drewe finally comes to the table and takes a seat after harper got back from new orleans she says he told me about the pineals being taken the next day i punched a few queries into the medline computer at university hospital it told me more than i knew before but not a lot just enough to lead me in the right direction theres a neurobiologist on staff at university he hasnt been there long but hes good you should have seen him come to life when i asked about the pineal gland he was still jabbering when i left fortyfive minutes later melatonin is hot right now because research teams in different parts of the world have recently come up with some startling new findings on it but before i tell you what theyre doing im going to tell you why these women are being killed miles stares at drewe with the wonder of a kid watching a magic show let me ask one question first she says what were the ages of each of the victims miless eidetic memory spits out the digits like bingo numbers is that in order by date of death yes how old is the kidnapped woman rosalind whatever fifty drewe smiles there it is someone is trying to transplant pineal glands between human beings whatmiles cries why i ask to add fifteen to twenty vital years to the human life span perhaps ultimately to his own life miles and i are silent according to the neurobiologist drewe says foreign researchers working on the pineal began by focusing on melatonin as a dietary supplement just the way people are taking it now they found that mice ingesting a regular regimen of the hormone were not only healthier but also lived longer than the control mice this prompted them to try a more radical approach they had microsurgeons transplant pineal glands between micethe pineals of young mice into old mice and vice versa the results were astounding far more dramatic than oral dosages the coats of the old mice regained their luster the animals regained their sexual appetite and ability tcell counts went up certain tumors disappeared and a dozen other results all positive and the young mice miles asks they immediately began to age rapidly but the most fascinating thing is that the old mice with transplanted pineals maintained their reinvigorated state almost up to the point of death to put it simply they never got old they just died the kitchen is so quiet that the cheeep of crickets outside sounds like a roar if that were true i say finally american pharmaceutical companies would be researching melatonin twentyfour hours a day how do you know theyre not they may be duplicating these experiments right now it just might be that a gland thought vestigial until is the engine that controls the human aging process the number of people taking melatonin nationwide is staggering its also frightening because no one knows what its effects are over time the pineal gland basically rules the endocrine system harper it controls sexual development by regulating other hormones it affects body temperature kidney function immunity it controls hibernation in mammals migration in birds it changes skin color in chameleons all this was new to me when the neurobiologist started asking why i was so interested i made excuses and got out of there but by then it was clear to me miles is tapping his fingertips together youre saying the age disparity between the first six victims and karin wheat is explained by the fact that the killer was taking harvesting drewe corrects him harvestingthe pineal glands of young women for transplant youre saying he put these first few glands in the freezer until he got ready to start kidnapping older women to test his theory on she shakes her head i think the first murders were part of a training program transplantation of a human pineal has never been tried the pineal gland has the highest blood flow by weight of any organ other than the kidneys a transplant would be fantastically difficult probably impossible lots of microvascular stuff severing and reattaching minute blood vessels were talking groundbreaking neurosurgery i think whoevers doing this knew he would need practice in the vasculature surrounding a pineal glandprobably a pineal as close to the living state as he could get it so according to your theory says miles just prior to the murder of karin wheat this mad doctor decided he was ready to make a transplant attempt karin wheat is the flaw in my reasoning drewe says quickly to make a transplant attempt the surgeon would obviously need his recipient alive in an operating room not dead in new orleans but i still think the last young woman killed prior to wheat was meant to be a transplant donor what was the elapsed time between her death and karin wheats murder six weeks i reply she sighs in frustration thats too long no way a gland would remain viable that long oh no i nearly moan what miles asks brahmas primary topic of conversation with karin wheat was immortality that was the subject of her last novel they both seemed obsessed with it score one for my theory says drewe but he didnt kidnap karin wheat miles reminds her he murdered her but he did kidnap rosalind may she counters and may was almost the same age as wheat right fifty is definitely the downhill side of the hormonal roller coaster perfect candidate for what im talking about maybe the killer wanted to kidnap wheat i suggest but something went wrong maybe miles allows she was the only victim who died with a drug in her system ketamine its an animal tranquilizer your tech called me two nights ago baxter said may had been missing for two days that means she was kidnapped the night after wheat was murdered i nod they wanted to kidnap wheat somehow bungled it and decided to go for may as a substitute a preplanned backup miles suggests but what went wrong with the wheat scenario why kill her drewe slaps the tabletop stunning us both theres another victim she says whatmiles asks there has to be wheat was the intended transplant recipient something went wrong so they took rosalind may the next night but whos the donor the last murder of a young girlthat we know aboutwas six weeks before wheats death thats too long for a harvested pineal to remain medically viable that means another young woman was kidnapped in the interval or is about to be shes the donor my god i whisper starting to believe for the first time drewe looks at me how long does it take you to find out an eros woman is dead or missing weeks usually i only found out about karin so fast because she was a celebrity what about rosalind may she was only taken days ago its complicated but it comes down to coincidence she was a blinddraft account holder who hadnt been active for a while but was still paying her fees when her account went to zero one of miless techs started poking around a week ago her account went active again it looks like she was talking to brahma right up until the second he took her my god are there more accounts like that about fifty drewe goes still the donor is one of those fifty only her account hasnt dropped to zero yet so nobody but the killer knows shes part of this both she and may could be lying on an operating table right now waiting for wait a minute says miles holding up his hands were going off the deep end here if your surgeon is a helike almost all serial killersand he wants to prolong his own life wouldnt he be kidnapping men sex doesnt matter in organ transplants but why is he raping them for gods sake after theyre dead no less according to your theory this surgeon would be motivated by a semblance of rationality is raping corpses the act of a rational man on eros i once saw a quote about necrophilia taken from a psychiatric textbook in necrophilia the diagnosis of psychosis is considered justified in all cases i laughed about that for two days talk about understatement im no missionary but bonking corpses is definitely off the reservation i cant explain that part of it drewe confesses but i stand by my theory and ill tell you something else one glance at those pictures you flashed tells me these murders werent committed for purely sexual reasons why every one of those women looked different from the others different hair complexion bone structure and enough difference in cosmetics show different personalities men are visually motivated the only connection between those girls was that they were young and karin wheat and rosalind may werent miles flattens his hands on his papers okay lets look at your surgeon for a minute if he intended to try this transplant wouldnt he need the victims blood type tissue type things like that i assume so drewe says but i dont know im an obstetrician i know virtually nothing about transplantation there are very good antirejection agents now how would he do it hes got to remove a gland from the center of the brain then put the new one right back in that spot or could it go somewhere else i would say reattachment in situ is impossible damaged central nervous system tissue will not growthats axiomatic the pineal is attached to a stalk through which all kinds of chemicals flow once you sever that stalk its over maybe he could park it in a kidney or something a kidney i ask in the early mouse transplants the surgeons placed the new pineal inside the thymus which is behind the sternum they did that because both glands were connected to the same nerve center in the brain and the transplanted gland functioned but in the later mouse transplants the new pineals were put right into the brain after the old glands were removed how i dont know and i dont see how you could do that with humans how long would an operation like this take miles asks drewe opens her hands removing a pituitary tumor takes two or three hours but thats simply an excision of tumor tissue this would take much longer but you know for a fact that it worked on mice yes but you see the difference dont you the doctors working on mice were studying only the aging process who knows how much brain function they destroyed in the process of transplanting the pineals a horrifying thought hits me whos to say brahma didnt take the pineals from those first victims and transplant them into living recipients theres no reason to think we know about all his victims he could be taking women from other online services he could be taking homeless women off the street shit mutters miles and if he is he might not care any more than those mouse doctors about what mental functions he destroyed oh god drewe whispers god maybe rosalind may is alive miles says getting to his feet how many people would it take to do what youre talking about bare minimum double up any functions that allow it mmm five two surgeons two nurses and an anesthetist that sounds high i tell her think about battlefield surgery the civil war doctors have performed operations with almost nonexistent resources when they had no alternative okay ditch one nurse but this isnt some macho deal where they do without sedative and cut with a kitchen knife and someone calls it a miracle because they got muddy doing it youre talking about a transplant a glandular transplant at the core of the brain it has never been done if anything it would take more hands than usual plus a stateoftheart operating room youd need an operating microscope a carm fluoroscope all kinds of stuff it might take surgeons working in shifts some neurosurgical operations take more than twelve hours so even if he is a surgeon miles says he needs serious help trained people were talking a lot of money here the ultimate object might even be money i start to argue but he holds up his hand i agree that drewes estimate of five is high were talking about someone who has access to stateoftheart voicerecognition technology miles quickly explains to drewe the theory behind strobekkers zero typographical error rate so whos to say he doesnt have access to computerassisted robotic surgery or whatever else he needs ive seen some prototype medical equipment thats unbelievable i mean we dont know who were dealing with it could be the chief of neurosurgery at a major medical school no way drewe objects wheres the best neurosurgery department in the world i ask columbia she replies without hesitation where else is good not the places youd think the university of washington michigan the barrow institute in arizona but columbia turns out the majority of academic neurosurgeons in the us im getting something from this miles says what columbia i dont know it might come to me in a second might take ten years this is where the brain is truly inferior to the computer ive lost a file in my own head and i cant retrieve it no matter how hard i try memories of lenzs verbal primer on the psychology of serial killers flash through my mind you really think the motive could just be money just money miles barks man you must be even richer than i thought my only question is how brahma could ever make money off the procedure even if he succeeded at the transplant hed be guilty of murder true says drewe but if it worked legitimate surgeons might begin working on the procedure how same as any transplant pineals could be harvested from recently deceased persons your brahma cant access legitimate donor networks because his research is illegal thats why he has to kidnap or kill to get donors but if pineal transplants were proven to counter the aging process the demand for the procedure would be unimaginable but personally hed never make a dime i point out hed be famous though says miles and with the current legal climate he might just get off and do a multimilliondollar book deal money and fame murmurs drewe the twin gods of our society pretty strong motivation for the right person i just dont buy it i insist well obviously theres the metaphysical side says miles i mean whoever pulled this off would be accomplishing what no one in history ever has if you forget morality his quest is heroic even noble noble hell yes melvillian in scope captain ahab with a scalpel mary shelley unbound one of his aliases is prometheus remember ill tell you something else the three of us are under thirtyfive but one day were going to look down at parchment skin shriveled breasts limp dicks and swollen joints that creak like ratchets when we try to move and on that day i think well understand the fountainofyouth motive much better than we do now drewe wrinkles her nose i think youre crude but also right that tells us that the killer must be at least what fortyfive says miles thats the upper range limit for a serial killer i tell them and youre using it as a lower limit at least thats what i got from my research if we go with drewes theory says miles i dont think brahma is a serial killer except by afterthefact definition hes a doctor period a scientist lumping him in with jeffrey dahmer and john wayne gacy is like grouping denton cooley with doc adams from gunsmoke fortyfive sounds good drewe agrees surgery is an acquired skill even gifted cutters need to be tempered in that instant my mind skips off track giving me a new perspective were missing the forest i declare startling both of them if drewe could find out all this about the pineal gland surely the fbi has as well she looks put out at my devaluation of her detective work what do your papers say she asks miles as of last night they werent giving more weight to doctors than to any other group that may have changed after wheats head was autopsied i doubt it i tell them do you know why my oracles are silent weve created a single suspect brilliant enough to actually pull off this transplant thing but thats flawed logic it isnt necessary that he be capable of it or that it even be possible you see all thats necessary is that he know about the pineal research and that he believe hes capable of doing a transplant thats what lets in the psychotic taxidermists and dentists and all the rest but his computer skill proves hes brilliant argues miles brilliant with computers says drewe not necessarily medicine lets say a surgeon is the brains behind this i cut in he trolls eros himself but he needs a hacker to get at our master client list plus medical information from health insurance computers god knows what else then he hires muscle to do the actual killings that explains the rapes cries drewe its not the surgeon its his hired thugs some sleazeballs are raping the women and the surgeon doesnt care so long as he gets his pineal glands hes probably glad his thugs are confusing the crime scenes miles is nodding division of labor a surgeon could easily afford a cracker and some hired muscle gross income for a neurosurgeon is nearly half a million drewe says and thats an average im definitely in the wrong business miles mutters but that theory works only if brahmas a flake i point out if we postulate a man with a real chance of success he needs a team of medical specialists to help with the operation and theyd realize what he was up to says drewe eventually i dont think money would be enough motivation for medical people to take part in murder miles laughs bitterly money is always enough motivation for some people you two have so much of it now youve forgotten what its like to really need it whether its a nut or a serious surgeon i say irritably its clear why you and i are suspects you could easily be the paid hacker youd be guilty of murder even though you were never at a single crime scene he nods soberly i shove back my chair climb onto its wooden back and perch there with my feet on the seat id say weve come up with some significant reasoning here the question is do we tell the fbi fuck no miles says savagely theyve got me cast for the remake of midnight express i look to drewe but she is gazing at the kitchen curtains drawn shut against prying eyes they know most of this already she says softly they must if they dont i dont have much faith in them what do you think i ask miles do they he averts his eyes the groundwork is there they dont suspect theres an unknown victim i press him he shakes his head weve got to tell them about the fifty blinddraft women drewe says flatly thats nonnegotiable one of them is dead or missing right now drewe miles says carefully women set up blinddraft accounts precisely because their use of eros might cause problems or even physical danger in their homes i cant sic the fbi on them without any warning she is clearly upset by this privacy means more to you than a human life you think those women value it over their lives its more complicated than that you just came up with this unknownvictim idea and if we accept our own logic shes already dead right i mean were pegging her as a donor not necessarily dead she could be lying on an operating table right now miles is thinking what if i call jan krislov and tell her to order my techs to start contacting those fifty women to verify that theyre alive and okay everywoman with a blinddraft account drewe insists thats over five hundred women i tell her closer to six miles says it might cause a panic but we could do it he pauses again weighing the risks okay ill tell jan to put four techs on it theyll start with the fifty women who arent active but are still paying their fees good enough drewe bites her bottom lip i feel a strange fluttering below my diaphragm miles maybe its time to come clean with baxter and lenz you talked me out of pursuing this thing once and the result was very bad he lets out a frustrated sigh harper the three of us are buying into a scenario we came up with offthecuff and a pretty damned wild one at that the fbi has twice the raw data we do but theyre not buying the doctor theory yet because they cant afford to its their responsibility to catch this guy were just three people talking you see at my core i know this is a lie we are not just three people talking we are bright people with specialized knowledge and personal stakes in the case even drewe seems to have attacked the problem with proprietary intensity the blaring ring of the kitchen telephone freezes us all in place drewe looks to me for a sign im here i tell her miles definitely isnt she takes a deep breath then picks up the receiver and says dr cole she listens intently for about ten seconds then cuts her eyes at us and smiles tightly hang on she says and puts her palm over the mouthpiece its mom its about erin this is going to be a long one you want me to go to the bedroom phone well get out i spring off the chairback and land on my feet what about telling the fbi she gives me a searching look and while it lasts miles does not exist after some mental process i cannot divine she says they have the same facts we do as long as you start checking the blinddraft women i see no point in calling attention to ourselves tonight a sigh of relief escapes miless lips but if one turns up missing drewe adds we go straight to the fbi miles nods then quickly gathers his papers into his briefcase i kiss drewe on the cheek and lead him down the hall to my officethe domain of secrets and of the eros computer chapter sitting in a halflotus position on a stool before the eros computer his hands flying across the keyboard miles says id forgotten how quick drewe is you really think theres another blinddraft woman missing i ask staring over his shoulder the cover is off the computer and its electronic guts look very different than they did thirty minutes ago well know soon he says typical miles hes already emailed his techs and instructed them to begin a discreet check on the safety of all female blinddraft account holders thus predictions are pointless he stares at the monitor his hands suspended over the keys i cant believe you never installed this card man i sent it to you two months ago hes referring to a large rectangular circuit board designed for voice synthesis and recognition the voicerecsynth card is the most densely packed pc card ive ever seen i dont use the voice much i tell him thats because the one you have sucks the new one has unbelievable inflection control it really sounds human lets hear it he drops his hands to his sides put the cover on bwana you just entered the twentyfirst century with a hard shove i press the metal cover back onto the chassis you got a demo for it miles shakes his head call up a file an eros file these cards only work properly with the eros format i lean over his shoulder click the mouse and retrieve the top file in my electronic filing cabinet the text of a typical exchange between myself and eleanor rigby fills the screen miles hits altva key combination called a macro that simultaneously carries out several functionsand a rectangular window appears in the lower left corner of the screen using the mouse miles clicks on the first harper prompt drags the mouse over to voice one and clicks again then he selects a frequency under the male range he does the same with eleanor rigby but selects a frequency in the female range beneath the frequency range display is a group of controls much like those on a tape recorder miles uses the mouse to select play your turn tonightsays a voice not so different from mine but without any accent the voice came from my computers multimedia speakers but it sounded as natural as a third person in the room i squeeze miless shoulder in disbelief he just laughs im readyanswers a female voice its timbre not exactly sensual but definitely feminine we are standing naked on cool black rock volcanic rock staring across a vast expanse of primeval ocean an orange explosion of sunset burns itself out beneath a purple horizon leaving us stranded beneath white points of stars our blood pulses in sidereal time as our eyes dilate to adapt to the newly dark world pupils expanding to expose underused receptors until the very glow of our skins massages the nerve pathways leading to our brains the first touch not a touch and yet as real as any language in this unbelievable i say over the hypnotic canticle all the subscribers will get this not for a while miles chuckles with the affection of a proud father this part of the package isnt that complicated or expensive its the other half that puts it out of reach what video no quality voice recognition its much more complex than realtime video which you should know since youve had video by satellite uplink for six months which i hardly use either krislov thanks you its too fucking expensive he stands up from the stool and hands me a black plastic headset exactly like those worn by telephone operators and receptionists i guess this will count as the first field test the earphones dont work i picked up the wrong set when i split the office the mike works fine though just talk into it hang on he clicks recordchat with the mouse and the harpereleanor rigby file vanishes okay the real test is whether the program will recognize your voice if it wont this thing is useless to you until we train it with your voice how do you train it by reading many long and boring passages into it grasshopper ive modified the program to be as tolerant as i can make it out of six techs at eros it accepts four as me i sit before the computer and rather tentatively say hello on the screen appears miles hello ill be damned hello is easy says miles it displayed the miles prompt because i logged on as me ill set it to read whatever screen name youre using at the time try a sentence okay as clearly as i can i recite now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country on the screen we see miles okay now is the time four all good men to come two the aid of there country shit says miles his voice weary actually thats not bad considering you never trained with it if youll consciously avoid your southern accent youll probably get better results ihave an accent i ask laughing now that hes neutralized the stress he felt at being around a computer that was not quite stateoftheart miles walks away from the eros table and examines various objects around the room with distracted interest my guitars the civil war sword the sculpture of my fathers coat you glossed right over lenzs plan to lure brahma by pretending to be a woman he says leaning across the twin bed and rubbing the side pocket of the coat i let it slide because you sounded like you didnt want to go into detail about eros in front of drewe good instinct i cant believe this is made of wood he says running his fingertips over the sculpture i thought drewe was into eros she was until about three months ago now she cant stand it she hasnt stepped into this room in six weeks he sits down on the bed and peers at me with open curiosity why the change she find out about eleanor rigby no shes ready to have kids miles but thats only part of it id rather not go into it right now and erin problems with her husband same story skip it i get up from the stool and roll my swivel chair opposite him the last time i saw her was in new york he says as i sit down you saw erin yeah this was years ago she looked seriously medicated she finally kicked that he raises a skeptical eyebrow she got kids now one his gaze is too direct for me to dissemble on that subject so i push him straight to our mutual problem what do you think about lenzs plan i think it might work really the logic is sound there wasnt a word about it in any of the fbi or police computers not even on baxters personal email if theyre keeping it that secret baxter must think lenz is devious enough to pull it off he may but i dont why because its not that easy to pretend to be a sex other than the one you are especially for a man to pretend to be a woman i see people try it all the time and i can always tell cant you miles runs a finger down his aquiline nose sometimes but if i couldnt telland i couldnt peek at the master client listhow would i know i was being fooled granted but what about the tripup questions like what does a speculum look like or what brand of feminine protection do you use and why lenz is a doctor he can handle that stuff maybe but when someone starts writing their innermost thoughts to youlive on computeryou begin to form an emotional picture of who they are and when something rings false you get a little twinge somewhere like hearing a dissonant voice in a choir miles laughs softly harper youre more perceptive than almost anyone i know but even you can be fooled his tone stops me he is not speaking in theoretical terms what do you mean people are fooled about sexual identity every day on eros and i can prove it to you how you wont like it spider legs of apprehension creep along my shoulders why it involves someone you care about what are you telling me miles eleanor rigby i am utterly still no way shes a man i know who she is shes eleanor caine markham a mystery writer an odd smile narrows his lips who also works as a body double in hollywood and has a crippled sister in a wheelchair who resents her personal life i am too stunned to respond immediately miless invasion of my privacy is momentarily forgotten as i try to guess what shocking revelation he is about to drop on me harper he says his tone like that of a teacher urging a child toward the answer to a simple question eleanor rigby is the sister in the wheelchair this statement hits me with physical force as though my parents had sat me down and told me i was adopted you never considered that he asks gently a woman with the brains to be a successful mystery writer also has a body that major directors pay to put on film possible but not likely it seems so obvious now but sixty seconds ago i had no clue it justeverything she said seemed so heartfelt it was each part of eleanor rigby is based in objective and emotional truth she just shuffled the parts on you mixed the roles she lives vicariously through her novels and through talking to people like you on eros youre her sex life harper you truly are her lover maybe the greatest of her life sad isnt it a shapeless flood of anger courses through me and for lack of a better target i direct it at miles who gave you the right to go prowling through my life goddamn it youre the one who doesnt have a life were all voyeurs he says in a neutral tone its the new american pastime pretty pathetic i guess but thats where we are thats a copout miles maybe if you want to know the truth i checked out eleanor because i saw you getting tight with her maybe even risking your marriage if drewe happened to see the stuff you two were writing i wanted to make sure she wasnt some basket case you know the kind that shows up and starts boiling rabbits on your stove how can i ever thank you though i am spitting sarcasm my inner voice tells me that miles does care what happens to me but still i feel the urge to strike back before i know it i am asking him the one question i have spared him up until now miles i say in my fathers voice are you involved in these murders in any way he blinks in surprise in any way he looks away then back at me anything else you want to ask while youre at it am i queer youve been wondering that too havent you youre avoiding my question that scares me fuck no i am not now nor have i ever been a corpsefucking killer okay good enough i watch him impassively i cant believe you asked me that i feel the peculiarly human satisfaction of knowing i have made him as angry as i am youd better get used to it im on your side and i had to ask what do you think the fbi will think hey i know what they think thats why i have to catch this asshole i slowly roll my chair forward and back with my feet i agree do you have a plan you think i came back to this cultural wasteland for the sights of course i have a plan my pulse quickens what is it youve got a way to trace his phone connections he shakes his head i might be able to if i had the help of att and the major cellular companies but i dont do i so he slides off the bed and stands his uncovered crewcut a mere shadow against his scalp he runs a hand through it like a man feeling the stump of an amputated limb then begins pacing out invisible patterns on the floor this is what will happen he says for a while brahma will communicate just as he has in livechat mode how long depends on the telephone tricks he has up his sleeve its not easy to avoid being traced these days once they get close to him he can keep using livechat mode by switching between authorized accounts to which he has the passwords according to you hes already done this once talking to lenz but if the fbi techs are smartand thats open to questiontheres a way to track those legitimate accounts miles has paused so i oblige him with a how you gave lenz some transcripts of some of brahmas dialogues with his victims right using those the fbi should be able to build a search engine that will sift through eros for his most common prose patterns it will take less and less time for them to begin their traces and eventually brahma will switch from live chat to email does that help us think harper whats the essential difference between chat mode and email well i dont know sure you do think real estate location location location suddenly i have it in chat mode each person is sending his side of the conversation to one of our servers in new york in essence each is viewing the conversation by long distance whereas email is an actual file that the user downloads from our computer into his own usually anyway he grants me a smile patronizing enough to make me feel im back in the third grade thats how im going to get him i try to see farther down the logical track how youre going to give his computer a virus destroy all his files what will that accomplish im not going to do either what then a trojan horse i sit back and ponder this a trojan horse is a program that a hacker plants inside someone elses computer usually to facilitate the burglary of passwords it resides in some neutral area of the host computers memory waiting patiently until a legitimate user logs on and enters his or her password when that happens the trojan horse copies the users password into a secret file before allowing him access to the computer after a day or a week or a month the hacker dials back into the computer opens his trojan horse program and removes a hefty new file filled with legitimate passwords then he deletes his trojan horse so that no one will ever know it was there after that he can gain illegal access to that system whenever he wishes by using the legitimate passwords the trojan horse true to its name has opened the gates to the city i dont see your reasoning i tell miles youre not trying to break into brahmas computer this isnt going to be a traditional trojan horse if i can build it this will be a real trojan horse i dont understand you remember how the trojan horse got inside the walls of troy sure the greeks built it pulled it up to the gates of troy and pretended to sail away the trojans thought the horse was a gift and pulled it inside their walls miles nods which is exactly what brahma is going to do why should he do that trust me he will what happened after the trojans pulled the horse into the city the greek soldiers hidden inside climbed out that night and killed them all miles chuckles softly my plan is slightly different from that but the result will be the same but you cant even roll your trojan horse up to the city walls you dont know where it is im not going to he says calmly you are and then i see it miles has arrived at the same conclusion i did at the indian mound this afternoon only he probably did it three days ago you want me to do what lenz is doing pretend to be a woman engage brahma online he smiles dont tell me you havent thought about it and i know you can do it harper much better than lenz youre a songwriter for god sake a fucking pied piper with words not exactly a successful one for reasons wholly unrelated to your talent and you have more empathy with women than anyone i know every girl we ever knew confessed her darkest secrets to you at some time in her life am i wrong hes right but im in no mood to admit it im not saying i havent thought about it but lenz has some advantages we dont like a swat team to take brahma out if he shows up we dont need that were not trying to lure him here we have three simple goals all based around the trojan horse one get brahma to believe in you two keep up the relationship until he switches from live chat to email three get him excited enough that he doesnt examine every bit of information flowing down the pipe from you to him youre going to bury your trojan horse program in my email and hope he downloads it into his computer thats one possibility but wont he see the program an executable file piggybacked with email i dont know im not sure i can do what i want to do with email but i have an advantage i designed eross email system we want a situation where the two of you are exchanging long letters sexual fantasies anything that requires a lot of bits if i cant do it with email youll have to convince him to download some program you say youre wild about some sexual thing i could kluge up fast maybe with a video file or something what if brahma doesnt switch to email then you make the switch tell him you get nervous live you like to compose your letters in romantic contemplation or some such bullshit i consider the plan searching for faults exactly what kind of special trojan horse is this going to be the serene smile of a zen master smooths miless face a masterpiece almost invisible but deadly in its own way a study in elegance i want to press him but i know it would be useless how long will it take he shrugs i dont know i never know that bumming code isnt linear work i mean i might hack through it line by line but more likely ill stare at the tv for two days then cop to the right thing when im not thinking about it reaching across the twin bed he pulls down one of my old martins he studies the guitars scarred face then cradles it under his arm and puts his fingers to the strings a halting rendition of neil youngs the needle and the damage done tinkles from the sound hole i taught him to pick that tune sometime around at fourteen miles was growing his own marijuana and he drove me crazy to teach him the song as far as i know its the only thing he can play how long since you played that i ask ive picked it out on every guitar i ever found leaning against a wall in someones apartment i laugh with him the bonds of friendship are strange and the moment emboldens me to be painfully honest miles what were talking about could take a while you know as well as i do that one of those sheriffs cars could pull up outside with a search warrant any time and wed both be arrested he nods soberly if that happens ill go back out through the tunnel just like i came in and i wont come back drewe isnt going to like this i know but i dont think she wants me in jail either shed rather it be you than me he hangs the guitar back on its pegs and unfolds his long frame on the bed sighing deeply he turns his head to face me exhaustion clouds his eyes like smudges on a camera lens we could go two different ways he says as if ive already agreed to his scheme use the identity of a real eros client a woman with a blinddraft account or we can create a fictional woman totally from scratch after a useless moment of internal resistance i ask which is better a real woman is easier from a technical standpoint but there are disadvantages you wont know much about her brahma might discover real information that conflicted with what you were telling him also if brahmas selection criteria are medical we dont know what they are a real woman has real medical records and if he got access to them he might disqualify her on that basis alone plus wed be putting her life at risk without her consent unless someone like eleanor rigby would let us no i say cutting him off miless manipulative tendencies are never far from the surface as i consider his words an image of agent margie resslers gamin face comes into my mind what about a fictional woman the plus is that she can be whatever you want the negative is that she wont really exist which means ill have to create her what do you mean bureaucracy social security card drivers license motor vehicle records address im sure the fbi faked credit cards and everything else for lenzs decoy they did i confirm recalling lenzs boasts in his car can you do that miles yawns heroically sure only i dont have the help they do if we go that way ill keep it simple no medical records at all that way brahma has to go with whatever you tell him despite anxiety about the risks im fascinated by miless proposal rather than trying to lure a predator toward us in the hopes of trapping himwhich is basically lenzs planmiles means to trick him into swallowing a hand grenade as his eyes close i say those goals you mentioned contacting brahma keeping the relationship going long enough for him to switch to email all that yeah he opens one eye you forgot one both eyes are open now what catching the son of a bitch before he decides to kill me he smiles then both eyes close miles is snoring softlywith three cups of coffee in him no lesswhile i sit at my desk with the contents of his briefcase spread in front of me drewe is still on the phone with her mother occasionally her voice rises above the hum of air conditioner and computer theres enough stolen information on my desk to fill twelve hours with steady reading not merely nexis newspaper stories but lab results and detectives case notes things that would put miles under a jail were they ever entered as evidence in a court of law yet all of it pales into insignificance beside the photographs of the victims confucius was right about pictures and words all the words on the paper in this pile add up to mere statistics but the faces are real the faces are people a more analytical man might look at those statistics and see gold see his destiny might feel certain that after enough solitary study of those lines and squiggles a new relationship would emerge like a hologram from the chaos and point him toward the killer but my analytical gift ends at murder i feel too much empathy with the women in these searing images to place myself at the appropriate remove for objective study perhaps this is the reason i first strayed out of my fathers footsteps drewe has that capacity for distance it may well be what allowed her to make logical leaps about brahma while miles and i plodded along like boys following bread crumbs strange that emotional distance would be a requirement for those who heal whereas i who feel others pain more keenly than most have hurt far more people than i have helped what can i do for these poor women what do they need someone to avenge them theyre certainly past hurting now as this thought dies i realize what holds my gaze to their haunted faces they are eternally unattainable like keatss grecian figures they will possess their mystery and thus their beauty forever i can never touch them and if i can never touch them i can never hurt them granting myself that reprieve i am able to admit that i do know what they need they need justice but justice cannot be served until their killer has been hounded to his lair chained and brought to a place of judgment it may be that miles and i can assist with the first task yet my logic remains sound enough to comprehend the scale of the problem for almost a year brahma has gone about his business without hindrance in all the world i alonebecause of a few ripples in the eros netperceived the foul wake of his passing i reacted late but i reacted and by so doing created a window of opportunity and then in dallas the fbi squandered forever the only advantage it would ever havesurprise now brahma is hiding and he has an infinite matrix in which to conceal himself i once thought the vastness of america was geographic that miles of space or denseness of wood made massive measure then on an icy chicago street i met a man and woman searching for their stolen child after a single conversation a couple of long looks into their hollow eyes i saw that every mountain lewis and clark traversed every steaming swamp de soto pushed through every plain the pioneers crossed has been transected by the compass riven by the surveyors level scarred by roads photographed by satellites and reduced to a thing you can fold into your glove compartment but those lost parents stared across an uncharted sea of people praying in vain for the phosphorous glow of a longvanished trail each town an eddy each city a whirlpool that could swallow a hundred children without trace and across that sea float the millions of milk cartons carrying photographs of the missing like messages in bottles bound for garbage cans as surely as the ruins of last nights dinner looking at miless stolen photographs i know that somewhere in that same sea moves a man who saw final agony twist the faces of these women who heard the last word or plea or wail that passed their lips he moves comfortably in the knowledge that maps do not exist to lead men to him that he can do his grisly work in peace that he can taunt his hunters that only an accident will raise his head above the mob and mark him as a son of cain chapter i found brahma at pm to my surprise he was deep in conversation with lilithdr lenzs personal eliza doolittle id been looking for him for about an hour stopping occasionally to run a global search of eros checking for anne bridges the account name that backed up lenzs lilith i also searched a few chat lobbies for shiva and levon and prometheus and kali as i searched i wondered whether brahma like me could roam behind the digital walls that appear solid to eross subscribers but yield like curtains to its system operators if so he could see me searching yet i had no choice if i wanted to find him after a while drewe leaned in saw miles sleeping said good night and padded away without offering a summation of erins problems i wasnt about to ask for one and then i got the hit at first i didnt understand what i was seeing the alias interacting onscreen with lilith was not shiva or any of the other familiar noms de plume it was maxwell yet after reading less than twenty lines of text i knew maxwell was brahma my excitement made me clumsy when i tried to activate the new voicesynthesis program but i finally got it going now my laserjet printer hums and whispers as it records the conversation while the digital voices of lilith and maxwell spar and weave and intertwine like mating serpents they seem to be discussing a sexual incident that sounds like a cross between a group sex encounter and a gang rape lilith it was my decision maxwell i dont accept that why did you let nine men have their way with you lilith its not easy to explain maxwell was it you who suggested it lilith it wasnt that clearcut maxwell wasnt it suggested by the first man the one who took you upstairs lilith why do you think it was upstairs maxwell it always is or else in a basement lilith it was upstairs at a fraternity house and i dont remember exactly it was like we were doing it my date and i on this bottom bunk and then this other guy walks in a boy really he said hey im really drunk i need to crash and then he climbed up on the top bunk to sleep maxwell but he didnt sleep lilith no in a minute or so i opened my eyes and saw his head leaning off the edge of the top bunk looking down watching us looking into my eyes he looked like he was watching god or something wideeyed like a kid and then his head disappeared and i noticed the top bunk was moving too and like i knew what he was doing up there he couldnt help himself and when my date finished a second later i said i think your friend is frustrated he looked at me funnyhe was pretty drunk tooand he said you wanna help him out or something and i just laughed and said i felt sorry for him why not i swear to god ill never know why i did that so my date got up and laughed and the kid from the top bunk came down he was really timid at first really gentle but then he started thrashing and moaning it took him like a minute and a half to finish and by the time he did i noticed the first guy was gone and there were two other guys standing by the door maxwell inside the room lilith yes the door was half open and i dont know why but i just sat up and said whos next and they practically fought each other right there it was like wild animals or something after that it was all sort of a blur maxwell nine men in a row lilith does this turn you on or something maxwell it saddens me lilith lilith it shouldnt dont you understand what i told you its what finally liberated me maxwell i dont believe that lilith because you dont understand it all these guys these boys whose whole lives were wrapped up in their egos and the size of their penises this macho thing every one of them was the same you see they all wanted the same thing me and none was any better than the others or any worse and i could take whatever they dished out and reduce them to nothing they came in like lions and went out like lambs maxwell youre not telling the complete truth lilith i know it was degrading did they stand around watching each other do it to you lilith i wouldnt allow that one at a time maxwell was the room dark or light lilith dark maxwell did they all have you the same way missionary position lilith a couple tried to turn me over but i knew better maxwell how long did each one last lilith why do you want to dwell on this stuff maxwell lilith lilith some lasted a few minutes others fifteen seconds most around two minutes i guess maxwell so it was just twenty minutes out of your life no big deal thats what youre telling me lilith no im telling you it was a big deal but not in the way you think after it happened i no longer felt that stupid sense of obligation to satisfy whoever happened to want me a guy has an erection so what thats his problem when i was younger i didnt understand that it may sound naive but i didnt there is a sudden silence i wait with my hands gripping the arms of my chair where is lenz getting this stuff despite my assertions to the contrary with miles im having a hard time remembering that lilith is a middleaged psychiatrist sitting in mclean virginia the female voice synthesized by the computer probably contributes to the illusion but lenzs nightmarish story is freighted with the pain of real experience as i begin to worry that he has somehow blown it maxwells voice and text resume maxwell you say you didnt know any of these men lilith i knew the first guy he was the guy who asked me to the party my date hah maxwell i think you knew someone else at the party lilith lilith like who maxwell a former lover another caesura then maxwell lilith lilith im here maxwell i think you let these men have sex with you not to liberate yourself but to hurt someone else lilith you dont understand anything maxwell be honest only truth can free you lilith you think youre pretty damned smart dont you maxwell i see what is i sense pain lilith yes he was there maxwell a former lover lilith yes maxwell hed thrown you away for someone else lilith yes maxwell was this someone else at the party too lilith no maxwell did this young man learn what you were doing upstairs that you were servicing his friends lilith yes maxwell did he come upstairs the longest silence yet kicks up my pulse rate but finally lilith responds lilith yes someone pushed him into the room they were yelling at him telling him to take a turn maxwell did he lilith no maxwell what did he do lilith he started crying maxwell really lilith yes maxwell and lilith i told him if he wanted me hed have to wait in line maxwell someone was fucking you while you said this lilith yes maxwell what happened then lilith he tried to stop it maxwell did it stop lilith no they beat him up and threw him out maxwell how did you feel after that after he left lilith i wanted it to stop then i wanted to go after him maxwell to explain to tell him how badly hed hurt you lilith yes and how id wanted to hurt him back so hed understand what hed done to me maxwell did it stop lilith no maxwell why not lilith i was trapped maxwell by your own perversity lilith i guess i dont like to think about that part of it maxwell the door to the room was open wasnt it lilith yes maxwell people were watching lilith yes maxwell how many lilith lilith i dont know maxwell how many had you lilith i dont know some got in line two or three times maxwell and what was it like lilith horrible maxwell what was it like lilith lilith like drowning like they were holding my head under water i couldnt fight they were too strong maxwell did you call out for help lilith yes maxwell to whom your mother lilith no if my mother had seen me that way i would have killed myself maxwell your father lilith my father was dead there was no one maxwell the police lilith i didnt report it maxwell you couldnt could you youd agreed to have sex with more than one man at what point did it become rape lilith i knew thats how a cop would see it how men would see it maxwell women too lilith women are far more cruel judges of female character than men i assure you lilith you dont have to tell me that but i meant what i said before about how it changed me at some point during the thing i just rose above it all like i died and rose ten feet above the bed and hovered there and saw myself being humped by these brainless bastards maxwell how did you feel about them lilith i didnt feel anything i saw them like a pack of wolves biological jello in the evolutionary chain consciously they were just animals trying to show off to each other unconsciously they were trying to spread their genes i just thank god i didnt get pregnant from it i might have killed myself maxwell you talk a lot about killing yourself lilith i used to think about it a lot before that night anyway like after a date when i had let a guy screw me and then he wouldnt call that kind of purgatory feeling when all the other girls are out with their boyfriends and you know theyre holding out for that letter jacket or that pin or that wedding ring oh no jimmy not there not yet just on the outside of my panties im so sorry sweetie i can help you though ill just use my hand okay maxwell it sounds like youve been there yourself lilith guys have told me that stuff maxwell and you never held out for anything lilith not back then i dropped my panties for any goodlooking guy with a hardon maxwell and now lilith i still dont hold out because someone who holds out is on the defensive im not on the defensive anymore maxwell no lilith no i fight for what i want and i get it ill bet i make more money than any of those idiot jocks who raped me maxwell i wouldnt be surprised lilith theres just one thing i want to know lilith my address right or what color is my pubic hair christ youre all alike maxwell not at all i would like to know what youre doing on eros i am praying lenz will reply quickly but the next voice that speaks is not his maxwell it doesnt seem to me that someone who has experienced what you say you have and grown spiritually from it would be spending time on a sexual online service nestce pas lilith im not a sexual being anymore is that your point maybe youll figure it out eventually maybe youll see me again here maybe you wont maxwell im sure i will lilith i have a question for you max maxwell yes lilith how long is your cock maxwell i shall not dignify that lilith i mean it i like them thick at the bottom think you can follow fifteen guys in one night maxwell not to my taste thank you im a fastidious man lilith youre a liar ill bet youre playing with yourself right now maxwell youre a hostile person lilith where did all that rage begin lilith youll never know maxwell someday i shall tell me did you climax at any time during this forced bacchanal lilith ive never had a climax with a man in my life maxwell what about masturbation lilith when i was very young not later maxwell but you experienced some heightened state on that night lilith that night i told you it was an elevated awareness like the more animalistic the situation got the less individual i was the less guilt i had the less i had to worry about anything beyond some point i knew nothing was my fault and the men seemed almost in some kind of trance state like a frenzy something about their madnessit was a sexual madness i thinkpassed into me somehow like i was just a vessel for their anger and their fear maxwell why do you say fear lilith thats what i felt i guess that underneath all their thrusting and heaving was some kind of awful terror something they were running away from something worse than anything in the world maxwell death lilith worse than that and the harder they tried to come the closer that thing was getting to them it was insane really im not sure i could live through it again maxwell what do you mean lilith i think my heart might stop or just explode i would probably kill one of them or die myself maxwell that was the next natural step wasnt it lilith death from this sexual frenzy to death lilith i suppose it was violence was all over that room maxwell did you ever feel while it was going on that the young men might kill you lilith i dont know i was scared scared enough to help them finish i mean i didnt just lie there i figured the faster i moved the faster theyd finish and the safer id be maxwell you were frightened that theyd hurt you lilith they were hurting me you asked if i was scared theyd kill me maxwell and lilith no they werent at that level you know they were like these suburban white guys there were moments when theyd all like realize what they were doing that it was a crime or whatever i think it was only the fact that they were all together that gave them the guts to keep going individually theyd never really crossed the line maxwell what line lilith you know ive dated guys whove really been to the edge guys who could have killed every kid in that room and never given it another thought maxwell you exaggerate lilith lilith no there are men like that i like men like that maxwell men who have killed lilith not necessarily but men whocouldkill and damned quickly if they had to maxwell all men can kill lilith if pushed far enough lilith i disagree physically yes but spiritually no just as every man with a penis could technically have raped me that night but mentally and spiritually some could not have people are different maxwell you are an interesting person lilith what would you have done if youd walked into that room that night maxwell i would have stopped it lilith you couldnt have my old boyfriend was there and he couldnt they beat him to a pulp maxwell i am not your old boyfriend lilith how would you have stopped it maxwell by deciding to i am like john galt i can stop the motor of the world if i so choose lilith who is john galt lenz must be reveling in the delicious irony of typing those words that question as though he had never heard of that literary character maxwell a fictional hero in a magnificent but ultimately silly novel by ayn rand the allusion seemed appropriate ten seconds ago lilith what are you really like maxwell i want to know more about you im curious maxwell curiosity kills cats here we go i say softly here it comes lilith are you threatening me maxwell do you respond to threats lilith not well why shouldnt i be curious youve been interrogating me as you please maxwell what do you wish to know lilith how old are you maxwell fortyseven holy shit i glance right to make sure the printer is still recording every word is brahma telling the truth turning toward the bed i call miles wake up then i turn up the voices lilith thats a good age maxwell how so lilith old enough to know what youre doing not too old to do it maxwell to what are you referring lilith whatever you like in life do you like your work maxwell i focus more on my avocation lilith you have your own company or something maxwell i own several companies but theyre merely paperwork what most people call careers i call glorified secretarial work lilith do i sense an attitude maxwell i do not suffer fools gladly lilith sowhats your real work maxwell im in the medical field score one for drewe miles says from behind me you were right i admit lenz seems to be pulling it off hes damned good at it i thought he might be lilith are you a doctor maxwell please do not pry too much we dont know each other well enough lilith how much closer can we get ive already told you my darkest secret maxwell really there must be more in your past than a postadolescent gang rape however tragic a woman who will ask whos next to drunken fraternity boys has more in her closet than that lilith i dont care for your attitude maxwell you can always log off do it i say sharply though lenz is a thousand miles away log off asshole miles spits at the monitor but lenz is greedy lilith why do you want to bully me like that maxwell i thought you didnt put up with bullying anymore lilith im not made of stone inconsistent says miles hes losing it goddamn it log off lilith i havent let a man into my life for some time but i had a new feeling tonight maxwell i must go now perhaps well speak again lilith how will i find you stop pushing i yell maxwell ill find you auf wiedersehen he knows says miles staring at the letters still glowing on the screen lenz spooked him and he split maybe not a lot of exchanges get like that at the end one person is always needier than the other maxwell miles murmurs brahmas playing games all over the place man what do you mean the name whats the first maxwell that pops into your head maxwell smart he shakes his head think beatles abbey road abbey road maxwells silver hammer miles begins to sing joan was quizzical studied pataphysical science in the home late nights all alone with her test tubes ohohohoh i follow with maxwell edison majoring in medicine calls her on the phone whoa he cuts in maxwell was a doctor and the chorus jesus together we chant the now chilling words bangbang maxwells silver hammer came down upon her head bangbang maxwells silver hammer made sure that she was dead we stare at each other in numb silence thats a big leap i tell him except that his other aliases were shiva kali levon shiva is the destroyer kali is a goddess of blood and death levon wasnt a killer he wasnt exactly santa claus either he was born a pauper to a pawn on a christmas day when the new york times said god is dead and the wars begun this is creepy miles he scans the printouts again lenz had the son of a bitch and he blew it i thought hed try to mimic karin wheats personality more get into immortality and the occult and all that miles shakes his head lenz is in a hurry hes trying to cover all the bases at once hes giving brahma a woman whos both strong and weak but if we go with drewes scenario lenzs approach is useless its designed to provoke by being overtly sexual whereas brahmas criteria may be medical what choice does lenz have he cant log on and say fortysevenyearold female seeks succulent twentythreeyearold pineal gland please send photo miless laugh is terminated by the ring of the phone the impulse to flight flashes in his eyes well screen it i tell him after two rings the machine answers my outgoing message plays and a beep prompts the caller cole pick up the phone says a deep voice lenz says miles he crosses the room picks up the cordless trots back to me and hands me the phone im here did you see the psychiatrist asks his voice brimming with excitement i saw it not bad doctor i had him going didnt i has lenz called merely to rehash his triumph like a high school kid talking about his football game maybe he thinks im the only person who truly understands the parameters of his strange quest you saw his age he asks fortyseven yes and admitting that hes in the medical field cole its working miles leans over the answering machine what about the bit at the end lenz asks suddenly penitent did i go too far hard to say i know i pushed him but im fighting time here miles punches me in the side i guess baxters pressing you to nail him before he kills again huh im speaking of the phone traces miles punches me again this time i punch back you mean theyre close to tracing him no theyre no longer trying to trace him what before we put the decoy plan into action we realized we were facing an eitheror situation if they tried to trace the unsub every time we conversed online it would be obvious i was helping the fbi you see oh i see but i cant believe baxter stopped the traces its not indefinite hes given me seven days then they start the traces again now you see why im having to push harder than id like is there anything else you needed yes lenz says in a strange voice im wondering why you havent asked me about turner i look at miles i figure youd be crowing about it already if youd caught him if you know where he is cole do yourself and your wife a favor turner wouldnt hang his ass out to protect yours i sense the heat of miless rage from a foot away yeah well opinions are like assholes everybodys got one lenz finishes only a lot of people pay a lot of money for mine theres a sucker born every minute good night cole i carry the cordless back across the room and set it in its cradle nice guy huh hes better than some says miles he points at the red in the led window of my answering machine have you listened to all those messages i didnt want them banging around in my head he raises his eyebrows and getting no objection from me hits the rewind button a minute later the tape begins playing back the messages most are from various police departments a couple are from old friends warning me that theyve been questioned about me by police one is a sales pitch from a credit card company and six are from detective michael mayeux of the new orleans police department miles and i listen to his final message in rapt silence mr cole i dont know where you are but youd better start checking your messages you may not believe this but im worried about you if the fbi has pressured you into some kind of cooperation you better be damn careful this case got weird fast theres a lot of bad feeling in all the pds involved these days the bureaus pretty good about sharing information but right now theyre acting like they did back in the seventies some people are saying theyve already screwed up the investigation that isnt your problem i know all im saying is things could reach a point where the departments involved just get fed up and decide to do what theyve been wanting to do all along which is blow the whistle shut down eros and arrest you and turner you gotta admit i treated you okay when you came to us if you need helpand brother you doim your man now give me a call miles has wandered away from me what do you think about that i ask never happen he says distantly going public and shutting down eros i mean city cops arent going to risk pissing off the feds to that degree could we use mayeux to our advantage things havent progressed that far yet just ignore him im glad hes not a mississippi cop hed be sitting on my doorstep right now miles plunks himself down on the edge of my bed and sighs you said they found karin wheats head near the bonnet carre causeway i remind him headed toward la place that means he passed the new orleans airport but from the distances between the previous murder cities i always assumed brahma was flying he could have flown out of baton rouge miles points out its only an hour away and you go through la place to get there or he could have driven to la place just to toss out the head then turned around and driven back to the airport the fbi doesnt know how hes getting around common sense says flying but theres enough elapsed time between the murders for him to have ridden a goddamn trailways bus except the onenight interval between karins death and rosalind mays abduction he nods theyre searching airline records trying to match passenger manifests for the murder cities on given dates but all matches so far have been legitimate he could have taken a private plane i suggest like you did to get here theyre checking that he looks up and searches my face you got something you want to say take it easy im just thinking out loud he runs both hands over his freshly skinned scalp and focuses somewhere beyond me you been thinking about what we talked about the trojan horse some and im up for it a broad smile lights his face all right now were cooking with gas miless occasional regressions to southern idiom surprise me but i guess every refugee carries cultural baggage have you decided which way you want to go he asks i mean a real eros client or totally from scratch not a real client i tell him i dont want to put anybody at risk like that but i dont want to start totally from scratch either his eyes narrow i dont get you i move closer to the bed and look down at him im going to explain this to you once after that you dont ask me about it sure youve got a name in mind yes what is it erin he blinks no questions i dont get it youre picking that name out of the blue or youre talking about our erin my wifes sister he lets out a low whistle if this is going to work miles its got to be authentic that overthetop stuff lenz is doing wont fool brahma long i mean i think that gang rape stuff really happened to somebody but not to lenz you know probably one of his patients brahma feeds on the pathos of real human beings and erins the one i know things about her things that could help me play her very well whatever you want miles says quietly i trust your instincts lenz thinks brahma is targeting older women now thats why he made lilith fortyeight but i cant play a fortyeightyearold woman convincingly well just have to hope hes still interested in donors as well as recipients he opens his hands whatever you say but ive got to ask are you saying you want erin as your online alias or the real name behind the alias online alias you can make her legal name anything you want miles digests this slowly im not even going to ask where this is coming from youre playing the role you pick the costume but arent you worried that using erin might somehow lead brahma to her no because it wont really be erin its going to be a blend of erins personality and mine a hybrid and the fact that the alias is erin should make brahma think her real name is anything but erin youre right he says looking impressed for once its your job to create a fake identity thats untraceable and the address worries me i know you can do a lot by hacking but you cant change where we are what if brahma can actually trace the phone connections i dont think he can not easily anyway but even if he tries ill have it covered how im going to hack into atts jackson switching station change around some number and address data then ill make that data match the erin stuff i put into the dmv computer and everywhere else i thought telephone switching stations had gotten practically impenetrable some have but ill bet mississippis had the fewest attempted penetrations of any state in the us he smiles and they definitely arent ready for me grasshopper im asking for one promise miles what drewe knows nothing about what were trying to do nothing i dont care what we tell her but its not going to be this he holds up his hands you think im nuts this is illegal and we both know it yeah but weve got to do it wicked blue light flashes in his eyes and its going to be the motherfucking rush of all time wow a surge of adrenaline pushes me over to the left front window i have to fight the urge to peek around the blinds to see whether there are any deputies standing in the dark yard can i ask you one thing miles says one thing then i shut up for good one thing i say to the window blind this erin thing were talking about something in the past right you and her yes i thought so i turn from the window to ask how far back in time his suspicions began but he is already hunched over the keyboard at my desk by tomorrow morning a digital human being that backs up my erin will exist in the bureaucratic agar that forms the basis of legal existence in america miless groundwork will accomplish brahmas initial suspension of disbelief but far more important than a social security number or address will be the woman i carry in my mind and heart a carnal phantom called erin still wanders unbidden through my dreams and though i am not sure how or why i know that through me she can haunt the ruthless killer we have christened brahma to his grave chapter my chief fascination in the days following miless appearance was listening to the baroque mating ritual between maxwell and lilith from the worldly wise but bitter woman who endured a college gang bang lenz quickly expanded his creation into a multidimensional character worthy of a christmas appearance on oprah sometimes lilith taunted maxwell other times she passively answered whatever questions he put to her however personal i decided lenz must be drawing his emotional raw material from actual case histories much of it had the outrageous ring of truth that only reality can provide incidents that would get any decent fiction writer drummed out of his profession through it all maxwell probed liliths past with lapidary precision a twist here a light tap there gradually forming a picture of the woman who lay behind the alias miles spent most of the first day building the digital skeleton that would support my fictional erin we chose the legal name cynthia griffin and decided to place her address in vicksburg which lies forty miles southwest of rain we discussed the chance that a mississippi address might give brahmas intuition a tickle but wordofmouth among my old friends had brought the number of mississippi eros clients to more than thirty miles thought that was more than enough to make one new addition quite natural once cynthiaspersonal information had been hacked into the proper government computersand an eros account opened in her namemiles began coding away at his trojan horse program consuming massive amounts of mountain dew and granola bars ferried by drewe from the yazoo city kmart he rarely sat in front of his computer to do his coding after drewe left for work each morning he would commandeer an easy chair in the darkened den and fortified by junk food sit glassyeyed through three or four old movies on the satellite channels his favorites seemed to be disaster movies from the nineteenseventies à la airport and the towering inferno melodramatic extravaganzas featuring faded hollywood legends now and then he would jump up and hurry into my office sit down before his laptop and punch in a few keystrokes cocking his head at odd angles and murmuring to himself drewe worked every day but she called frequently to see how the check on the female blinddraft account holders was going about midnight on the second night jan krislov emailed us saying that the fiftytwo blinddraft women showing low account activity in the past months had all been verified as alive and well so had more than three hundred of the remaining blinddraft women this punched a gaping hole in drewes theory of another missing woman and by extension her pineal transplant theory or so we thought when we told drewe about jans message she was standing at my office door about to leave for work she looked blank for about thirty seconds then her eyes flickered with knowledge i was so stupid she said the missing woman couldnt be an eros client the eros population isnt large enough to allow selection of tissuematched donors you see the killer could do all the surgical practice he wanted on eros women but when it came time to match a donor to a recipient he had to search a much larger population why asked miles probability donor networks require pools of thousands tensof thousandsof potential donors so that exact matches can be found for those in need of organs or tissue after the killer kidnapped rosalind mayhis intended recipienthe had to tissuetype her then find a donor of the right age who was a match the twentyfive hundred women on eros arent nearly a large enough group to get a match actually he would need a tissue donor registry like for bone marrow transplant networks list people who need organs not people who want to donate them and drivers license computers might list organ donors but not any of the medical information the killer needs so where would he find a group like that miles asked drewe shrugged a legitimate tissue donor network or directed donors listed with blood banks those are the only kinds of databases that would have the medical information hed need while miles pondered this drewe stared at me as if waiting for me to say something when i didnt she looked at miles and said weve got to tell the fbi to start checking tissue donor registries he looked at me clearly uncomfortable with the idea of contacting the fbi can we do it anonymously i asked her she sighed deeply then pulled her keys from her pocket and walked away she slammed the front door on her way out at my request miles agreed to compose a summary of drewes theory and sneak it into the quantico computer i suggested using an anonymous remailing service to send the message but miles thought the fbi could get at us through the operator if they tried hard enough later that day a running argument developed between us as to whether brahma was actually being taken in by lenz or whether he was making a fool of him id begun to notice what i thought was dry humor in maxwells conversations with lilith most of it was double entendre so subtle as to be arguable yet i believed it significant ever since miles pointed out the maxwells silver hammer and levon connections id felt brahma was toying with us not just lenz but everyone who had committed the hubris of stepping up to the plate against him miles on the other hand thought lenz was doing very well considering the time pressure he was under and pointed out that i had yet to draw brahma into a single online conversation to speed up this process he carried his laptop to the easy chair in the front room and during an encore showing of the thomas crown affair on ae hammered out a search program based on brahmas most common figures of speech he claimed it would locate brahma online regardless of the alias he was using and it did however it could not draw him into conversation with me the police surveillance of our house continued and by the third day cabin fever had set in miles insisted that my phones were tapped and it wasnt enough that he remain indoors he demanded that i check one window on each side of the house every half hour and also that i leave the house occasionally to create the appearance of normalcy i understood the necessity but it became a major pain to constantly jump up from my computer while he sat watching the poseidon adventure like some arabian potentate yet it was tougher on him than on me hed promised drewe that he would clear out at the first sign of trouble and i knew he meant it like a fireman or a fighter pilot he had to stay pumped enough to jump up from a dead sleep and race into the kitchen pantry for the trapdoor that led to the bomb shelter so it was almost a divine deliverance when at eleven pm on the third night the longawaited invitation from brahma arrived id been in the lobby of one of eross conference areas politely fending off notsopolite advances from a man calling himself billy pilgrim when a small window opened on my screen the words inside it read maxwell hello erin i notice that your conversations have a particular type of error pattern are you using a voicerecognition unit my heartbeat racing i tried to think clearly id debated whether or not to use the voicerecognition unit ultimately i decided that being able to speak my thoughts into the computer rather than type them was worth arousing whatever suspicion miless voicerec program might cause in brahma speaking as clearly as i could i said yes how did you know on the screen appeared erin yes how did you know there was a brief silence then three new lines of text appeared and the voice id selected for brahma said maxwell im quite familiar with such systems youre the first person ive seen using one on eros where did you come by it quality systems are prohibitively expensive miles had given me good ammunition for this question erin my husband is a physician hes using a new system that was designed for medical dictation a friend of his works for the company that designed it he put a version on our computer so we could try it out i like it i like having my hands free maxwell yes what company does this friend work for erin sorry its proprietary technology still in the testing stage hed go ballistic if i talked about it mostly because of the companys stock price maxwell i see would you like to join me in the blue room my heart thudded against my breastbone after saying yes i sent a rude kissoff to billy pilgrim then clicked my way into digital privacy with a man who had killed at least eight people and probably more brahma was waiting when i arrived maxwell ive been watching you you spurn attention as though it burns you what are you looking for i paused to compose myself during the long days of waiting id given much thought to how i would approach brahma in the end i knew i would have to fly purely on instinct but as with any new relationship my opening was critical erin something that doesnt exist maxwell what could that be erin a man with the soul of a woman maxwell there are many of those erin a man who has the soul of a woman but remains a man maxwell ah this is rarer why do you seek this erin im unfulfilled obviously maxwell man desires all things thus he is eternally unfulfilled erin but woman can be fulfilled maxwell i speak of man in the collective sense erin there is no collective sense that includes both man and woman they are poles of existence maxwell you speak wisely you have much experience erin is that a nice way of asking how old i am maxwell take it as you will erin i just passed my thirtieth birthday maxwell you are married erin yes maxwell your only marriage erin yes maxwell you have children erin a son maxwell there are problems erin not the usual sort maxwell you are sexually content erin no ive lost my passion for the physical maxwell but you once enjoyed it erin i lived by it the speakers fell silent then maxwell resumed his questioning maxwell why do you seek a man with the soul of a woman erin men dont understand me maxwell a common female complaint erin my problem is different from most men cant see me as i am maxwell how so erin i have the curse for which no one feels sympathy maxwell you are rich erin im not speaking of that i was speaking of beauty maxwell you are beautiful erin yes maxwell many say that here in this faceless environment they rub balm into their insecurities by playing at characters they are not erin my fantasies have nothing to do with appearance maxwell then perhaps you are what you say you are erin you dont believe me you resist the idea that a physically beautiful woman has the intelligence to step outside herself long enough to analyze herself maxwell you assume too much i can accept that but it seems to me you share the problem of the wealthy womanno one ever looks past her money erin its not the same at all maxwell why not erin because physically beautiful people can become rich but most rich people can never become beautiful not with all the plastic surgery in the world maxwell i appreciate that distinction i understand it too well erin are you rich and unattractive maxwell you dont use much tact do you erin i dont have time for games maxwell nor do i i am rich in material things but im not at all unattractive erin is that your opinion maxwell one long confirmed by others but i understand your problem better than you might think erin how so maxwell i was born a genius erin really maxwell yes erin can you prove it maxwell can you prove you are beautiful erin i see what you mean maxwell actually i could prove my genius in this environment much easier than you could prove your beauty but what would be the point anything i wrote at that level you would not understand erin all right all right i believe you maxwell would you mind telling me whether you are fairskinned or dark erin i guess not in winter im fair in summer im brown maxwell your ancestry erin my ancestry french and english why maxwell mixed on both sides erin father scotsenglish blood mother cajun french maxwell ah an interesting roux erin interesting home life anyway maxwell what appeals to you about the female soul as you called it erin women understand that the past can be left behind men dont men are haunted by the past maxwell are you speaking of ones own past or the past of a mate erin either maxwell your husband does not allow you to forget your past erin correct maxwell you had many adventures erin many lovers maxwell from a young age erin fourteen maxwell the first was a man or a woman erin a man ive never felt drawn to womens bodies regrettably maxwell you enjoyed these many lovers or merely allowed them to take pleasure from you erin i learned to take my own pleasure early and to give it i felt no inhibition i shocked men made them afraid men fantasize about wanton women but when they meet one theyre paralyzed by fear maxwell can you elaborate erin men like easy women so long as they can mentally classify them as sluts or whores but a highly sexual woman who is beautiful who has her pick of males doesnt fit that puritanical equation and if she has intelligence as well she is feared and thus hated maxwell your point of view intrigues me erin the bitter fruit of experience maxwell you never found a man who gave you the understanding you needed erin i thought i had once but i was wrong maxwell who was he erin i dont have time to tell that story now in fact its later than i thought i need to log off i enjoyed our conversation goodbye maxwell please wait would you answer one question before you go erin if its quick maxwell you said you descended from french and english blood also that you tan in the summer from this i deduce that you are more dark than fair does the english trait show up elsewhere in your family very fair skin i mean brahmas interest in skin was starting to sound pathological i was about to answer based on erins dark complexion when something stopped me all of brahmas victims but onethe indian womanwere caucasian erin what an odd question as a matter of fact im not more dark than fair i have a sister with a peaches and cream complexion and im only a shade darker its just that i tan in the summer rather than burn its a nice bonus maxwell thank you erin goodbye maxwell au revoir you played that just right miles said from behind me the synthesized voices had drawn him from his throne in the den make an impression then vanish like the cheshire cat you should give lenz lessons time will tell where did you get that female soul stuff i dont know ive been trying to put myself inside erins head when he asked what i was looking for that seemed right it was perfect miles picked up the printouts and scanned them whats this youre ripping off hair color ads now in a terrible french accent he cooed dont hate me because im beautiful think about erin one thing overrides everything else her beauty its the central fact of her life it shaped her whole character but to herinsideit must be nothing you know i mean nothing and yet everything at the same time just like you being smart miles ran a hand over his flattop i was right about one thing anyway what you can do this youve got him going one conversation is nothing and you know it oh its something he likes you you mean he likes erin he gave me a sidelong glance if you say so what does that mean it means you can think what you want but erin andersoni mean grahamcouldnt have written that conversation if her life depended on it i mean she might feel those things but she could never express them just like you said she couldnt step outside herself and analyze her own feelings you dont know her that well miles shes a lot brighter than anyone ever gave her credit for i know her better than you think what does that mean he put down the printouts and looked away nothing im talking out of my ass i grabbed his sleeve dont try to crawfish on that line you said you saw her in new york is this something to do with that he studied the floor for several moments then he looked up his blue eyes flat with defiance look i fucked her okay my train of thought momentarily derailed i knew erin had been promiscuous but this was a shock when was this in new york yeah let go of my arm he tried to pull away but i squeezed tighter at the same time recalling what lenz said about miles battering some guy outside a gay bar with martial arts but the rigidity went out of him and he broke eye contact again it was just one time okay erin showed up at this party i was at in the village she was with this singer a real asshole she was high but he was almost comatose she said hello to me then walked away about an hour later she came back and asked if i could give her a ride she didnt want to go back to their hotel we ended up at my place and and what man you want gory details yes he took a deep breath then blew it out in one hard rush we talked for a long time she told me shed always thought i was gay i was sorry id asked the question but too late miles was reliving the moment if anyone else from home had suggested that id have flipped out brained them but not her she was so frank about it she wasnt judgmental at all just interested we talked about it for a while and then she made love to me it was unbelievable harper she was everything id ever longed for in a woman and had never found miles no let me finish i think she sensed the pain i was in at that time and she was trying to heal me isnt that funny because she was twice as screwed up as i was her whole life has been a tragedy if you ask me but that was her nature i could tell she was whatever people needed as if through her they could move to some better place you know what i mean yes god knows what kind of degrading crap she put up with from assholes like that singer and she just left you after that the next morning she woke up looking like an angel that had crashlanded in my apartment by mistake she called a cab kissed me on the forehead and disappeared from my life forever i shook my head in wonder thats why i knew that female soul stuff was right on thats her man thats what she needs she told you that not in those words like i said she was i dont know emotionally farsighted maybe she could see other peoples problems clearly but couldnt focus on her own thats her all right he smiled with compassion i wont ask where you got your insights it was different with us but not too different its like a dream sequence in the middle of my life and it never goes away not completely no thats why you picked her isnt it what do you mean because shes haunting tragic she has this unresolvable tension she pulls men like a force of gravity after this strange moment of communion miles picked up the transcripts and shuffled through them printers low on toner he said holding up a sheet with letters so faint i could barely read them got another cartridge no we can take the cartridge from the printer on your gateway good thing theyre both laserjets we dont have to i told him glad to be able to hide my awkwardness in a mechanical task i walked to a shelf and took down a tall white plastic bottle whats that he asked toner yep you refill your own cartridges out here in the boonies its the only way to fly isnt it a pain i shook my head with miles staring in rapt attention i removed and partially disassembled the wedgeshaped toner cartridge from the hewlettpackard printer with a tool called a screwstarter then so as not to end up looking like a coal miner after a cavein i very carefully removed the plug from the toner reservoir and refilled the empty space with the ultrafine black powder that constitutes the ink of a laser printer thats it miles asked i replugged the reservoir and replaced the cartridge cover ready to go as i reloaded the cartridge into the printer he pretended to write a note on his palm and said a new job for my assistants but the fallout from his earlier revelation still hung in the air like ozone after a lightning strike i walked over to my minifridge and took out a tab why dont you scan for brahma he suggested i doubt hes still on youre the one who broke contact no reason to think hes closed up shop using miless search program it took less than a minute to locate maxwell in another private room there true to his habits of the past three days he was conversing with lilith again the voices confirmed my suspicion there was a lot more information flowing from dr lenz to brahma than the other way around lenzs plan isnt working i said over my shoulder why do you say that because hes not learning a damn thing about brahma hes not supposed to is he hes just laying out bait hoping to provoke brahma to come after him but he is trying to find out things in between his neogothic revelations anyway listen to him the stuff he spews out makes deliverance look like a disney film miles shrugged as if to say what can i do about it i half listened to lilith for a minute but my mind was elsewhere hows your trojan horse coming its got tendinitis miles said sullenly what ill get there you going to tell me how it works until you get brahma heated up it doesnt really matter does it i was about to tell him to kiss off when he sighed an apology look itll work or it wont okay lets take a break i held up my hands for a truce in the background liliths voice droned on dredging up dark sexual secrets from her past and clumsilyto my ear at leastpressing maxwell to respond in kind brahma tolerated the probes with uncharacteristic docility but he refused to be drawn out as the conversation progressed i could not escape the feeling that dr lenz was greedily reeling in not valuable information but rope just enough to hang himself chapter last night i dreamed of erin making love to miles my memory is a traitor that way the images id most like to wipe away cling to life with the tenacity of weeds while those i want to treasure fade like the blush on a rose this morning drewe left before i woke up i fought to stay asleep while miles fixed himself an omelette and commandeered the television in the den but it was no use he had me checking windows and trolling eros before i could even get a bowl of cereal brahma logged on as maxwell early but when lilith started into one of her long monologues he cut the conversation short and logged off miles wandered in and did some coding at his laptop then drifted back to the tv after watching cnn for a while i walked into the backyard to verify that the tomatoes in our garden were as scorched as theyd been last week they were then i walked around front and stared up the highway long enough to make sure deputy billy was at his post he was about tenthirty i logged back onto eros as sysop i didnt expect much morning traffic is mostly level one stuff medical questions or lonely hearts looking for a shoulder to cry on a quick cruise through level two also showed what i expected softcore exchanges involving roguish dukes and hardwon ladies which i knew from long experience were frequently two women taking opposite sides of a romantic fantasy then i clicked into level three the lobbies were mostly empty out of curiosity i peeked into some private rooms most of it was gay actionmen in some rooms women in othersplus a few dominance sessions then in a gossip lobby i rarely visited i found some people discussing the murder of karin wheat they were obviously fans and speculation about who had killed the author ranged from her jealous and grossly overweight exhusband to a crazed fan who lost sight of the line between fact and fiction meaning to join the conversation i logged in as erin ten seconds later a window appeared in the center of my screen in it was a prompt followed by single line of text which eross voice duly read prometheus would you like to join me in the blue room my skin went cold i sat paralyzed for a moment then i looked at the window on the left of my screen which listed the code names of everyone in the lobby sure enough prometheus was there i had got so used to looking at maxwell that this older alias of brahmas had slipped right by me yanking off the headset i sealed its mike shut with my thumb and shouted miles get your ass in here then i put the headset back on said yes into the mike and clicked into the blue room instantaneously these words appeared maxwell ive been waiting for you even as i heard miless feet pounding the floor i answered into the mike and watched my words appear onscreen erin i think were about to be interrupted by someone who calls himself prometheus miles was standing beside me by then hit the space bar if you want to tell me something he whispered in my ear it mutes the mike maxwell i am prometheus erin i use many names but prometheus fits me in many ways erin why use maxwell if you like prometheus so much maxwell maxwell has its own significance i was tempted to ask him about the beatles reference but instead i pressed the space bar and said miles this guy say something to him miles snapped popping me on the shoulder i fired an elbow into his leg and held down the space bar listen goddamn it i just figured something out what i logged on first as sysop not erin and he didnt see me spying on the lobby he was in it was only when i switched to erin that he noticed me maxwell are you there erin he wasnt aware you were lurking as sysop exactly that means he probably doesnt have sysop access himself i know now get out of here i need quiet remember the trojan horse miles said walking backward make him want you then he stepped out of the office and closed the door behind him brahmas voice pulled my attention back to the screen maxwell erin erin sorry the newspaper man came to my door maxwell ah you follow current events erin no the obituaries this was true twice during our interlude in chicago erin sat in bed reading the tribune obits aloud and making up outrageous stories that supposedly lay behind the sanitized life summaries of the rich and prominent maxwell the obituaries erin im eccentric maxwell you are interested in the death of karin wheat erin i barely even saw what they were talking about before you invited me here it does seem interesting though her death sounded so gory maxwell im sure that was exaggerated the press makes its money pandering the prurient and the morbid i was hoping we could continue last nights conversation erin im tired of the mental sparring on this network its all so juvenile maxwell what do you want from eros erin i told you im looking for someone maxwell the man with the soul of a woman erin thats what i called it last night its nothing that definite its just a yearning i have maxwell do you mean you wish to find this person and then meet him in real life erin why not maxwell most are afraid to transmit real information about themselves over the net it may be a wise precaution the world is full of disturbed individuals erin im pragmatic about that kind of thing i figure when my times up theres nothing i can do about it anyway until then enjoy maxwell you believe in predestination erin no fate maxwell whats the difference erin not sure maybe its one of degree with predestination everythings laid out from square one with fate those ladies are up there weaving but you have a certain amount of power to tangle the threads maxwell yes and death erin well i mean you have some power to tangle but the length of the thread is predetermined from the start maxwell how interesting you know mythology erin a nodding acquaintance you maxwell all life is myth when viewed from the proper perspective erin whatever you say youre supposed to be the genius maxwell please forget that a little fillip of ego in our last conversation you spoke of having no inhibitions as though you have no shame erin i have shame maxwell of what act in your life are you most ashamed déjà vu prickled across my neck and arms for a moment i saw arthur lenz sitting at his computer in virginia pretending to be maxwell as easily as he pretended to be lilith then i remembered that lenz had used the same shrink routine on brahma brahma could merely be echoing the psychiatrists questions with me consciously or not maybe lenz provoked more of a response in him than i thought erin would you answer the same question coming from me maxwell yes i have never committed an act for which i felt regret all life is exploration thus all acts are justified erin i dont agree with that maxwell ah you believe in sin erin i dont know about that but there are certainly wrong choices maxwell no only poor choices and only from a given perspective erin but isnt the idea of sin one of the oldest creations of mankind it was there in greek mythology just as much as in the bible maxwell you answered your own question sin is a creation of mans intellect a herculean effort to explain the eternal condition of sorrow in which he has found himself from the dawn of time look at oedipus the poor lad did all he could to avoid sin yet ended up killing his father and sleeping with his mother murder and incest all to illustrate the inevitability of mans fate the same with job nothing was his fault it was god having a wager with satan erin no mortal act deserves punishment maxwell thats a different question sin occurs in relation to god not man look at prometheus he ridiculed the gods and their power and he acted accordingly he stole divine fire and gave it to man as a gift he sinned against the gods but blessed man forever erin and look what happened to him chained to a rock with his liver eaten by eagles for thirty years and the liver grew back each night maxwell a nodding acquaintance indeed but remember after paying that price prometheus was taken up to olympus where he resided forever among the gods erin does that have something to do with why you use the name prometheus maxwell just so heroic men must often endure a period of suffering or darkness before their work is recognized erin you sound bitter maxwell im tired of dealing with squalid little souls i yearn for a society of ahabs but inhabit a world of walter mittys erin now you sound like some kind of superrace nut maxwell i have my moments do you know nietzsches quote about society a people is a detour of nature to get six or seven great men erin yes but thats not the whole quote the rest is yes and then to get around them or something like that maxwell you amaze me erin sometimes i amaze myself i suppose youre one of the six or seven maxwell only time will tell erin i suppose women dont fit into that equation of greatness maxwell of course they do women are the gateway of the absolute from an evolutionary perspective as critical as the male they provide half the genetic code erin what do you mean the gateway of the absolute maxwell you have a child a son i believe did you deliver vaginally erin yes maxwell did you not feel when your cervix dilated and the cramps exploded in your belly and your anal sphincter let go and the pain was like a scaly hand ripping you apart that you had been possessedhijacked if you willby something infinitely larger than yourself erin dont remind me but the answer is yes it was like i dont know maxwell that was life erin life seizing every cell in your body and bending you to its singlepurposed will life is violent and uncontrollable and indescribably beautiful dont you sometimes walk naked into the nurturing sun and scream i am alive erin im not usually that demonstrative about it maxwell you should be life is everything erin you dont believe in an afterlife maxwell you do erin no i told you about the thread remember when the thread runs out its over i just wanted to know what you thought maxwell for a moment i thought we had gone as far as we could go erin are you married maxwell no erin ever been maxwell no erin how old are you maxwell how old would you guess erin if youve really never been married you must be young or gay maxwell i am not gay i defy nature in far more profound ways than that how old a man are you looking for erin age doesnt matter maxwell not in the man you are right but the woman must be of childbearing age erin youre a real sexist arent you maxwell a darwinian sexist perhaps what do you visualize happening with this man you seek you already have a son do you see yourself abandoning him for this man erin i dont want to talk about that maxwell your family erin my son i dont mind talking about my husband maxwell why the selective affection erin its something to do with what we discussed before maxwell sin erin being ashamed having regrets maxwell you are ashamed of your son you regret having him erin no only the way he was conceived i guess you could say he was conceived in sin maxwell through an adulterous relationship erin not exactly worse really maxwell i dont understand erin its something to do with a sin you mentioned earlier maxwell i mentioned but what murder i didnt respond hed get it fast enough maxwell your son was conceived through incest erin not exactly its complicated maxwell but i must know erin ive said too much already maxwell but erin i can help you with this i have specialized knowledge we must explore this erin i need time to think maxwell of course yes i understand but we must speak again the soonest possible time for me would be late tonight possibly very early tomorrow morning is either of these times good for you erin maybe if im online ill check the blue room you can find me there maxwell and if not erin well leave it to fate maxwell how very appropriate erin goodbye maxwell yes goodbye after a giddy few moments staring at the screen i called miles back into the office he snatched up the printouts of the conversation and read them with stunning speed youve hooked him he announced setting down the pages you know brahma sounds a long way from crazy to me i feel exactly like he does sometimes i took off the headset and pushed back from the computer our conversations dont have quite the same feel as his conversations with the other victims i cant put my finger on why i know i dont think hes looking at you as a potential victim a donor or whatever hes interested in some other way just keep stringing him along by tomorrow i should be finished with the trojan horse and well be ready for phase two you sound like a bad movie he grinned i like bad movies that exchange happened four hours ago since then miles has been coding more or less steadily he seems to have scented the finish line and only stops for fresh mountain dew now and then hell shout something like fmhwhich he explained was a polite form of fuck me hardera hacker curse usually directed at some particularly annoying piece of software that refuses to behave as it should in this case his trojan horse ive read half a paperback novel cleaned up the kitchen and driven to yazoo city and back all in an attempt to keep my nerves steady knowing that the man we call brahma is looking forward to his next conversation with me is more than a little unsettling this connection is what i set out to establish but now that i have all i want is for miles to finish his trojan horse so we can get the whole thing over with around fivethirty it strikes me that drewe might like it if i whipped up some dinner before she gets home she might like it a lot i have a vision of fresh tomatoes from our garden then remember the heatshriveled specimens i saw this morning without intravenous therapy theyll never be fit for a dinner table as usual its too late to thaw anything out i am nearly reconciled to tuna on toast when miles walks into the kitchen with his laptop and says why dont you fire up the search engine i start to remind him that brahma said he wouldnt be back online until late tonight but arguing with miles is useless i expel the air from my lungs with a disgusted plosive walk back into the office and sit down at the eros computer the search program begins its monotonous task with an efficient clicking of the hard drive searching for brahmas prose patterns takes much longer than a search for an account name after a few distracted minutes of playing guitar on my bed i look over at the computer the monitor shows the screen format of a private room the prompt at the top of the page reads maxwell the answering prompt reads lilith first i yell for miles then i rehang my guitar on the wall and sit down before the eros computer he lied to me i say when miles comes in hes back on hes talking to lenz again i thought he might same old shit from lenz freud dispensed at the level of sally jessy raphael looks like it want me to turn up the sound nah he sits on the bed and opens his laptop as i skim the usual purple prose a wave of heat suffuses my face my eyes have locked onto one passage like a laser sight maxwell i understand too well the majority of men are asshoels i reread the text above this line but everything looks normal then this appears maxwell weve discussed hiv in abstract terms but weve neveer asked each other the one iportant question i try to yell miles but my voice comes out a whisper you say something he asks typos look at this in seconds hes reading the screen over my shoulder he keeps making them i murmur hes not using his voice recognition unit miles grips my shoulder hes on the move my chest feels hollow lenz knows that right got to the fbi agents at eros probably saw the typos before you did scroll back up ill bet hes been making errors during the whole exchange i scroll through the previous lines and verify that miles is correct okay i say trying to calm down okay they must have seen that too many to miss damnmiles says softly lenz pulled it off ill bet an fbi swat team is greasing its guns right now brahma goes mobile two or three days before a kill i remind him based on his error rate and the old murder dates anyway reconnaissance says miles hes out there right now using a laptop and a cellular i wonder how close he is to that safe house im calling lenz i decide aloud why the fbis gearing up to slam this guy down right now miles runs one hand over his still ridiculous crewcut you know nows the time to trace him why because hes on a cellular and we know where hes headed im calling the safe house miles go ahead but theyre just going to blow you off fine scrounging in my wallet for the number lenz gave me i find it and drop it by the phone my call is answered on the second ring yes says a female voice this is harper cole i need to talk to dr lenz you shouldnt have called here i need to make sure he knows something important he knows harper this is margie ressler margie the decoy is everything okay yes but we cant tie up this line right now ive got to tell lenz about something about the errors you know about that everythings under control really take it easy relief washes over me okay i just wanted to make sure you guys werent going to be surprised were the fbi harper were not going to be surprised her voice goes quiet youd better keep your eyes open though did you or miles turner send email to mr baxter warning him to check tissue donor networks margie i stop unwilling to implicate myself on a phone that might be tapped as if reading my mind she says all im going to tell you is that the shit hit the fan after they started checking youd better watch your butt thanks and youd better take your own advice he wont come tonight not if the records any indication suddenly i hear a babble of male voices sir margie answers like a boot camp recruit the phone goes dead in my hand well asks miles back on the bed now they know he gives me his dour itoldyouso look she also said they got your note about transplant networks now hes paying attention she said the shit hit the fan when they started checking miles ponders this for a few seconds then drewe must be right there must be another missing woman jesus what are we going to do he takes a deep breath looks at the floor for a few seconds then says im going to code until seven which is when tbs is showing i walk the line with gregory peck and tuesday weld youre kidding nope i love tuesday weld did you see wholl stop the rain from robert stones book even nolte was great in that miles tuesday weld should have played holly golightly in breakfast at tiffanys not audrey hepburn even capote said that of course he said a young tuesday weld with her we wouldnt have gotten that bullshit hollywood ending holly would have miles he looks up irritably what dont you care what happens at the safe house of course but its not in my power to affect the outcome isnt there some way to at least monitor the action hack into a bureau computer or something harper a stakeout is just some guys on the radio theyre probably not even talking a whole lot so theres no computer angle to it baxter will want to be there for the collar so hes probably at the safe house already or else on his way nothing will have to be relayed to him ergo we cant intercept anything digital what about radio then miles laughs we cant monitor police radio from a thousand miles away why not because its analog man radio waves that die after a few miles smugness is one of my pet peeves at times like this i want to smack miles on the side of the head and somewhere between staring at his arrogant expression and clenching my right fist a solution arcs through my brain like a roman candle as miles stares i sit down at my gateway and switch on my modem what are you doing he asks logging onto compuserve why to eavesdrop on the stakeout how i click the mouse rapidly by talking somebody local into doing it for us whos going to do that ever hear of ham radio it takes less than five seconds for miles to see where im going but ham radio is a totally different frequency spectrum than law enforcement stuff he says i dont even respond i know hes kicking himself for not thinking of this first ham operators hang out on compuserve he asks getting up and looking over my shoulder either here or aol one of my neighbors is a ham nut hes mentioned a forum before and i think its on compuserve im doing a find for the word radio suddenly a neat column of words appears on my screen broadcast professionals cb handle ce audio forum hamnet forum iquest national public radio ha you see that hamnet miles says thats it lets see seconds later were staring at the multicolored logo of a computer forum dedicated exclusively to the arcane joys of ham radio i click the mouse and topic headings like amateur satellites swap shop utility dxing and hardwarehomebrew appear miles i guarantee you some of these guys are into a lot more than ham radio that tom swift crap with cigar boxes full of vacuum tubes is history these guys are high tech now a couple of old hackers at mit were into ham he says and i sense how badly he wants to move me out of the chair and take over this job the only question i muse is will somebody with the right equipment be close enough to mclean virginia to do it definitely miles says excitedly mcleans the dc metro area not far from langley bound to be somebody there ill bet some of these guys have wet dreams about intercepting cia and fbi communications i dont know i say reading the screen more closely look at some of these topics fcc compliance and proper certification maybe theyre not into that kind of stuff why dont you let me talk to them miles suggests standing so close that i feel uncomfortable its all yours i tell him rising from the chair he sits and immediately begins composing a forum message we just have to approach it right im not a federal fugitive im a reporter for the times picayune so are you he pauses thinking we just got a tip about a rogue fbi operation in dc it might even involve the atf how does that sound like another bad movie he laughs this is great man within two hours well have realtime coverage of lenzs little trap right through your telephone just like two tin cans on a thousandmile string what if my phones really tapped oh yeah he says his brow furrowing well ill just have to figure something out the bang of the front door catapults miles out of his seat and to the nearest window go check he commands harper its me drewe i reassure him its just drewe he steps away from the window and leans against the wall one hand over his heart this is major stress man what did i do to deserve this i wont answer that i start toward the door id better fix us some supper the office door opens before i reach it drewe stands in the hall holding a large brown paper bag she is smiling and her radiance gives me an unexpected lift yet it is plain that she does not intend to cross the threshold instead she reaches into the bag and pulls out a paper box printed with red curlicues and an alarmingly orange fluid dribbling down its side chinese she says i figured we were due for a change you are a goddess miles says with genuine reverence i shall kiss your feet and worship forever at the altar of your infinite kindness drewe laughs just chew with your mouth closed and ill be satisfied as she walks away miles sits back down at the gateway you coming i ask he waves one hand just let me post this message be right there as i pass through the door i hear him say this is going to be better than sex this from a man who has seen heard and perhaps participated in just about every carnal activity the human mind can imagine i turn and look back it is the new sight for this century i think a man in digital bliss and yet it is as old as the first hominid who stared mesmerized into a campfire we are fascinated by that which can destroy us chapter miles beat his own prediction by over an hour by the time we finished supper three ham radio operators in the washington dc area expressed interest in helping us monitor the communications of the fbi in the interest of the publics hallowed right to know of course one of thesean exmarine named sid moroneyadmitted that he often monitored cia training exercises on the streets of washington and its suburbs and boasted that he maintained a notebook containing the frequencies most commonly used by the governments more aggressive acronymic agencies this resource put him over the top and miles told him we would email our requirements to him asap we spent fifteen minutes arguing about the best way for moroney to relay what he overheard to us we wanted it in real time but we also knew my phones might be tapped we decided i would stay linked to sid moroney via compuserve on the gateway while miles monitored the eros computer for any lilithmaxwell activity sid could update me on the stakeout by tapping messages into a private room on a compuserve chat channel if anything radical started to happen he was to call my office number and press the mouthpiece of his telephone to his radio receiver so that we could hear the traffic ourselves this was a risk but miles figured anything serious enough to warrant a call would probably be the climax of the manhuntwhich would exonerate us both so far the wait has been anything but climactic moroney has intercepted communications indicating a stakeout in progress in the vicinity of the mclean safe house so far ive received six reports from him via compuserve transcribing such bloodcurdling radio traffic as alpha red here kensington quiet ten four red yellow you there affirmative alpha wimbledon clear tomorrow must be garbage pickup everybodys coming out in their robes to put out the cans button it yellow out and so on for the past three and a half hours the use of alpha reminds me of daniel baxter in the trailer at quantico but since i cant hear the voice theres no way to tell this time i let drewe in on what we were doing since clearing our names seemed possible but when eleven pm came and went she raised a white flag and retired to the bedroom i worried that moroney would get bored and do the same but after a few queries i found out he keeps a cot in his radio room and like a good marine has developed the capacity to detect significant radio traffic even while sleeping i am half asleep myself when the balloon goes up miles sitting six feet behind me at the eros computer says hello as i turn in my seat before the gateway he raises his hand forbidding any interruption brahma just logged on he says in a monotone hes using maxwell whats he doing i ask rubbing my eyes and straightening up in my chair looking for lilith where his shoulders stiffen lenz is there now theyre going into a private room im turning up the sound brahmas digital baritone fills the office with an almost calming cadence what about his error rate i ask im looking three typos already hes definitely not using his voicerec unit miles adjusts the speakers then looks over at me already this conversation seems different from the ones weve become used to this time brahma is taking the lead is lenz showing a little restraint at last i ask looks like it i guess we wait now we dont wait long in less than five minutes a message from sid moroney flashes onto the screen of the gateway just heard some fast chatter this is alpha all units be advised we have a cellular trace on the unsub hes definitely in the washington metro area hes using a rented phone were holding off on a pinpoint trace but unsub is close by look sharp miles the fbi is trying to trace him now when he doesnt respond i turn hes listening closely to lenz and brahma baxter was supposed to give lenz a week without trying to trace brahma i remind him why do it now and risk blowing the whole operation momentum miles replies not bothering to turn this is like any big business deal at first everybodys loveydovey but when closing time comes major egos are involved the fbi knows brahma is close theyve got the capability to trace him therefore they trace him its not even a question moroney says theyre holding off on a pinpoint trace whatever that means brahmas probably moving between cells and they dont want to put out scanning vehicles for fear of spooking him but why not just stop his car and arrest him if they can find him at last miles turns to me his look contemptuous arrest him for what riding around with a laptop computer and a cell phone and typing sex talk couldnt they backtrack over his movements compare them to the murder dates stuff like that why risk him getting away theres no reason to think hell try hes following an established pattern hell shadow the decoy agent for two or three days then make his move on the house right i say unconvinced suddenly the speakers fall silent miles checks his screen brahma just logged off shit you think he found out they were trying to trace him maybe hes got guts this guy i wonder if he might actually try to hit her the first night thats the feeling i have miles dont ask me why like somethings wrong really wrong like what what could be wrong i think brahmas about to make a fool out of everybody hes been three steps ahead of us all the way why should he act like an idiot now why walk into a trap tell me i dont know damn it miles looks thoughtful okay say youre right how could he make a fool out of everybody i dont know my mind is fuzzy with anxiety and fatigue by doing the unexpected and whats that maybe he knows lilith is a trap but hes figured a way to kill the decoy anyway you know the girl i told you about margie ressler harper right this second a dozen swat guys are perched in trees and on rooftops around that safe house they can shoot the balls off a hamster at five hundred yards and the range is probably less than forty if brahma shows up there hes dog meat but brahma doesnt think like other people remember dallas he wont walk up with a target painted on his shirt they wont even see him or if they do theyll think they know who he is one of them maybe hell do his thing and split before they even know what hit them miles bites his lower lip shit he says finally miles what what if brahmas not even going there what if hes after someone else like who eleanor rigby thats nuts she lives in california we know brahmas in dc or virginia no we dont we know somebodys in dc or virginia logging on as maxwell remember the teamoffender theory if theres really a group behind this brahma himself could be anywhere he could be in california right now he could be here man miles shakes his head calm down he has no idea this place exists and why in gods name would he pick eleanor rigby out of thousands not thousands six hundred shes a blinddraft account remember the odds are still ridiculous give me one shred of logic maxwells silver hammer remember a beatles song and shes eleanor rigby theres death in that song too wouldnt he gravitate to that miles purses his lips in concentration maybe is there some central data bank where all eros conversations are stored an archive or something i know you told the fbi there wasnt but theres a sixtyday record every word is automatically filed to disk for sixty days then its erased we do it for legal protection in case of things like crimes against children ricocheting back on us one of my techs handles it i want you to check it right now why to find out whether brahma has talked to eleanor recently but if you dont im going to call eleanor myself and thats the first step to the whole story coming out he clicks angrily at his mouse then types a brief email message and transmits it to new york i told them it was urgent but it might take a while thank you we sit in uncomfortable silence for a few minutes i watch the screen of the gateway but sid moroney sends nothing through here we go miles says eleanor rigby spoke to maxwell in a private room three days ago the conversation lasted eight minutes you want me to get the text from them my heart is in my throat as i pick up the phone hey what are you doing miles asks warning eleanor lets at least look at the file first forget it eleanors line is busy i set down the phone an image of a lonely young woman in a wheelchair burning behind my closed eyes busy i say quietly thank god that would have started a networkwide panic i slap the desk with my right hand like i give a shit okay were talking about life and death here i dont care if the whole goddamn company implodes everybody will just have to go back to using magazines to jack off miles looks at me like a scientist observing some rare protozoan then blinks and goes back to his screen when i turn back to mine i find a message from sid moroney awaiting my attention just picked up a secondary frequency in the area could be another stakeout dea or local cops but i dont think so its scrambled i also heard a couple of references to gamma team on the primary frequency no gamma before that what are all these guys waiting for could it be a dangerous fugitive or something like that without consulting miles i type a quick confirmation that the subject of this stakeout could be very dangerous by the time miles asks what i typed ive sent the message by the time i finish explaining the situation ive received a reply from moroney my guess is that the scrambled freq is being used by a sniper team thats gamma team a regular stakeout doesnt mean much to eavesdroppers in this city but people talking about lines of fire rules of engagement and stuff like that would have a tv truck over here like lightning thats why its scrambled im working on unscrambling it but the odds are one in a million this is heavy stuff guys thanks for the invite my pulse has settled into a rhythm far above its normal rate you were right miles theyve got sharpshooters up there can moroney hear what theyre saying no its scrambled he shakes his head obviously disgusted thats about what id expect from the fbi what do you mean using encrypted radio traffic around the safe house is stupid you think brahma wont have scanning equipment scrambled chatter is like a neon sign screaming cops what choice do they have radio silence or they could use fake radio chatter like theyve got a drug bust set up near there should we try to warn them way too late we stare at each other in silence then a familiar male voice floats out of the speakers and the printer behind miles begins humming brahmas back he says turning same room by the time brahma finishes his first sentence miles and i have frozen like ice sculptures maxwell greetings dr lenz id actually planned a more dramatic revelation than this but now it seems juvenile after dallas i warned your agency not to interfere with my work yet you persisted by putting my life at risk you implicitly risked your own and also those under your protection learning ones limitations is always a painful lesson but it is only through pain that we grow perhaps now you will understand that some lawbreakers are best left alone besides considering what you were forced to endure each night in the name of love perhaps i did you a favor we shall not speak again my condolences in advance he killed somebody miles says in a flat voice right now somebody close to lenz is dead or dying my hands are shaking before i can speak my office line rings dont answer it miles commands its moroney i reply in a hoarse whisper the machinell get it i steel myself against dreadful news after my outgoing message ends a voice says hello guys guys this is sid all hells breaking loose up here i am rooted where i sit but miles reaches the phone in three lightning strides keep talking sid whats happening im going to hold the phone to the radio staticfilled radio chatter bursts from the tinny speaker of my answering machine alpha what the hell whats going on in there more static then stand by green standshit stop him ressler goddamn it thats baxter i cry i recognize his voice alpha is daniel baxter the first voice comes back alpha weve got a guy running down the walk waithes turning back for the garage then a new voice eerily calm alpha this is gamma leader i have a male adult in my scope looks like your shrink the voices merge into a babel of confusion all units this is alpha thats dr lenz outside repeat friendly personnel outside the house what the hells going on sir uncertain green hes in the acura alpha hes burning rubber out of the driveway please advise green follow the doctor but do not attempt to apprehend gamma leader this is alpha i am standing on the sidewalk stand down until the car is clear then converge on the house and secure it green dont let the doctor hurt himself we dont know whats happening roger alpha in pursuit hes turning onto dolley madison yellow here alpha what about the unsub contact too brief yellow no useful bearings unsub could be anywhere stay sharp green stick to the doctors tail were there alpha turning onto chain bridge road a flurry of street names fills the airwaves does lenz have any kids miles asks yes im still too stunned to move a son i think he said where does he live i dont know its not the kid though who is it its his wife miles looks at me how do you know that when i was up there we stopped off at lenzs house for a few minutes so he could get some papers and clothes she actually hit on me while lenz was upstairs and shes a bad drunk thats what the end of brahmas message was about christ where does she live ten minutes from the safe house thats why lenz chose that location the disjointed radio chatter is suddenly interrupted by sid moroneys voice you guys got any idea what the hells going on up here no miles says into the phone his eyes still on me i got traffic on the regular police band they just dispatched two patrol units to an address not far from the stakeout that anything to do with us could be says miles dont hang up sid you kidding im putting the phone back to the receiver ill give you whichever channels have the most traffic the ensuing chatter tells a simple story of pursuit very like an episode of cops but for the profanity of the fbi agents attempting to stay up with the racing acura after four minutes by my watch we hear the denouement hes stopping alpha sixfifteen whitehall repeat sixfifteen whitehall large residential house the doc just parked in a closed garage we have fairfax county blueandwhites arriving at the scene what do you want us to do green this is alpha im en route now get inside that house one of you follow dr lenz the other tell the locals whats what move it understood green make sure the locals know lenz is a white hat whoever goes in the house give me playbyplay ill take over when i get there alpha this is green im in the garage im ahead of the police its dark my weapon is out im moving through a slightly open door its a laundry room no sign of anybody wait alpha somebodys yelling screaming i think its a man i have a man screaminghowling really he oh sweet jesus oh my god we got a body here sir we have a female down shesjesus shes on a kitchen table shes naked the doctors giving her cpr but i think shes dead dan shes got to be dead because herher head jesus ive never seen one this bad terminate contactsnaps a rigidly composed voice ill be at the scene in less than a minute is that understood is that understood understood sir sorry i lost my head green out theres another long burst of static then sid moroneys voice drifts through my office in a hushed interrogative you guys heard that miles doesnt answer guys hey somebody just got wasted a lady just got wasted i uh wasnt expecting that i think maybe you guys better tell me whats going on huh miles shakes his head and puts his mouth to the telephone we didnt expect it either sid we knew it was serious but nothing like this dont worry youre not in trouble the hell im not ive already broken about fifteen statutes that i know of now what the hell is this about you guys really working for a newspaper or what yes sid the times picayune out of new orleans you can call the office and check us out but please tell me first whats happening on the radio after a moment moroney says nothing on the fbi channel i got some mclean pd stuff theyre reporting a oneeightysevena homicideat sixfifteen whitehall did they mention a name they dont do that on the radio female caucasian is all theyve alerted paramedics some patrolmans asking for brass on the scene complaining about the fbi and um uh i think thats about it for me guys next time call somebody else okay thanks for your assistance mr moroney miles says with overdone formality then he hangs up this is bad he says only now do i realize that miles was consciously disguising his voice on the phone adding the drawled southern rhythms he worked so hard to eradicate during the past few years bad i echo its a goddamn nightmare i meant the telephone call it wont be long before baxter finds out we were monitoring what happened you mean that i was we were using my phone i may have to split he says rocking in place like a nervous sprinter weve got to accelerate the plan what were out of this shit miles as of now what do you mean i mean no more games no more erin and maxwell you saw brahmas note to lenz hes knows exactly whats up just because he caught on to lenz doesnt mean he suspects you have you sensed a single false note in his communications with you i pause no but any subtle humor at your expense not yet but its totally different he believes in erin why is anybodys guess but he does miles youre missing the main point here and that scares me what main point how did brahma find lenz his mouth remains half open through the telephone system right miless brain is operating at a speed i cannot begin to comprehend i say nothing while he works out the possibilities finally he says unless new information on lenzs decoy plan was entered into fbi computers in the last thirtysix hours id have to say yes so he can trace us too miles stares at me without speaking his face masklike in its lack of humanity no he says at length if brahma checks the phone companys computers hell find the vicksburg address coupled with your line any other digital data he can turn up will verify that he cant check actual land ownership because in mississippi nothing like that is on computer and probably wont be for another fifty years something in miless tone makes me work through his answer step by step but it checks out lenzs problem was that he was at the physical address that went with his phone line not so with us miles pauses what i dont understand is how brahma knew lenz personally was behind lilith i mean he attacked lenzs wife not the safe house so maybe he did get his information from some fbi computer maybe somebody got careless were still out of it miles until tonight we were fooling around in a bad situation now its a forceten clusterfuck fate just tapped us on the shoulder you want to leave it to the socalled experts now he asks angrily you just saw their incompetence tragically demonstrated how many women are we going to watch die because were scared to take brahma to the wall its not our fight the hell it isnt you think tonight changed my situation for the better you couldnt have killed mrs lenz i can swear you were right beside me lets just come clean with them come clean a minute ago you threw the teamoffender theory up at me dont you see its going to be more popular than ever now why because unless brahma was transmitting his first message from lenzs home someone else killed his wife brahma knew the safe house was a trap he knew theyd be following his cellular so he drove around typing messages to lenz while someone else did his wife then he logged off swung back picked up the killer and was already out of town when he transmitted that final message as much as i want to argue the scenario makes sense miles rubs his eyes and walks over to my minifridge for a mountain dew do you realize what just happened a serial killer murdered the wife of an fbi agent lenz was a shrink not an agent you think that matters he was one of the stars of the investigative support unit and brahma already took out a hostage rescue team member were about to see one of the biggest manhunts in american history i feel a sudden urge to set the air conditioner at sixtyfive degrees climb into bed and sleep for twenty hours miles drains the mountain dew like a man dying of thirst if i turned myself in now id be asking for a legal reaming the likes of which hasnt been seen since sacco and vanzetti while i marshal my arguments he drops the empty can picks up the tv remote control aims it over my shoulder and switches on my office television what are you doing seeing whats on tv what my times almost up harper he gazes past me surfing through channels at superhuman speed im going to find a movie thatll induce deep hack mode then lie down and finish my stupid trojan horse the email thing isnt going to work too short a time frame now i meant what i said miles im through with brahma i heard you suddenly a wide and placid smile soothes the lines from his face his eyes glaze with almost religious receptivity what is it i ask looking over my shoulder this gun for hire alan ladd and veronica lake ladds first big break and he was playing a killer its only been on a few minutes this is like the fourth scene film noir i thought you liked seventies trash im eclectic this is perfect were living noir right this second digital noir he gives me a bucktoothed imitation of humphrey bogart and for a moment i actually doubt his sanity but then he clicks off the halogen lamp sits on my bed with his back against the headboard and props his laptop on his thighs the blackandwhite light of the television flickers over his features like shadows of clouds on the face of a cliff whatever anyone may think of miles turner he is a man doing what he was born to do not many of us can say that ill sleep on the couch in the den i tell him he nods slightly or perhaps not at all in miless universe i am already running in a minimized format chapter harper wake up huh wake up my eyelids are sealed shut with epoxy i rub my fists into them the first image that materializes is miless face hovering inches from my own in the dark i remember now im lying on the couch in the den miles shakes me again wake up a bolus of adrenaline sprays through my system bringing me into a sitting position are the cops here no come to the office i had a nightmare jesus whats going on miles is no longer there i rise and stumble toward the office noticing faint blue lines around the edges of the blinds i must have slept through the night the muted cyclone of drewes electric hair dryer whirs from the end of the hall as i pass across it and through the office door miles is seated before the eros computer youve got email he says from who look i rub my eyes again and peer at the screen to erin sender unavailable i must talk to you you know who i am i shall check the blue room every half hour by the clock it came in about two hours ago miles informs me i let you sleep as long as i could notice anything interesting no the momentum of the relationship has shifted brahmas desperate to talk to you so youve got to answer him a knock at the door lifts miles an inch off his seat were awake i call drewe opens the door and smiles shes dressed for work in dark slacks and a white liz claiborne blouse im having cereal for breakfast she says best i can do this morning you guys want any no thanks says miles trying to look nonchalant harper sounds good im starved i ignore miless angry expulsion of breath and follow drewe into the kitchen glancing at my watch as i go seventwenty am miles must have figured it would take ten minutes to convince me to answer brahmas message im definitely not going back into the office before seventhirty drewe pours two bowls of raisin bran and slices a navel orange into bright crescents i go straight for the coffeepot its community dark roast with chicory and i savor the kick you look rough drewe says you look like an ad for ivory snow thanks long night worse what happened i take another scalding sip of coffee and tell her about the tragedy in virginia i cant tell if shes stunned or furious or both after a long silence she says is miles in there trying to track this nut down i shrug hes got a few ideas unable to read her eyes i twirl the spoon in my cereal bowl the flakes are already soggy did miles tell the fbi to start checking tissue donor networks she asks yes and it looks like you were right theres probably another missing woman drewe puts down her spoon then its time to tell the fbi everything i have no answer but the truth i cant do it with miles here she gives me a pointed look that i have no trouble translating maybe thats our real problem maybe i should call them she says from my office tell them i came up with the whole transplant theory drewe she wraps both hands around her coffee cup and stares into it i know miles is our friend harper but its not fair to us she looks up jail is not my idea of a future i reach across the table and close my right hand around her left nor mine miles knows whats going on i just dont think he knows where to go ill talk to him she squeezes my hand then stands drewe enjoyed theorizing about the murders when they were a technical abstraction but she does not share miless moral ambivalence about duty taking a last swallow of coffee she smooths her slacks then bends and kisses me on the forehead if he tells the fbi everything he can stay as long as he wants to if not tell him i enjoyed seeing him ive got to go see you tonight she hurries out of the kitchen car keys jingling coach purse swinging from her shoulder when the front door bangs shut i put down my coffee and check my watch seven thirtytwo i take my time with the orange slices miles is sitting on the edge of the bed typing on his laptop he doesnt look up or speak so i take the initiative youre not going to try to talk me into answering brahma i answered for you his eyes never leave the screen i told him your husband hadnt left for work yet but youd be in the blue room at nine what he keeps typing i had thought he was coding but hes typing too rapidly for that you logged on as erin brahma didnt know the difference hes desperate to talk to you goddamn it miles this is dangerous its been dangerous ever since you called the police i always knew that it was you and drewe who saw it as some kind of mcmillan and wife episode i start to cuss him from hell to breakfast but i stop myself miles ive got to tell you something you ive got to tell you something he cuts in looking up from the computer at last i finished the trojan horse my mind goes blank you did after what happened last night i thought it was too late but once i saw brahmas message i knew what to do the hard part was a roar of motors and flying gravel drowns his voice before he resumes typing his fingers flying across the keyboard i leap to a window and peek around the blinds four yazoo county sheriffs cruisers have blocked my drive their doors are open and at least six uniformed men are rushing toward the porch its the cops miles is still typing like a madman when five fast knocks boom through the house get your ass into the bomb shelter i tell him keep your voice down he says calmly i need thirty seconds stall them theyll break the door down no they wont ill hide the disk where you can find it go on with a lump the size of a cue ball in my throat i walk slowly toward the front door in my sock feet sheriffs departmentshouts a voice open up im coming hang on a second thanking god for the scottish fortress mentality that kept my grandfather from putting windows in or around our front door i reach for the chain lock and jiggle it loudly gimme a sec chains stuck open up or we break it down as i jiggle the chain again i have a fleeting impression of something passing across the hall behind me praying it was miles i count slowly to five then unlatch the chain and open the door someone in a white polyester shirt shoves a piece of paper in my face and starts reciting legalese while three tan and brown uniforms push past me and fan out into the house before the voice stops another deputy goes by me then the plainclothes man who was reading shoves past and deputy billy climbs the steps to the porch he looks a little sheepish what the hells going on billy fbi thinks turners here youve had the house staked out for a week how could he be here hey we waited till your wife left okay thats better treatment than most people get this mollifies me a little but then i realize that common decency isnt what made them wait sheriff buckners scared of pissing off drewes father right billy gives me his worldly look bob anderson pulls a lot of weight in this state whos the guy who read the warrant sheriffs detective summoning as much indignation as possible i stalk into my office and shout well did you find him a stumpy redfaced deputy gives me an eatshit look and continues tearing out the contents of my closet a rumbling from overhead alarms me until i realize that somebody must be fighting his way through our attic with a flashlight an invasion of privacy that is its own punishment a muffled conference in the hall draws me to the door then sharp banging noises pull me across it to the den i want to laugh a gangly deputy is hammering his hand along the wall like a man searching for a stud in which to place a nail looking for secret passages i ask why dont you wait outside he says coldly because this is my property yeah bf deal i cant resist rattling his cage why dont you introduce yourself so i can be sure to get your name right when bob anderson asks me who was here his hand stops in midstroke he looks at me with naked hatred then continues his pounding albeit more softly got something shouts a deep voice from the kitchen a wolfs grin spreads across the deputys face i fight the insane urge to trip him as he bulls past me with one hand on the pistol grip of a nickelplated revolver in the kitchen my heart jumps in my chest three deputies have crowded up to the pantry door they have discovered either miles or the trapdoor leading to the bomb shelter whose is this asks the sheriffs detective rednosed and beagleeyed he steps out of the group holding a dark suit jacket it takes only a second to recognize the cashmere coat my father brought back from germany the one reproduced perfectly as a sculpture in my office well he says mine i confess still dazed that jacket hasnt been out of my closet in months sorta hot for a jacket today aint it as i meet his stare something else rises slowly into my line of sight gripped between the detectives tobaccostained thumb and forefinger is a inch floppy disk why or how this man zeroed in on this disk rather than the hundreds in my office i dont know but i have no doubt that he is brandishing the results of miless marathon of codingthe trojan horse what about this he asks shaking the disk in my face ill hide the disk where you can find it what about it i ask praying that hes smeared miless fingerprints beyond recognition whats on it i dont know whered you get it he looks at the deputies then back at me i feel more men squeezing in behind me but i dont break eye contact your pantrys a wreck he says cans all over the floor and the back door was open he nods through our laundry room toward the exterior door the jacket was on the floor by the door this disk was in the inside pocket my wife was mending it i tell him its old nothing but mending thread keeping it together a quick examination of the coat confirms my answer you cant buy nothing like this around here he says doggedly my dad bought it overseas when he was in the army someone behind me grunts as though serving in the army constituted some kind of subversive activity what about the disk i shrug ive got a million of them for all i know that ones been in that coat since last year says you bud the beagle eyes do not waver well find out soon enough whats on it we can find out right now says the lanky deputy i met in the den hes got computers out the ass in his bedroom leave em be says the detective his drooping eyes still on me sure you dont want to change your story the truth is id like nothing better but right now miles is either crouched in the dark tunnel beneath our house or snaking through the cotton fields on his belly dragging his briefcase and computer bag behind him he needs time i suggest you be careful with that coat i say mildly it has a lot of sentimental value the detective blinks then folds the coat over his arm and hands the disk to a deputy who slips it into a transparent plastic bag dont you worry sonny well take plenty good care of it he turns and walks through the laundry room and pulls open the back door i see more brown uniforms in the sunlight beyond him anybody make a break for it he calls nossir answers a chorus of voices windows or doors he sighs interminably les go boys he shoves roughly past me and plows through the deputies toward the hall my eyes track the cashmere coat until it disappears through the kitchen door when the front door finally bangs shut i take a slow walk through the house every closet door is open with shoes and boots and clothing strewn across the floors the attic door hangs down on sprung hinges heavy detroit engines rumble out front as i make my way back to the kitchen after checking to be sure the back door is shut and its curtain pulled i open the trapdoor in the pantry floor the odor of mildew and insecticide hits me in a wave miles no answer miles you down there nothing leaving the trapdoor raised i return to the back door and open it across our backyard stands the long open toolshed where my grandfather kept his tractor and plow and disc and hand tools the rusted brickandtin structure has fallen into ruin and now serves mostly as a picturesque prop for the huge fig trees that surround it miles could be hiding there but i doubt it the exterior entrance of the bomb shelter opens twenty feet beyond the shed in the field if miles came out there he would have crawled deeper into the enveloping cotton my gaze wanders across the dusty white sea already shimmering with heat at eight in the morning i half expect to see miles rise up like a scarecrow from the middle of the field but he doesnt maybe hes still hunched over his briefcase in a corner of the bomb shelter but at some level i know he is not he promised drewe that if the police came for him he would leave and not come back and miles keeps his word a movement at the far edge of the field catches my eye but when i try to focus it disappears miles it could just as easily have been a deer after locking the door i pour a cup of scorched coffee and sit at the kitchen table i can just see the proppedup trapdoor in the open pantry closet ill give miles another half hour before i close it as i sit drinking i ponder the mornings riddles why didnt the police confiscate my computers i can think of two answers one the fbi ordered the raid on my house but instructed the sheriffs department not to touch my computers that would mean baxter still wants me working as sysop which suggests he might try a repeat of lenzs illadvised eros strategy two last nights debacle in virginia convinced the nonfederal police agencies involved in the case that the fbi has lost control of the investigation they told sheriff buckner to find out once and for all whether miles was here or not leaving my computers alone suggests that while buckner doesnt mind thumbing his nose at federal authority he wont risk screwing up an fbi investigation by interrupting the running of eros this leaves me with the enigma of the cashmere jacket and the disk why in gods name would miles take my coat hide the trojan horse disk in it then leave both behind did he run to the back door thinking he could break for the fields and avoid the claustrophobic tunnel altogether did he nearly run smack into the deputies who must have been waiting in the backyard even as drewe and i ate breakfast would that have frightened him enough to make him drop the jacket and dart down the tunnel without it no would he take one of my treasured possessions without asking i remember him admiring the coat sculpture in my office but ill hide the disk where you can find it i stand suddenly as though sleepwalking i move up the hallway to my office i cant believe the deputies did so much damage in so little time they dragged furniture away from the walls pulled guitar cases out from under my bed and generally trashed anything large enough to conceal a hamster but the sculpture of my fathers coatmounted on long bolts driven into wall studsremains pristine and untouched just as miles must have guessed it would i stand before it like a votary before an icon wondering whether this inanimate object that has so long preserved my fathers memory could have provided the spark miles sought during a desperate moment the coat sculpture looks impossibly real the winecolored cashmere slightly wrinkled as though the coat had just been slipped off after a night of musicmaking in a smoky club even the fine stitching is rendered in the wood the outer pockets have flaps but they do not open one of the deputies probably bruised his knuckles trying to check them but the inside breast pocketthanks to the sculptors painstaking techniqueis there somehow cut into the black silk lining with a steadyhanded certainty unlike any ive ever known i reach between the wooden lapels and slip two fingers down into that pocket a thin edge of plastic slides perfectly between my fingertips when i withdraw my hand it holds a inch floppy disk labeled trojan horse son of a bitch i whisper without hesitation i take the disk over to my gateway push it into the floppy drive and scan the contents of the disk it contains only two files one is a wordperfect file of bytes called harper the other is labeled ejpgthe jpg signifying a graphic file encoded by the standards of the joint photographic experts group this must be the trojan horse hoping for an explanation i boot up wordperfect hit shift f and retrieve harper the pagelong letter begins harpe thabk god i type the upload instructionsbeofr the cops giot here jsut get brahma to downolad this jpeg and weve got him you candoiit tia thanks in advance i mutter thanks but no thanks the rest of the letter gives detailed instructions for transmitting the jpeg file via eros there are almost no typos in that section miles must have typed it as soon as he finished the trojan horse though he doesnt explain exactly what the trojan horse is designed to do he does say that he based his plan around the likelihood that brahma would use the new eros uuencoderdecoder program to decode the image file the trojan horse code will probably be visible as a small black line somewhere in the photo when brahma views it which i am to explain ahead of time by saying that the picture was digitized with an inexpensive hand scanner the problem is that miles omitted the most crucial fact from his letter a description of the image contained in the jpeg file my eros program will decode jpeg images but since the trojan horse is buried inside this particular fileand i have no idea what destructive function it is designed to carry outi have no intention of disabling either of my computers by trying to view it since miles didnt tell me what the image was he must have thought the answer would be selfevident what image could brahma want badly enough to download into his computer ejpg a chill races across my shoulders would miles really suggest that i send a photo of my sisterinlaw to brahma he would i was willing to use erins personalityat least parts of itto seduce brahma and miles hasnt half my moral scruples but even if he wanted to use her photo how could he there are no digital photographs of erin in this house then it hits me he wouldnt have to use the real erin miless latest project was expanding eross software interface to facilitate transmission of graphic images between subscribers he probably had dozens of digital photos on his hard drive or on disks in his computer bag as long as one showed a beautiful woman who looked something like i described erin he would have been set despite my assertions to miles that our game with brahma is through i feel a quickening in my blood its brahma will be checking the blue room for erin in ten minutes i shove my chair away from the gateway and stand up the closedin feeling is on me again and the disordered room only adds to my anxiety the closets are the worst worthless guitar pedal effects and expensive rackmount units have been spilled out with equal disregard even my video camera lies on the floor beneath a pile of old shoes and boots as i pick up the camera i wonder what it was doing in my closet we usually keep it on the top shelf in the hall closet within easy reach if we want to tape holly during a visit drewe couldnt have put it here she doesnt even put herself in my office that leaves buckners deputies and miles with a hollow feeling in my chest i pan my eyes across the room the scattered junk looks indigenous to my office much of it stuff ive sworn a dozen times to throw out then kept for no defensible reason but something must not fit this picture there on the right side of the eros computer table lies a photo album that belongs in the den with all the other albums drewe meticulously maintains but this is no ordinary family album its a portfolio from erins modeling days i cross the room and open the portfolio with a familiar twinge of guilty knowledge and discovery a few nights over the past three monthssince erin told me the truth about hollyi have slipped quietly into the den and brought this album back to my office where i pored over its pages in a state of time dislocation it is a strange and terrible thing to know your genes have blended with anothers in the person of a beautiful child that can never be acknowledged i know every photograph in the portfolio intimately the first pages are magazine covers glamour harpers bazaar vogue then comes a fullpage ad that ran in the french edition of elle miles i murmur lingering over the seminude lingerie shot erin stares up from the page with startling prepossession how many models have i seen in my lifetime they stare out from behind glaring type straining for aloofness stretching for sincerity and never quite making it look at me they implore i am a special creature one of the chosen yet with most a look that lingers longer than the time it takes to check your groceries pierces their transparent glamour not so with erin miles was right the bastard the feeling never goes away it never goes away because erin is life lived too close to the cycle of birth and sex and death that we in the west have tried to deny for too many centuries a woman who walks among repressed twentiethcentury males projecting the tidal power of the moon and the sexual energy of the harvest is like a human low pressure zone an eye waiting for a hurricane and i like so many others was sucked into it as inexorably as a palm uprooted from an island shore paging quickly through the portfolio i come to an empty plastic sleeve i know what belongs here and i find it at the back of the portfolio torn by a hasty reinsertion its an eightbyteninch blackandwhite photograph in it erin stands in quarter profile on wet stone steps before an arched doorway she wears a diaphanous black gown a silver necklace and silver earrings her hair is gathered upon her head revealing her graceful neck bare shoulders and seemingly virginal bosom both arms are extended toward the door offering a silver chalice to a shadowy figure standing just inside the arch one pale hand is visible in the blackness waiting to receive the chalice the great stones forming the arch suggest a castle or cathedral and they seem to suck the very light from the air so that even erins dark skin hair and eyes appear translucent as though limned by some inner radiance the image is a study in contradiction the gaze of a saint on the face of a harlot a black gown on a bridal body warm light flowing from darkness in a scene of carnal communion the image projects a timeless power that miles must have recognized the instant he saw it i let the album fall shut with a sigh my video camera is lying out because miles used it to reproduce this photograph in digital form then he somehow transferred that video imageone frame of itonto the floppy disk i found in the sculpted coat he probably had some kind of videocapture device in his computer bag miles said his trojan horse would be true to its name and he meant it the image of erin is his horse and hidden inside its seemingly harmless codeas deadly as any greek armyis whatever program he designed to destroy brahma a raucous buzzing suddenly fills the office i drop into a crouch trying frantically to locate the source of the sound my alarm clock in the past year i might have set it twice so its sound is now as unfamiliar as an air raid siren the clock reads miles obviously set it so that brahmas next logon wouldnt pass unnoticed as if impelled by miless will i shut off the alarm then move to the eros computer and stare at its screen saver the bust of nefertiti turning hypnotically in the field of black the urge to touch the keyboard to move forward on the path to knowledge no matter how dangerous is nearly irresistible damn you miles flexing my fingers like a violinist warming up for a concert i tap a few keys killing the screen saver and logging onto eros as sysop from my birdseye view of the system i scan the block of private rooms that contains the blue room brahma is there maxwell erin the dry earth awaits the rain the nerves in my arms dance needle points on my skin i feel like i just opened my bathroom door and found a stranger waiting behind the shower curtain with a quick click of the mouse i log off and sit staring at the black screen nefertiti soon reappears she is beautiful but cold somehow across the ages she whispers to me how trivial is all this my concern with who lives and who dies she is another face of the man who awaits me in the blue room and a reckless humour in my blood stirs me to challenge i stand and walk to the gateway pick up miless trojan horse disk set it beside the eros keyboard and sit back down okay shithead i whisper pulling on the headset come to papa with savage pleasure i stab the keys that transform me into erin and take me to the blue room where maxwell s prompt still glows softly i feel a sudden consciousness of the conditioned chill in the house the dead heat outside the burning cotton in the fields and miles crashing through its leaves somewhere the violated bodies of women lying headless in dry crypts beneath the ground and lenzs pathetic shell of a wife also dead now and rosalind may who might still be alive and worse off for it with all this and more coursing through me i activate the voicerecognition program speak softly into the microphone and watch my words appear onscreen erin i am the rain chapter maxwell im so glad you came back brahmas digital voice floats from the speakers with chilling familiarity his previous communications have imprinted it in my memory as indelibly as that of douglas rain the voice of hal in stanley kubricks a space odyssey im tempted to assign a different frequency to brahma but i dont the familiarity will help me to visualize him as a man which of course he is somewhere he sits just as i do facing a glowing screen preparing to speak his inmost thoughts into a machine when he does i follow the letters across the monitor to be sure i do not mistake his meaning maxwell but its you who are the dry earth erin i am the rain erin i think the opposite but im not ashamed of need you may be right maxwell perhaps i am ashamed of need i mean i have been lonely for so long not alone but lonely erin the lot of most people im afraid maxwell i am not like most people erin no one ever thinks they are maxwell soon you will know that i am not erin how maxwell today im going to do something i have never done erin what maxwell tell my story and then you will know erin why do you want to tell me because i told you i was beautiful and you believed me maxwell beauty is important but it is not enough look at the actors and actresses on eros their pathetic fantasies are encyclopedias of insecurity you said things yesterday that intrigued me the way you spoke of sin and fate to find beauty married with character and intelligence is very rare i possess all these so i know many seek to know me but i reveal nothing i live within myself i believe you do the same thus i long to know you i sense something deep in you but i shall not ask you to reveal it without also revealing myself i ask only one favor of you if the things i tell you shock you too much tell me in this way shall we know we were meant to go no further erin all right maxwell and please forgive me if i take liberties with specifics such as places or names erin lie about the little things but tell the truth about the big things maxwell just so i must start in a time before you were born for my destiny began then erin im ready maxwell in the latter years of the last century my paternal grandfather was born into a prominent family in germany call him rudolf rudolf was given a firstclass education and became a distinguished surgeon in berlin when he was twentyfive his parents died in a fire his elder brother karl also a surgeon was his only surviving relation rudolf was a bull of a man prussian to his boots but he married a small frail woman she was porcelain pale with fine features and seablue eyes when the kaiser began rattling his saber my grandfather decided to emigrate to america karl begged him to remain during what he called the fatherlands hour of need but rudolf took his inheritance and settled his wife in here the speakers fall silent but after a brief delay brahma picks up again a large american city and quickly established himself as surgeon to an upperclass clientele their first child was a son well call him richard richard was something of a byronic figure even as an infant hed inherited his mothers slight bones pale skin and blue eyes but his fathers dark hair intellect and relentless will a year later a daughter was born catherine at that time it was discovered that richard suffered from hemophilia his condition was controllable so long as he was protected from traumatic injury but his handicap completed his byronic persona early on richard showed signs of genius he was given a peerless education by private tutors while catherine received instruction in music and ballet from the age of four the family led an idyllic existence until when the stock market crashed rudolf lost his fortune overnight he could still practice medicine but suddenly it was a means of survival rather than a lucrative hobby when several friends committed suicide he fell into severe depression his behavior became erratic he practically imprisoned himself and his family in the speakers are silent again unsure of what to do i finally type erin whats the matter are you all right maxwell yes its proving harder than i thought to tell the story without giving away too much erin what are you afraid of maxwell when im finished you will understand im under a great deal of pressure just now i am working on a great enterprise certain people would like to stop me they dont understand my work erin but you believe i will maxwell you might im not sure erin ive got to tell you im under a lot of strain myself almost breakdown level to be honest dont tell me anything you dont want to but getting it out might do you some good i know what it means to keep a secret bottled up for too long maxwell if i go on you must remember something knowledge is a burden it has a price remember the garden of eden erin dont worry id make a very good eve id blame adam or satan for picking the apple while i made apple wine for god this is the kind of conversation i subscribed to eros for in the first place maxwell you actually made me laugh i shall continue then after losing his fortune rudolf practically imprisoned his family in their brownstone in the city he practiced only enough medicine to keep food on the table the staple of home life was continuing richards studies particularly in anatomy and physiology my grandmother taught catherine piano on their bösendorfer after five long years of depression both small and capital d rudolf locked himself in his study and put a bullet through his brain richard discovered the body though but twelve he became the psychological head of the family he wrote to germany for help and uncle karl obliged with money stating that richard should use it to return the family to berlin but richard knew that if he did his uncle would quickly take his fathers place he convinced his mother they should try to hold on in america doling out karls money like a man rationing water to lifeboat passengers richard continued his studies alone using his fathers magnificent library he became driven his solitary goal to regain the status and fortune his father had lost imagine the scene a shadowy mansion empty but for three people a beautiful boy seated at an oil lamp reading grays anatomy and aeschylus until his eyes blurred a senile mother rapping her daughters fingers with a ruler when she made mistakes at her beethoven speaking only german the boy keeping up his sisters english while the mother slept their survival was a miracle the only food was that which richard could buy cheaply or steal on the streets while a city and nation starved outside rudolf had taught his son how to manage his hemophilia how to go to hospitals and clandestinely purchase whole blood how to give himself transfusions and the boy did it he survived it was within this dark and insular realm that richard came into his sexual awakening virtually cut off from outside contact he turned to his younger sister for comfort bereaved by the death of her father and by the emotional withdrawal of her mother catherine accepted richards advances even welcomed them all the studies tell us incest skyrockets in situations of overcrowding isolation or poverty but i make no excuses this relationship was a great gift for richard his immense powers of concentration were never diverted by petty romances nor did he risk genetic union with an inferior partner my grandmother must have known and understood because the children lived as lovers under that enormous roof sleeping in the same bed exploring the limits of physical and spiritual experience have i shocked you erin erin id be lying if i said no but im fascinated too ive never heard anything like this before maxwell its like reading about young gods isnt it erin in a way but i know whats coming richard left catherine didnt he maxwell did he when still quite young richard passed the examinations required to enter university desperately short of money he wrote again to uncle karl he blamed jewish thieves and antigerman persecution for the familys failure to appear in berlin war was looming again and karl immediately forwarded funds sufficient for a sea passage of course richard used the money to enter university he became an academic star his tuition paid by scholarship and since his hemophilia exempted him from the draft he was able to accept a scholarship to medical school three years later during this time catherine had begun meeting men outside the family but no relationships developed my grandmother discouraged her saying that this or that suitor could never measure up to the family standard which of course meant richard for his part richard had several outside relationships with both women and men but none supplanted catherine in his heart erin i feel sorry for catherine she never had a chance to find out what she really wanted maxwell she was marked by destiny erin does that idea make you uncomfortable erin why dont you tell me her destiny first maxwell while in medical school richard decided for machiavellian reasons that the time had come to marry and to marry well his opportunity arrived in the form of the disgraced daughter of a wealthy professor i always called her the gorgon pregnant before her first marriage this woman lost the baby immediately after it then went through a nasty and public divorce no longer suitable for men of her own class she was convinced by her father to give a brilliant medical student a chance richard wasted no time realizing that his plan would be a shock to his sister he broke the news gently stressing his mercenary motives but to no avail catherine was devastated over the next two weeks she pleaded madly with him and twice seduced him telling him that no other woman could ever love or understand him as she did when he refused to yield she blurted out that no other woman could ever give him the child she could richard ignored her and pushed ahead with his plans the day before the wedding catherine left the city with all the money richard had in the world worried near to collapse he told everyone she had gone west to seek relief for fragile lungs if he had known the truth he would undoubtedly have followed her like a homing bird catherine had gone in search of their one blood relative uncle karl this was during the war remember she traveled first to neutral spain and befriended members of the german émigré community there with their reluctant assistance she managed finally to reach berlin there during an air raid cowering with strangers in the basement of a hospital she delivered the child she had conceived in america the child of her brother it was a son that child was me in the silence that follows these words my composure begins to fray during the last few minutes brahma has told me more about himself than he told lenz in a dozen conversations the fantastic character of his story fills me with wonder and also dread but i cannot stop to analyze any of it time is draining away like water through my hands erin i dont know what to say maxwell now you understand my special knowledge of incest i have gone as far as i will for now i believe i have earned the right to your story or at least part of it erin im embarrassed i dont have a dramatic family saga like yours maxwell all family histories are dramatic freud showed us that in some families the struggle merely occurs beneath the surface like battles under primeval seas brahma has an answer for everything he wants a story and for days ive planned to tell him one only now that the moment is at hand i am paralyzed how much truth do i tell how much fiction earlier this week it seemed to me that deception was mostly a matter of facts with continuity the key to success now i see how foolish i was successful lies are not based on fact but instinct emotion if i tell a story that i believe brahma must believe too closing my eyes i fill my mind with images of erin a child laughing in the bathtub with drewe in grainy home movies a girl smoking cigarettes behind bushes in a girl scout uniform a teenager riding pillion behind a harleycrazed pothead her long hair flying in the wind a high school junior standing naked on a pier a young woman glossyfaced in the magazines moving urgently beneath me in chicago a bride draped in white and kissing patrick at her wedding eyes open and looking down the row of groomsmen to where i stand this is like performing a classic song you dont just sing and play the notes you open yourself to the subliminal power of the whole the fluid biopsy of personality that was somehow captured in the words and music of the original recording and if youre lucky for one small slice of time you become otis or muddy or jimi or janis or lennon i have done that and if i can do that i can do this when i speak i hear my voice as erins hypnotic contralto the sound soothes my nerves using stories told me long ago by bob anderson i begin weaving a history of drewe and erins ancestors then slowly draw it into a new south tale worthy of margaret mitchell my reason tells me i shouldnt use too much truth but instinct tells me that straying too far from it will destroy my credibility the lives i use for thread are like my own are in fact part of my own and the tapestry that results will not be pulled apart not even by brahma yet as my story moves into the recent past he begins asking questions maxwell you do not get along with your sister now erin we get along how can you not get along with the most perfect person in the world maxwell obviously you dont believe that about her erin sometimes i do shes a doctor now but everybody knew shed be an astronaut or something like that even when she was a kid youd probably love her maxwell i doubt it i know many female superachievers and the image rarely reflects the reality beneath erin in this case it does my sisters life could be a movie only it would be too boring its more like a tv commercial maxwell is she attractive erin yes maxwell but you are more so erin physically maxwell she was jealous of your beauty erin if she was she never showed it if shed tried she could have gotten as much male attention as i did but while i was cutting class she was dissecting fetal pigs maxwell did you go to university erin no new york maxwell ah what did you do there i pause its time to bend the truth a little erin i was a singer maxwell what kind of singer opera broadway erin a folk singer sort of joni mitchell but with more edge i changed my name so my family couldnt find me my father had told me id end up turning tricks to eat but i was signed pretty quickly i was wined and dined and photographed and flown to montserrat to cut a cd then my ar guy got fired for signing too many acts that flopped i think he only signed me because he wanted to sleep with me nobody else at the label cared whether i lived or died my cd was never even mastered i got depressed did more coke than sherlock holmes and freud put together and crashed in less than a year maxwell crashed erin lost my bearings did too many drugs slept with too many men even started losing my looks theyre back now thank god im vain enough to appreciate that maxwell vanity may be what saved you but dont you think its time we went back a bit further perhaps discussed your father a bit more erin why maxwell i think you know its the oldest story in the world erin let yourself be rid of the weight erin you think my father tried to screw me or something maxwell not necessarily most adultchild sex involves oral or manual stimulation not penetration erin my god youve got it all wrong maxwell that sounds like denial to me erin and you sound like every stupid shrink i ever went to my problem has nothing to do with my father its my sister maxwell your sister are you telling me you had a lesbian affair with your sister that youre haunted by some silly adolescent cunnilingus or suchlike erin or suchlike how old are you really maxwell fortyseven erin god im not sure whether we can talk or not different cultural vocabularies maxwell i transcend generations erin erin right do you keep yourself in shape maxwell cellinis perseusis my ideal erin ive never seen it but i get the idea how close do you come to your ideal maxwell perhaps one day you will judge lets return to your sister what is this thing you try so to avoid telling me erin its her husband maxwell you are bedding her husband erin bedding no worse than that i have a child by him a son in the ensuing silence i sense brahmas heightened interest like a leopard raising its head maxwell your sister is still married to him erin yes she does not know hes the father of my child maxwell ah does he know erin yes i told him three months ago maxwell how old is your son erin three maxwell how did this happen erin with a fluidity that surprises me i give brahma a condensed history of the relationships between myself drewe and erinbut from erins perspective the names i change yet the eternal triangle retains its mythic power brahma seems particularly interested in the diametric personalities of erin and drewe when i arrive at the incident in chicago he asks maxwell what was the sex like between you how do i describe sex with myself from erins point of view this may be the obstacle that finally trips me erin it was the consummation of years of suppressed desire in a certain way it was unique id been disillusioned by men very early men see women as saints or whores and at that time i saw men in similar terms bastards or wimps the bastards i was always attracted to tried to destroy me and the nice guys i destroyed thats whats happening to my husband now maxwell which type was your sisters husband erin neither that was the unique thing with him i responded like i had with my bastard lovers but he wasnt one he was gentle he was a musician a songwriter maxwell but this is the root of your desire for a man with the soul of a woman artists are the bridge between the male and female poles they are spiritually hermaphroditic erin maybe thats it because he took me to a different place than id ever been sometimes when we made love i achieved something more than an orgasm it was a total obliteration of consciousness the waves would start and then suddenly id reach this hyperaware plateau a clear white space like a liquid dream and then id black out absolutely when i woke up i felt something i never had before peace i felt id known what it was to be dead or at least beyond life and i liked it you know i wanted that peace later i found out the french call that the little death maxwell sex and death are opposite sides of the same coin erin we in the west repress this but the east has always known it death without sex means extinction sex without death the same orgasm is a bridge between the two states a temporary annihilation of the self a momentary return to the womb waters to the mindless timeless flux of nature it was into this infinite province that he took you erin you sound like you know a lot about it maxwell death and life yes i know them well but you should not long for that annihilation we all get there too soon tell me why did you not marry this unique lover as i describe erins marriage of convenience to patrick and his promise never to ask about hollys father i am forced to look into an abyss i have not allowed myself to think about for the past three months the dark hole where dr patrick graham has become unhinged obsessed by a shadow face that lurks in his dreams like a grinning demon that will never grant him peace my face maxwell has your husband ever struck you during these arguments erin no not that i havent deserved it but im starting to understand him now i once thought he could grow to love my child as part of me but men arent built that way in the animal world males try to kill the offspring of other males at some primitive level i think the same thing is happening in my husbands brain the more he loves my son the more he hates him maxwell yes and what is your solution to all this erin i havent got one maxwell of course you do you simply havent found the strength to admit it you dont love your husband do you erin no hes a good father though i picked well in that department even in desperation maxwell do you love your sisters husband erin i dont think so i dont know maxwell if you knew you were going to die tonight how would you feel about him erin i dont know id be angry that he was going to be left with my sister be free of me and my son i guess i must resent his happiness maxwell and your sisters erin no i was never jealous of my sister my parents always loved some nancy drew idea of me but my sister really knew me and she loved me anyway she still does maxwell so why resent her husbands happiness erin maybe because hes the only man who ever made both of us love him he got to screw mary magdalene and deflower the virgin mary too all without taking any consequences i mean i certainly had to take consequences maxwell you want your sister to know the truth erin i dont know but im not sure i can keep the secret regardless my husband is forcing the issue what if he leaves me should i end up alone with my son while his real father lives an idyllic life with my sister is that fair it makes me crazy i hate him when i think like that maxwell has he asked you for sex since chicago erin no but hes still haunted by me i feel it whenever im around him and now that he knows about our son hes really going out of his way to see us god everything is going to hell and i have no control over it my sister wants a baby of her own my son is like an unexploded bomb lying between our two families my husbands going crazy my sisters husbands going crazy im going crazy maxwell calm down tell me one thing only what do you want out of five different impulses the right answer comes to me like divine revelation erin i want out maxwell thats simply another way of saying you havent the courage to try to get what you want which is your sisters husband erin no i want out maxwell out of what out of your situation out of life erin its hard for me to admit this but i still dream of the magical mystical man out there somewhere who is what ive always wanted likesnow white someday my prince will come go ahead tell me im pathetic and unliberated and everything else i could care less thats what i want i want to be saved maxwell describe your prince for me i close my eyes out of the luminescent afterimage of the computer screen something is moving toward me it is formless yet threatening faceless yet drawing into focus it is not one thing its a mass of shadows an army of ghosts walking with their eyes shut ghosts of all the blind men who used erin throughout her life and my ghost walks among them but behind those pale shadows i see something else a shining obsidian darkness and within that darkness floats a single pair of open eyes terrible cobalt eyes framed by long lashes eyes that stare into my soul with phallic intent brahmas eyes erin i think my prince is a dark prince he terrifies most women but not me he knows the ways of the world but hes not of the world do you know what i mean maxwell go on erin he inspires awe in men yet abases himself before me as i abase myself before him he knows that all men who ever touched me were like slaves who tended me until his arrival he knows that earthly defilement confers a certain kind of purity he knows i possess immeasurable love but that the edge of my love is terrible and cold and he welcomes that he can make me scream in the night loose me from everything that holds me to the earth cause an explosion in my head that dwarfs the orgasm of my body he loves me so desperately that he wants to kill me but that is the one act he hasnt the power to commit because at the hot core of his strength he fears me thats what i want maxwell be at peace child i am come a drop of stinging sweat falls into my eye somewhere on this planet a man sits in the glow of a computer screen speaking these words to me and fantasizing a future i do not even want to crack the door on i am miles farther down the road dr lenz tried to walk and the only way home is forward erin i dont know what to say your words are powerful i wont deny that im drawn to you but i know the reality youre nearly fifty years old and youre sitting somewhere dreaming about bedding this beautiful young girl youve found online i dont think youre my savior maxwell i am more than savior erin i am a second sun burning above the teeming earth but even suns need sustenance they consume themselves as i have done for so long i am subject to one god above me and that god is time erin you sound like youve gone a little far with this maxwell we are come to the fork in the road to the time of choosing you must decide whether to remain where you are dwelling in darkness or to journey to the place of understanding remember that knowledge is a burden knowledge has a price my mind has finally gone blank erin i need a few minutes to think about this its a lot to take in at once maxwell no erin why not to be perfectly honest i need to pee youve made me nervous maxwell urinate where you sit it will bring your mortality home to you erin im perfectly convinced of my mortality thank you im going to leave this terminal for five minutes i do want to know about your life i do believe youre different you might even be the one but i have to pee and i want to compose myself if youre here when i get back ill be glad if youre not ill be sorry and with thatwith my heart beating like a triphammer and my hair soaked with sweati log off chapter i spent most of the fiveminute rest i gave myself from brahma in the bathroom wiping my neck and arms with a steaming washrag and staring at my stunned face in the mirror brahmas life storywhat ive heard of itis stranger than anything i ever imagined and i have a sense that it will only get more so but is he telling the truth am i learning the genesis of a murderer or is he merely playing me for a fool as he did so expertly with dr lenz i dont think so a small voice in my mind is telling me to call daniel baxteror even lenz himselfbut i am not ready to do that having brought brahma to the point that he wants to pour out his twisted past to erin i must push on to the end sitting back down at the computer i pull on the headset and take a long pull from a fresh tab on the screen are the last sentences i spoke if youre here when i get back ill be glad if youre not ill be sorry i decide to make him wait another minute just to keep the authority on my side after finishing the tab i speak again and eros faithfully transcribes erin are you still here max maxwell yes erin you havent scared me off yet lets go maxwell go erin im ready to hear the rest of your story maxwell but we were discussing you erin you told me a secret i told you one its your turn again maxwell such children we are very well where was i erin incest your father married a woman in america for her money and position while his sisteryour motherran off to germany and gave birth to you during the war maxwell skip ahead six years richard had achieved his childhood dream he was a prominent psychiatrist in one of americas greatest cities his wife had money but he earned plenty of his own yet he had one regret the gorgon had no intention of inhibiting her social life with the drudgery of rearing a child so richard lost himself in his work and became more renowned and controversial with each passing year his approach was simple he encouraged people to accept their natures he used freud and jung and the rest to legitimize socalled aberrant behavior i find a humorous parallel with a maxim of the computer industry thats not a bug its a feature richard relieved his rather exotic sexual needs away from home in a variety of ways but he managed to stay clear of both the press and the police when catherine appeared on his doorstep the old family brownstone now fantastically refurbished with a sixyearold boy at her side he was stunned i was a mirror image of him darkhaired paleskinned classically beautiful mother explained the similarities with the fiction that i was richards nephew to explain my fatherless existence catherine told a harrowing tale of an impulsive marriage to a young german soldier who was quickly killed on the russian front then three terrible years in a displaced persons camp with uncle karl the dp camp was real enough the cold there lodged in my bones like tumors of ice catherine also revealed that i suffered from hemophilia the same type richard had this made the gorgon vaguely suspicious but since hemophilia is passed down through females only her suspicions were allayed when richard and catherine were finally alone mother confessed the truth there was never any german soldier i was richards son though i did not know it half mad from exhaustion mother told richard shed managed to survive only by vowing to deliver me to him before she died in her eyes richard saw the glazed apartness that had lighted his fathers eyes shortly before he shot himself sweeping aside the gorgons opposition richard took us into his home tension between the two women grew quickly and one cold morning richard found catherine dead in her bed shed taken an overdose of morphine from his medical bag she lay in state in the house for two days resting in a bronze coffin her delicate hands folded across her still breasts like those of a fallen martyr i did not leave her side except to urinate and i ate no food at all nor did i sleep when catherines body passed into the crematorium i collapsed and had to be admitted to the hospital when richard announced that he would legally adopt his nephew the gorgons lack of opposition surprised him he didnt realize that iwithout catherinewas the answer to the gorgons prayers as well as his own i freed her forever from the pressure to bear a child yet things did not turn out quite as she hoped in me richard had gained more than a son for what was i but a genetic reconstitution of himself and his sister the male and female halves united in one being i was his father reborn he educated me in the manner he had enjoyed before the crashprivate tutors focusing on the hard sciencesand i did not disappoint as i surpassed each new expectation richard came to realize that his sister had been right no other woman could have loved him as she did or given him such a child he came to believe that fate was acting through our bloodline to bring about a higher order of humanity without even being conscious of it he began to eulogize catherine as a saint as the years passed the gorgon grew more resentful of me from the beginning shed had suspicions too deep to put a name to and one night after consuming a staggering amount of gin she stumbled upstairs to richards private bedroom and confronted him she disparaged my mother in a long tirade shed done this before but for some reason on this night richard snapped he told the gorgon the truth at first she misinterpreted shouting that shed always known i was a bastard that catherines dead german soldier was a lie to hide her whoredom when she finally comprehended the true state of affairs and began wailing about that demon child richard lifted her off her feet carried her to the second floor landing and threw her over the rail to the marble floor below i was fourteen then and i saw it happen the shouting had drawn me to the head of the stairs richard was terrified not that i would report him to the police but that he might have lost me forever by committing murder before my eyes i remember my reaction to this day i said its about time you did something about that shrew uncle do you think me cold erin in the silence of the hanging question i force myself to take no position at all to draw no moral line that might stop brahmas flood tide of confession erin its almost like a film i see it all happening in my minds eye is it real really real maxwell absolutely that night richard took me into his study to try to explain what had happened for once he found himself at a loss for words he realized he had reached the point where he must risk alleither gain a son or lose me forever he told me the truth he was not my uncle but my father uncle and father he told me of the forbidden union between himself and his sister how through that sacral sexual union an immeasurable strength and talent had been createdme we had always felt an intense kinship partly because we were so similar but also because of our shared disease during that hour in the study our bond was consecrated we vowed to stand together on the matter of the gorgons accidental death and from that moment forward shared a conviction that we were beyond moral constraint i was reborn that night erin incest and murder were my nativity erin you were fourteen when this happened maxwell yes i had wished this thing to be real for so long and suddenly it was it had never seemed possible that id been sired by some anonymous german soldier too stupid or unlucky to survive a war of course my father was a renowned psychiatrist if i was a little too ready to see myself as theübermenschrichard claimed i was fate has proved him right three years later i entered medical school despite my determination to remain calm i clench my right fist in triumph drewes theory looks more likely with each passing minute erin so you are a doctor i had a feeling you were maxwell yes but i do not wish to speak about that erin what do you want to say maxwell i have a perverse impulse to tell you of my failings my wounds my darkest journeys erin why focus on your failings maxwell do you understand the essential difference between man and woman woman can simply be she gains identity through existence itself through the biological imperative she merely waits for completion as you do but man must become he must create himself he must tear himself away from his mother sever the umbilical and project himself into the world beyond that wholeness man must exile himself from comfort and completion you see that dont you erin i suppose so maxwell it can be a dark journey i was no normal adolescent erin i saw elvis presley as a cartoon dionysus for bourgeois america when the beatles burst on the scene i ignored them too chipper too happy but then the world changed the rolling stones the doors hendrix i immersed myself in the drug subculture richard had always been a libertine and by profession was an expert on pharmacology hed traveled down the hallucinogenic highway before leary ever heard of lsd he shepherded me in this as in all things i was the right age for vietnam but my hemophilia disqualified me from the draft as it had my father before me i was wealthy in an ivy league school on the fast track for medicine but in one area i remained unfulfilled the area which eros exists to explore erin sex maxwell yes we are all slaves to our childhoods and i was no exception because my hemophilia was my only limitation it grew to terrifying scale in my mind i strengthened my body through ceaseless swimming a sport in which the chance of sustaining a bleeding injury was very low my mention of cellinisperseuswas no idle comment it was truly my goal and through years of swimming i attained it if you saw me in clothes you would notice only exquisite proportion but if you saw me naked you would understand my body attracted women but whenever matters progressed to an overtly sexual level i found myself put off by their carnality by their very vitality i felt revulsion fear nausea and did not understand why my fathers erotic exploits proved that sex was possible for men like us i masturbated albeit carefully and for two semesters in college i had a male roommate who would suck me to climax whenever i needed relief he disgusted me but it accomplished the goal still i feared what might happen in the unguarded thrusting and writhing of real sex then at a college party i mistakenly walked into a bedroom where a drunken girl had passed out as i stared at her closed eyelids the nearmotionless breasts beneath her sweater i felt my pulse quickening a twinge of tumescence i closed the door moved to her and pushed my hands clumsily under her sweater as my heart thundered in my chest terrified that someone would come in i groped beneath her clothing for a few moments soiled my trousers then fled from the house it sounds pathetic doesnt it erin ive heard stranger things maxwell naturally i found a way to put myself into a similar situation again only this time i removed the girls pants and actually penetrated her the third time the chosen girl awakened and i ran she was unable to identify me but the experience frightened me enough to make me stop it also forced me to diagnose my own neurosis all my life i had been carrying around a psychosexual template of my dead mother in my head it was my last vision of her lying motionless in her coffin pale and perfect waiting for the flames of cremation these women i had touched were but gross reflections of the anima in my mind of course diagnosis and cure are different things an acrophobe who knows he is afraid of heights cannot suddenly shed his fear my anima remained with me and it had faces i had yet to perceive erin in four years of college you never once fell in love maxwell love my mind was in chains whenever i thought i was making progress another incident would occur in medical school seven other students and i were paraded into an operating room where an anesthetized young woman was about to be given a hysterectomy we were to practice vaginal examinations using her as our patient this is common practice in teaching hospitals if your husband hasnt told you as i stood in line watching my fellow students force their gloved fingers into the pale still body i felt fury at the institutional violation of this defenseless woman but then i sensed a terrific pressure beneath my lab coat when my turn came to examine her my hands were trembling this was so out of character that the attending physician remarked on it i bumbled through the exam then raced into a rest room to relieve my distress as i did i visualized the anesthetized woman the most perfect image i had yet encountered of my mother i knew then that i was not yet freethat i might never be freeof her erin your father never sensed your problems maxwell of course he did richard blamed himself completely for eulogizing my mother long after her death for not having the courage to marry the woman he loved if he had he knew he might have given me the gift hed been granteda sister with whom i could share all worse by denying me that sister he had also crippled the powerful gene line that had been concentrated in me he begged me to turn outward to search for someone who might fill the need he had not provided for and give me heirs worthy of our genes erin did you maxwell i tried but i was meant to walk a different path erin summers during college i began to travel abroad with my father i had been to europe of course but never to the east and the east was richards great passion he was obsessed with the fertility cults of the indus valley cities the bloody rituals of sex and death around which indian culture had developed hed been raised by an authoritarian father a paragon of the sky cult of christianity which of course had been grafted onto the sky cult of germanic warrior culture yet he had seen his father break and commit suicide under the stress of bad fortune richard sought a greater strength thus was he drawn to india the great fount and faithful preserver of the mother principle in india my illusions were stripped away the strong ruled the weak served or perished i found women there who would do anything i wished for pitiful sums the fact that i would be miles away the next day allowed me to overcome my anxieties and couple with them but always there was a problem indian women are dark of skin and hair they did not fit my template ethereal catherine lying in her martyrs coffin back in america my sexual problems continued but they did not interfere with my academic advancement i was like a man aflame even as my genius was proclaimed from the heights i was hiring prostitutes to lie passive in white gowns while i gently mounted them i believe i was going slowly mad even those whores who had seen so much depravity were frightened by something in me one lost her composure during the act and attacked me and i had to be hospitalized for clotting factor therapy suicidal thoughts possessed me it was then that richard intervened he stuffed me with amphetamines whisked me off to india and changed my life forever erin what was different about that trip maxwell i found someone erin a woman maxwell yes erin like your mother maxwell no i found a woman who was death in life do you understand christianity preaches eternal life through death but that is a false and exhausted dream it is on the road of death that we find life eternal here we go i say silently jesus christ erin im not sure i understand maxwell you will on that final trip to india we crisscrossed the subcontinent in search of rituals and cults which had been outlawed by the british long before but which rumor claimed still flourished in remote areas richard was no western dilettante he had friends all over the country from the teeming cities to the villagedotted plains at an isolated tribal village we were allowed to see a young boy dragged through the fields while a crowd of farmers hacked the flesh from his body in strips which they then buried in their fields to ensure fertility from there we trekked to a high village where a certain shakti cult was known to practice tantrism of the left hand most indian holy men practice asceticism as the route to what westerners would call salvation but tantrics of the left hand path are adepts for them selfdenial brings pleasure their sacrament requiresbreakingeach taboo in ritual fashion no westerner had ever witnessed these rites yet richard with the help of a guru gained us admittance at midnight in a cremation ground eleven couples were seated in a circle at their center sat a young woman nude there was chanting of mantras then the woman was sprinkled with taboo substances such as meat and alcohol which were shared by all then the remaining women removed their vests which were placed by the guru in a box each man approached the box and selected a vest his choice of vest determined the woman with whom he would couple during the ritual as we stared from without the circle the participants disrobed and began to copulate around us no taboo of class or law was observed during this rite if a man chose the vest of his sister they made love as strangers honoring the goddess by their rapture for my father the experience was an epiphany a validation of his life history for me it was electrifying the spiritual antithesis of a roman orgy it was holy sex when the men and women around us finally began to allow themselves the release of orgasmwhich we had believed forbiddeni realized that this journey was not like the others time was funneling in upon itself sucking me toward some great reversal encouraged by our successes we pushed farther into the interior our only protection in that hard land was our wits our money and the strength in our limbs my father had a very bad time hemophilia deteriorates the joints and richards were failing fast but like mad white hunters pursuing elephants in search of the mythical ivory graveyard we trod endless miles of grass and rock in search of the one significant cult of which richard had found no extant trace the thuggee the thugs were a robber caste which had flourished in india for centuries they earned their livelihood by falling in with groups of travelers on the roads and then strangling them in their sleep they stole all money and belongings then expertly concealed the corpses nothing remarkable in that of course what made the thuggee unique was that the murders they committed were part of their religion they worshiped kalithe goddess of death and destructionin her many forms kali the black one the betrayer the difficult of approach for them murder was a sacrament and the profit gained their rightful due the british claimed to have wiped out the thugs by the end of the nineteenth century but my father believed no cult which had thrived for centuries could be utterly stamped out in one he was right after many weeks of following whispered directions bought too dearly and warnings shouted free of charge we were admitted to the home of a man who confessed that kalis cult of murder still existed after a sleepless night talking to richard during which a considerable amount of money changed hands the man admitted that he himself worshiped kali and had been trained in the ways of the thugs for my father it was the culmination of a lifes work but as he greedily absorbed the most arcane of eastern secrets i was striking up a relationship of my own the thug had three daughters two chattered endlessly but the middle daughter was silent she was darkskinned of course but also unutterably beautiful she watched me wherever i went and i watched her on the third night she came to my pallet it was the first consensual sex in my life with a woman who was not a whore i did not have to speak the first time she lay as motionless as the dead beneath me the second she rose above me like a black goddess and chanted words that cleft my mind like a scimitar is kali my divine mother of a black complexion she appears black from a distance but when intimately known she is no longer so bondage and liberation are both of her making she must always have her way in that instant this young girl smashed my spiritual chains and brought me to fierce bursting climax i was a man transformed in the morning i was amazed to learn that this proud girl spoke english which was rare in the province she had been taught it as a way to lull travelers into feeling safe for three nights she initiated me into wonders i had never imagined or had been sickened by when i did i saw that all my life had been an obsessive exercise in compensation i had been born with an incurable disease cursed with fragility id watched my delicate mother perish for love then sought a woman equal to her but the daughter of the thug was catherines antithesis cold and hard outside yet soft and fathomless at her core i had feared unrestrained sex for so long in my mind the yonithe opening in the womanwas a crevice through which a man would fall back into the mindless black maw of nature the women who had wanted me sought to enslave me to bear children unworthy of my line but the daughter of the thug allayed my fears she taught me that semen once ejaculated into the fire of theyoni could still be arrested and returned that i would not be dissolved into her but rather purge myself of earthly lust and touch the stars she was death rendered tangible in flesh on the night before my father and i were to leave i spoke out at the dinner table in my best attempt at his dialect i humbly asked the thug for his daughters hand in marriage he opened his stinking mouth and bellylaughed in my face i was humiliated blinded by rage and embarrassment but of course richard knew exactly what to do with a bemused smile he removed a leather case from his robe laid a thousand british pounds on the table and told the fat man he wanted the girl for me the thug snapped up the money and agreed without demur at first i did not understand i thought some exorbitant fee for sex had been arranged but just as i was about to make a fool of myself the situation became clear my father had bought the girl outright not for the night but for life erin you mean like a slave maxwell exactly the thug had sold his daughter for two thousand dollars i had no idea how she would react to this arrangement but when we departed the next morning she fell in behind us with a cotton bag hanging from her hand a fortnight later waiting in the delhi airport for the first leg of our flight home my father collapsed at fiftyfive he had already outlived most hemophiliacs of his generation and the strain of the journey had finally caused a terminal bleeding incident i married the thuggees daughter to gain her us citizenship at the ceremony i told an indian magistrate that her name was kali and no one objected kali i have called her to this day we watched over richard as he died then spread his ashes over the ganges and took the next plane out of the country this is my early life erin the seed of my becoming my strengths i have passed over in silence kali remains with me still as my concubine understanding that i could never bear children by her she allowed me to sterilize her in this pure form she has purged the lust from my body watched over me held my subconscious at bay while assisting in my lifes work how do you judge me erin a dozen loose ends from miless recitation of the eros murder scenes begin clicking into place the indian hair the possibly female bite mark the postmortem rapes brutal fallout from brahmas dead mother fixation even mrs lenzs death which must have been carried out by kali while brahma led the fbi around mclean with his cellular phone maxwell are you there erin erin you lied to me max maxwell how did i lie erin you told me youd never been married but you married kali youre still married to her maxwell only as a convenience to gain her entrance into the us erin its obviously more than that maxwell it was the only thing i could do under the circumstances just as you did when you married erin i know just dont lie anymore okay in the silence that follows i realize that i have put myself into a position where action is a necessity but options are few no matter what my gut says i have no guarantee that the tale of richard and kali and the rest is anything but the delusion of a madman brahma seems to be wrapped around erins finger but what is the value of that hes already proved that he can evade telephone traces how can i use our strange relationship to stop him try the lenz gambit set up a meeting and inform the fbi so that hostage rescue can try to ambush him it sounds workable until i factor the debacles in dallas and mclean into the equation like it or not i have only one trump card to play and it was dealt by miles turner the trojan horse the inch disk that contains it lies just to the right of my keyboard inside that black plastic painstakingly woven into a graphic file that can be decompressed into the stunning photograph of erin holding the chalice are a few lines of code that miles designed to stop brahma as surely as a stake through the heart i dont know exactly how they can do that but i dont have to know in matters digital i trust miles absolutely the risk of sending brahma that photo of erinthough theoretically almost nilinflates a large and corrosive bubble beneath my diaphragm but my choices are few and the stakes have been life and death for a long time now erin are you there max jesus i didnt realize the time this is my husbands afternoon off he could get home any minute i had a gift for you something i thought youd like but i guess it will have to wait maxwell what is this gift you speak of erin a photograph of myself for you i told you id been looking for someone here and i wanted to be ready if i found him and you seem to think i have what i told you is true the truly transcendent aspect of my existence is my beauty i know that a famous writer once asked me a question he said i wouldnt accept at face value but one that was born from honest curiosity the question was what does it feel like to inhabit such a beautiful body and the thing i tried to make him understand is that i dont inhabit my body i am my body and i want to give that as a gift to you as a beginning i may not be as fairskinned as your mother but i know im fairer than your indian girl much fairer maybe im too vain but right now it seems the only thing i can give you to match what youve given me maxwell how can you give this photograph to me erin i have it on a disk in a special kind of file a jpeg file maxwell you know how to encode and transmit a jpeg file erin i do now a friend showed me how she scanned my photo with a hand scanner the quality of the image isnt that great but the photo itself i like if you want to see it weve got to do it right now though or else wait until at least tomorrow maxwell i wish very much to see it let me give you my email address erin cant i just send it to maxwell maxwell no send it to qnowherehelfido you have that erin im printing my screen wheres that its not an eros address maxwell its in finland ill get it though erin well if you dont assume that my husband got home dont try to contact me no email or anything ill try again the next chance i get maxwell perhaps tonight erin i doubt it what you told me is a lot to absorb you must know that maxwell i have faith in you erin remember one thing max im worthy of my dark prince after youve seen my photograph youll know that the next question is are you worthy of me maxwell you still have no idea whom you are talking to youre like the desert traveler who stooped to touch a glimmer of gold in the sand when he tried to pick it up he found it would not move only when tons of earthmoving equipment had been hauled in did he realize that he had touched the finger of an enormous golden buddha buried in the sand that is what you have done today you have touched the tip of my finger erin goodbye max sweet dreams shaking with fatigue and excitement i log out of the chat room and slide miless trojan horse disk into the floppy drive the instructions he left me are simple first i open the eros uuencoder program and convert the jpg file into auue file which comes out to twentyone pages of indecipherable text then i watch the filestatus indicator changing slowly as theuue file is transmitted to finland as email then message sent upload additional files y n i press n and stare at the glowing monitor until the bust of nefertiti swirls into sight my hands are still shaking standing slowly i look into the tray of the laserjet iii a neat stack of paper chronicles every unbelievable word brahma spoke during the past hour but does it matter very soon he will download miless trojan horse as images from his twisted tale tumble through my brain a voice speaks from a still place inside me it is arthur lenzs voice echoing the french phrase he uttered prematurely at the safe house in virginia commencement de la fin the beginning of the end maybe now the words are true chapter i am highlighting passages from the brahma printouts when the highpitched ring that announces a satellite video linkup with eros headquarters in new york chimes through the office on the screen of the eros computer nefertitis head evaporates and the face of jan krislov materializes in its place a small window opens near jans left ear giving a running status report of the video link hello harper jan says in her cool voice her moving lips have the jerky quality of lowspeed digital video but the audio is clear i pull on the headset mike hello jan someone wants to speak with you she says just a moment she looks away from the camera all right go jans face remains on my screen but after a harsh click a staticridden voice says harper im here miles did you find the trojan horse i found it did those goddamn deputies confiscate your computers no thank god or daniel baxter rather the locals knew hed been using eros to try to trap brahma and they didnt want to risk crashing the system by screwing with your end of it what the hell were you doing using a real picture of erin to mask your trojan horse it was the right thing harper you know it shes not in any danger absolutely nothing weve done leads to the real erin shes not even on the map he pauses you used it didnt you i say nothing did the cops find the dummy disk i left in the coat yes he laughs sharply through the static come on you got him to download erins photo didnt you like i had a fucking choice yeshe exults i knew you could do it what happened brahma told me his whole life story going back three generations it was like hed been holding it in forever and its some kind of story well hes a doctor just like drewe guessed third generation actually theres way too much to tell miles give me a summary looking down at my highlighted pages i quickly sketch brahmas journey from incestuous birth to his marriage to kali i quote some of his more chilling passages but miles absorbs them all in silence the only thing that elicits a shocked comment is brahmas hemophilia harper you realize that most hemophiliacs born before got aids from tainted blood transfusions brahmas a doctor maybe he suspected early that there was a problem with the blood supply and acted preventively dont ask me how i think the disease had a lot to do with shaping his character though hey whats cellinis perseus a painting a sculpture the renaissance version of arnold schwarzenegger mikhail baryshnikov with better muscles hes holding a sword and the severed head of medusa severed head wow lenz will flip over this guy miles i know theres enough here for baxters people to figure out who brahma is after i black out some of the stuff i had to say to get him to talk im going to fax copies to quantico they may not need it what why not i think they may have figured out who brahma is what how maybe the organ donor registries as soon as the fbi started checking donor networks they turned up two kidnappings both from the same registry its called donornet one was a longstanding missing persons case that had basically been written off the victim disappeared about eight months ago in florida it was a man a man yep a guy named peter levy the other happened the night after rosalind may was kidnapped virginia beach virginia jenny something or other drewe hit it right on the head and you think this somehow led baxter to brahma i dont know i do know that an hour ago baxter asked jan to temporarily shut down eros did he say why he said it was because the media has picked up on what weve been doing because of mrs lenzs death he told jan that staying online any longer would be counterproductive even to catch brahma the perception of risk to our clients would be too great the perception of risk baxters words not mine but with eros down and with potential hostages theyll need my information more than ever maybe but i think baxter told us to shut down because he knows who brahma is and hes trying to cover up the lenz fuckup as thoroughly as he can however late it might be he threatened us with an injunction if we didnt go offline and jan decided to comply the risk of client lawsuits is pretty high at this point when the fbi wanted us online we could pass the buck to them now that shield is gone miles ive got to pass this stuff along how many hemophiliac doctors can there be i dont know go ahead and pass it on but even if baxter has a name on brahma catching him could be a whole different thing why dont you fax me the printouts of your conversation fax them to jan at eros shell get them to me i hesitate i will if youll answer one question the one youve been avoiding from the beginning what how did brahma get into the system how did he get the master client list a flicker of interest on jan krislovs inscrutable face i dont know miles says simply i may never know but every account brahma hijacked is over a year old he could have done everything hes done so far by breaking into the system a single time over a year ago and downloading the list and theres just no way to check that now how good was your security a year ago as good as anybodys like what a firewall give me a break thats corporate pacifier stuff i use traps filters alarms other things logs yes you know what im thinking yes miless voice is strangely flat brahma got physical access to a company computer either in the office or in one of our homes and printed out the list right any breakins at the office no your house jans the techs krislov shakes her head miles says one of my techs had a burglary seven months ago but thats too recent im mulling this over when he adds there is one other possibility what its a little uncomfortable to talk about people are dying miles spit it out can you hear me jan krislovs lips move jerkily but i hear nothing okay miles says youre a widow you date men of the age were considering as suspects its possible that brahma could have begun a relationship with you just to get access to your house your computer even before he stops speaking i know hes found the truth his words seem to hit krislov with physical force thats got to be it i tell him except he says quickly jan doesnt exactly date guys off the street she dates corporate people architects doctors i cut in the static closes around me like a malevolent embrace jans lips are moving again her eyes wide in anger or fear as she talks to miles its over a minute before he speaks again you going to fax that stuff through harper one more question how is your trojan horse supposed to work can it really nail brahma by itself if he uses the eros uuencoderdecoder software theres no doubt about it so how does it work just be patient okay i dont want to jinx it shit then when is it going to happen i cant predict that exactly but it will damn it miles i want to push harder but i know its useless all right just keep your head down harper wait did brahmas messages show any typos during the time you talked to him i didnt notice any not during the entire exchange no but ill check again you think hes on the move i just want to be careful he cant trace anything to my house right no way im just being paranoid even if baxter hasnt identified brahma the trojan horse will have sealed his fate by dawn tomorrow tomorrow miles tell drewe thanks for letting me stay there he says his voice full of hackers glee and fax your stuff to jan ciao the static ends i can tell from krislovs face that she wants to speak to me but i am not interested our professional relationship will very soon be over i terminate the video link walk over to my desk and get the number of investigative support at quantico my name gets me quickly past the operator but instead of the person i asked for i get voice mail dr lenz is on compassionate leave at this time says a sterile female voice his calls are being handled by dr weaver of the behavioral sciences instruction unit if you need further assistance please remain on the line when the operator comes back i tell her i want daniel baxter she says hes unavailable two minutes after i tell her its lifeordeath and the eros case baxter comes on the line colehe shouts like a man in the pit of a mine talk fast im in a hurry i heard youre shutting down eros is that right yes speak up how do you plan to catch the killer without it the oldfashioned way what we know who he is cole our unsub is no longer un so miles was right how i mean who is he i cant tell you that well i just talked to him you mean the killer yes for over an hour via eros he thought i was a woman ive got pages of stuff practically his whole life story ill be damned you have any idea where he was when he was talking to you no but if he was at home my guess would be new york or some other large city that has brownstone houses a brief pause thats consistent with what we know i really think you should look at this stuff ive got cole youve been a big help and a pain in the ass but the games over were about to arrest the guy a charge of excitement races over my skin but my experience with brahma tells me such statements are premature let me ask you something mr baxter you dont have to answer unless im right okay is this man youre arresting a doctor how did you know that i know a lot more than that fax everything you have to quantico we may need it if we have hostages and well definitely use it to build the case against him ill do that if you tell me one thing howd you figure out who the guy is was it the organ donor stuff silence then baxter says i knew that had to be you you and turner right no comment it wasnt that it was flight records he flew to all the crime scenes commercial flights private a beechcraft baron ever since you linked the murders weve been checking everything that moved in or out of each murder city near the death dates we finally found a private plane that had flown into tiny airports near three of the cities baxter pauses so long that i think weve lost our connection then he says okay listen cole the plane is owned by a doctor from new york weve got him under surveillance now hostage rescue is going to arrest him as soon as i land to eliminate any chance of a barricade situation did the unsub reveal anything to you that might have bearing on a plan like this a doctor from new york miless home territory hes got a woman helping him an indian woman in our conversations he called her kali but i cant be sure thats her real name im almost positive shes the real killer good what else is this doctor a neurosurgeon mr baxter no why what kind of doctor is he hes an anesthetist you mean an anesthesiologist an anesthetist is just a technician anesthesiologist right hes an md is he married i cant tell you anything else this things about to explode in the media i want this guy hogtied and any hostages freed by the time rbj open their mouths tonight rbj rather brokaw and jennings gotta go cole fax your stuff through wait is dr lenz okay he doesnt seem like the type to take compassionate leave i made it compulsory his wifes murder put him over the edge now thats it ill see you at the trial if there is one and hes gone if there is one a sudden memory sends a chill across the back of my neck i am sitting in the new orleans police station telling the fbi that i know who the killer is david m strobekker and i have the strangest feeling that this new york doctor baxter thinks hes about to arrest or take out will turn out to be as dead as strobekker was but of course he cant be baxter said they have him under surveillance chapter blackness explodes into light and pain a burst of brightness cored with shimmering dark i spring up from something soft sure im in a nightmare until the light resolves into a figure standing in a doorway with one hand on a light switch drewe are you okay she asks i rub my fingers hard through my hair to get the blood flowing im on the den couch again i guess i fell asleep i dont even remember how i got in here she smiles tightly and moves down the hall toward the kitchen still disoriented i follow and sit down at the table drewe stands at the sink drinking water from a glass theres an aspirin bottle on the counter with a quick movement she puts it back into the cabinet over the sink headache she nods but doesnt speak bad day she opens the refrigerator and takes out a diet dr pepper looking at the drink can she says is miles still here no so he wouldnt tell the fbi anything thats not it the police showed up right after you left this morning he barely got away shes looking at me now it doesnt matter anyway the fbi called theyve identified the killer theyve probably arrested him by now really marginal interest hes a doctor just like you guessed she nods looks back down at the dr pepper can drewe whats the matter she shakes her head silently drewe the sight of my wife bowing her head into her hands to hide tears is something i havent seen in a very long time i come to my feet my stomach churning with anxiety whats going on did somebody die is it your parents she shakes her head violently what then she drops her hands from her wet face and stares at me as though pleading for an explanation patrick beat up erin what patrick hit erin last night more than once but why what happened she wont tell me i stopped by their house on my way out of jackson i saw the bruises the second she answered the door i cannot think whitehot rage blots out all reason before i know what im doing ive snatched drewes car keys off the counter and started for the hall where are you going she asks grabbing my arm to rip that son of a bitch a new asshole harper dont thats not the way it isnt what would it solve he wont hit her anymore you dont know that if i wanted revenge id tell daddy what happened and hed drive to jackson and blow patricks head off then where would erin and holly be i stop trying to pull free where is holly is she okay drewe drops her arm and retreats back into the u of the kitchen patrick wouldnt hurt holly you know that i dont know anything where is she home im sure is patrick there too i assume hell go there after he finishes his rounds drewe what the hell is going on i dont know they had an argument last night the worst yet but she wont say what it was about all i know is that erin believes the beating was her fault nothing justifies beating your wife drewe meets my eyes with a piercing gaze erin says she deserved it how quickly anger can give way to fear this can only be about one thing harper she says quietly i think shes having an affair i have stopped breathing my effort to look normal is wasted drewe has turned away and begun poking listlessly through the refrigerator seemingly oblivious to the thunderclap reaction in me did she tell you that i ask no but its the only thing that makes sense we all know how she used to be a plate of leftover chicken rattles on the counter the only thing i can guess is that after three years of trying to be faithful she found she couldnt what else could make her feel guilty enough to stay with patrick after he beat her you dont want to know drewe shakes her head again still patrick is the last man i would expect to lose control over something like that i nod like a robot harper jesus i want to ask you something i am looking straight into the most vulnerable expression i have ever seen on my wifes face are you sleeping with erin the directness of the question almost breaks my composure for three years i have prayed this suspicion would never be voiced now it cleaves the air between us like the blade of a guillotine what the hell are you talking about im sorry she says quickly you dont have to deny it you think i am having an affair with her how can you even ask that drewes face is pale its the only thing i can see making patrick mad enough to hit erin once the thought got into my head i couldnt make it go away and you and i havent been making love because of of me getting off the pill jesus drewe im not sleeping with your sister i know shes attractive sexually i mean drewe dont lie to me harper her lower lip is quivering thats all i ask just dont lie just dont lie how many times have i heard that phrase and from how many women drewe is poised like a teacup on the edge of a table the slightest touch will shatter her into irrecoverable fragments when i answer i enunciate each word my voice filled with the conviction of an apostle im not sleeping with erin drewe i wouldnt screw her if she climbed naked into my bed at three in the morning like sunlight burning through fog belief lights drewes eyes she bows her head again and wipes away new tears god i dont know what im saying i think seeing those bruises just about did me in i hesitate then lean forward and hug her as tightly as i can its going to be all right i murmur rocking her gently theyll get it straightened out i dont know whatever it is it may have gone too far please god no you cant do anything about it tonight why dont you take a valium or something from your bag just climb under the covers and blank your mind you know i never take sedatives maybe today rates an exception she shakes her head and pulls back enough to look into my eyes you know what would make me feel better what if youd sleep with me forget about those damned murders and just curl up with me i feel about as sleepy as a strungout addict but i am not stupid thats the best suggestion ive heard in a month go on and wash your face ill be there in a minute shouldnt we eat something ill make some sandwiches and bring them to the bedroom she smiles as she walks down the hall i sag back against the counter for the first time calling the police after karins death feels like a mistake though i see no connection it seems that my involvement in the hunt for brahma somehow accelerated the implosion of erin and patricks marriageto the point that i stand here now in fear that my own will not survive the week just dont lie to me that line should be added to the three biggest lies in the world all women say it but none of them mean it they think they mean it but what they really mean is that they want there to be nothing for you to have to lie about more sobering still this plea forms the rationale for a very dangerous act just come clean says your conscience confess now and everything will finally be all right the way it used to be but it wont women are human beings and its not human nature to forget any more than it is to forgive once the soft circuits of human memory are inflamed with carnal images they can never be erased more often they grow and metastasize until they take on more passion than mortal bodies could ever experience and flay the soul of the betrayed with pain as unbearable as any physical torture of course keeping back a guilty secret has its own consequences as i know too well it is a slow poison and thorough yet it does its work primarily on the betrayer if one bears up under the strain almost everything can be salvaged my reasoning is simple every time in my life i ever confessed anything no good came of it the truth was known hallelujah and everybody was miserable the lesson was plain deny deny deny and two minutes ago when put to the test ive feared so long i held true to my belief i did the best thing for everybody so why do i feel like shit drewe and i never finished our sandwiches we never even started them when i climbed onto the bed with the plate she pushed aside the covers and without words pulled me under them with her she was naked she quickly made me that way and for the first time in months i had not the slightest suspicion that her desire had anything to do with her quest to become pregnant all i sensed was a desperate flight from everything conscious a willful narrowing of the external world a plunge into the only fire that can truly expunge grief and pain drewe was not drewe she was a woman who looked like drewe yet moved and urged and cried out without any of the baggage drewe carries through everyday lifeduty and selfreproach and secondguessing and obligation to familyonly wide green eyes and pale smooth skin and the unruly auburn hair she was born with all through it i knew that this intensity so long withheld this energy repressed was what i had always been drawn to in her had believed that i could bring out in time but i never did it took the shattering of routine to do it an eruption of violence and fear into her rigidly defined existence a shock sufficient to cut her moorings and force her into uncharted water and it will not last for all the power of her latent passion drewe is a creature of equilibrium even now her regular breathing fills the room like the sound of an organic clock measuring the halflife of dreams ive rested fitfully in desultory lapses of consciousness that never quite dissolve into sleep a while ago i had an absurd dream i was a young whale thrashing in the shallows near a volcanic beach kicking and rolling toward deeper water yet unable to reach the ledge of the great rock shelf and drop into the blueblack haven of peace and forgetfulness im only thankful the air conditioner is holding its own against the night heat the ring of the phone stuns me like a klaxon and i grab for it hoping to keep it from waking drewe cole yes whos this daniel baxter what is it you got brahma brahma the killer the unsub no we didnt i sit up on the edge of the bed a strange buzzing in the back of my head drewes clock reads two am you missed him no we got the guy we were watching he was the wrong guy but you said you traced the plane we did and it was owned by this doctor right identification numbers everything only this plane hasnt been off the ground for six months this guys a classic doctor takes up a new hobby every six months buys all the best equipment then gets bored and moves on to the next one right now hes into hightech scuba diving youre sure its the wrong guy absolutely we nailed him as he was walking up to a house turns out he was best man at a wedding inside his brothers wedding he had alibis for every single murder hes also got one of the best lawyers in new york and hes already said publicly that hell sue for wrongful arrest i dont get it what explains the plane heres what i think the unsub has his own plane he wants to use it to get to his killing sites but he doesnt want it traceable to him he could try using fake registration number decals but in real life that kind of stuff never works so he asks around and eventually he finds a guy who has the same model plane he does but doesnt fly much like a doctor then he finds an outoftheway airstrip to house his plane the first time he takes it there its already painted with the numbers of this doctors plane not only that hes dummied up a license in the doctors name as well see once the original scene is played he doesnt have to fake anything whenever he goes to that strip hes doctor soandso not himself you there cole fully awake now i speak softly so as not to wake drewe i can see that working but cant you just search airports until you find another beechcraft with those numbers or trace every sale of that model for the past twenty years were trying now im calling because my people say you never faxed us the printouts of your sessions with the killer i feel a wave of confusion like the one i felt when drewe startled me awake in the living room jesus im sorry when you told me you practically had the guy it just knocked out all the tension of the past week i crashed i know how you feel but i need everything you have right now glancing back at drewe i memorize the fax number baxter reads off if the stuff he told me is true you might have enough to id him just from the printouts i hope so one other thing cole what wheres miles turner i sigh angrily i dont know and im tired of being asked dont make it worse on yourself you hid him out you aided and abetted youre right i aided and abetted a friend who has nothing to do with these murders he was trying to solve the goddamn things for you and he still may do it what does that mean whats he doing whatever it is its over my head is he the one who came up with the tissue donor network angle actually that was my wife i think looking at drewe bundled under the covers but im not about to put her on the fbis agenda yes i say evenly anything else not for now just fax that stuff through youll get it what about eros you going to leave it shut down were discussing that right now im out of it now mr baxter just remember that as lightly as i can i get up from the bed and go to my office its still a wreck i remove the brahma printouts from the bottom drawer of my filing cabinet where id hidden them in case drewe broke her own rule and entered the office walking to the fax machine i notice that i forgot to edit out the details of erins liaison with her sisters husband baxter may not recognize the truth behind that story but eventually someone in the unit will put it together even without lenzs help with a black magic marker i blot out the lines that contain my personal revelations then gather up the mess and begin loading pages into the fax machine it takes a while to feed them all through long enough to develop a cramp in my back from bending over the machine when im done i realize i promised to fax copies to miles as well i stretch my back and repeat the process as the last group of pages starts to go through my office telephone rings normally id let the machine get it but its late enough now that the possible callers are pretty limited it me says miles when i pick up the cordless you safe going with the flow whats up the trojan horse didnt work he says this as though his best friend just died design flaw hell no a timing thing what do you mean cant tell you im hanging up now wait a minute cut the bullshit then your phone could be tapped man i no longer care the fbi missed brahma by the way they arrested the wrong guy miles hesitates im aware i say nothing you never faxed me the brahma stuff he says i just put it through to eros now tell me about the trojan horse after a long silence he begins to speak in the mister rogers tone he uses to explain technical matters to people like me the code i wrote is hidden in the compressed data of erins jpeg photo right when brahma downloaded the jpeg to his computer he pulled the horse into his city when he tried to view it erins photo went up onto the screen just fine but right before it did my program slipped away and made a nest in another part of his computer once every twentyfour hoursat onethirty amthat program will wake up and use brahmas eros interface to dial my eros mailbox once the connection is made itll download a copy of whatever it finds on brahmas hard drive and id be very surprised if his name wasnt in there somewhere i feel a sudden rush of hope thats actually possible unless brahma got suspicious of the single black line in the image and detected the hidden code its going to happen the only question is how soon how obvious is this black line its practically invisible i fixed it so its hidden by the dark stone at the bottom of the photo im marching around the office with the cordless youre a genius man youre going to get him well see miles says with uncharacteristic modesty how did you come up with onethirty am analyzed brahmas recent traffic patterns that was one of his least active times does his computer have to be on for this to work yes if hes at his computer when it happens will he see it no if theres another program running the trojan horse wont activate but if his computers off it cant activate right but i figure he leaves all his computers on just like me and anybody else who knows anything about computers unless its a notebook so tonight he was working at his computer at onethirty bet on it damn youre going to crack this thing youre going to i stop in the center of the room staring at the eros computer screen harper ive got email eros mail who from i walk to the computer and click the mouse on the email icon its brahma hes using maxwell i thought eros was shut down whats the time stamp on the message thirty minutes ago damn how can he be in the system if its shut down shut down doesnt mean switched off it just means the servers are closed to subscribers theyre still running so hes in the system he obviously got an email message through ill start checking what does the message say i read it aloud into the phone erin i know you told me not to send email but i had to i cannot express what i feel at this moment i received the photograph and it was astounding everything you said was true i stored the image in a program that allows me to view it from any angle to modify it as i wish even create a moving montage yet every modification every turn or inversion is a desecration of the original i can only imagine what it must be to behold you in three dimensions reflect on all i told you imagine what i withheld be assured that i am your deliverance your dark prince thats it miles yells weve got him going and coming and he has no idea maybe i allow strangely sobered by brahmas reappearance in my life what about the master client list did jan remember dating anybody who seemed suspicious shes been out with a couple of doctors but theyre not likely candidates shes hired private investigators to check them out though how are you going to answer brahmas message im not he sighs unhappily any typos in the message no its pretty short though why do you keep asking me that if hes using voicerec hes back at his home base and i think thats new york why the false airplane registration for one thing the way that was set up how do you know about that he ignores the question brahma had to know about this anesthesiologist to pick his plane for a front other things point to new york though i also happen to like the idea know what i mean i make an affirmative noise not wanting to state the obvious if miles is glad brahmas home base is new york its not because innocent women are unlikely to die in the next couple of days but because miles has managed to get back there himself and if his trojan horse works as planned tomorrow night he can be there for the endgame i am about to ring off when he speaks again unable to resist letting me know how deeply this hunt has worked itself into his blood you know what english fox hunters used to say dont you enlighten me in at the death i grunt neutrally just remember something brahmas no fox he laughs and im no englishman ciao after putting down the phone i save brahmas message then sit down on the bed its a mistake in seconds i am lying on my back half conscious and fading fast as sleep washes over me i see redcoated men riding horses through misty fields of dying cotton their horses legs thrashing and crackling through the dried brown stalks far out in front dogs howl madly as the horses close the gap and then gather in a ring around a tiny hole in a grasscovered hill someone lights a bundle of straw then sets it by the hole while the dogs guard the back entrance to the den the men on horses swig scotch and congratulate each other saying in at the death old man in at the death then someone says theyve made a mistake the den is empty and the dogs tear off across the fields again and i sit there on my horse like the others drinking scotch with the sun on my back watching a shadow grow longer and broader on the ground in front of us i want to turn around to see what is making that shadow but i cant seem to move i can hear though and what i hear is a wild black animal voice making human sounds for the first time mangling the simple syllables trying again and again until they become distinct and form the sound their maker intended laughter chapter cotton picking began this morning not the full harvest but scattered bands of men and machines controlled by farmers who got fed up with staring at stunted cotton that would grow no more before the drought finally broke and soaking rain flooded the scorched fields and a moneyeating rot set in men who felt like fools for gambling against god by putting out growth regulators at the wrong times and who finally just said fuck it and called their hands and fired up the fourrow pickers to try to salvage what they could from my front porch i watch gunmetal clouds gathering over my neighbors fields they hover with mocking heaviness unmoved by wind or by the drone of the mechanical pickers drewe left early this morning for her clinic in yazoo city ive passed most of the day walking from room to room avoiding my office no one has called few cars have passed on the road and despite the slow dusty progress of the pickers the whole world seems to be waiting the ring of my office phone is almost a welcome sound i trot through the front door and veer left expecting daniel baxters voice from the machine or miless but i hear neither its drewe and she sounds shaken im here i say picking up harper i need you to drive to jackson right now what whats wrong im afraid erin might hurt herself what she threatened to kill herself no she told me everything was fine then what everything is not fine we know that but she told me shed found a way to solve all her problems she said it might be painful for everyone for a while but in the end it would be for the best i feel like my body temperature is plummeting i want you to go right now wouldnt she rather see you i ask she doesnt want me there id go anyway but ive got a difficult delivery on my hands it could be a while drewe im the last person erin wants butting into her problems she doesnt even like me harper please erin respects you more than any man she knows youve got to be kidding then why did she tell me that now get your butt over to jackson and talk her out of doing anything stupid get her out of there if you have to and take her where bring her to our house do whatever you have to do and if she wont come figure something out please get going im on my way call me if it gets crazy and ill find someone to handle this delivery if it gets crazy i set down the phone and glance around the office for my keys this situation is long past crazy and i have a feeling its going to get worse erin and patrick live in the belhaven district of jackson most people at their income level long ago moved out to the enclaves of ridgeland and madison but patrick took advantage of white flight to trade up to palatial quarters for a bourgeois price i managed to make the whole hourandtwentyminute drive from rain without thinking i popped in joni mitchells hejira and turned it up to the pain threshold following jaco pastoriuss fretless bass as it wound through the spaces between larry carltons guitar and the soaring vocal but now im here the front door of the house has one of those burled finishes youd expect to find at a victorian mens club i hammer the big brass knocker and wait listening to the blows reverberate over the slate and hardwood floors inside at least a minute passes before i hear heels clacking theres a rustle at the curtained windows to one side of the door then stillness again i try the handle then push open the door erin stands just inside looking at me with preternatural calm her facial bruises are yellow at the edges setting them off from the tanned skin that might otherwise have masked the damage the orbit of her left eye is a continuous contusion like an indigo map of an island flecks of blood dot the corner of the eye itself a closed fist delivered that blow shes wearing a linen sundress the color of lilac it lies as smoothly against her upper body as a silk camisole billows slightly at her waist another bruise marks her left breast where it disappears into the dress her hair is tied up with a dark spray falling around the back of her neck she wears no shoes earrings or wristwatch no wedding ring come in she says turning away and walking through the entrance hall were in the tv room is patrick here the back of her head turns once from side to side as she moves deeper into the house i fear that drewe may be right about the danger here the air conditioner is not running which on this day is evidence enough of mental instability ahead of me erin walks with the grace she always possessed yet her fluidity seems oddly exaggerated the dimness and heat increase with each step i take i have a disturbing vision of myself following an egyptian girl into a tomb what do i sense here resolve some decision has been taken a choice has been made in cold deliberation and the weight of it is tangible as erin steps out of the dark hallway and into a blue glow fear suffuses me not for myself but for what i might find at the end of this brief journey where is holly screams my brain i quicken my steps hurrying after erin hoping to prevent any madness that might remain unconsummated then i see holly shes propped on thick pillows in front of patricks treasured fiftytwoinch television her back is to me and she doesnt seem to be moving i dont see erin at first then my eyes pick her out of the shadows seated in a cushioned chair against the wall to my left her long bare legs stretched across an ottoman i move quickly to holly and lean over her her eyes are barely open i stare with frantic intensity at the little belly beneath the precious cargo tshirt watching for the rise and fall of respiration she is breathing with relief cascading through me i swoop her up from the floor as though she were weightless youre going to wake her up erin says i lay hollys head on my left shoulder and begin rocking her gently as i walk around the room put her down erin insists its nap time shell be comatose by the time ursula the sea witch shows up i turn toward the tv and see the comforting yellow splash that is flounder then the orange hair of ariel the little mermaid whats going on erin what do you mean turn on the lights theyll wake up holly i dont care youre not her mother i youre not that either she snaps except in the genetic sense youre the sperm donor what are you doing here anyway drewe called me shes worried about you erin gets to her feet and moves toward me give her to me shes already asleep first tell me nothing crazy is going on here that hollys okay what her voice drops to a threatening whisper yougivememychildthis instant reluctantly i release the little body that is flesh of my flesh yet resides under another mans roof under another mans protection erin leaves the room with her when she returns she is alone she clicks on the overhead light stretches out on the chair and ottoman and studies me as if i am some nonhuman creature of trifling interest now she says what are you doing here i grope for words that will not sound pompous but find none talk about a fools errand content to let me suffer in silence erin says nothing who are we i wonder two people who three years ago thrashed around a bed in chicago for three days and somehow produced the beautiful child who now stands unknowing in the eye of a gathering emotional hurricane one thing is certain whatever we shared is finally gone a few nights ago when erin sat down on my bed and began crying i felt a response a pulling toward her even through her despair i sensed desire a possibility of consummation however mad it would have been but today there is nothing if a landscape of her emotions could somehow be superimposed upon this room we would be sitting in a blasted gray ruin devoid of vegetation and fast running out of water its probably good that youre here she says finally itll make things simpler how patrick and i have been having some discussions violent ones thats completely irrelevant and all my fault i doubt that dont has my name come up during these discussions a faint smile touches her lips god youre so predictable all youre worried about is yourself or maybe drewes precious illusions being shattered right thats all anybody ever worries about im worried about you too and holly spare me okay youre here because drewe told you to come and you couldnt get out of it without telling her the truth about us right she doesnt wait for verification let me put your mind at rest your worst fear is right on target the problems between patrick and me are about hollys father nothing else im not sure what is happening to my face but it must be funny in an awful sort of way because erin is laughing at me youd better sit down she advises i back gingerly to a sofa and drop onto it its all going to come out she says in a matteroffact voice i peer across the shadowed room at her face a study in selfpossession why is that because it has to we were stupid to ever think it wouldnt she makes a steeple of her long fingers and studies me over it youre terrified that drewe cant take the truth arent you you think she can erin suddenly begins speaking in drewes voice quoting lines im sure drewe has never spoken erin screwed every goodlooking guy in school but dear sweet harper was above it thats what she thinks isnt it she knows im not above that oh you diddled some cheerleaders but thats not the same is it after all princess drewe wasnt putting out was she but to come to me thats another thing i didnt come to you erin you came to me and it was ten years after high school in her eyes thats worse stupid you werent a horny little seventeenyearold then you were supposed to be committed to her you were supposed to have judgment i think drewe may know us better than we think i doubt the attraction between us was as secret as we always thought i think maybe shes knows were not above it but she hopes we wouldnt do it but we did didnt we i say nothing she shakes her head you still think about it dont you what chicago i know you harper you tell yourself youd sell your soul never to have done it you lie awake at night sweating promising the dark that if only something would make it all unhappen youd never do anything like that again and five minutes after that youre standing in the bathroom making yourself come thinking about how it felt to be inside me how it felt to have supermodel erin sucking your precious weenie erin i gape as she hikes the lilac sundress up to her hips with a fierce flourish well there it is thats what its all about for you isnt it she is wearing skyblue panties but they are sheer and the black tangle beneath them is obvious in spite of everything my eyes lock there with three million years of evolutionary focus then the lilac veil falls and she is up on her feet with her hands in the air thats all men ever think about with me she cries turning away in anger because im not the girl you marry am i my past is just too much except for someone like patrick sweet hardworking rich impotent patrick my mouth falls open again oh were way past spats in the kitchen she says turning back when his obsession hit critical mass patricks plumbing stopped functioning in the last two months weve made love twice if you could call it that both times he came home drunk at midnight climbed on top of me and started flailing away before i could even wake up if i hadnt known what was making him crazy i would have hit him in the head with the telephone but you know what i did i told him i loved him and begged for more and as soon as i did that it was over he couldnt finish he doesnt have meanness like that in him she leans back and touches her bruised eye and i realize she is on the verge of tears and you know what what he deserves better than me thats not true erin better than what ive been giving him then i was a fool to make him promise never to ask who the father was she laughs i actually thought he was dr pretorius shes lost me whos that somebody from new york no stupid dr pretorius was cary grant what its a movie i thought you knew every movie ever made cary grant plays this wonderful doctor who marries a woman whos pregnant by another man and it all works out oh i was actually dumb enough to think a cary grant movie could come true but men arent wired that way they cant handle something like that and i should have known it god knows i know everything else about them erin oh dont stop me now maybe i did know that about men but i made patrick promise not to ask anyway you know why to protect drewe i didnt want drewes illusions shattered any more than you did and i knew if patrick found out about you and meabout hollydrewe would eventually find out everything in the heat of some family argument it would explode thats where we are anyway isnt it i point out except youre the one whos about to explode she shakes her head slowly and i sense sadness flowing into the place where her anger had seethed in a voice stripped of all hostility she says do you believe in sin harper at last i understand her strange intensity she has finally flipped out she is born again saved or whatever they call the manic grasping at straws that occurs when people whove damaged their lives beyond all repair hurl themselves into lunacy in the quest for one more chance for that mythical clean slate i know youre not religious she says calmly im not talking about that im talking about a sin against yourself against people you love people who trust you do you understand what i mean i dont know what to say when erin speaks again her voice is so soft i hear it as a shout what do you believe in harper out of the mouth of a distraught woman comes the question i have tried to answer since i started thinking for myself a question brahma asked me only yesterday and i am no closer to an answer now than i was when i was thirteen years old i guess i believe in honor keeping faith trying to do the right thing and consequences if you dont if you believe in that you believe in sin erin and that we have an obligation to try to make things right dont you not the way youre talking about youre talking about more pain too anxious to sit any longer i get to my feet and shake the tingles out of my arms and legs you know what i really believe in goddamn it its only now that i see it i believe in drewe in her optimism her trust her faith in happy endings that happiness is even possible i know theres nothing out there but an abyss but she doesnt or shes convinced herself she doesnt either way it doesnt matter my point is that if happiness is possible its going to be made by people like her people with the strength to hold on to their illusions in the face of all evidence to the contrary in the face of nothing erin watches me in silence for a long time i understand what youre saying some illusions are necessary but the reality sleeping on the piglet blanket back in my bedroom cant be ignored or suppressed or anything else holly may be a symbol of weakness something wed like to shield drewe from but she is also real and to have a life the life she deserves she needs both her parents and i dont mean you im sorry but thats the way it is so what do you want to do not want im going to tell patrick the truth about how holly was conceived tonight jesus god and youre going to tell drewe i am numb i try to tell myself this is not happening but the fact that my brain is trying to shut down my peripheral nervous system confirms that it is blood is rushing from my extremities to my core organs as surely if i were being chased by a man with a machete harper as i stare at erins bruised angelic faceher eyes burning with misplaced convictionseveral thoughts crystallize at the speed of light she means what she says about telling patrick she means to make me confess to drewe words will not stop her but one thing could she is speaking again but i hear only the blood in my ears a roaring blast like a divine voice shes the one who put you in this situation who showed up on your doorstep and stepped naked into your shower she could have told you she was pregnant before you married drewe she could have prevented all of this i feel sweat in my palms an electrical tensing in the muscles of my arms forced to choose which woman is more important to me i have chosen with dreamlike slowness i take two steps toward erin then another her eyes widen in puzzlement as she speaks i outweigh her by close to a hundred pounds but holly would never be the same would she i feel as though someone just slapped me are you listening to me harper i nod dully look down at my closed fists it was hollys name that broke my trance not the fact that drewe knows i am here or that i would almost certainly be caught if i hurt erin hollys name there are not two women in this insane emotional equation but three im listening i murmur dimly aware that ive dodged some point of no return did you take something today erin asks staring suspiciously at my eyes are you wired or what i laugh hollowly hell no youre the drug addict i resent that im sorry are you going to tell her or not erin because if you dont ill have to ill tell her goddamn it she is no more shocked by my shout than a ghetto kid by gunshots in a taut voice i add i just hope you realize what could happen because of all this she laughs softly and turns away i know better than anyone i think about it day and night you and i could lose everything we love but dont you see harper its also the only way we can truly have the things we love theyre not things erin theyre people she says nothing nothings going to change your mind she shakes her head and turns back to me her eyes wide and earnest this is the right thing harper i give her a brief hiss of scorn do you remember chicago she asks according to you i do two spots of color touch her cheeks i remember do you remember the strange thing that happened what you did for me that no one ever had she steps to within two feet of me and rests a sunbrowned hand on her flat abdomen i swallow and clear my throat you mean the passing out she nods you remember we talked about it how it was like a little death a momentary union with whatever is beyond life yes we had it backwards harper that wasnt death at all that was life the purest distillation of it the love we felt for each other i know what the little death is now its the way weve been living hiding our secret pretending things are fine every day having to pile one more lie on top of all the others to keep the house of cards from falling on top of us thats death dying a little each day dont you feel that i cannot quite grasp the fact that this is erin speaking there is absolute certainty in her voice her eyes in the set of her perfect mouth and the angle of her chin i guess theres nothing else to say i sigh with resignation she steps back and smooths her sundress yes there is one thing as insane as it is im glad youre hollys father youre a good man harper but patrick is too and hes my husband hes hollys father now and hes losing his mind i have a duty to do right by him by forcing me to destroy my wife drewe is stronger than you think shes stronger than any of us i hope youre right with proprietary boldness erin crosses the space between us and raises a hand to my left cheek her fingers linger there a moment cool and dry in the heat of the house they transmit the sensuality she has always embodied and something more we probably wont see each other for a long time she says her eyes wide and unblinking erin she rises on tiptoe and silences me with a soft kiss on the lips then turns and walks from the room my face burns from her touch as i make my way out of the house it hits me with humbling sadness that this grownup girl once known merely for having the bestlooking ass in the state of mississippi has much more than that she is a woman now and she has more courage than i the ride back to rain takes half again as long as the ride to jackson did i play no music i dont even run the air conditioner i just drive with the windows down and let the hot wind tear through my hair like the fingers of a grave robber i never actually thought it would come to this incredible as it seems i somehow convinced myself that the fates had been on vacation during the nights i rolled around that bed with erin or at least that theyd been watching someone else perhaps my vanity convinced me that the good things id done in my life had somehow built up a credit account from which karmic bills could be subtracted without my making any outofpocket payments but i was wrong the due date has arrived and the bank doesnt want an installment but the balance paid in full for a moment i wonder if miles is still free and safe but i dont spend more than a few seconds on him the events of the last few days now seem remote like some tragic newscast watched years ago a thousand thoughts spin through my brain and each has but one object drewe will she be home when i get there no ill have at least an hour to prepare maybe longer if the delivery is a really bad one but whats the point of preparation if she were there when i got home i could blurt out the truth in the first thirty seconds before doubt and fear turned me into a gutless jellyfish swinging around the final turn toward our house i see no surveillance cars i guess baxter isnt as concerned with me as he used to be but as i slow for the driveway i spy a boxy ford parked under the shade of our weeping willow babyshit brown with a tall antenna for an instant i think fbi then i see the mississippi tag i reach down and touch the butt of my where it protrudes from under the seat for all i know brahma could be sitting in that car i turn slowly into the drive coast forward and stop practically grille to grille with the ford there are two men inside as i stare its front doors open and both men get out the driver is a big redfaced man in his late thirties stuffed like a sausage into his polyester suit the other man is older and darker something about him seems familiar then he smiles crookedly at me and i recognize detective michael mayeux of the new orleans police harper cole says the redfaced stranger moving toward me with alarming speed yes im detective jim overstreet of the jackson police department youre under arrest for obstruction of justice and harboring a federal fugitive while i stare at mayeux in shock overstreet cuffs my hands in front of me and pulls me to the side of the brown car you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you mayeux refuses to look at me as he climbs back into the passenger seat one of overstreets big hands cups the crown of my head and pushes me down into the back do you understand these rights as they have been explained to you wait a minute what the hells going on here overstreet leans down so that his sunburned face fills the window do you understand the rights i just read you ass hole looking to mayeux for help all i see is the darkly freckled back of his neck through scarred wire mesh i understand overstreet slams the door chapter i feel the passage of time like lifeblood draining away mayeux acts like im not even in the backseat he and overstreet make small talk now and again but not about me my being locked in the back of this car means only one thing a power shift has occurred between the fbi and the police i want information but i dont have the stamina to keep banging away at mayeuxs sphinx act i keep seeing erin sitting in her dark house waiting for patrick to get home so she can finally blast away his obsessive suspicions with one terrible lifesize truth how long before these idiots let me use a phone can i just pay my bail and go no bail has to be set before it can be paid that means an arraignment can i get one this late in the afternoon do they have night court in jackson the thought that i might have to spend the night in a cell waiting to go before a judge makes me lightheaded what if i dont get home tonight will drewe call erin looking for me will erin think i broke under the stress and just took off would she really take it upon herself to tell drewe the truth can i please ask you a question i ask mayeux for the tenth time in a mushmouth drawl dripping irony detective overstreet says sounds like he might be developing the proper attitude mike whats on your mind asks mayeux still facing forward if you dont tell me what you want i cant give it to you told you he was smart says mayeux overstreet chuckles thats how he got so rich mayeux goes on everythings a business deal with this guy i remain silent and the resulting vacuum lasts a couple of miles left a few messages on your machine mayeux says finally you never called back i know im sorry look things were really crazy then you know what was going on besides your messages didnt sound that urgent didnt sound urgent enough for him mayeux says exaggerating his cajun accent urgent echoes overstreet like a redneck ed mcmahon mayeux laughs things feel pretty urgent now though i take a deep breath and try to keep my voice steady ill tell you whatever you want to know you dont have to do this i dont okay lets see wheres miles turner i dont know see mayeux says to overstreet i had a feeling it was going to be this way jesus detective this is a really bad time for me ive got to take care of something important bad time overstreet says shoulda called his secretary i dont have a fucking secretary the silence that follows this outburst is more threatening than any words overstreet clearly does not like his arrestees using profanity as the ford thunders eastward along the twolane blacktop i lean back and let my eyes rove across the endless fields here and there red or green cotton pickers trundle through the white ocean like great metal insects the steely clouds i saw this morning have not been scattered like all the rest in this parched summer they have gathered steadily like a ghostly confederate army amassing itself from the tattered remnants of a thousand skirmishes a fluid gray mass slowly being reinforced from unknown regions lets try again suggests mayeux wheres miles turner i cant tell you what i dont know youll have plenty of time to remember in your cell this is crazy detective he nods at the windshield ive been thinking that for several days now another image of erin flashes through my mind she faces drewe across a brightly lit room both women screaming both in tears to hell with mayeux and his head games its time to pull out the stops detective overstreet the mississippi cop grunts behind the wheel yeah i get a phone call right eventually well for your sake it better be sooner than later because i dont think the person im going to call is going to like a louisiana cop coming up here and arresting the soninlaw of one of his asshole buddies very slowly like a hog looking around for the source of a mildly interesting noise overstreet heaves himself around in his seat his forearm looks as thick as my thigh who you think you gon call boy i try not to look past him to see whether were going off the road the governor of the state of mississippi the first time you let me near a telephone his face does not change hes heard a thousand threats like this hes bullshitting you says mayeux take the wheel says overstreet mayeux obeys now boy whose soninlaw you say you were i didnt say well say goddamn it bob anderson overstreet stares without blinking a long measuring gaze calling the governor to save my ass in the name of my fatherinlaw is the last thing i would ever do but he doesnt know that you know this guy anderson asks mayeux his voice edgy bob anderson from yazoo city asks overstreet his eyes boring into mine thats him shit what does that mean asks mayeux trying to hold the car on beam and watch me at the same time huh overstreet blows air from distended cheeks and takes his time about answering it means you might have talked me into biting off a big piece of trouble mike mayeux groans furiously what the fuck are you saying you saying some people are above the law up here no overstreet lifts his forearm and lets his weight slide him back into position behind the steering wheel but some peoples tails you dont step on unless you absolutely have to and dont tell me its any different down in new orleans cause i know its worse shit curses mayeux slamming the dash with an open hand shit im sick of people protecting this son of a bitch he is obstructing justice i can prove it hes obstructing it in louisiana not here its a federal case he harbored a federal fugitive in mississippi youre holding cole for the fbi your chief okayed the arrest overstreets voice sounds even more somnolent than before most of thats bullshit and you know it mike im out of my jurisdiction and you dont even want the bureau to know weve got this guy are these state or federal charges against me i ask shut the fuck up snaps mayeux ill take full responsibility jim youre not suggesting we let him go are you no but the minute we hit the station im telling the chief how things stand if he wants to let cole walk hes gone the remainder of the ride passes in frosty silence i wish theyd let the windows down so i could sniff the air for the rain smell rain wouldnt do the cotton any good now but after months of drought my need for water is almost physical like the dull headache i get after going too long without caffeine as we pull into jackson i ponder a backup plan if the chief wont kick me loose on the basis of my relationship to bob anderson i know three or four friends from college who practice criminal law here plus at least thirty more who do corporate work there are probably more ole miss lawyers in jackson than there are cops ive got money in a couple of banks here so bail shouldnt be a problem the problem is time suddenly a string of letters flickers before my eyes and i hear them as if read aloud by a chilling digital voice i am subject to one god above me and that god is time brahma knows whereof he speaks thirtysix minutes after mayeux and overstreet walked me into jackson police headquarters i was released on my own recognizance with an assurance that no arrest would be recorded against my name i guess my fatherinlaw wasnt exaggerating when he said he had connections god only knows what ties bob anderson has to the people who run this state but right now i dont care the oft maligned oldboy network seems pretty wonderful when youre sitting chained in a police station of course that system only works if you have access to it but ill worry over the moral implications when i get time like maybe next year right now i have one overwhelming need transportation inside the station i was thinking of making some kind of deal with mayeux for a ride back home but he stomped out right after the chief told overstreet to cut me loose now my only options are to hit up a friend for a car or take a cab to the airport and rent one my hand is on the sticky receiver of a parking lot pay phone when a blaring horn forces me to cover my ears the driver keeps jabbing it and i look around angrily searching for the source of the deepthroated honk its mayeux hes parked about thirty feet away in a vintage blue cadillac waving for me to come over stuck he calls genially as if the past two hours never transpired ill get back i could give you a ride like hell i say but im tempted riding with mayeux would save me some embarrassing calls plus he could ignore the speed limit all the way if he wanted to why did you pull this crap i ask him walking toward the cadillac why didnt you just talk to me when i got home his smile disappears because the fbi has fucked up this investigation from the getgo today was the first chance i had to get at you without having to go through them and i was sick of your evasions i knew youd hold back whatever you wanted in your own house i figured a police station would loosen you up a little i just didnt count on you having that much juice the fucking governor jesus look i really need to get home fast ill go with youand talk to youon one condition whats that you floor this bastard all the way mayeux grins and cranks the caddy you waitin on me you walkin backwards cher jump in he pops a magnetized blue flasher on the roof and switches it on before we even reach the city limits something going down he asks cutting his eyes at me that why youre in a hurry i dont know the sky to the west toward the delta is nearly black with piled cloud i have a foreboding sense of things spinning out of control like battlefield blindness where you know only what is happening where you stand but are dimly aware that great wheels of action are whirling in the fog around you just a bad feeling i tell him trying to push it all away hey i been there something i might need to know about its personal he nods gamely mayeux isnt happy but he can deal with it maybe his drive up from new orleans wont turn out to be a waste after all bad weather he says raising a forefinger off the wheel to point ahead heat lightning splashes through the sky giving the cloudscape the massive scale of an ansel adams photograph i ask him why he thinks the fbi messed up the investigation baxter and lenz kept us from sweating you in new orleans wed have played the whole thing different woulda been better for you and better for us and maybe wed have that son of a bitch by now instead of the fbi running around embarrassing themselves and everybody else by arresting the wrong fuckin guy i doubt this but i dont say so i gotta tell you for a while i was wondering if it wasnt lenz himself doing those ladies i mean classic case you know shrink does the murders for his own kinky reasons then takes the starring role in the hunt for himself mayeux laughs serial killers love that kind of shit making fools out of cops staying involved in the crimes long after theyre done this guy sure hit the doctor where it hurts didnt he lenz is smart detective he just lost sight of the danger i knew a lot of guys like him in chicago trading futures one day they were bulletproof the next somebody was padlocking their houses and seizing their bank accounts after a couple of beats mayeux says in a confiding tone i play a little in the market myself nickleanddime stuff never tried commodities but im open to it got any tips for an honest cop you sound like columbo the cajun columbo he pulls a sour face buy mutual funds and blue chips and forget them anything else is a losing game for you why because you cant beat the market from where you are you havent got the money or the time he nods sagely but hell drop a few thousand on some halfbaked brotherinlaw tip before six months are up what about turner he asks that boys got alibi problems i know but hes not the killer i pause i wasnt sure at first but i know now he cuts his eyes at me again okay but look is he queer or what it aint like i care or anything but itd clear up my thinking you know i wonder where mayeux is getting his information i dont know if he is or isnt and i dont care i think hes trying to protect a married lover by keeping quiet about his whereabouts on the nights of the murders whether that lover is a man or a woman is anybodys guess mercifully mayeux speaks no more i watch the dark sky and wonder if drewe is on the road home yet shes probably done with the delivery by now but you can never tell with babies i jump in my seat the first time thunder shakes the car this is no empty threat booming hollow over the fields and dying into nothing it rattles my eardrums buffets the reservoir of dead air at the bottom of my lungs hammers the car like a bass drum in a gymnasium mayeux feels it too hes from new orleans where rain is a constant companion but even he hunches in his seat when a big blast rocks the car otherwise he remains silent eating up the miles with a determined stare perhaps some of my apprehension has seeped into him suddenly there is wind against the car where there was none before it whines at the seam of the windshield hisses at the windows then the rain is upon us big round drops splatter on the glass like pellets from a sawedoff shotgun then a hail of water engulfs us like enfiladed musket fire shit mayeux curses slowing the cadillac to fortyfive try to keep your speed up i urge him hey im trying i tap my fingers nervously against the dashboard this deltas some fuckin flat he grumbles leaning forward and squinting into the rain a minute ago i was gonna say it was like the atchafalaya swamp without the water but i guess we got the water now one of gods little jokes yeah the caddy crawls through the downpour mayeux struggling to keep his eyes on the faded white line that marks the right margin of the highway what kind of shoulder we got he asks flat dirt about fifteen feet but if you go into a cotton field we wont be getting out until somebody comes with a winch great how much farther we got were about four miles out hey you see that something in mayeuxs voice brings me erect in my seat what blue lights way off there to the left where look he says pointing thats a blue bar making that mississippi highway patrol guy must be pretty gungho to stop speeders in this rain i narrow my eyes to slits and probe the gray wall for blue light there a sapphire halo pulsing far to the left as i stare a terrible premonition tightens my gut fire i ask praying for a yes wrong color thats police lights lots of em looks like mississippi highway patrol or some local sheriffs department where you think that is i think its my house mike punch it hey im pushing now floor this motherfucker the sudden acceleration presses me back into my seat mayeux flicks on his blue flasher and we hurtle through the wall of rain like teenage lovers with a death wish even with mayeux tempting fate i grip the caddys padded armrest and will the car to go faster the sapphire glow quickly blossoms into a flashing ball like a miniature mushroom cloud what the hell could have happened part of me knows the answer but i fight that knowledge with all my soul unwilling to believe that brahma has somehow penetrated miless digital shield that i have exposed drewe to the whitehot flame of his insanity we blast through rain proper like a blue monorail leaving a howling vacuum for a wake slow down half a mile to the turn mayeux touches the brake gently then begins pumping it as the riot of flashing blue and red differentiates into distinct images squad cars sheriffs cruisers rescue and highway patrol vehicles they surround our farmhouse like a motorized posse mayeux turns into the drive and pulls as far forward as he can im out of the car and sprinting through the rain before he even shifts into park wait up cole i run for the porch dodging between cars stunned by the amount of light pouring from our house two bluewhite flashes suddenly blank out my office windows stop someone shouts a knot of uniformed men blocks the front door i charge them without pausing triggering a metallic flurry of gun slides and hammers freeze this is my house i shout throwing up my arms in the face of a half dozen pistol barrels wheres my wife freeze asshole i finally stop in an ankledeep puddle at the foot of the porch steps barely able to contain my panic anybody know this guy asks a mississippi state trooper with rain sluicing off his hat brim hes okay shouts mayeux from behind the detective skids to a stop beside me with his wallet open mike mayeux new orleans homicide this guy owns the house whats going on oneeightyseven says the trooper a double who got it is that a murder i shout get out of my fucking way the cops start to restrain me but mayeux manages to get in front and by some combination of civility and intimidation clear a path through them drewe i scream wildly drewe where are you nothing another group of cops blocks the door of my office harper a female voice i careen up the hall leaving mayeux behind harper is that you drewe whirls from the kitchen sink dwarfed by uniformed men at both shoulders her white blouse is covered with blood her eyes blanker than ive ever seen them i run to her and grab her by the arms hearing the uniforms say my name but ignoring them searching her body for wounds feeling the reassuring tightness of her biceps are you hurt she shakes her head violently no but i couldnt couldnt do anything what happened i ask touching her bloody blouse it wont come out she says her chest heaving drewe what happened suddenly her face crumples as if the supporting structures beneath have simply melted away erins dead she whispers i blink no i just left her at the words die in my throat as one of the men beside her nods ssomebody she stutters horrible i was too late couldnt do anything an image of patrick graham flashes in my brain mr cole says one of the uniforms whom i finally recognize as sheriff buckner from yazoo city we need to get your wife calmed down she gave a statement already but she cant seem to stop shaking and she wont let the paramedics near her where have you been drewe asks suddenly harper did you go see her like i asked you yes she was fine when i left her the police arrested me afterward they took me back to jackson as drewe shakes her head new panic seizes my heart wheres holly nothing happened to holly mamas she murmurs erin dropped her off at mamas dropped her off how do you know first thing i thought of called i didnt tell her about erin though i couldnt do it i couldnt i pull her to my chest and wrap my arms around her what exactly went down here asks an authoritative voice from behind me detective mike mayeux new orleans homicide were not sure mister growls sheriff buckner got two dead women in an office room up front erin died here i gasp trying to mesh my memory of our confrontation in jackson with what buckner is saying where did you think she died he asks i saw her in jackson this afternoon i just assumed he stares at me with unveiled suspicion then he turns to mayeux and says one deceased is mrs coles sister the others a jane doe foreigner by the look of her a wave of unreasoning fear shunts through me what kind of foreigner who knows real dark woman asian maybe indian they all look the same dont they the information is coming too fast for me to absorb it one thought dominates my mind get drewe out of here are you finished with my wife sheriff for the moment he says slowly i want to take her into our bedroom get her away from all this fine but i want you to take a look at that foreign woman you might recognize her right now next few minutes anyhow before they load her out who else knows about this i put in a call to the memphis hotel where dr andersons staying but he was out i left a message for him to call here or my office if he cant reach here the mention of bob anderson hits me like a belly punch who else as of now nobody your wife said not to tell anybody but this is a real small town son you know that you or your wife better call margaret anderson before she hears it from somebody else theres a husband too right in jackson ill take care of that they been having any marital problems drewe suddenly goes stiff as if the possibility of patrick being the killer has just occurred to her i squeeze her reassuringly hes not a killer sheriff please give me a few minutes with my wife then ill answer all your questions i push past mayeux and a couple of strangers and shepherd drewe into our bedroom turning on only the bathroom light i sit her gently on the bed and kneel before her in the shadows her eyes are unfocused i have never seen anything affect her like this in our family drewe is famous for nerves of steel now shes a rag doll drewe honey no response i have a thousand questions but none can be asked without forcing her to relive whatever horror she just endured can you hear me drewe her face remains impassive taking advantage of her near catatonia i quickly strip off the bloodstained blouse and toss it into a corner she doesnt resist i lay her back on the bed and remove her shoes and khakis then pull a crocheted comforter off a rocker and drape it carefully over her erin she cries suddenly instantly buckner is inside the bedroom gun in hand i wave him out angrily im right here i tell her laying my hand on her cold forehead its harper everythings okay im going to take care of everything after about a minute i rise and pad into the bathroom to scan the contents of her medicine cabinet nothing opening the hall door a crack i catch mayeuxs eye as he talks with buckner in the hall he moves quickly to me there should be a black medical bag somewhere i tell him my wife uses it to stitch up local kids stuff like that check the hall closet its evidence he replies she apparently tried to resuscitate her sister christ i think shutting out another bloody rush of images just get me the bag mike all i need is one bottle and a syringe his eyes narrow what you gonna do you aint no doctor are you my father was look ive done everything from shooting x rays to stitching people up just get me the bag mayeux speaks quietly to buckner who looks at me then nods satisfied i go back into the bedroom and kneel beside drewe she is still shivering beneath the comforter her eyes wide and glassy its okay i whisper im here its okay dont think dont think im going to make everything all right just get warm warm a crack of light falls across the bed here you go whispers mayeux i quickly scan the contents of the bag and select a vial of vistaril and a cc syringe i hate to shoot her but i doubt i could make drewe swallow pills and pills might not even dent the psychological trauma shes sustained mayeux watches as i load ccs of vistaril into the syringe invert it thump the barrel and nudge the plunger to evacuate the air bubbles if drewe were fully aware she would never allow this but she doesnt even flinch when i slip the needle into the muscle of her arm and empty the contents of the syringe the crack of light disappears from the bed with drewe held tight in my arms i murmur incessantly half of what i say makes no sense its the same maternal mantra ive heard erin use when shes trying to put holly to sleep constant reassurance the tone more important than the words an orally generated security blanket that lulls the senses almost as effectively as narcotics at last she is under her breathing deep and sonorous tucking the comforter under her bare feet i move to the door and step quickly outside buckner and mayeux are waiting you ready asks the sheriff this is my first good look at buckner hes a big stolid man of fifty who wears a white shirt and brown tie to set him apart from his deputies by reputation he is tough and honest though not necessarily smart i want you to put someone by this door i tell him in case my wife wakes up he snaps his fingers and a deputy scrambles into the hall its billy who manned the stakeout at the highway curve last week he listens to buckner then takes up his post before the bedroom door like a guard at buckingham palace real sorry harp he says ill holler if she wakes up lets get this over with buckner says watching me closely i follow him up the hall with mayeux at my heels the sheriff pauses before my office door and turns to me i hear the voices of men on the porch someone laughs then cuts it off ever see anything like this before buckner asks i worked in an emergency room one summer good how bad is it mayeux takes my arm from behind squeezes it and says hang tough cher it aint good and sheriff buckner opens the door to hell chapter the instant buckner opened the door i saw blood you couldnt enter the room without walking through it not unless you used a window which i saw evidence technicians doing from the doorway to about five feet into the room the floor was a sticky puddle with five or six pairs of shoeprints tracked through it your wifes buckner said pointing to the smallest prints couple of deputies and fire department people walked through here trying to see whether anything could be done but they were too late there was more blood deeper in the office splashed high on the walls but before i could focus on it i saw the foreign woman buckner had talked about she was lying on her side about six feet inside the door facing away from me a zippered black body bag lay unrolled at her feet a gleaming sword blade protruded from her back walking forward i saw that it had been stuck through her abdomen with horror i recognized the brass hilt of the civil war sword that usually hung on my wall beside my far window the dead woman wore a yellow sari but one of her arms was exposed it had been slashed several times to the bone what happened i said you know her asked buckner kalis face was beautiful even in death a perfect oval with strong planes and sculpted ridges covered by nutmeg skin her eyes were open the sclera like old ivory framing fixed onyx irises there were lines in the skin at the corners of her eyes and lips some wrinkles gathered at her throat but few other signs of age as i studied her face i noticed something small and bright against the skin just below the jawline i started to crouch and look then realized that i was looking at the feathers of a tranquilizer dart well grunted buckner ive never seen her before in my life ever talk to her on eros asked mayeux how would i know that take a look at the rest said buckner you dont have to mayeux said your wife ided the other body i moved forward anyway propelled by something deeper than thought the center of the room was a circus of small red footprints as though a dance had been held for bleeding women the walls and everything hanging on them were spattered with blood flung drops on a framed print a large splash near the baseboard a fine spray across the faces of two guitars where is she behind the headboard of the bed buckner said i took the required steps and stopped near the head of my twin bed there propped low against the wall sat erins nude body if her eyes had been open i probably could not have stood to look so heavily did the responsibility for her death crash down upon me in that moment her dark hair hung mercifully over her breasts but her legs were splayed grotesquely apart as though she were a mannequin laid out for an anatomy lesson i wanted to shout at buckner to cover up her nakedness but something caught my attention and held it with paralyzing power cut into erins tanned abdomen just above her pubic hair was a vertical incision about three inches long there was very little blood just enough to define the wound is that what killed her no said buckner from just behind me shes got a big knife wound in her back above her kidneys probably hit the heart see the blood then i did see erin was propped in a black pool of blood i hadnt noticed because the headboard made a shadow there as i stared one question filled my mind does she have any head wounds no mayeux answered i checked i looked back at him both of us were asking the same silent question why not we found the murder weapon said buckner under the bed its some kind of curved dagger looks like a movie prop for the thugs murder was a holy sacrament i gazed around the room looking at the overturned furniture and scattered papers and drying blood trying to fathom what had happened what could possibly have brought erin here so soon after our confrontation at her house best we can figure buckner said is one or more persons surprised your sisterinlaw here in the house she may have been in this room she may not maybe she fled here your telephone lines were cut maybe she fled here got a deputy out back fixing them up for you hes handy with that stuff take it easy detective hes saving the cut ends for the crimelab boys anyway id say mrs graham did something very unexpected in here she snatched that sword off the wallthat is your sword right yes and she defended her life as best she could she did a pretty good job of it too she hit that foreign woman at least five times on the arms then ran her through like a pig on a spit of course by doing that she lost her weapon at that point i figure a second assailant got her what makes you think there was another person here footprints we found a pair of sizenine reeboks that didnt match the shoes of anybody working the scene brahma wears reeboks oh found the actual shoes right in the middle of the floor the perp obviously knew we could track him that way so he walked through the puddle at the door then tossed the shoes back in hes running barefoot now thats tough going in fields and woods especially at night how do you know he didnt take a pair of shoes from my closet and put them on in the hall buckner stared blankly at me for a moment then anger clouded his eyes would you know if a pair was missing let me look one glance into the closet told me a pair of nikes were gone air jordans white with blue trim shit buckner muttered writing on a pad he produced from his khaki shirt pocket what size twelve well that should slow him down a little feeling a strangely protective urge i moved back toward erins body your buddy turner wear a nine buckner asked sharply i dont know what size he wears but bigger than a nine hes skinny but hes well over six feet probably a twelve what i cant figure said buckner is why one of the perps didnt just shoot mrs graham they shot her with the dart gun mayeux said in the shoulder he added looking at me i meant a real gun maybe they didnt have one buckner shook his head thats a pretty risky way to break into a house especially in mississippi i told you theyre not from mississippi mayeux said buckner gave him a scowl i said you do know this guy has been using a private plane to get to the crime scenes and theres an old crop dusting strip about two miles west of this house deputies already found it buckner said tracks in the mud somebody used it tonight mud how long has it been raining here sixty to eighty minutes that plane probably took off less than an hour ago good godi thought realizing how close drewe had come to dying with her sister something else said buckner one of my men thinks the killer might have been wounded based on the amount of blood and the spatter patterns makes sense to me with knives and swords flailing around he might be a hemophiliac buckners eyes came alive like a bird dogs a what a bleeder he might be a bleeder how in hell would you know that i thought of telling buckner the truth but that would probably put me in a jail cell something i overheard an fbi agent say in washington i knew them sonsabitches was holding out on us buckner said furiously im gonna burn some federal ass over this his right cheek twitched so maybe this assholes hurt bad enough to crash his plane harper mayeux said gently i cant understand why this dark woman caught a tranquilizer dart like your sisterinlaw did you got any ideas on that no you sure do i need to call a lawyer buckner turned on me then son you might need to call a bodyguard when bob anderson finds out what happened to his little girl and with that he marched out of the room straight through the blood at the door i covered my eyes with one hand what the hell am i going to tell her father i mumbled her mother her husband mayeux pushed me down onto the bed and sat beside me ive done it a hundred times and it aint ever easy thisll be worse cause its family its not that you realize what happened here i killed her mike i killed her what do you mean i mean miles turner and i sat in this room for three days straight and tried our damnedest to stop that son of a bitch on our own only it didnt work out the way we expected holy mary thats where you got that hemophilia stuff you been talking to this freak on the computer hell yes so has dr lenz thats how his wife got killed but miles he told me there was no way brahma could trace brahma whos that thats what we call the killer miles swore hed rigged a way to keep him from tracing our location something at the phone company switching station slow down now no no somethings wrong there werent any typos in any of his messages to me what the hell are you talking about dont you remember the meeting in new orleans i told you the killer never makes any typographical errors his communications are always perfect and fast but just before each murder he makes as many mistakes as anybody else miles said he had a voicerecognition unit at his home base but when he traveled it wouldnt function reliably so he didnt use it just a notebook computer and a cellular phone like everybody else thats how we could predict when he was moving his typos would skyrocket but they didnt somethings wrong mike how long since you last talked to the guy this brahma yesterday well theres your answer he could have flown here from anywhere since yesterday as long as he didnt contact you youd never have a chance to see any typos the simplicity of brahmas tactic dazed me goddamn it youre right but why should he kill your sisterinlaw just because she was here i dont buy it not with that weird abdominal wound he took something out of her man but it sure wasnt her pineal gland mayeux looked uncomfortably at me then at the floor i think maybe it was her ovaries jesus christ god help me what kind of shit did you talk about with this nut anyway he did most of the talking i said trying to recall whether i said anything that could have led brahma to this house but i cant and even if he somehow traced the photo of erin that wouldnt have led him here could he have been watching erins house while i was there did he follow her from jackson to here why the hell did she come out here anyway you okay cole no i want erins body covered up i want all these bastards out of my house right now calm down man that sheriff wants to arrest you i told him you were with me when the murder went down but he could still bust you material witness whatever hes pretty steamed this happening on his watch that juice you used in jackson cuts two ways remember bob andersons a big man around here and his daughter just got butchered pardon my french buckners cranking up a manhunt thatll make the john wilkes booth posse look like cub scouts and if you make the wrong kind of noise hell stomp on you with hobnail boots i bent over put my head beneath my knees and breathed the way youre supposed to when you take a kick in the groin an hour ago you wanted to arrest me mike why the change mayeux laid a hand on my shoulder and squeezed you didnt have nothing to do with this other than being stupid i seen a lot of killing and this is some real weirdness we got here he looked around the office again i think maybe this bad boys started coming apart decompensating or whatever they call it and i think maybe youre the reason some way i straightened up and wiped the damp hair out of my eyes what are you going to do tell buckner to put some security on your house call baxter at quantico and tell him he better get his federal shit together before this freak singlehandedly cuts investigative support from the national budget after that im not sure thanks mike thanks a lot mayeux pulled me up from the bed led me to the window helped me climb out of it then followed the last thing i remember him saying was smells like a goddamned slaughterhouse in there troop somebody get those bodies into a wagon with drewe breathing deeply beside me i sat listening to the bumps and curses and slamming doors and groaning engines of the uniformed battalions slow retreat after the last vehicle pulled away i realized i was avoiding looking at something the telephone by the bed then i remembered it might not be working as i reached out to check for a dial tone it rang it was bob anderson calling from the peabody hotel in memphis i didnt hesitate or even try to soften the blow with a guy like bob a man whos been in combat you give him the truth and let him deal with it his own way after a stunned silence he asked a couple of questions in a voice that sounded colder than brahmas digital facsimile one was did she suffer i lied and told him erin had not after that his only concern was for the living satisfied that drewe was all right for the time being he focused on his wife and patrick and holly he wanted to tell margaret in person but he was almost three hours from home most men would have given up there but bob decided to send a friend over to his housenot to console his wife but to cut the telephone line and head off any busybody neighbors who might take it into their heads to drive over and tell her the bad news before the wire could be cut i was to call margaret and tell her that drewe and erin had gone to jackson on an errand the prospect of telling this lie made me uneasy but bob didnt give me time to equivocate i felt like an infantryman being given orders by a veteran sergeant when i reminded bob that a crime like this might make the late news in jackson he said hed take care of that too to my embarrassed relief he did not question me in detail about who might have killed erin either he suspected patrick and did not want to voice those suspicions or he suspected the truth and did not want to flay me longdistance after he signed off i realized that erins death was a tragedy bob had probably rehearsed many times over the years i know now that ive rehearsed for it too the way we do with any friend whose life is ruled by chance or driven by demons yet for her to die this way leaves me feeling ambushed by fate as though a relative had survived cancer only to be run over by a truck steadying my shaking hands i pick up the phone and dial the anderson house hello margaret says erin i feel like ive connected to a parallel universe where physical events register only after a confusing time delay pulling the phone into the bathroom i shut the door and say this is harper mrs anderson oh is erin there she told me not to call but its getting late im worrying myself into a migraine harper she was acting so strangely keep your voice steadysays my instinct a mother can sense danger to her children like a shark smells blood erins not here mrs anderson drewe either they went to jackson on some kind of shopping errand they left a note but they didnt say what they were after i pause what time did you see erin she called around threethirty and asked if i could keep holly while she talked to drewe about something my heartbeat skips then starts to race you know me margaret goes on i didnt want to butt in so i didnt ask any questions youve got holly lord yes she got so hungry i finally fed her supper i know erins finicky about what this girl eats but i didnt have anything healthy so i gave her frozen pizza erin will just have to get over it for the first time tonight tears well in my eyes im sure its okay mrs anderson this time margaret says nothing just as i am about to speak she blurts harper is erin going to leave patrick shes already left him says a manic voice in my head i dont know mrs anderson theyve been having some problems i think she cant leave him harper she cant that boy worships the ground she walks on i want you to talk to her she might listen to you im squeezing the phone so hard that the skin on the back of my hand feels like it might split ill do what i can mrs anderson i think youre doing the best thing you can just by keeping holly in fact if she gets sleepy why dont you just put her to bed over there another silence i hear you all right ill do that and you do what you can to straighten this mess out yes maam bye byebye my heart is still racing but my hands are steadier holly is safe at least theres that as silently as possible i slip back into the bedroom drewes chest rises and falls with comforting regularity beneath the coverlet not wanting to wake her i sit in a hard wooden rocker in one corner and resume my vigil why in gods name did erin come to our house if she called her mother at threethirty she did it right after i left her house she told margaret she had to talk to drewe about something what did she decide i didnt have the guts to tell drewe the truth about holly after all maybe but even if she did she would have given me a chance to do it maybe she decided that telling the truth would be a mistake after all did she rush after me to stop me unlikely her resolve to finally be rid of the lie was ironclad so why did she come then i see it she must have decided that telling drewe the truth was not my obligation but hers drewe and i are husband and wife now we werent at the time of the affair but drewe and erin were sisters and by that logic erins was the greater betrayal of all the alternatives this is the noblest and nobility was erins predominant state of mind when i last saw her alive i mean rocking quietly in the dark i recall the unalloyed panic that jolted me when i believed holly unaccounted for if she really had been missing i would have been the one that required sedation children are stolen from parents every day in this country by monsters as brutal as brahma i met two such parents in chicago and though erin is lost to me now to us all i thank whatever god or fate exists that i am not now thrashing through the fields in search of my daughter that holly is safe and warm in the loving arms of her grandmother is she whispers a voice in my head are you sure the squeak of the rocker stops rising quickly i go to the kitchen and look up the number of the yazoo county sheriffs department which i memorize sheriff buckner please i tell the dispatcher this is harper cole from rain about the double homicide after about a minute buckner comes on the line what is it cole i talked to dr anderson so did i just got off the phone with him i think you should get some men over to his house and watch until he gets home maybe all night buckner spits probably into a cup and takes his time about answering doc told me he was going to have a friend of his take care of things were not talking about the same thing sheriff erins threeyearold daughter is over there i think she might be in danger especially if bobs friend cuts off communication with the house you hear what im saying i can almost see buckner snapping to attention in his chair you telling me this serial killer might go after bob andersons grandchild im saying theres no telling what he might do christ youve stirred up some kind of shitstorm around here will you do it hell yes ill do it im tempted to cordon off the place with a swat team dont do that if mrs anderson sees cops shell know somethings up shell start trying to call her neighbors can you keep your men out of sight you aint got to tell me my job boy ill take care of it by the way docs already got a plane lined up he was talking to me from a car phone on the way to the memphis airport i calculate quickly how soon will he be here hour and a half more like thirty minutes bob anderson dont fool around he called whatever high roller he was meeting up there and got hold of a king air one of my deputiesll be waiting at the new airport for him god almighty i look around the empty kitchen in a daze you there cole yes gotta go i got a manhunt to run after hanging up the phone i look in on drewe again shes still out but for how long with vistaril she could sleep eight more hours or wake up any minute what am i going to do when she does what can i tell her sooner or later the tough questions will be asked should we even stay here in the house no drewe will want to stay at her parents house but shes still going to wake up here bob could show up too in fact i should probably expect him hell take care of his wife first but then hell want to see erins body wherever it is after that hell come here to see where it happened to convince himself that it did happen and to find out who in holy hell is responsible one thing i do know i dont want drewe or bob to have to face the abattoir that is my office drewe saw it once and that was too much i may not be able to wipe out the acts that led to erins death but i can damn sure scrub every last drop of blood out of that office if i cant i can repaint the goddamn thing by morning buckner and the fbi will probably crucify me for destroying evidence but evidence hasnt led anyone to brahma yet from a cabinet in the laundry room i remove a gallon of clorox a bucket some rubber gloves that are too small for my hands and a mop and carry them to my office door the smell hits me with more intensity than it did the first time this is the coppery stench of death the rotten fruit of violence pouring the clorox into the bucket i step into the bathroom and dilute it just enough to be able to breathe then slosh the pungent mixture across the drying slick by the door the bleach barely cuts the coagulated blood i bear down hard with the mop in the relatively clear place where kali lay dead an hour ago as the blackred mess swirls into scarlet spirals the anesthetizing torrent of chemicals that must have insulated me up to now begins to slow and the dark siblings of grief and guilt stir to wakefulness in my soul the mother of my only child is dead my complicity in her death grinds in my belly like slivers of glass i probably know more about the man who killed her than anyone alive now that kali is dead but i dont know how he found his way here i do know he could not and would not have done so had miles and i not played at catching him we were fools or worse somewhere perhaps not far from here brahma is fleeing for his life he might even be wounded trying to stanch a river of blood that contains no natural clotting factor but his fate seems strangely irrelevant now the mother of my only child is dead erins blood yields slowly to the corrosive bleach my throat works in vain against what feels like a lozenge of acid i cannot swallow and glutinous tears burn my eyes they are not healing tears but tears of selfdisgust my part in drawing brahma here is nothing beside my true offense somewhere in the dark chambers of my brain the small and fearful animal that rules my subconscious has already computed times and distances already realized that erin did not have time to tell patrick the truth about holly before she died if she had he would have shown up here long before now one day soon patrick and drewe and bob and margaretsomeday even holly herselfwill know that through stupidity i invited a depraved killer into our insular world that knowledge will forever change their opinion of me as it has my own but they will never untie the final knot in the twisted skein of desire and consequence that led erin to this house on this fateful night the chilling thought that possessed me for an instant this afternoonthat only death could stop her from revealing our secrethas been fulfilled and as i scrub fiercely at her blood fighting to feel only honest grief at her passing the pathetic rat voice of human instinct whispers in my heart thank god theyll never know chapter the high ring announcing a video link from eros headquarters is more than enough to get me off my knees after two hours of scrubbing up blood with steel wool and clorox hunched and aching i shuffle from the far wall of the office toward the eros computer first there is only nefertiti revolving slowly on her black background then a window pops up onscreen its top left corner flashing status numbers that precede the link pulling off the crampinducing dish gloves i watch for jan krislovs face to appear instead like a human version of the cheshire cat miless grinning visage materializes from the black void you there harper i sit down look into the dimesize camera lens mounted atop my monitor and pull on the headset no the trojan horse worked miles im sitting here with a stack of stuff you wouldnt believe miles whats wrong you look like your dog just got hit by a truck wheres my congratulations erins dead his smile does not disappear instantly it seems to peel away like old paint in a hard wind he is too intelligent to ask for pointless repetition or to express disbelief i know that behind his dazed eyes his brain is already modeling all possible sequences of events that could have produced the result i so baldly stated tell me it was a car accident no suicide brahma got her miles he touches his forehead with one hand where right here my office both his hands cover his eyes in an almost childish parody of grief then one hand comes away toward the camera like the pleading hand of a heretic about to be burnt at the stake harper how did he know to come here miles the millisecond he looks into his lap tells me the answer is very bad how i repeat oh my god miles its my fault its our fault okay no its my fucking fault the agony on his face stops me what do you mean the switching station the telephone company switching station what are you talking about he slowly shakes his head the slowspeed video making his movements appear spastic when i hacked the false identity for erin i did it just like i told you i would dmv social security a few credit records i made her name cynthia griffin and before i could do any of that i had to have a physical address that meant hacking into the phone companys switching station to match a fake address with your phone number everything had to work off of that see yes but i was wrong about the security level at the phone company it was taking hours to break in i needed a code or a password from someone inside i tried to socialengineer it but i couldnt snow anybody then i got to thinking even if i succeeded in breaking in brahma might be able to crossreference enough databases to figure out that the address was fake you were ready to start up as erin you used my real address it was the only way to make the character bulletproof bulletproof you goddamn idiot i know okay miless voice is high and shaking damn it i thought wed know if he made any kind of move from the typos thats why i kept asking you if he was making any the errors didnt matter he just stopped communicating with me for the time it took him to fly down here just that stupid email message about getting the jpeg picture of erin god i should have tried to talk to him right then then id have known he was moving miles seems to be shaking but i cant tell from the grainy picture whether its him or the link oh god he croaks i killed her christ we killed her i correct him you talked me into it but im the one who lured him here and now im scrubbing erins blood off the walls he wipes his eyes again i am numb the magnitude of our culpability in erins death is impossible to face for long tell me about the trojan horse miles he nods distractedly and raises a sheaf of paper toward his camera lens whats that the contents of brahmas hard drive the one he downloaded the trojan horse onto a remnant of cold reason revives somewhere in my brain does it tell you who he is no name no im ted bundy or anything like that in a curiously childlike gesture miles wipes his nose on his sleeve i got his eros software serial number but its registered under david strobekker damn but there are definite leads hes got to be working out of new york he started out killing homeless women here the first three victims were infected with hiv so he stopped that must be when he hit on the eros idea he killed strobekker in minneapolis for his eros account where are you getting all this i think he used this computer primarily as an interface for eros its mostly windowsbased applications he must have his main stuff on a unix workstation somewhere jesus i cant believe this god what else do you have i ask forcing my voice under control the explosive stuff is the wordperfect files he actually kept a record of most of the murders theyre like descriptive letters dear father we landed in new orleans yesterday evening a humid city blah blah he shuffles pages dear father we landed in michigan in the afternoon dear father we landed in virginia beach brahma told me his father died in india miles shrugs so he writes to his dead father its like psycho maybe the problem is that the only names mentioned in the letters are those of the victims or this woman kali according to the letters she did the actual killings although brahma helped with the staging the mutilations and stuff kali must be that girl he picked up in india the thuggee girl shes dead too she is how do you know erin killed her right here in my office ran her through the stomach with the sword off my wall miles is thunderstruck come on there must be something in the letters we can use drewe was right about the pineal transplant thing he says brahma definitely kidnapped peter levy the man the fbi got off the donornet list know why come on miles levy was a perfect tissue match with brahma jesus you mean you think he could already have found a way to have this transplant done to himself no i think levys on permanent standby for when the procedures perfected ill bet when brahma turned up an exact match for himself he decided he wasnt going to take any chances that the guy would get run over by a truck i guarantee you levy is being held prisoner somewhere right now good god the donornet womans dead though the navy chick from virginia beach she died on the operating table rosalind may did too heart attack for some reason brahma was going to open her chestdont ask me whyand he actually told her about it the letter said he was trying to make it easier on her she died of plain terror its pretty sick stuff but theres one thing that doesnt add up in it all what why brahma was fooling with erin i mean with you what do you mean i dont think he saw you as a potential donor so why was he wasting time with you im listening everything was going fine for him until karin wheats death she was meant to be the first live recipient i think he thought she might voluntarily allow him to perform the transplant of course when he and kali showed up at her mansion she freaked and they had to kill her after that he went to his backup plan which was straight kidnapping rosalind may and he got the navy girl easily enough the donor but just before the big operation his help got greedy on him he was using unlicensed indian doctors as assistants probably recruited by kali they tried to extort more money and kali killed one of them thats a lead right there the fbi can start checking indian physicians whove been turned down for us medical licenses they can concentrate on new york listen to me harper that same night may died on the operating table the next day the fbi breached his perimeter in dallas notice a pattern here brahmas having big problems exactly but does he lie low and regroup no he decides to teach the fbi a lesson he plays lenzs little game then kills lenzs wife meanwhile hes playing kissykissy with you too maybe i was meant to be the next donor for who who would the recipient have been kali maybe this stops miles i hadnt thought of that but i dont think so too early shed want to know the procedure worked before she risked it so why was he talking to me brahma wants immortality harper physical immortality listen to this soon i shall stand alone at the pinnacle of the species the only man with the courage to reach into the fountain soon i shall spit in the face of god the fountain of youth hell yes he even talks about ponce de leon brahmas fountain is the pineal transplant except just as he gets close fate starts working against him and the worse it gets the more he tells you about himself he gives you his whole life story something we know hes never done before why do you know theres another kind of immortality harper just tell me damn it kids the word detonates in my subconscious like a bomb even with the jerky video image i can see the excitement on miless face in the transcripts you faxed brahma says he sterilized kali remember yes he said he couldnt have children by her so she allowed him to sterilize her if he couldnt have children by her he wouldnt need to sterilize her i think he wouldnt have children by her because she was indian i say distantly because she had dark skin exactly all those early questions about skin color all his life brahmas been looking for someone like his mother for a mate but my erin wasnt that much like catherine not so much physically maybe although you did change her in that direction a little good instinct yeah obviously no listen harper the answer lies in the story you were telling him thats where erin was like his mother and thats what attracted him what do you mean you blacked out most of what you told brahma miles says looking straight into the camera but now isnt the time to be shy it was all stuff about you and erin right the real erin i hesitate only a moment yes the big thing in brahmas past is incest hes a child of incest he always longed for the sister he never had kali was a poor substitute right uhhuh i started thinking about erin and you your separate pasts when things might have happened between you and i realized that your marriage dates were pretty close together miles so i called the methodist church down in rain and found out exactly when erin and patrick were married then i checked the social security computer and got a birth date on holly graham you son of a bitch im sorry harper i had to know and thats the answer brahma became obsessed with erin because she had this semiincestuous angle to her past and because you played her so convincingly erin had a child by her sisters husband she ignored the rules for the sake of love just like catherine shes a combination of brahmas mother and the sister he never had or at least thats what brahma started to think under the stress of his other problems were done talking miles wait cant you see im only doing this to stop this motherfucker i dont think anybody can stop him i can the question is what will brahma do now when he got to your place and found hed been fooled he must have flipped out but why kill erin she was the girl in the jpeg after all why not kidnap her did he take her pineal gland no but he took something probably her ovaries miless mouth falls open she had a surgical incision down there christ you see with his pineal work going down the tubes brahma fixated on extending his gene line through children its that simple wait erin killed kali you said that means erin fought like a banshee right i close my eyes remembering kalis mutilated corpse brahma had to kill erin miles concludes she left him no choice just like karin wheat so he tried to salvage what he could he probably carries some special transport container for the pineals he just loaded up her ovaries instead stop miles i dont even want to hear that shit theres got to be something else on that hard drive to give you an idea who or where he might be he looks at me in silence for several moments then he says two things theres a wordperfect file called clarus its not set up like the murder letters its more of a memotomyself kind of thing like something he typed out while talking on the phone it looks like specs for some type of new medical instrument clarus is the name of the company that makes it what kind of instrument the kind drewe thought didnt exist and until recently it didnt its called a neuroendoscope its a long thin flexible tube called a cannula that you can pass instruments through its made to operate on the brain theres a fiberoptic camera attached and a bright light source you can visualize the interior of the patients brain by running the scopes camera signal to a tv or a video camera with a builtin screen harper the cannula is only fourpointfive millimeters wide my god are there any names in the file people from the company that brahma might have talked to no whats the second thing ive got a serial number off a microsoft program that might be traceable its a beta version microsoft handed them out like popcorn in ninetytwo but ive got some friends in redmond who might be able to track it down good do it and fax everything you have to baxter at quantico right now harper do it goddamn it he nods assent dont you think baxter is probably on his way to you by now this hasnt occurred to me i dont know it looks like brahmas already clear he used a private plane they found fresh tire tracks on the same strip you used harper i am so sorry about erin hows drewe holding up i sedated her oh you just fax that stuff to baxter i will he pauses maybe you should split for a while you know what do you mean brahma for one thing he knows where you live and if erin killed kali do i have to draw you a picture dont worry about me dr anderson isnt exactly mr understanding either as i recall if he thinks its your fault his daughter is dead it is my fault only to the extent that you trusted me look at it this way miles next time lenz asks us what the worst thing weve ever done is we wont have to think very hard to find the answer before he can respond i click the mouse on terminate video link and sink lower into the chair after a minute nefertiti reappears turning slowly the muscles in my neck are knotted from scrubbing and my backbone feels like it could splinter through the skin i should get up and check on drewe but i cant summon the energy miless warning about drewes father replays endlessly in my head bob must be home by now he could show up here any time i need caffeine i force myself up out of the chair and walk to the minifridge but its empty as i head for the kitchen my eyes follow the floorboards checking for bloodstains i might have missed i see none there are no tabs in the kitchen refrigerator but there is a sixpack of diet coke i pop the top on one and lean back against the counter swallowing the burning fluid and letting the cold from the open refrigerator wash over me when that drink is empty i open another and let the door swing closed the kitchen is so narrow here it looks like a monks sleeping quarters youre punch drunk i tell myself you can make it to the bedroom glancing through the laundry room to the back door i realize that the last cop through it probably didnt think about locking up i set down the diet coke and walk past the closed pantry door to the laundry room to shoot the bolt and freeze at least twenty cops have trooped through this house in the past two hours but im positive that not one of them knew of much less searched the bomb shelter leaving the bolt unshot and the diet coke on the stove i back through the kitchen into the hallway my heart hammering my fear for drewe overcoming all else should i try to get her out of the house no wed be totally vulnerable as i carried her to the truck my is out there too ive got to have a gun i dart into an offshoot of our main hall toward the neglected bedroom we use for storage the door creaks as i push it open but i follow through and leave it ajar behind me in the far corner of the bedroom standing like an upended deep freeze amid the sentimental flotsam of five generations of coles is my fathers gun safe inside it is a motley collection of antique pistols and flintlock muskets many dating back to the war between the states some even to the revolution the combination lock is easy to open the numbers those of my fathers birthday the hard tang of gun oil and good steel hits me in a reassuring wave shoving apart the muskets to reach the back shelf i set aside a can of elephant brand black powder and grab the suede zip case containing the single modern weapon in the safe my fathers smith and wesson magnum theres a box of shells on a thin metal shelf in back i quickly unzip the case and load the pistol putting the remainder of the rounds in my pocket the cartridges are old but with luck they will still cook off if i actually have to fire the thing the big checked wooden grip feels unfamiliar in my hand sighting once down the sixinch barrel i move back into the hallway and hurry into the bedroom drewe hasnt moved facing the closed door i back around the bed to the telephone and dial sheriff buckners office with my left hand i keep my right on the magnum taking my eyes off the door only long enough to see the numbers sheriffs department a womans voice more a question than a statement i need to talk to the sheriff now who is this harper cole get him hes not here whos in charge just a second the next voice is male young deputy jones what can i do for you i answer in language calculated to scare the living hell out of deputy jones telling him about the tunnel and making it plain that people might die if buckner and some deputies dont get back to my house asap then i hang up and sit down between drewe and the door the pointed at its upper panel the gun has a sobering weight my arms are soon shaking with fatigue but im afraid to sneak a look at my watch its been over a year since i opened the gun safe the last time i felt sentimental about my father and found myself cleaning his guns to remember him no squeeze the trigger son be careful now harp this thingll put a bullet through a car door a bump from somewhere inside the house steels my flagging arms no way could buckners men be here yet not from yazoo city i listen in a way i have not since my grandfather took me on my first and last deer hunt shooting bambi seemed cruel and unnecessary to me then now blowing off a mans head seems entirely justifiable there is definitely someone in the house i dont know how i know but i do and that someone is moving harper cole my finger pulls against the magnums trigger stopping at the last pound of pressure does brahma know my name of course he does where you at man its billy jackson im on my feet instantly pulling open the door and motioning the heavyset deputy into the room his forehead and cheeks are beaded with sweat his eyes alight with excitement whos with you billy jimmy hayes on the porch he says breathlessly thumbing the hammer of the ninemillimeter automatic in his hand we were watching the house like that new orleans cop said to just you two sheriffs on his way but it could be twenty or twentyfive minutes your wife okay shes sleeping he looks past me to drewes inert body sheriff told me something about a basement someplace we didnt search its a bomb shelter from the fifties i think the killer could be hiding down there state police say the guy got away in a plane then why the hell is buckner still searching billy they found tracks on an airstrip thats all that could be hunters spotlighting deer the fbi thinks theres a group of people involved in these killings his eyes move quickly from side to side like mechanical thought indicators a bomb shelter huh no shit old pete williams has one of those like a little underground trailer has a poker night down there sometimes this ones bigger i say impatiently there are tunnels running to it one from the house the other from outside where in the house pantry closet in the kitchen theres a trapdoor in the floor outside theres a weathersealed door like a cellar entrance about seventy feet on a straight line from the back door of the house in the cotton its covered with dirt most of the time but i stop too late billys eyes flash with animal cleverness turner used it to sneak past us last week right i dont answer but he sees the truth goddamn okay wait here a second i grab his meaty forearm and hold him where you going tell jimmy whats up i dont like the look in billys eyes what did the sheriff tell you to do make sure you and your wife were safe till he got here dont you think you should stay here then he pulls his arm away harp theyre combing the whole county for the sumbitch that killed erin and he could be squatting under this house right now maybe wounded you think im gonna wait till he skips out that back tunnel he coulda heard me hollering for you im gonna put jimmy out there to cover the back entrance i hate to admit it but billys plan makes sense youll be okay he says pointing at my magnum thats a goddamn cannon you got there ill knock twice when i get back again i cover the closed door with manic concentration when the two taps finally come and the door starts to open i have to restrain myself from pulling the trigger billys sweating even more than before and hes exchanged his pistol for a pump shotgun you okay harp scared shitless dont worry jimmys covering the back entrance how can he find it in the dark billy grins hes a hunter boy somebody pops up in that field hell take em down sure as shit this is nuts i say silently you hang tough another minute okay billy backs toward the door where are you going his eyes are hard and bright we got this sumbitch cornered harp like a fox and im gonna nail his ass what his smile disappears dont give me no shit now im gonna work my way through the tunnel with the remington while jimmy covers the back door billy dont do it wait for buckner he shakes his head you got lights down there theres a switch low on the right side of the pantry wall i cant believe im telling him this but i also cant let him go down into that hole in pitch darkness which he seems fully prepared to do billy slaps his open hand on the shotgun you just sit tight and cover your old lady i got a teargas round a gas mask and the odds on my side my mind searches wildly for another solution but alternate plans arent the problem getting billy jackson to abandon this one is and nothing short of a presidential directive would do it listen he says earnestly you want to see this asshole go to trial sit there in court with your crying wife and inlaws while a dozen lawyers scream objections and get this fungus sent to a mental hospital maybe even get him off this ways clean harp wont be nobody down there but me and him boomboom its over case closed youll never have to waste another thought on the guy the persuasive power of billys scenario surprises me hes no scholar but hes got a firm grasp of hard realities he squints at his watch in the shadows if im not back by the time buckner gets here tell him to give me five minutes and then gas the tunnel with cs got that cs right then come in blasting jesus billy and if you hear anybody coming out of that trapdoor that aint yelling billy jackson you blow em to hell and gone i will semper fi buddy shit chapter there is no more threatening sound than silence it is the symphony of the snake that waits for its prey to step within striking range of the tiger that stalks the deer it begins as mere absence of sound but unrelieved it can build steadily into a roar that blurs perception to the point of sense blindness i know that blindness now sitting with both hands gripping the butt of the magnum as though it could transport drewe and me to another dimension far from this dangerous place i count the seconds as rivulets of sweat across my face as breaths entering and leaving the lungs of my sleeping wife how long will it take buckner and his men to get here even if they were at the north end of the county it shouldnt take more than twentyfive minutes how many have passed five ten or two keep still i tell myself no way hes down there kali is dead and brahma limped out to his plane and got the hell out of here for good he saw his lover die and two explosions close together smash the silence rattling the foundation of the house i jump to my feet trigger finger quivering heartbeat loosed from its rhythm harper i whirl bringing the gun around with me drewe is up on one elbow her eyes barely open whats happening were in our bedroom lie down we may be in trouble we a third explosion shudders through the floorboards drewes eyes snap open what an agonized wail like a cat in heat rolls out of the kitchen what was that she asks her voice ragged two deputies went down into the bomb shelter brahma may be down there her fingers grip my wrist like channellock pliers do you still have that pistol you used to use when i was out of town i ask she nods in my dresser drawer which one i ask pulling open the top one thats it god i feel sick am i drunk drewes pistol is a tiny charter arms automatic bob gave her when she went to medical school in new orleans an oddly inefficient weapon coming from a man like bob but i suppose he wanted her to be able to conceal it easily whiiiite birrrd screams a voice that could have come from the pit of hell white bird what hes calling you says drewe hes saying harper who went down there billy jackson jimmy somebody harrrper heelll meeeee the sheriffs on his way i tell her my tone strangely defensive she nods quickly you cant go down there this time the wail drags out much longer than before im bleeeedinn i told him not to go down there damn as drewe stares at me willing me to deafness i realize im in a position ive seen a hundred times in movies seen and then screamed silently at the hero not to go into the woods or up the attic stairs or wherever any halfintelligent person would know the monster or murderer was waiting but sitting here now in the awful silence following those screams one fact is inescapable i brought those men here if i dont help them i will carry their lives on my conscience forever and im already carrying too much aaaaaaaaagghhh harper you cant do anything for them i know i say softly my right hand is clenched around the butt of the magnum with painful force the sheriff will be here before long but billy and his partner could be dead by then and brahma vanished into the summer night another prolonged shriek of pain reaches the bedroom fainter this time ive got to go what drewe asks no you dont why do you have to go i just do because this way its over one way or the other if i kill brahmaor even if he kills meill have done the only thing that could possibly expiate my guilt i start to hand her the then switch and give her the whatever else i do i will not walk out of here leaving my wife no more protection than a crappy saturday night special drewe takes the huge pistol with a kind of narcotized equanimity i drop the extra shells on the bed i want you to get down behind the bed and aim the pistol at the door she rolls over without a word and kneels behind the bed if anyone comes through but me you start shooting and dont stop until the gun is empty you understand she nods soberly she knows i mean to go and though she doesnt want me to she wont waste time trying to talk me out of it the barrel of the comes level with the bed then rises until its line of fire intersects my chest im okay she says go two words echo in my head as i stare through the open pantry at the black hole of the bomb shelters open trapdoor tunnel rat echoing down from years ago when a onearmed tractor driver told me about his job in vietnam first man down every hole darkness damp stink crawling on your belly with a colt held in front of your face like a crucifix and a prayer on your lips the lights in the tunnel should be on but theyre not too late i realize i should have switched off the kitchen lights before opening the trapdoor i creep close enough to peer over the edge a pool of light on the concrete floor six feet below tells me theres a dim column shining down from the kitchen i want to call out to billy but that would be idiocy instead i snatch a flashlight from the top pantry shelf and cut the kitchen lights thats almost as obvious as yelling but climbing down a ladder through a column of light would be suicide to get to the floor of the tunnel i must descend six ladder steps with my left side facing the open tunnel thats the normal method anyhow not tonight like a kid edging toward the lip of a high roof i slide my legs through the dark toward the place where i know the hole is a tin can of something falls over the edge caroms off the ladder and thuds on the cement below i stop waiting when the next howl of pain reverberates up the tunnel i drop down the hole like a sack my legs crumpling against the cool concrete the flashlight buckling under my weight forcing myself to breathe quietly i lie prone on the tunnel floor and stare into the blackness the feels like a toy in my hand it might stop a surprised mugger or rapist but a psychotic killer could take five bullets from this thing and keep coming move i tell myself youre asking for it brahma could be sitting ten feet up the tunnel right now i have only one advantage home ground this passage runs thirty feet away from the house with shelves lining both walls and ends in a heavy lead door that door opens onto the main shelter room which is about fifteenbyfifteen a second tunnel runs thirty feet out into the field to the rear exit it too is lined with storage shelves and also contains a chemical toilet room thats where my gold is stored sliding as far as i can under the metal shelving on the left side of the tunnel i shout billy its harper where are you at first i hear nothing then a slow creak of hinges harper a weak southern drawl yeah im hit man bad i need help wheres jimmy a long pause gone for a flashlight jesusanybody else in here i dont know what happened to the lights dont know i heard something and shot and they went out another groan of pain i need help man damn damn damn billy what what year did you graduate high school nineteenfuckingseventyeight come on man i aim the straight at the sound of the voice where paramecialike blobs of color swirl in a black sea where are you hit my leg im bleeding bad are you in the main room square room i think so close the door so that its between you and me while billy mulls over this instruction i slither to the center of the tunnel floor and rise into a crouch the in my right hand the ceiling has exactly six feet of clearancemy grandfather was fiveelevenso if i stay down ill have plenty of room and i mean to stay down i got you billy yells finally bring it on the metallic screech comes and fades so fast it barely registers before the lead door slams shut i explode forward like a nose tackle coming out of his stance my thighs pumping charging toward the main room and firing as i run in the closed tunnel the little booms and flashes like a howitzer deafening me to everything but the high zing of ricochets i sweep my arm across the tunnel as i fire trying to maximize the odds of hitting anything between me and the lead door with my eighth step i dive forward scraping my elbows in a secondbase slide and jamming my wrist as the empty pistol impacts the lead door open up i yell hammering the butt of the against the door if brahmas inside billy is dead by now but somehow i dont think so billys enough of a redneck that he would die trying to save his honorand mebefore hed let himself be used to lure me to my death when the heavy door finally swings inward i heave myself over the frame onto some part of billy jackson who screams at the top of his lungs i shut the door and roll off still in darkness you okay billy i dont know his groans sound like manly attempts to cover whimpering this leg was pumping blood i tied my belt just above the hole tight as shit wheres that fuckin jimmy i feel billys thigh with my right hand and what i feel is blood lots of it weve got to get you out need a stretcher he says grunting against the pain aaaagh that fuckin jimmy he shot me whatyou sure hell no i aint sure hey that was pretty smart what you did with the gun think you hit anything no haaaaay i jump so badly that billy feels compelled to steady me with one hand dont shoot okay yells the new voice its jimmy about fuckin time you assholebilly bellows back sheriffs on his way says jimmy coming through the opposite door with a hooded flashlight saw his lights must be ten cruisers coming up the highway great billy says shine that thing on my leg judas priest jimmy gasps as his light illuminates a ragged red hole in billys bloodsoaked trousers jeez im sorry bill i think hes okay i say if the bullet hit an artery his thigh would be as big as a propane bottle just keep putting pressure on it billy doesnt look relieved but as soon as i realize hes out of danger the real threat hits me if brahmas not in the tunnels where is he ive got to get back upstairs any more rounds in that shotgun aint no plug in this baby says billy handing me the remington three more rounds ready to go i pump in a round kick open the lead door and fire the moment the barrel is clear before the echo fades i am over the lip and charging back up the tunnel homing on a barely visible column of light that must mark the opening of the trapdoor above with every step i feel a knife blade whooshing out of the darkness to plunge into my groin or rip open my back i fire again for intimidation then dive for the ladder saving the final round for the house i come up out of the hole like a coal miner from a collapsed shaft pushing the gun in front and yelling for drewe as i enter the hall when she answers through the bedroom door i pause its all right she shouts again come in i stand to the side and turn the knob slowly then kick open the door and jump back in case shes being forced to speak she is just where i left her kneeling behind the bed with the bigbarreled magnum propped in front of her like a mortar what happened she asks billys hit hell make it though no sign of brahma the magnum drops hard onto the bedcovers harper she says in an exhausted voice does mama know about erin your father does i told him he chartered a plane in memphis hes home by now and im sure hes told your mother drewe is crying again ive got to be there she chokes out they need me throw some clothes in a bag youll be there in twenty minutes while she wipes away the tears and goes to her closet i stand watch with the shotgun have you packed already she asks i dont meet her eyes do you really think id be welcome there tonight when i look up she is staring at me with her mouth open you know it was brahma that was here tonight dont you i nod it had to be and it wasnt an accident was it it wasnt random no drewe dont tell me she says shaking her head i cant think about that now oh god she looks a moment longer then turns back to the closet and continues packing as she does i realize that erins death may have driven something between us that can never be removed trying to focus on anything but that thought i decide i might be able to save a lot of troubleand possibly our livesby calling the sheriffs department and telling them to inform buckner by radio that drewe and i will be leaving the house armed i make the call and the dispatcher agrees to do it while i wait a moment later she tells me we should come out unarmed i tell her to forget it brahma could still be in the house waiting for just such an opportunity when drewe is packed i give her the shotgun shoulder her bag and grip the magnum in my right hand ready i ask she nods we burst out of the bedroom door at a near run careening up the hall and crashing through the front door into a supernova of white light throw down your weapons roars a bullhorn voice right now i toss the magnum onto the porch drewe does the same with the shotgun just to be safe i put up both hands and drewe follows my example its raining again as my pupils contract i make out a ring of cars and men behind the spotlights come down from the porch and lie down on the ground its too goddamned muddy i shout back after a tense silence the cookiecutter silhouette of a cowboy blots out some of the light in front of us what in the name of creation happened out here bellows sheriff buckner beckoning us toward the shelter of the cars anybody else in that house i dont know i lead drewe down the steps into the rain and start explaining the situation buckners face remains impassive he already knows about billy jackson you realize what you did by not telling us about that basement he yells ive got a critically injured man i told billy to wait for you he wouldnt listen he shakes his head thats about the first thing you ever told me i believe sheriff i need to get my wife to her parents house its pouring rain out here you aint going nowhere cole not till we figure out whats what around here she hasnt seen her mother or father yet i know dr anderson must be worried sick by now buckner looks at drewes washedout face then signals to a deputy daniels you take this lady to bob andersons house outside of yazoo city shell tell you the way i know the way sheriff hallelujah go on then does it have to be me go on damn it the deputy turns and mopes toward his car but drewe doesnt follow im not going without my husband she says flatly now mrs cole says buckner you dont i mean it ill come straight back with your deputy i promise just let me ride with her you know what shes been through you can interrogate me all night long after i get back im gonna do just that growls buckner all right get out of here daniels make sure you bring cole back here with you as drewe and i catch up to the chosen deputy he mutters god i hate to miss this climbing into the cruiser i hear sheriff buckner shouting at the house through his bullhorn hes not much of a negotiator just three sentences hey in there if you make me come in after you you will not come out alive you have exactly sixty seconds to surrender then he begins counting chapter damn i hate to miss that deputy daniels whines for the third time watching his rearview mirror as the cruiser rumbles up the slick highway you get something like that once in maybe ten years around here theres nobody in the house i tell him holding drewe tight against me how do you know that too many ways he could have gotten out he had a good chance to kill both of us and he didnt same with billy and jimmy if he was ever there at all he shot billy didnt he billys partner shot billy what thats what billy said and i think hes right daniels looks around in his seat bugeyed with excitement ill be goddamned that sounds just like jimmy i dont know how many illegal does hes shot too damn quick on the trigger drewe is tugging at my sleeve i look down into her face startled by the intensity in her eyes what was erin doing at our house she asks quietly did you bring her there i motion for her to wait but she knows well be separated in twenty minutes and she means to have answers i lean forward in the seat deputy you think you could hit the siren and the gas my wifes feeling sick she really needs to get home hey the sooner we get there the sooner i get back he reaches up and switches on his red flashers then gooses the gas pedal no siren hell we dont need it out here in the wide open do we we get a lot of loose cows out this way deer too he snorts at my cautiousness but all the same he hits the siren and accelerates still faster the car has already outrun the rain i slide down in the seat with drewe as if to rest more comfortably and begin speaking below the howl of the siren i dont know why she was there she told your mother she was coming to talk to you i know but why you drove to jackson and saw her like i asked you to i told you i did i hardly remember you coming in i dont remember what you said what happened when you saw erin i hesitate she told me she was fine and you believed her what could i do you just left after id told you what i was afraid of she wasnt going to hurt herself drewe i could see that much i was going to call you about it but when i got home two detectives were waiting to arrest me erin obviously drove over sometime after that she looks away with her lips drawn tight it doesnt make sense what are you keeping from me harper you never want to know first erin didnt want to see me then she drives eighty miles to talk to me i cant make that work drewe she looks back at me with glittering eyes my sister is dead harper any promise you made to her about keeping secrets is meaningless now youve got to help me understand this i didnt want to tell you this she pulls away far enough to give me a level gaze shes obviously been expecting some dark revelation for a while and she braces against it like a defendant awaiting sentence patrick isnt hollys father she blinks three times fast processing the information as she would some rare medical symptom trying to fit it into her known information and compute a differential diagnosis with a shiver i realize that if erin were not dead i would not be able to stop at this point i would have to tell the whole tragic story and watch drewes world blown apart no wonder erin wouldnt use me as her obstetrician she says finally all that bs about how doctors shouldnt treat family members that wasnt erin at all i knew she was probably pregnant with the unannounced wedding and everything but i just assumed it was by patrick and she was doing so well nobody wanted to question it well now you know she told you this this afternoon i nod drewe shakes her head in disbelief does patrick know yes thats the problem before they got married erin told him she was pregnant but she made him swear never to ask who the father was i guess patrick was okay with it for a while but then he became obsessed with finding out finally she says letting out a long sigh finally it all makes sense she looks away out the window into the dark why didnt erin just tell him who the father was surely that would have been better than what they were going through just let it go would you i dont know maybe suddenly without any thought at all damning and damnable words flow effortlessly out of my mouth maybe erin didnt know herself who the father was i mean maybe she didnt want to admit that to patrick while i sit shocked at my own words some part of me gauges their effect it is profound drewe believes she can accept the idea that erin slept with so many men in new york that she lost count she can accept that erinin her converts zeal to get marriedwould keep this from patrick and most important she can acceptwithout imputing treacherous motives to methat i would want to keep this from her why didnt she just lie she asks make up some fictitious father the truth comes to my rescue a lie wouldnt have worked in the end patrick would have tried to make sure i think he was bent on some dramatic gesture drewes eyes probe mine as though she were peering through the barrels of a binocular microscope she told you all of this today no three months ago she told me im the father of the threeyearold angel patrick puts to bed every night who calls me uncle harp and begs me to sing barney and play old beatles songs to her on the guitar like im some friendly pied piper and not the very source of her existence yes i told you she would drewe folds her arms over her chest why couldnt she tell me damn it why the deputy slows the cruiser for a curve and switches off the siren yazoo city is a bluish cloud of light high in the distance soon we will swing onto highway which leads to bobs estate harper what where is erin right now i dont know you want me to ask the deputy she shakes her head in drewes family you dont ask a stranger such a question you dont let anyone outside the clan know you need them for anything as the lights of town drift closer a wave of selfdisgust washes through me i just slandered a woman who cant defend herself because she is dead what did daddy sound like when you talked to him drewe asks her voice like a shout in my ear calm i know that sounds stupid no it sounds just like him this will kill him though he worshiped erin hes still got you she closes her eyes were passing outlying homes now lighted by the moon and by the odd window or mercury vapor lamp ranchstyle houses set far back from the road and in the distance the green and white flash of the new airport beacon bobs mansion isnt far from here and yet its a world away it may be a world away from me now too the lies i told a few moments ago may save my marriage but they will do nothing to assuage bobs anger even if drewe finds a way to forgive me bob will expel me from the family not in any official way but his disapproval will have the effect of a papal bull will drewe forgive me shes in shock now of course but shell recover quickly particularly once she is called upon to steady the rest of the family will she accept what ive said tonight as easily then already i sense an emotional distance that seems unrelated to the trauma of erins death could she as i have often wondered know more than she allows herself to admit of course says a voice so clear i perceive it as a whisper beside me shes known for weeks months even thats why she asked if you were sleeping with erin she doesnt know specifics but she knows what women always know that something isnt right ive been like a junkie i realize thinking i could live with my habit that it wasnt really affecting my life but it is its destroying me its just up ahead drewe says to the deputy third driveway up i got it daniels replies why do i lie did i inherit the tendency from my father a man scrupulously honest in every area of his life but one even entering our marriage i had secrets they seem trivial now but if they were why didnt i confess them before i married drewe like a child unwilling to endure the pain of vaccination to gain immunity from a disease i was afraid to watch her carefully tended trust waver yet again or possibly even shatter as the deputy pulls into bobs long curving drive i feel dislocated in time as though erin and drewe might step arm in arm from beneath the brick entrance arch as i saw them do hundreds of times in my life two wet little girls in bathing suits teenagers wearing prom dresses and milliondollar smiles bride and bridesmaid before erins rehearsal dinner the cruiser stops with a harsh squeal of brakes drewe looks out at the floodlit mansion the ivy that covers the entrance arch still glistens from the rain more black than green in the artificial light leaning toward her i smell her wet hair as tangible as the touch of her hand she turns and hugs me then kisses me lightly on the cheek and grips the door handle deputy i say swallowing hard i need to talk to my wife in private for a minute can i get out with her drewe looks at me not sure whats happening i still feel the press of her lips upon mine a phantom touch of erins last kiss with that sensation comes something more chilling an echo of erins final words i know what the little death is now its the way weve been living pretending things are fine every day having to pile one more lie on top of all the others to keep the house of cards from falling on top of us thats death dying a little each day i dont think the sheriff would like it daniels says well how about you getting out just for a minute his shaved neck stiffens he turns in the seat and looks at drewe that okay with you maam drewe watches me still not understanding yes please okay im gonna leave my door open but ill step away and have me a smoke thanks when hes gone i take drewes hands in mine but when our eyes meet she pulls her hands away and folds them in her lap she doesnt ask what i have to tell her she watches me warily her back braced against the door chin turned slightly downward as if to ward off a blow i remember this posture from high school when i first admitted that rumors she had heard about me and a friend of hers were true a thousand reasons not to speak constrict the muscles of my throat i hear the voices of her girlfriends of her mother telling her that people dont change that betrayal is a habit that im not the kind of man who can remain faithful to any woman drewe i have to tell you something her eyes look away for an instant then back and in that brief slice of time much of their translucence dies replaced by a protective opacity i hear the metallic patter of the rain beginning again i know who hollys father is she presses harder against the door and i realize my hesitancy is only making things worse drewe no she says her lower lip quivering no one shaking hand rises to her mouth pauses uncertainly then covers her eyes even as my nerve fails i say drewe its me like liquid diamonds tears fall from behind her hand into her lap my worst fear is that she will run simply bolt from the car and leave me stuck with a triggerhappy deputy i spit out my excuses in a panicked flood i didnt know until three months ago drewe i had no idea erin showed up in chicago before you and i were married before we were engaged really she stayed for three days thats all it ever was drewe she never told me a thing after that and she came straight back here and married patrick i never knew she was pregnant and i never touched her before or since drewe drewe say something when she takes her hand away from her eyes a redness in the shape of butterfly wings stains her pale cheeks drewe nothing i start to take her outstretched hand then realize she is reaching for her clothes bag as her fingers grasp it her other hand gropes backward for the door handle drewe wait please we need to talk the door opens with a screech silhouetting the back of her head against the lighted entrance drewe wait i plead taking hold of the arm that holds the bag dont touch me she jerks away as though my hand were on fire and scrambles out of the car lunging across the seat i try to block the closing door but drewe throws her body against it with enough force to slam my arm and shoulder back into the car drewe wait drewe just as i get my hand on the door handle a decisive snick reverberates through the car i jerk the handle hard but nothing happens ease up ace deputy daniels says from the front seat ive got to talk to her i yell yanking the handle again and again looks like the lady dont want to talk to you i smash my fists against the wire mesh in blind rage break em if you want champ daniels says lazily i seen it lots of times outside drewe has paused in the rainbeaded brilliance of the floodlights she stands like a refugee looking back at the car with her bag in her left hand and her right raised to shield her eyes i press my hands to the window as if to bridge the gulf between us by force of will her face is a ghostly decoupage of fragmented emotion trust shattered love blasted into confusion unity into terrible apartness she waits a moment longer then backs slowly away from the car away from me toward the house of her parents and of her childhood the cruiser is moving now backing quickly down the drive i fight to keep her in sight with my fingers locked in the wire screen i watch her melt through the silver wall of rain chapter in the past twentysix hours revelations have detonated like artillery shells being marched across a trench position i havent slept at all when deputy daniels and i got back to my house last night we found sheriff buckner and his demoralized posse standing around their cruisers theyd stormed the house and found no killer they did find a rat blown to pieces by billy jacksons shotgun billys second shot had fractured an electrical conduit pipe blowing out the lights in the tunnel a surgeon in jackson soon confirmed that the bullet in billys thigh had probably come from his partners gun the consensus was that brahma had never been in the tunnel at all buckner put me in his car and questioned me all the way to yazoo city after we got there he questioned me some more in between questions he bawled me out for scrubbing the blood from my office and contaminating his crime scene i was still in his office when a tugboat captain discovered the wreckage of a downed beechcraft baron in the mississippi river the captain believed the plane had crashed in the river sunk skated along the bottom for a while then ridden up his anchor cable after hanging up on it at dawn i rode with buckner out to the levee west of lamont to look at the wreck the damage was serious but less extensive than wed been led to believe buckner figured the pilot had tried an emergency landing on the spur levee near scott and accidentally gone into the water or else had attempted to ditch in the river the cockpit was empty we all knew the missing body meant nothing i once saw a new york college kid leap into the mississippi river from a paddle wheeler in new orleans as a prank he thought he could easily swim the half mile to shore he drowned screaming for help in front of three thousand people southerners who knew the river far too well to try to swim out to the fool who was dying to set the price of ignorance a search began immediately but the boys body was never found it would probably be the same with brahma unless he happened to wash up somewhere like vicksburg or baton rouge before he was shunted out into the gulf along with the other refuse of the river still i knew something buckner didnt if brahma had told me the truth online he was an accomplished swimmer and that gave me a serious dilemma if i told buckner about the swimming he would demand to know how i knew and if i confessed that id been in direct contact with the killer and had kept it to myself he would undoubtedly arrest me as an accessory to murder i told him nothing sometime during this kafkaesque marathon a towtruck driver discovered a heavy leather case containing surgical instruments wedged behind the beechcrafts pilots seat it contained several scalpelssome of which had blood on thema video camera and a long hightechlooking instrument that the driver didnt recognize from the description i knew it could only be the neuroendoscope miles had described the night before buckner thought the abandoned instrument case bolstered the crash theory he believed brahmas body and any light gear had been flushed out of the cockpit during or after the crash leaving only the heavy case inside when i argued that brahma might conceivably have left the case behind to create just that impressionand then demanded roundtheclock security on bob andersons house and my ownthe sheriff released me on the understanding that i would return home and remain there or else at the andersons i didnt say so but i suspected it would be a long time before id be welcome in the anderson house again the morning sun was high when i got home the interior of the house reeked of tear gas my office of clorox the deputies had torn the place to pieces during their raid and the subsequent search armed with my i went out to the utility shed and got a stout twobysix plank which i sawed in half and hammered across the pantry door with the heaviest nails i could find satisfied that no one could enter the house by that route without my hearing them i walked back into the office my answering machine showed nineteen messages i hit the button and collapsed into my swivel chair to listen the first nine were from tv reporters some from mississippi stations others from louisiana even one from cnn the tenth was from daniel baxter he cussed me for about a minute telling me hed intended to send an fbi evidence team down to go over my house until sheriff buckner informed him that id effectively destroyed the crime scene i fastforwarded through more messages from reporters then stopped as miless voice crackled from the speaker his message said to call him immediately at a new york number i didnt recognize his voice sounded strange like a loud whisper too tired to rise from the chair i rolled over to the answering machine picked up its cordless receiver and dialed the number after two rings the same whisper said yeah miles harper still the whisper yeah where are you you wont believe me goddamn it miles im in brahmas house my heart thudded in my chest what im in his house in his bedroom what the hells happening remember the serial number from brahmas microsoft program the beta version the fbi was talking to microsoft but its the weekend and they were going through channels i have a friend in redmond who was on the development team he bypassed the red tape turns out this particular disk was given to the columbia university school of medicine in for beta testing i heard only my own breathing as my mind made the connection drewes theory again columbia and neurosurgeons as soon as i got that he went on i hacked into the med school computers and got a list of departments that participated in the beta test i narrowed that to specialties dealing with the brain that gave me twentythree doctors on the chance that the family history brahma gave you was true i selected the obvious german surnames there were eight and five of those were jewish i culled those because brahmas german uncle definitely didnt sound jewish that left three names dörner thiele and berkmann before i checked their personnel files i took a chance that the christian names brahma gave you might be real rudolf remember son richard a psychiatrist miles waited a beat well it hit youre kidding rudolf edward berkmann age fortyseven neurobiologist and neurosurgeon father richard a psychiatrist and another columbia alum berkmanns on the faculty harper his curriculum vitae even noted that his grandfather was rudolf berkmann a distinguished new york surgeon good god he goes by edward you want to guess what edwards subspecialty is the pineal gland no berkmann is world renowned for building a d computer model of the brain hes been working on it since the seventies i accessed the columbia library and found dozens of articles and abstracts from medical journals in the last twenty years this guy has sliced up over four hundred human brains all to establish the base values for his model fifteen hundred slices per brain frozen like chicken livers now berkmann collates all brain research around the world and integrates it into the model which is constantly updated the thing can be used to map neurochemical reactions project the progress of tumors practice surgery train medical students theyre even using it with prototype telesurgery systems miles was speaking almost too fast for me to absorb his words dont you see berkmann would have been one of the first to learn about the foreign pineal research drewe told us about melatonin the transplants affecting aging all that think of the deal he could do with those doctors in exchange for early access to their findings he could offer to integrate them into his model thus giving the work legitimacy in the us of course once he got hold of their data he simply initiated his own transplant program using humans instead of animals miles tell me daniel baxter knows all this hes upstairs right now going through berkmanns stuff a gasp of relief escaped my lips id had visions of miles sitting alone with a flashlight in the chamber of horrors that must be brahmas house i found the place myself miles explained but brahma wasnt here you should see this house harper its the brownstone from the story he told you but its a palace now its not four blocks from lutece ive seen some stunning new york homes but this place the art alone is worth a fortune most of its indian sculpture he and his father must have smuggled out of the country anyway it was a choice between physically breaking in or getting baxters help i was worried they had agents tailing me anyway so i called him i cant believe he let you in the house i made him promise to let me see the computers before id tell him anything what did you find this isnt berkmanns main base i know that because theres no voicerecognition stuff here there was a brief pregnant silence then miles said but i found the answers harper the very bottom of the thing what are you talking about the reason for the murders why they were committed the way they were drewe was right about pineal transplants being the object of the killings but she was completely wrong about the resources it would take to perform one the way berkmann has it laid out its practically a oneman procedure i think he only used those indian doctors for anesthesiology and tissue typing how do you know that theres a sun sparcstation here in the study theres a version of his brain model in it the graphics are some of the best ive ever seen get to it miles theres a series of surgical procedures modeled here im still learning the program but the harvesting procedure is based around that instrument i told you about the neuroendoscope in some ways its pretty much like drewe guessed berkmanns mapped out four different approaches to the pineal gland one is based on spinal fluid pathways he makes one small incision in the back of the neck then passes the scope through the cisterna magna the foramen magnum the fourth ventricle the aqueduct of sylvius and right into the third ventricle home of the pineal gland he can do the whole harvest in fifteen minutes jesus hang with me now another route is the sublabialtranssphenoidal approach which drewe told us about another is through the soft palate in the roof of the mouth then along the brain stem the last is through the optic foramen i finish after removing the eyeball exactly drewe was right about that part berkmann used a different surgical route with each victim and the only evidence he was ever there was the track of his scope it was easy to mask it the backoftheneck route was nashville he fired a ninemillimeter bullet right along his track sublabial route was new york shotgun blast to the face the optic foramen route was san francisco stakes driven through the empty eye sockets right but san francisco and la were linked by pathologists they found pineal tissue in both cases did brahma screw up those procedures no this is the beautiful part of it harper the part drewe missed the pineal gland is endocrine tissue it has what they call constant anatomy that means you dont need the whole gland for it to function and once its inside the recipient it doesnt even need a direct blood supply what once the scope was in the donorwho was already deadbrahma used a biopsy forceps to pull out part of the pineal its just grainy wet stuff he calls it pineal homogenate to transplant it into the recipient he anesthetizes the patient then drills a small hole in the upper part of the breastbone called the manubrium which gives him access to the thymus just like the mouse transplants exactly after he locates the thymus he injects the pineal homogenate into it with a largebore needle the thymus has access to the circulatory system so as long as the pineal tissue isnt rejected it begins to function normally you see what i mean about simplicity i cant believe it drewe was wrong about tissue viability too berkmann has projections here about the viability of frozen homogenate its patterned after the way they bank bone marrow for transplants miles sounded almost out of breath we both sat in silence trying to integrate the new information with what we had theorized up to that point in some ways his discoveries changed everything but in others nothing the cops down here think berkmanns dead i said what does baxter think he doesnt accept a death until he sees the body do you think hes dead its hard for me to imagine it what does dr lenz think lenz is out of the loop the shrink theyre using now is studying your printouts like a lost book of the bible hes full of shit he thinks berkmanns ultimate plan is to resurrect a corpse by transplanting a healthy pineal into it his mothers for example what baxter actually has people watching catherine berkmanns grave right now its right here in new york christ thats not brahmas thing i know that this guys locked into known paradigms man believe it or not theyve caught serial killers before by staking out graves what about peter levy what are they doing to find him cant they contact people who knew berkmann for help now that they know who he is berkmann has no relatives in the us his colleagues say hes an eccentric genius terrific at attracting large donations to columbia other than that they know zip about him his house is essentially empty of evidence no hostages no body parts no nasty crawl space full of surprises baxter says there has to be a killing house somewhere rented or owned under a false name thats where levy would be hes going to concentrate in connecticut they finally located the airstrip where berkmann stored his plane its outside darien as our discussion moved away from berkmanns technical plans and closer to berkmann the man i began to sense a strange undercurrent in miless voice it felt like anger anger bordering on rage when i asked him about it he fell silent then as i was about to speak again he said harper i finally understand how brahmahow berkmann i meangot the master client list after going so long without an answer to this question i had almost forgotten it but miles obviously had not how i asked from my apartment but i thought you hadnt had any burglaries i havent i dont get it he hacked into your home workstation he didnt hack into anything when i first got berkmanns name from the columbia computers i searched every database i could get into i got a mountain of stuff back including pictures and as soon as i saw the first photo i knew knew what that hed been in my apartment miles paused letting it sink in that id let him into my apartment a hot numbness swept over my face i tried to swallow but my throat muscles didnt seem to be working properly uh when was this about a year ago he wasnt calling himself berkmann then i met him at a party in the village but how did he i mean how did he use your computer without your knowing i was sleeping he must have gotten up without me realizing it that was the only time i ever saw him but one night was enough for him to get the master client list in spite of my past suspicions i still couldnt imagine miles involved with a man in this wayparticularly brahma miles i id rather not discuss it he said curtly i felt i owed you the truth after prying into your relationship with erin holly and everything miles you sound pretty upset edward berkmann killed erin harper she was a special person and he violated my trustviolated me just to miles i broke in afraid to hear more if brahma is alive my family could be in danger tell me what he looks like how dangerous would he be oneonone i heard shallow breathing and thought of the agony miles must be going through his description of himself was accurate he said in a flat voice cellinis perseus would give you the body very muscular very strong byronic face black hair blue eyes light skin beautiful in the classical sense a very intense aura thats what drew me to him the tortured tone in miless voice made listening to him almost unbearable i said can i reach you at this number if i need to yes its a rented cellular theres one other thing what i asked having no choice he had a scar across his upper abdomen it was huge i didnt ask what caused it but it must have been a serious operation the hissing silence bound us like a chain miles in a choked voice he said ive got to go harper wait miles whatever you did however you are you dont have to hide it okay not from me not from drewe i just want you to know that he said nothing you watch your back up there okay i heard more shallow breathing almost like panting then he said if berkmanns alive im going to kill him before i could speak again he was gone i started to redial his cellular then hung up the implications of what hed said were impossible for me to fathom im not even sure i wanted to i leaned back in the chair and closed my eyes the silence enfolded me like a shroud of thick cotton yet even as i slipped down into sleep some part of me refused to yield to unconsciousness i stood up blinking and went into the bathroom thinking i would take a hot shower then remembering brahma i decided i didnt want to put myself in quite so vulnerable a position instead i threaded my belt through the slits in the holster pouch of my put on the gun and shaved at the bathroom sink like a cowboy i washed my face and neck with a steaming rag then sat on the commode with the pistol in my hand i put down the gun to use the toilet paper at the fourth pull a flash of color caught my eye blinking with fatigue i unfolded the wad of tissue in my hand there was something pink on the paper something other than pale flowered print when i turned the tissue over i saw letters written with a light touch in pink highlighter were the words sorry i missed you left a present in the fridge check the lettuce b my mouth went dry as sawdust i snatched up the but fell over as i tried to jerk up my pants finally zipped up i eased through the bathroom door holding the pistol in front of me then i realized how stupid it was to be frightened brahma berkmannhad written that message sometime yesterday that was why he left it where he did in a place where police would be unlikely to search but where i was sure to find it eventually still i kept the in my right hand while i opened the refrigerator and lifted the head of lettuce out of the vegetable drawer turning it over i saw a knifethin seam of dark green running around the white stem in a diamond shape i set down the pistol and twisted the stem out of the cold leafy head inside a hollowedout space in the lettuce was something that looked like a gray strip of plastic for a second i worried that it might be a bomb then i realized i was looking sideon at an eightmillimeter videotape cartridge chapter i attached my video camera to my office television with a coaxial patch cable then inserted the tape it had been rewound and was ready to be viewed i scrambled through my camera bag for the remote control then sat down in my swivel chair about six feet from the screen and hit play the first image on the tape was identical to what id seen when sheriff buckner opened my office door last night except that erin was lying faceup in the center of the floor rather than behind the headboard of the bed she was nude and her eyes were closed as i focused on her face a man stepped into the frame as silently as a deer he had the physical symmetry of a gymnast beneath a tan jacket that looked like egyptian cotton he wore black clothes that fit tight against him but it was his face that arrested my attention the skin was unnaturally pale the hair deep black with a few fine strands of silver it fell in ringlets around his high forehead his brow lines looked cut from marble but met and descended to a surprisingly gentle and wellformed nose the lips were full and might have looked too feminine were they not balanced by a prominent chin from the point of the chin his jaw swept back and upward in a v giving him an almost avian aspect but what anchored the remarkable face what unified its disparate features was the eyes pure cobalt blue they pierced the camera lens with unnerving power did i not tell you i was beautiful he said his voice was low and resonant his cadence almost archaic only when he moved did i realize how profound was his stillness he cocked his head to one side as if waiting for an answer then he resumed his former attitude standing centered in the frame as immutably as a marble david since this must needs be a onesided conversation he said i shall begin isnt this a fine kettle of fish as the common folk used to say i dont think either of us expected to find ourselves in this situation did we mr cole mr harper cole i squeezed the arms of my chair unreasonably shocked by his knowledge of my real identity and who am i you wonder his eyebrows went up inquisitively youve known me by many names but perhaps you know even my legal name by now thanks to this reaching into his coat pocket he brought out a flat piece of black plastic it was a inch floppy disk he held it up to the lens so i could read the label trojan horse i think we both know who designed this he said then he tossed the disk across the room i am rudolf edward berkmann of course i didnt know your real name until a few minutes ago but now that i do everything is painfully clear you must be dying to know what happened i certainly was at first i feared the whole thing had been a trap laid on by daniel baxter that he would begin braying at me through a bullhorn any minute but it was something altogether different wasnt it youre smarter than baxter and poor doctor lenz put together arent you yet you produced the same result they did a woman you loved is dead berkmann gave a tight smile i know the feeling harper he licked his red lips and glided forward out of the frame i heard a soft groan then he was back in front of the camera holding up one hand which i saw to my horror had been dipped in blood he flourished the hand before the lens like a magician then with a bloody forefinger daubed a scarlet spot on his forehead like a caste mark kali was the vessel of my corrupt longings he said my faithful concubine for twenty years she was also my slave both are lost arts requiring dedication and love you attacked that love harper with lies and now she is dead turning his profile to the camera he threw back his head flicked out his tongue and brought his bloody palm down across the tip tasting kalis blood he shivered then dropped the hand and turned back to face the camera his cerulean eyes wide you tell slippery lies lies that are true poor erin had no idea she was starring in an exclusive production put on by you and your friend miles did she i wanted to shut off the tape then to spare myself but i couldnt berkmann made a quick turn away from the camera and gave a wistful wave to the center of the floor where erins naked body lay such a waste he said with what sounded like genuine regret are you wondering whether ive fucked her yet whether shes really even dead he nodded rest assured that she is and no i havent given myself that pleasure for one simple reason erin is your victim harper he smiled again his eyes communicating almost paternal sadness ive learned a lot today its a strange experience for me im accustomed to being the teacher and to be made a fool of twice in one day its really too embarrassing you dont know what im talking about do you of course not let me explain as erin you approached me at a vulnerable time id been experiencing difficulties with my work i was considering a sabbatical and we seemed to have much in common i saw through lenzs clumsy ruse from the start of course but yours you were quite convincing a gift i suppose as our relationship deepened kali began to take an interest she was quick as mercury at reading emotion and she saw the effect erin was having on me her feelings for me had always run much deeper than i suspected i realize that now her first response was to demand that i use erin as the next pineal donor obviously if i refused i would betray my true interest i had to proceed carefully kali could be very dangerous as you know i agreed that erin would be our next donor then came the resolution of the lenz problem on the night kali killed the good doctors wife she searched his study she found certain things which she kept to herself she learned for example that erin was another trap just like lilith but she chose not to tell me this she was wise in principle i was losing my perspective kali understood my vulnerability but she also knew the futility of trying to convince a man that his affections are misplaced how many wives have convinced husbands that they really dont love the voluptuous secretary quite futile kali decided to let reality teach me the required lesson a touch of zen for the master you see she obviously felt she could handle whatever violence was required when we arrived here i had no idea what was happening my plan was to spirit erin away under the pretense that she was a donor and thenif she proved to be the woman i hoped she wasfind a way to separate her from kali later surveillance proved to be impossible with your house so isolated a blitz attack was the only option i entered alone meaning to tranquilize erin immediately to eliminate any chance of problems but when i saw how beautiful she was in the fleshthe real erini had to speak i felt that after our conversations she would have no trouble recognizing me for what i was her dark prince but it was karin wheat all over again erin was terrified of course she had no idea what i was talking about but her terror masked that fact i still dont know what she was doing here fate sometimes takes a hand in these things i tried to calm her but it did no good then suddenly berkmann began to move about the office like a film director blocking out scenes rather than wait outside as instructed kali had listened through the door she burst in with her knife and began to shout at me didnt i see what a fool i had been like that but when she saw erina real woman who matched the jpeg photograph youd sent meshe stopped shouting i think she was as confused as i i placed myself between them tried to calm kali i said we should take erin with us kali temporized then she told me to shoot erin with a dart i pointed the gun as instructed but for some reason i couldnt fire that was the end kali shrieked and flew at erin erin lunged for the sword on the wall i fired then believing that if erin went down that way i could keep kali from killing her but by then she was a moving target the dart only struck her shoulder berkmann moved faster whirling like a choreographer feinting and lunging with natural grace kali tried to go around me but i blocked her path she slashed me with her knife and i went down he rolled on the floor and came up into a half crouch both women were screaming erin had already struck kali twice with the sword berkmann leaped to the center of the office where the bloody circus of footprints had been the night before they fought here it was magnificent a scene worthy of michelangelo the western woman untrained but genetically superior armed with a sword the eastern woman a perfect killing machine armed only with a knife it happened in the time it took me to load a second dart from the case in my pocket kali struck again and again but erin repelled every blow parrying like a fencer as soon as i had a steady shot i fired into kalis neck berkmann made a pffft sound with his lips and teeth it was a mistake the shot stunned both women then kali lunged for the kill and erin ran her through they stood locked together like embracing lovers and i thought the battle done then kali buried her knife in erins back erin managed to shove her away then collapsed herself twisting to imitate the climax of the duel berkmann ceased motion with his knees slightly bent like a crazed fred astaire looking into the camera while dipping an invisible partner she died in my arms harper sorrow and pity as if someone had yelled cut he rose casually and stood centered in the frame again i tried to save her but kali had hit the heart it was hopeless i looked at my watch then the tape had been running for more than three minutes i couldnt believe berkmann had the nerve to stand there making this documentary of depravity knowing that someone could walk in on him at any moment buckners men the fbi me drewe a wave of sweat suffused my skin as i realized just how narrowly drewe must have missed him once i saw how things stood berkmann said i took a little stroll round the place i had the run of it after all and such an interesting time i had going through this peculiar little house so many mementos this for example from his inside coat pocket he brought out a folded eightbyten photograph which he opened bob anderson had shot the picture about four months ago at one of the family barbecues in it drewe and i stand beside bobs mammoth grill a little apart while patrick rests a proprietary arm on erins shoulder erin is wearing a yellow sundress and sitting in a white lawn chair holly dressed in a matching sundress stands with victorian gravity resting an arm across erins tanned knees i feel like part of the family berkmann crooned leaving the photo suspended from one hand and walking around to study it with the physical genius of a mime hmmm lets see his finger danced along the paper until it stopped at my face here you are yes handsome enough chap i suppose though a little doughy for my taste not at all like your friend miles while i squeezed my knees in fury the finger moved again and lighted on erins face and here we have the sublime earth goddess i so foolishly believed i was communing with via eros so much darker than you led me to believe she could almost be kali at twentyfive and behind hercan it be the cuckolded husband how could erin ever have convinced herself that this mooncalf would be enough for her of course she might have been a perfect match for him ive given a lot of thought to that these past few minutes was erin the woman you played her as or did you inject some of yourself into herpardon the punas writers are wont to do in novels how thrilling it must have been playing both roles as you doled out your naughty little secret you gave erin a voice didnt you one she never had in real life ill wager berkmanns finger slid down erins chest to holly and here the little love child but a daughter not a son our own little pearl any fool can see youre her father as he spoke berkmann moved his head upon his neck with serpentine suppleness as if to hypnotize me by motion alone but im leaving someone out arent i the alpha female of the family as i teased at my meager facts it came to me that there was someone else in this house far superior to both you and your earthy paramour you painted her as the perfect sister the ideal wife but shes much more than that i think im speaking of this woman harper this woman here the finger lighted on drewes chest this is beauty my duplicitous friend what a fortunate boy you are what a delicious arrangement you had the carnal erin for sex and this noble lady for a wife more than any man deserves i should think oh yes berkmann refolded the photo and slipped it back into his inside pocket but your day is coming harper be assured of it im going to disappear for a while not my first choice but then i dont have a choice do i please tell daniel baxter not to waste any more public funds searching for me ive been planning for this day a long time even had my work succeeded i could not have remained in america appreciation of genius takes time but theres a wide world out there and i know it well without warning or explanation berkmann suddenly slipped off his jacket and began unbuttoning his shirt im a free agent now he said almost to himself so liberating both jacket and shirt fell to the floor while i stared looking for the huge scar miles had mentioned he raised both arms high above his head like a gull spreading its wings if he had risen two feet into the air i would not have been surprised as his right arm lifted i saw a dark line transecting the ribs maybe five inches long it took a moment to realize i was looking at sutures they were weeping blood kali had stabbed him and the son of a bitch had stitched himself up i appear to be leaking he said in an almost embarrassed voice notice the christlike position of the wound he laughed then dropped one arm and traced a line beneath his sternum and along his ribs and i finally saw it a massive chevronshaped scar probably twenty inches long with its midpoint beneath his breastbone and extending outward in both directions it was an old scar faded white with the dotted pattern of staples rather than the hash marks of sutures it looked as though someone had opened berkmanns entire abdomen for some reason you see this one he asked this is where it all began in that moment all the levity went out of him he stared into the lens with mesmerizing power his latissimus dorsi muscles flaring beneath his armpits like the hood of a cobra there are two kinds of people in the world harper the healthy and the sick actually they inhabit two different worlds the world of shadow and the world of light the door between those worlds opens only in one direction and i was born on the wrong side of the door i did all i could to remain strong as you know but when aids entered the blood supply my hemophilia became a potential death sentence then it was discovered that hemophiliacs who received liver transplants for viral hepatitis miraculously regained their clotting ability for me it was a revelation the door could open in the other direction hemophiliacs as a class werent given transplants of course not enough livers to go around and their symptoms could be controlled with clotting factor but clotting factor carried aids didnt it i wasnt about to die for the willful ignorance of my government i never even hesitated kali helped me find the surgeons i needed she bargained with them they could barely speak english after all it caused them no end of difficulty obtaining american credentials but they had good hands and they liked money the only problem was convincing someone to make the required donation berkmanns lips flattened into something like a smile but kali helped me there too she was quite indispensable he tapped the transplant scar lightly it was a traumatic experience suppressing my immune system to accept the organ all the rest but i survived and i was cured once wed accomplished the liver transplant well you can see what a natural progression it was to further research he looked down at the scar again then raised his right hand and pointed at the camera i felt he was pointing through the lens right at my heart but now kali is dead my best assisting surgeon is dead erin is dead yet you are alive i tasted bile in my throat remember the mills of the gods harper you know the reference of course not while i stared in disbelief berkmann unbuckled his pants dropped them to the floor along with his underwear and stepped out of the disordered pile the husk falls away he said then he lifted his left arm above his head as if holding something in his clenched fist cocked his right arm at his side and became utterly still every muscle in his body defined itself in basrelief beneath his alabaster flesh without ever seeing the actual statue i knew that i was looking at cellinis perseus i was still trying to take in the enormity of berkmanns madness when he burst into fluid motion whirling from one edge of the video frame to the other it could have been a ritual dance or the mindless flailings of a lunatic his voice so resonant before became an atonal blare howling syllables that my mind could not form into any known language i had the sense that id stumbled into a hillbilly pentecostal church where men and women rolled on the floor with poisonous snakes and gibbered in tongues but the man on my television screen was no hillbilly i started in the chair when he ducked down and came up with erins body in his arms without missing a beat he began twirling her corpse around the room in a grotesque parody of a waltz erins head hung limp on her chest like the head of a broken bird berkmann held her in perfect ballroom position as he danced and it struck me that he must possess demonic strength to hold a dead body suspended that way each time he wheeled toward the camera he made sure his eyes met the lens boring into mine as i gaped at the knife wound in erins back finallyas though from boredom rather than fatiguehe danced erins body over to the corner and gently laid it behind my bed where drewe would later discover it i thought i might have to run to the bathroom to be sick but berkmann stopped me by prancing up to the camera and aiming it toward my bed staying within the cameras field of view he walked to the bed reached up over it and took one of my guitars down from the wall it was a martin a prewar model id bought with one of my first big trading checks berkmann looked back at the camera and said youre the singer arent you then he pressed the instrument against his stomach as if coupling with it it took me a second to realize what he was doing he had slipped his uncircumcised penis to the side of the stringsinto the sound holeand begun urinating loudly all the while watching me with rapture on his face what a lovely sound he said then he cackled when he finished he shook himself off and hung the guitar exactly where hed found it i glanced away from the tv screen long enough to verify that the martin was still there it was oh he said as though hed forgotten to leave a tip in a restaurant he went to his discarded clothes and took something from a pocket it looked like a long metal film canister he straightened up and hefted it in his hand like a man feeling the weight of a cigar i harvested these before i realized erin wasnt who i thought she was i saw she wasnt menstruating and took a chance she might be ovulating no point in keeping them now of course he walked back to the bed and opened one end of the canister a cloud of pale vapor swirled out then he leaned over the bed slid the open end of the canister into the sound hole of the guitar he had urinated into and shook the contents into it as rapidly as the manic phase had come over him it ended leaving only the demonic intensity and the frigid blue eyes he stepped very close to the lens so that his blurred face filled the frame and said save this tape harper were forever joined now we whose lovers killed each other you cant show it to anyone though can you not unless you want to acknowledge holly his breath fogged the lens do you want to do that he pulled back then and as his cruel smile faded he said with the gravity of a prophet remember harper we are all broken from within then he reached up to the camera and the screen went black after my heartbeat steadied i stood up and took the treasured martin down from the wall walked out the back door and laid it faceup in the yard then i went to the utility shed got a gasoline can and doused the guitar from head to strap peg with newspaper and matches from the kitchen i began tossing flaming balls of paper at the martin from the back door the third one hit the seasoned wooden face and eighteen thousand dollars worth of handmade guitar and part of my sisterinlaw exploded into fire the sounds the martin made as it died were like bones breaking and tendons snapping and in ten minutes there was nothing left but tuning pegs and charred steel strings miles and daniel baxter were standing outside berkmanns manhattan brownstone when i called miless rented cellular baxter was about to leave for connecticut to oversee the search for berkmanns killing house which he thought might be in the area of the darien airstrip baxter thought berkmanns frankness about his identity on the videotape indicated that hed left my house with the intention of fleeing the country i didnt explain that berkmann thought i would never mention the tape to the fbi instead i pointed out that he had been flying north not south when his plane went down baxter asked me to overnight the original tape to him at quantico i agreed though i intended to send him a vhs copy appropriately edited baxter also thought berkmanns knife wound lent some credence to the plane crash scenario miles disagreed but i couldnt tell whether hed used logic to form that opinion or whether he was merely hoping berkmann had survived the crash so that he could kill him with his own hands after hanging up i shuffled through my desk drawer until i found the number i wanted then dialed mclean virginia the phone rang ten times before arthur lenz answered i have no interest in talking to you he said i dont believe you doctor believe it youre speaking to a chastened man so are you are you up to date on the eros case daniel has cut off my information he says its for my own good so you dont know what happened last night i still have a few loyal friends in the unit youre referring to the murder of a mrs graham and an unknown female of indian descent yes did you know that mrs graham was my wifes sister the erin i told you about in your car a brief silence the mother of your child right i didnt then you dont know it was me who drew the killer straight to her drew him how by doing exactly what you did pretending to be a female eros client yes erin graham to be exact i used my own guilty secret as bait but i told it from her point of view and you succeeded where i failed all i succeeded in doing was getting someone i cared about killed no you fooled strobekker didnt you he believed you were actually the woman he went to kill i suddenly realized lenz had no idea that berkmann had been identified look im calling because ive got about twenty pages of conversation between myself and the killer ive also got a video of him that looks like something from a fellini film id like you to look at it why would i want to do that because his whole background is there his entire family going back three generations its got to be a gold mine in terms of forensic psychiatry lenz said nothing hes a thirdgeneration physician doctor a sharp intake of air nobody told you that baxter has a team of shrinks going over his house right now they know who he is yep no more unsub his name is edward berkmann edward berkmann know him not personally but i know his work my god neurobiological modeling of the brain using computers his father was an innovative analyst richard berkmann discredited now of course my god what would you say if i told you edward berkmann was the child of an incestuous relationship what type fatherdaughter brothersister ill look at what you have what exactly do you want from me the police think berkmanns dead i dont does daniel think hes dead i dont know i cant tell you whether hes alive or dead cole i know that i just want you to look at everything and on the assumption that hes still alive try to predict what hell do that could be very difficult i only care about one thing will he run or will he come back for me and my family ah i might be able to do that edward berkmann i could never have imagined it wait till you see the video lenzs voice recedes to a blurry distance tell me cole are you experiencing strong urges for revenge you know the answer to that what about you id like to shave off his skin an ounce at a time you dont sound that angry im not a demonstrative man but contrary to what you saw when you met her my wife was once a beautiful and gracious woman i believe you the man who killed her so brutally should pay for what he did if hes still alive fax your pages through overnight a copy of the video it may take some time some of my case materials were stolen the night my wife died ill call you when i have something one second doctor what are the mills of the gods the mills of the gods it must be a quote or something he told me to remember the mills of the gods ah it is a quote the mills of the gods grind slowly but they grind to powder meaning it may take a while but we all get whats coming to us i cant argue with that lenz hung up without a word i rewound berkmanns video plugged a blank vhs tape into my vcr and started dubbing a copy then i called sheriff buckners office and again demanded that he provide roundtheclock security for the anderson family and also for me he told me he already had people on bobs house for political reasons i knew and that he would assign one deputy to watch my house after dark the last shell of the afternoon exploded thirty minutes later i was lying on the sofa in the front room trying to stay awake when the phone rang in my office i heaved myself up and went in to screen the call sure it would be another reporter trying to worm his way into the story when drewes voice came from the answering machine gooseflesh rose on my arms its me was all she said but those two words affected me more deeply than berkmanns whole twisted tirade i reached for the receiver then froze as her next words tumbled out of the machine please dont pick up if youre there please i mean it im calling to ask youto tell youthat you shouldnt come to the funeral tomorrow daddys gone to pieces hes at the funeral home right now sitting a vigil over erins body like they did in the old days he wont let anyone else do it its almost like hes trying to protect her even though its too late i shouldnt care what happens to you but for your sake and for his please dont go to the funeral please daddy needs to blame someone for what happened and youre the most convenient target she paused and i stood like a condemned man in the hiss of blank tape as far as what you told me i cant even think about it but i know its true maybe ive always known it dont call me harper i mean that dont try to see me and dont come to the funeral if you have any respect left for me dont come goodbye i snatched up the phone then yelling drewe wait but she clicked off even before i got the words out blinking like a punchdrunk fighter i heard a horn honk outside from the window i watched a white sheriffs cruiser pull into our drive its driver executed a threepoint turn and parked noseout toward the highway buckner must have decided i rated daylight security as well now i lie on drewes bed my face buried in her pillow trying to catch the scent of her like some lovesick teenager but im no teenager im a heartsick man who broke his own rule and told the truth only to find out he was a fool for doing it or else did it too late fatigue conjures strange thoughts i once believed that all men existed on a continuum of behavior some leaning to the moral side others the immoral or even amoral yet all having the capacity through circumstance to end up at either extreme its a common conceit i suppose the idea that but for the grace of god or fate or chance any of us could be walking in anyone elses shoes but as the ticking of my brain slows an onslaught of images from the berkmann tape assails me none more monstrous than the desecration of erins corpse by the grotesque death waltz hovering in that halfwaking state on the ledge of sleep i realize that on this earth walk beings who inhabit the shells of men but are not men they are other and somewhere deep within me in the cells of my blood pulses a cold current of preverbal knowledge a tribal memory absorbed and distilled to savage instinct needing no voice to speak with allconsuming power that which is other must be destroyed chapter drewe told me not to go to erins funeral but she said nothing about the burial the funeral service was at three pm its nearly fourthirty as i drive into the cairo county cemetery through the back entrance passing the long utility shed surrounded by yellow backhoes and a rusted fleet of lawn mowers the cemetery superintendents office looks like a good place to conceal the explorer from casual view as i make for the small building i think of miles he called this morning to give me an update on the hunt for berkmanns hidden killing house baxters teams have been searching the area surrounding the connecticut airstrip but miles always the contrarian has been combing the streets of harlem and washington heights moving in concentric semicircles away from the columbia presbyterian medical center which backs against the hudson river like an island of succor rising from the squalor of the upper hundreds parking the explorer behind the superintendents office i get my guitar case out of the back and begin walking slowly toward the anderson family plot it lies a hundred yards to the west ive been there many times with drewe five generations of andersons rest in that ground from infants who died of diphtheria to soldiers who survived whatever war fell to them and returned to the delta to die of old age today it is marked by the green pavilion tent of marsaws funeral home which rises out of the ground like a generals field headquarters amid an army of stones from the west comes the invading force the living a seemingly endless line of slowmoving automobiles fronted by an advance guard of darksuited infantry i select a mausoleum for temporary cover a thickwalled edifice of marble and stone about sixty yards from the funeral tent two stone vases adorn its wroughtiron door and one of them makes a serviceable stool erins burial is like most others ive seen only larger the entire town of rain is present a bluebrown blanket of polyester dotted by the dark silks of expensively clothed people from vicksburg and greenville and clarksdale and memphis i see several doctors from jacksoncolleagues of drewes or patricksand at the periphery standing apart from the rest a couple of tall stunningly dressed and coiffed young women accompanied by a grayhatted man wearing dark sunglasses friends of erins from her new york days im surprised any of them showed i cant see drewe but she must be seated under the sunbleached tent shell be holding one parents hand in each of hers and quieting holly when she gets too distracted anna the black maid who has worked for the andersons since before i was born will be with them i should be there too but i am not wanted i have forfeited my place i hate the flatness of this sunscorched boneyard i once attended a funeral in natchez the burial took place on majestic bluffs high above the mississippi river in a whitestoned athens of a cemetery shaded by mossdraped oaks thats how a cemetery should be a place that can bring a little peace to the living erins graveside service is mercifully short the crowd thins at the edges first the impatient ones heading for cars they parked away from the cortege in order to facilitate a quick exit a few people move in my direction possibly to visit their own dead but i stand my ground to hell with them and whatever they think about why im not at drewes side as larger waves move toward the line of waiting cars i know that one word is on the lips of everyone murder more evil has probably been spoken of erin on this day than on any during her life whispered rumors of drug addiction and promiscuity recalled in the glare of a sensational crime savored as the most titillating gossip to touch this town in a decade most of the local citizens will have convinced themselves that she brought the murder on herself the wages of sin brother amen yet somewhere beneath that summary judgment lies fear a nameless dread that perhaps this daughter of rain did nothing to bring her fate upon herself that some faceless being has for unknown or unknowable reasons chosen this little enclave as his hunting ground or perhaps evengod forbidthat he was raised here i am glad for that fear they deserve it when the muted rumble of engines rolls past me i focus on the tent that shades erins grave my line of sight is clear now the family is there standing together a much diminished group of mourners stands a respectful distance apart close friends at last with drewe and anna at their head escorting margaret the family steps from beneath the tent and joins the waiting mourners when i spy patrick with holly in his arms anger ambushes me again i should be there that is my family whatever may have happened and erin would want me there but drewe does not she blamed my exclusion on her father but i think she lied this separation is punishment for my intimacy with erin bob anderson looks lost in the ritual of hugs and tears like a soldier separated from his unit after a battle he moves constantly restlessly i want to talk to him exactly why im not sure but in this patriarchal family making peace with bob is the first step toward reconciliation the problem is how to approach him would drewe cause a scene maybe i should wait and see him at his office hell probably be working tomorrow morning trying like all reticent men to grind away his grief with labor but i dont have to wait without a discernible glance in my direction bob detaches himself from the crowd and walks across the grass toward me he has the hunters eye hes known i was here all along he must be sixty but he still moves with animal ease his burly limbs churning around that low center of gravity like an organic machine i feel myself tensing for the inevitable explosion of his rage i doubt he would desecrate the ceremony by hitting me here but theres no knowing for sure he stops two feet from me and looks into my face bob is shorter than i by a good six inches but his presence has little to do with his physical mass the windburned skin and bluegray eyes seem to show first anger then grief then disgust but perhaps i am merely reading my own feelings onto his face glancing past him for an instant i see drewe looking our way look at me bob says sharply dr anderson he stops me by raising one hand to the level of his lapel i want to ask you one question yes sir do you know who killed my baby girl my baby girl words so far from the image i will always carry of erin the very archetype of sensual womanhood but behind the eyes of her father a combat veteran who watched friends die by the dozen in korea there is only ineffable love for a being he will always see as an infant or perhaps a beautiful toddler i know his name i tell him but i dont know where he is you think hes alive then yes sir i do the fbi says hes probably dead i know that but i dont believe it bob nods almost imperceptibly i dont either ive known men who fell into that river and came out alive i wait i want you to promise me something harper yes sir if you find out this man is alive somewhere you pick up the phone and call me first thing you understand first thing the baldness of bobs intent reaches toward me like windblown flame its the sort of intensity that makes even veteran cops nervous what do you have in mind to do i ask his mouth twitches at one corner put him down dr ander in the ground a chill prickles the hair on my neck and shoulders for the first time since this madness began i feel i am looking at a man who is a match for edward berkmann unlike lenz miles or baxter bob anderson is terrifyingly simple clever rather than brilliant he can handle any weapon from a deerskinning knife to an automatic rifle and he is possessed by a righteous anger that looks not to the law for guidance but to the old testament by which he was raised promise me he says again i will bob exhales deeply a sound almost like a sigh but heavier a sound that carries the weight of a burden i cannot begin to comprehend drewe is my pride and joy he says looking over his shoulder to where his wife and surviving daughter stoically accept the condolences of the last stragglers shes already accomplished more than i ever did im so damned proud of her i cant sit still with it but erin he looks back at me allowing his shield of impassivity to drop a little erin was always different i knew from the start she was a wayward girl god knows but it wasnt her fault it was her nature she put us through the trials of job but i think we loved her all the more for it for a moment he seems unable to continue then he wipes both eyes and regains his voice i dont know what went on between you and erin but i always sensed there was something jesus no mans immune to the temptations of the flesh son and god knows she was a temptation to every man who ever saw her but this when you told me she was dead i thought id kill you the second i could get my hands on you i knew that somehow that computer sex thing of yours had gotten her killed but flying back from memphis i realized you were gonna punish yourself more than i ever could and if you didnt god would bob runs a hand over his balding scalp but this other bastard hes my responsibility aint no father and mother no place gonna have to endure what margaret and i have because of this man dr anderson you listen to me son i got enough money to take care of margaret if she lives to be a hundred and fifty im gonna leave some to patrick to take care of holly and some to drewe for the kids you two will have one day the rest is going to margaret and im naming you as trustee just be still harper you know more about money than anybody i ever knew and more important i trust you i want to speak but a lump the size of a golf ball is blocking my throat i never agreed with your daddys politics bob says haltingly but i always respected his guts for a long time now ive looked at you like you was my own now you got to put the past behind you and do whatever you have to do to make up with drewe and get on with the business of living he inhales deeply as though speaking so many words winded him thats all ive got to say bob sticks out his callused hand i take it and for the first time since my father died i feel a surge of filial devotion an atavistic sense of belonging that blasts all words into the eternal irrelevance they embody for the few seconds we clasp hands i am plugged into a world where ambiguity does not exist and i feel strong everyone is gone now in the distance i see the yellow backhoe that will fill erins grave but no operator the funeralhome tent gives surprisingly cool shade or perhaps its the opened earth that cools the air here taking my surviving martin from its case i realize i forgot to bring a strap ill have to sit to play using one foot i prop the flight case up on its side and sit on the fat end with my shoes at the foot of the grave the polished metal casket has a bottomless sheen a french vanilla sprinkling of delta soil dropped by the family lies across the lid like the first fingers of the reclaiming earth i hope you can hear this i say my voice sounding too offhand for what should be a solemn moment hitting the strings once to check the tuning i begin the syncopated chords that lead into all i want is everything a song i wrote in a moment of crystallized indecision a song erin asked me to play anytime she saw me with a guitar with a suspended chord hanging in the air i begin singing softly being born in babylon its so hard to get off on the halflife of every choice we love that serpents voice it takes a sure hand and a sharp knife to cut the fruit from the tree of life but once you taste that virgin drop how do you know when to stop all i want is everything girl you know its true all i want is everything but all i need is diamond cuff links on my sleeves gold teeth in my mouth chartreuse italian shoes and time to wear them out no really a nice house and a nice car and a nice girl not a movie star a normal kid and some green grass and a great camera to make them last all i want is everything girl you know its true all i want is everything but all i need is you i play without singing for a bit remembering how erin used to laugh at the verse about the gold teeth and italian shoes and then suddenly get pensive as the rest of the lyric came around she knew she would never fit into the middleclass scene painted in the second half of that verse and perhaps also that she would never be all i neededjust as no one person could keep all her demons at bay remembering the farewell kiss in her house on the day she died i sing the last verse two roads lead from this spot ones easy the others not they say pleasures born from pain but i dont ride that train i can go east i can go west choose one and i lose the rest but for a man who wants it all this is sure some easy call all i want is everything girl you know its true all i want is everything but all i need is you as the last chord fades into silence a voice from close behind me freezes me in place what are you doing moving slowly i lay the guitar on the ground get up and turn to face drewe she stands just inside the shade of the tent wearing a black dress black shoes black hat and rayban sunglasses she seems a pale apparition of rebuke saying goodbye i reply this is what she wanted i had to do it you told me you wrote that song for me i did but she liked it drewe says nothing i glance over her shoulder for a car but see only the empty cemetery lane what did my father say to you he let me know it was okay i was here thats not all he said thats all im going to tell you her mouth wrinkles in disgust more secrets if you like she sighs then turns and begins walking away he told me i should do whatever it took to make up with you i call out that we should get on with living she stops and turns back squinting her eyes against the sun and what did you say to that nothing i dont think i can make it up to you i think it comes down to whether you can live with what you know and with me too or whether you want to do you think anyone could i dont know i think youre a unique person drewe i think you love me even if you dont like me or even respect me right now and you think thats something to build a life on its a start i love you drewe ive loved and respected you since we were kids then why did you fuck my sister the profanity shocks me but if anything was ever going to push her to it this is it because i couldnt sleep with you no she cries bitterly we were sleeping together then youd asked me to marry you and you said we should take a year to be sure that was for your benefit i was sure i thought you might not be and obviously i was right i was sure drewe you were sleeping with other women too werent you no she walks back a little way her arms folded protectively across her chest i hate this she says softly i hate it i hate it too i try to trust people i want to but everything is always soso ugly at the bottom thats not true it is its not true with you i mean youre the exception and im glad you are it actually gives me hope for the world she pulls off her sunglasses and looks into my eyes im no exception harper what do you mean just what i said no ones completely pure everyone has a past what are you talking about she hesitates then pushes on what could you learn about me that would shock you the most that would hurt you the most there is a strange buzzing in my head which prevents my thinking clearly im not sure i youre not the only man ive slept with harper she takes a quick step back as though the bald statement has shocked even her you dont believe me but you said i let you think that because you wanted to believe it so badly and because it was almost true almost true she folds and unfolds the earpieces of the sunglasses in her hands when i was in college the last year before medical school i hadnt seen you for almost two years you called maybe twice that whole time id spent four years doing nothing but studying id just taken the mcat and i was sure id blown it completely but you scored in the ninetyeighth percentile i didnt know that then okay i just hit this down place in my life i felt like everything had been a mistake id been in love with you for years was practically living like a nun yet i was being faithful to a man who was sleeping with women all over the country it seemed insane it was insane drewe one night i accepted a date with this boy we went for pizza and a movie nothing special but i liked him he was in some of my classes and he made me laugh a lot anyway when he took me home i asked him to come in drewe you dont and while we were kissing she says forcefully i realized how good it felt simply to be held by another person and i just didnt resist anything he was doing almost my whole dating life had been spent pushing away hands and saying please dont or im sorry and i was just tired of it i couldnt do it anymore he was kissing me and i realized with sort of a shock that i was wet and i was wearing a dress and i justi just did it i have a childish urge to cover my ears with my hands drewe watches me with an almost defiant look her green eyes flashing as if daring me to criticize her what do you want me to say i ask it hurts that i did it or that i didnt tell you about it i understand why you did it im surprised you didnt do more of it but why couldnt you tell me she shakes her head as though she cant believe what shes heard i did exactly what youve done to me tried to spare your feelings i know that i get it okay i dont know why it hurts so much i guess its because i always put you on such a pedestal as if you were more than human hell drewe you let people think that what when i was young i acted wild so people wouldnt think i was a prude when i finally tried to be myself everyone made me into a saint i cant help what people think was that the only time she glances at the ground then back up at me still defiant god drewe i didnt sleep with any other men but i slept with him again for a couple of days after i wouldnt talk to him but then i did i slept with him every night for a week then i stopped the whole scenario is impossible to comprehend like someone telling me my mother was secretly married to some stranger why did you stop i was terrified id get pregnant for one thing i knew i didnt love him for another i liked him but i didnt love him i loved you and i knew the things i was doing with him were things i should wait to do with you even though you werent showing any signs of commitment to me the things you were doing i hesitate trying to control my imagination what were you doing with him she shakes her head and takes a step toward me just sex it doesnt matter then tell me just intercourse or everything just intercourse isnt that the worst offense in the scale of guilty behavior no i dont know did you stop it harper this is wrong its dangerous i guess it is was he what better than you bigger than you tell me youre not that juvenile harper tell me youre more mature than a seventh grader i whirl away from her and start packing the martin into its case as stupid as it is all i can see is drewe debasing herself for some faceless guy and loving every minute of it all at a time when she wouldnt sleep with me the man she claimed she loved she circles around until she is facing me again you know something harper the biggest penis i ever saw was on a cadaver in medical school you think it was doing that man any good just shut up i wont i thought you were different from other men all this obsession with how many conquests they can make and who has the biggest prick and who can piss the farthest i see it every day in hospital staff meetings in politics men are like threeyearolds trying to snatch all the toys from each other life isnt about that you think it hurts to hear i had sex with a man for one week in my life how do you think i would feel if every girl you ever slept with was lined up in a row i know half a dozen personally and the rest would probably fill a school bus im sure they did things for you i couldnt even imagine but i dont want to imagine them you slept with my sister for gods sake you have a child by her so dont stand there looking like a kid who just found out theres no santa claus im the one whos been wronged im the one who should be apologized to i tried to apologize try again with an idiots numb elation i realize that drewe isnt telling me all this because she hates me but because she loves me and because she must hurt me a little to make it possible for us to live together again the truth is i feel almost relieved i think i always wished for some little chink in her moral armor if only to mitigate my own sins against her trust its difficult trying to measure up to someone who not only has impossibly high ideals but also lives by them before a window can open for second thoughts i take a step toward her she holds up her hands harper i love you with all the joy and pain that entails and right now the pain outweighs the joy we have a long way to go with two strides she is past me turning me with one hand until we stand at the foot of erins open grave i loved my sister she says softly looking down into the hole we were more competitive than either of us ever admitted erin felt resentments i never let myself see i was jealous of her sometimes too not so much her beauty but i wanted to be as free as she was to be able to live without secondguessing myself all the time she paid a price for that freedom yes but this wasnt the price this is obscene and theres nothing we can do about it i blame myself too for not stopping you and miles erin too you and miles led that animal to our house but it was erins secret that put her within his grasp wasnt it i say nothing we werent married when you slept with her drewe goes on still looking down that makes a difference to me erin could have told you she was pregnant before you married me even before she married patrick she chose not to at last she looks up from the grave and focuses on the granite headstone you remember the day we got married what you promised forsaking all others from this day forward till death do us part did you really think about what you were saying then i remember drewe i meant every word i try to pull her to my side but she keeps a stiff elbow between us she turns to me her green eyes bright promises are easy harper think hard love is a terrible compromise if you choose to see it as one if youre faithful im the only comfort youll ever have her jaw muscles flex with determination but im special im smart and im beautiful and im enough for you to live inside forever if you know how to open me up i know that ive always known it she looks up and scans the wide expanse of the cemetery i watch her from the side her profile regal her thick auburn hair rippling from beneath the black hat catching a wisp of breeze she has never looked stronger or more unattainable than at this moment as she turns to me i look down not wanting to be caught staring my eyes register a dark glint against the sheen of the coffin you dropped your sunglasses i tell her what where down there i point into the grave i dont want to sound superstitious but maybe we should just leave them those arent mine what she points to her throat her raybans lie flat against her black dress suspended from the high neckline by one earpiece the wraparound glasses in the grave lie at the very foot of the coffin thats why i didnt see them while i was playing the guitar they almost look positioned there rather than dropped from some distraught mourners hand they stare up out of the hole like a pair of sightless eyes drewe i wonder if theyre mothers she says stepping to the edge of the grave and bending over i catch her arm stop ow that hurts stand up drewe stand up straight what hes here what hes here who then she is looking up into my face with horror dont look around i tell her even as i do myself every headstone in the field now seems capable of concealing a killer my eye inventories mausoleums at the speed of light prioritizing the most dangerous areas he didnt do the killings i hear myself whisper what he didnt kill the eros women the indian woman did he only fired the tranquilizer gun weve got a chance harper hes dead how can he be here im trying to appear calm but if berkmann is watching me he must see me scanning the headstones with the controlled panic of a soldier walking point in the jungle were going to have to run where drewe asks her voice thin the explorers parked behind the superintendents office thats a hundred yards away im going to leave my guitar here she squeezes my hand hard shouldnt we take it with us try to act casual and get as far as we can you can drop it if we have to run we have to run now he could be fifteen yards away between us and the truck take three or four deep breaths then break for it when i do watch the ground not the building dont trip should i hold your hand no if he chases us ill stay behind you dont look back if he jumps up in front of us ill have to try to kill him you keep running harper keep running my thirtyeight is under the drivers seat thats the only way you can help me if i have to fight here are the keys oh take them god i wish your father was still here wed kill that son of a bitch right now okay get ready one two were off without ever saying go flying across the grass like locust shells blasted before a prairie wind with every step i see berkmanns powerful body rising from behind a gravestone scalpel in hand moving with the speed and inevitability of nightmares i pump my legs furiously willing drewe faster as in my mind berkmann angles toward her me running to get between them but not making it as he plunges the scalpel into her stomach the superintendents office is closer maybe fifty yards i hold back giving drewe the lead pivoting my head as i try to scan degrees of threat knowing he can see me that he can pick his moment harper drewe is down something tripped her and laid her out hard on a flat stone the length of a coffin i yank her up still looking frantically around us she cradles one elbow as if its broken can you run go she gasps i start to run but she jerks me to a stop the keys she darts back to the gravestone and begins scouring its surface like someone searching for a contact lens drewe ive got them go even as the ranks of stones tighten around us we pick a sure path through them dodging the little bronzeroofed markers that read perpetual care they might as well be land mines were five yards from the office when a darkhaired man in a tan jacket steps out from behind it drewe shrieks and cuts to the right with adrenaline spurting like hydraulic fluid into my limbs i empty my lungs in a savage scream and charge the man shouts my name and brings up one hand but i see only his throat i pounce like a wildcat both hands throttling him as he tumbles backward the impact knocks out his wind and i pummel his face with three quick rights before he can recover fury and fear flash in his eyes as blood from his broken nose fills the orbits feeling him going limp beneath me i push off his chest with both hands scramble to my feet and sprint the last few yards to the back of the superintendents office drewe is already inside the explorer a sharp thump startles methen i realize she just unlocked the doors i leap into the drivers seat as she clambers across the console to the passenger side in one continuous motion i crank the engine throw it into gear and hit the gas the tires spin wildly on the gravel before they catch and we hurtle forward onto the narrow asphalt lane as though shot from a catapult was it him yells drewe gulping air get down the explorer is doing fifty through the headstones and still accelerating was it him i dont know you dont know it looked like him did you kill him i shake my head trying to keep us on course and watch the rearview mirror at the same time i hurt him enough to get past him drewe slumps down in the seat and begins probing her elbow joint maybe it wasnt him she says her breathing ragged i mean anybody could have dropped those glasses into her grave no hes here you dont know that i think you didnt kill him because you werent sure as the explorer rockets through the cemetery gate and onto the highway one image fills my mind two tall stunningly dressed and coiffed young women at the edge of the burial crowd and beside them a grayhatted man wearing sunglasses hes here drewe he wants to kill us so why didnt he i dont know chapter from the cemetery i drove straight to sheriff buckners office in yazoo city i answered drewes questions about berkmann as best i could without revealing the existence of the videotape i told her who he was that the fbi had identified him with miless help and that miles had sent me a picture of him via computer the fact that drewes early theories about the case had proved to be so accurate gave her little solace she seemed bent on convincing herselfand methat berkmann had died in the plane crash sheriff buckner had attended erins burial but when drewe and i were ushered into his office we found him eating a shrimp poboy with his feet propped on his desk he started shaking his head the moment he saw me before i said anything he wiped tartar sauce off his mouth put down his sandwich stood and paid drewe his respects then he looked at me and said i dont know whether to arrest you or give you a medal buckner had just heard from the yazoo city police chief how bob andersons soninlaw had gone crazy out at the cemetery and assaulted an fbi agent named wes killen the agent had called on a cellular phone and was now on his way to the emergency room at kings daughters hospital while drewe and i gaped buckner explained that the fbi had insisted on sending an observer to erins funeral on the chance that her killer might show up he got a big charge out of the fact that id brained the fbi man before he could get to his gun and pointed out that erins murderer had he been there would probably have killed special agent killen long before he was observed i wasnt amused by the story but at last i understood whyif edward berkmann had been at the cemeteryhe did not kill drewe and me special agent wes killen didnt pull a gun on me because he knew meprobably from picturesbut he would have shot berkmann in a heartbeat sheriff buckner listened to my sunglasses story with the sincerity of a doctor humoring a schizophrenic he promised to look into the three outoftowners id noticed at the funeral but we were clearly wasting our time as we left buckner told me not to worry about the fbi agent pressing assault charges the bureau would never stand for the embarrassment of a public trial we are almost to drewes parents house now and im doubting myself more with each passing mile whos to say someone didnt accidentally drop their sunglasses into the grave then decide that retrieving them would be too embarrassing maybe its berkmanns video thats got me paranoid the shocking intensity of his personality makes it hard to accept the idea that hes dead when bobs mansion comes into sight surrounded by a visiting fleet of automobiles drewe says i really do have to be there i know looking into her lap she shakes her head all those damned casseroles i know erin would have hated it she looks sharply at me then slowly she softens her gaze youre right i decide to take a desperate gamble for normalcy think of the poor chickens who died to make all that tetrazzini drewe backhands my chest with a stinging pop but the hint of a smile tugs at her mouth she knows exactly what im feeling a thousand sacred words and condolences are nothing compared to one throwaway line that captures something of erins real life we both know erin would have hit me the same way for that joke and drewe acting as her surrogate brings her back to life for us if only for an instant in the momentary escape from grief im tempted to bring up the question that has tortured me ever since i told drewe the truth about holly what about patrick does she think he should be given the answer to the question that has haunted him so long has she already spoken to him this is the final legacy of the secret the last unexploded mine but right now i dont have the nerve to probe it what does the house look like drewe asks her voice heavy i scrubbed out the office the deputies tore things up pretty bad and it smells like tear gas but i managed to sleep there last night pull in she says pointing out a path through the cars blocking bobs majestic drive i have to park thirty yards from the front entrance drewe opens the explorers door but does not get out feeling a strange tingle in my chest i reach for the ignition key and shut off the engine she closes the door again and settles into her seat we sit in the muggy silence the dead motor ticking like a halfsprung clock im about to suggest that we get out and talk when she says as bad as this is i still believe one thing we were meant for each other ive always known that and so has anyone who ever knew us she is looking at the windshield not me a hundred words pop into my head all sound calculated and hollow ive been thinking she says watching an elderly couple shuffle out of the entrance arch weve been here too long rain i mean its too safe i know that sounds ridiculous considering what happened to us here but maybe thatswhy it happened you know we wanted too much to go backward to this ground where we grew up to our families or their memories at last she turns to me her eyes filled with conviction we wont grow in this soil harper weve got to find our own place in these words i hear the door to my future opening youre my love drewe you always have been just tell me where you want to go she smiles and lays a hand over mine give me an hour and a half then come back for me excitement quickens my blood youre coming home tonight yes to pack where are we going were moving harper tomorrow if not today where well rent a house in jackson to start after that well work it out wherever we want its time to go i search her face for signs of doubt but there are none i start to get out and to walk her to the door but she stops me by leaning over the console and kissing me on the cheek make it an hour she says still flying from drewes kiss i pull into the parking lot of a convenience store and head for the pay phone the kings daughters hospital operator connects me with an er nurse who eventually gets special agent wes killen to the phone i apologize before i tell killen who i am and again after he listens to my explanation with professional detachment then begins asking questions as i tell him the story of the sunglasses he promises to have the bureau check with the airlines for anyone resembling the new york people i saw at the funeral unbelievably killen has to return to the cemetery and continue his vigil at erins grave he even criticizes himself for leaving his post long enough to get his nose patched up after he gives me a cellular phone number i can use to reach him if i need to i apologize once more and sign off driving back to our farmhouse i feel im traveling a road ive never seen before because it is no longer the road home its the road away the road that will lead drewe and me out of the past and into our future the events that brought us to this point are too painful even to focus on yet they have delivered us from ourselves for the first time i allow myself to believe that the demented killer who pissed into my guitar for posterity might actually be bumping along the bottom of the mississippi river getting nested in by catfish or ripped to pieces by gar when i sight a sheriffs department cruiser parked by our mailbox it strikes me how paranoid i must seem to sheriff buckner yet as i park under the weeping willow by our porch my anxiety returns heeding the old fear i reach under the seat for my and grip it tightly as i open the front door of the house the reek of tear gas and clorox is still strong and the house feels empty in fact it feels more like a place i once lived than the home that nurtured four generations of my family this feeling embarrasses me as though ive broken faith with my maternal ancestors yet if my greatgrandfather were alive he would probably forgive me he came to mississippi from scotland and despite his love for this land he understood that most primitive of truths sometimes people have to move to survive i open all the windows in the house hoping to air out some of the stink for drewes sake then i get out my address book and call every bank and brokerage company with which i have an account balances in hand i go to my gateway boot up quickenwhich i have neglected for weeksand update each account then i total all the balances the result is pretty gratifying my watch tells me ill be ten minutes late picking up drewe given the usual twentyminute drive to bobs house picking up the keys and the i trot for the front door my hand is on the knob when the phone rings i pause listening for the answering machine in case its drewe instead i hear the voice of arthur lenz hello cole pick up if youre there im here i yell sprinting back to the machine i hit the memo button so that lenzs words will be recorded then pick up the cordless im listening doctor oh good ive spoken to one of the profilers daniel has working the eros case a man i trained im conversant with the new data on berkmann and ive put together my own profile go i believe our usual classification systemorganized versus disorganized behavioris inadequate to describe edward berkmann until recently he did not kill from uncontrollable impulse nor did he develop better technique with each murder as most killers do he was like mozart from the very first crime he demonstrated genius he not only staged murder scenes he seemed to know our specific classification criteria and manipulated evidence accordingly to prevent computer matches effectively he had no crime signature superorganized would be my term of choice okay no serial killer has functioned in society to the degree that berkmann did the only possible analogy would be the royal physician suspected in the whitechapel murdersthe jack the ripper casebut his guilt was never proved in terms of raw intelligence and education berkmann wasor isprobably superior to ninetynine percent of the people hunting him thats painfully obvious you actually hit on the truth that night in my car cole until recently berkmann was killing for a perfectly rational reason transplantation of human pineal tissue is theoretically possible and may have significant therapeutic effects as a neurosurgeon berkmann understood that this procedure would never be developed under current experimental guidelines he simply decided it was worth sacrificing a few lives to make the attempt not so long ago mainstream american medicine made similar decisions about research using convicts you sound like youre defending his actions i merely make the point that their moral character is a separate question from their scientific defensibility its immaterial so far as analyzing motive and especially in trying to predict his future behavior wheres all this leading berkmann saw himself as a sort of modernday prometheus defying gods law to steal fire for mankind fire symbolizes freedom given berkmanns background particularly his disease he sought the only fire modern man is still denied freedom from death he committed the gravest mortal sinpremeditated murderin pursuit of immortality he undoubtedly believed that others would eventually see him in a heroic context as well thats what he meant in his note when he told us to be patient that he would come to us when his work was done he eventually meant to go public that doesnt tell me what i want to know im getting to that lenz says obviously annoyed at being rushed despite all ive said i now believe that berkmann is in fact decompensatingcoming apartjust as other serial killers do our murderous mozart is finally joining the ranks of the salieris why do you say that because if he werent he would not have made a single tactical mistake as it stands hes made several when he learned we were hunting him he could have gone underground stopped his pineal work indefinitely but he didnt like all egomaniacs he took offense became indignant then furious and eventually he committed a murder simply to chastise us your wife a brief pause yes you see even though there was a rational reason for berkmanns early murders an underlying sexual psychosis was always at work like two minds working in parallel we were both right cole with the stressor of fbi pursuit berkmanns subconscious drive began its ascendancy and thats the key to his future behavior if hes still alive of course how so whats he going to do it all comes down to the mother catherine berkmann yes from his oral family history you might think the flamboyant fatherrichardwas the dominant force in edwards life but he wasnt it was catherine who seduced her brother in order to prevent the extrafamilial marriage it was catherine who gave birth to edward amid shot and shell shepherded him through hunger and privation to reach americashe was the anima behind his subconscious sexual urges and she made herself felt at every eros crime scene even though the murders were technically committed to harvest pineal glands the postmortem rapes exactly tell me did you notice that the name erin is fully contained within catherine that undoubtedly contributed to your success in drawing berkmann even though you knew nothing about it my god i never saw it this is the key cole did you notice his choice of words in describing kali he didnt call her his wife or his lover but his concubine so the word has some very specific meanings one refers to a secondary wife one of inferior status yet we know from the transcripts that berkmann legally married kali so if she was of secondary status who held the primary position at last i see it hes been searching for that person his whole life lenz says the substitute for his mother the sisterlover he never had your erin came along at precisely the right moment the similarities between the names your own incestuous secret revealed to him through her eyes he couldnt resist it and his transplant plans fate and the fbi had already interrupted them his scientific search for immortality was on hold but there was always another way children i say softly recalling miless thesis exactly the only true immortality well ever have at some level berkmann always knew that even if he gained an extra twenty vital years from his pineal transplant he would only be postponing the end but dna lives forever as long as there are offspring anyway a single searing image fills my brain the incision in erins abdomen thats why he the ovaries cole thats why he cut out erin grahams ovaries he threw them away when he found out erin wasnt who he thought she was he threw them away im sorry goddamn it whats the final answer here if hes alive will he run or will he come back here tell me about the videotape did he threaten you not beyond the mills of the gods line nothing else youve got to realize that berkmanns mental decompensation wouldnt prevent him from being as calculating or manipulative as he ever was its conceivable that everything on that tape was meant to influence you in a certain way though my mind resists it i force myself to replay the sickening tape in my mind he seemed to lose control about halfway through it he said he was going into hiding he also seemed to fixate on my wife at one point he called her the alpha female of the family talked about how perfect she was did he say anything else about her he said i didnt deserve her you should move her to a safe location as quickly as possible tell no one where youre going i swallow my throat dry you really think edward berkmann is a profoundly disturbed man who has been cut loose from his moorings his only trusted ally was killed before his eyes you are responsible for that if hes alive he might be looking for revenge he might have transferred his subconscious anima projection onto your wife anything is possible at this point thats what i wanted to know doctor i appreciate it i hope hes dead cole i couldnt have said that a week ago but i mean it now i hope so too goodbye as i set down the phone the effect of lenzs words flows through me like electric current though it will make me even later i find the jackson yellow pages and open them to the realtors section picking the biggest ad for ridgeland i dial the number its nearly sevenforty but i doubt the place is completely empty after about twenty rings a curt female voice answers when i tell her im looking for a house to rent not buy the coolness becomes frigidity then i say the magic words money is not a consideration she adopts a guardedly warmer tone a lot of people say that until they hear the prices out there theres really nothing to rent theres always something for the right price well there is one place for sale the owners got tired of waiting and moved to idaho but they wouldnt rent for less than four thousand a month and you couldnt have a lease youll have a check for twelve grand in your hand tomorrow but you dont tramp any buyers through there for the next three months deal i can almost hear her cursing herself for not asking more after she takes my name i race out to the explorer with my keys in one hand and my pistol in the other drewe is waiting outside her parents house with her bag she doesnt seem angry that im late as i get out to open her door someone opens the great front door of the anderson house its patrick hes standing inside with holly in his arms uncle harp the threeyearold begins squirming leaving patrick no choice but to let her down she flies off the steps like a brunette cannonball and races to me my eyes still on patrick i kneel and stop her at arms length trying to keep my smile natural while she squeezes closer i glance to my left at drewe but she looks away quickly and walks over to patrick i lift holly into my arms and hug her tight she digs her face into my neck and folds her arms between us as if to go to sleep on my shoulder how you doin punkin i ask softly she shakes her head what is it i miss mommy i close my eyes against the sting of tears but its no use holly leans back roundeyed and concerned she touches the drops on my cheek you miss her too i miss her too punkin her lower lip puffs out in a mixture of sadness and strength that i saw on erins face many times im okay punkin thanks to you pawpaw and daddy say mommys in heaven she whispers watching over us is that right i cant see her up there you listen to your daddy i whisper back wishing i had patricks blind faith in god and all the rest weve got to go sweetie drewe says suddenly beside us she pulls holly away walks to the steps and deposits her in patricks arms the symbolic nature of this act is inescapable patrick gives me a blank wave then turns and goes back into the house holly watches me over his shoulder as they go taking a deep breath i climb back into the explorer drewe is already inside facing sternly forward the first fifteen minutes of the drive pass in awkward silence the stripped cotton fields look barren as battlefields and the hope i felt so recently wavers in the face of them i got us a house i say finally almost in defense what i got us a house in ridgeland we can move in this week if its not ready by tomorrow we can get a hotel her glance is brief but i see gratitude in it drewe its okay to talk about it she says too loudly the worst thing we could do is keep it hidden like a piece of broken crystal the first time we had to touch it wed both get cut does patrick know anything yet she faces forward again as though watching for our driveway which we could both find blindfolded if necessary no erin wanted to tell him the truth drewe thats what she told me the day she died she was planning to tell him that night and she wanted me to tell you she brushes a strand of hair out of her eyes dont you think she was going to tell because she felt she had no option that if she didnt patrick would leave her i shrug i dont know erin seemed different that day like shed grown into a different person it made me ashamed of myself really she was totally committed to her decision dont tell me this harper im sorry i just wanted you to know the whole truth she turns to me her green eyes burning the truth ill tell you what the truth is patrick is a good man a good father even during the craziness of the past few weeks he hasnt let holly see anything with erin gone his obsession is going to fade you should see him hes latched onto that child like a life raft i think he realizes how stupid he was to have wasted time badgering erin about the past because now shes gone i dont think hell waste any more so youre saying im saying patrick will never know about you and erin neither will holly it will be harder on you than anybody watching her grow up without knowing what you really are to her but it has to be that way you understand i nod silently for a while theyll be close to us to my parents but patrick will eventually remarry and theyll drift away it will hurt you it will even hurt me but thats the way life is and somewhere out in the world a little piece of erin and you will be alive long after were dead even drewe looks away abruptly and i realize she is hiding tears shell be okay though she comes from good people dont miss the damned drive i hit the brakes and wheel onto the gravel as i pull around drewes acura and park she says its settled then yes good lets pack the essentials and go i am packing in my office when i notice the email icon blinking beneath nefertitis slowly turning head on the eros computer dropping a can of shaving gel into my dopp kit i stare at the icon the sounds of drewe packing in her bedroom echo up the hallway willing myself to be calm i walk over and click the mouse on the icon at the top of the message i see this sendersysopedward berkmann md chapter waiting for miles to answer his cellular phone i try desperately to remember whether my email icon was blinking last night whether i could possibly have missed it in the insanity of viewing erins body or mopping up the blood i dont think so nor was it blinking this afternoon this message arrived in the past hour as its time stamp indicates still with my breath coming shallow i pray that berkmann somehow planted the message for delayed delivery while in the house yesterday turner here a cacophony of road noise threatens to drown miless voice he is obviously walking or riding down a street somewhere its harper berkmann may be alive why do you say that i just got an email message from him via eros time stamped thirty minutes ago what does it say how did you like my little documentary id love to hear your comments ill be waiting for you in the blue room theres a pause he could have sent that from his plane before it went down whats the alias none its from sysop it cant be man are you in denial or what look berkmann got that last email message into the system through an old toll access line on a backup server i found it and closed it off maybe this is one of my assistants fucking with us for a joke wheres baxter miles can you contact him hes still in connecticut the state police are canvassing homes in the area of the airstrip berkmann used looking for the killing house you at home yes ill call baxter call you right back i dont move a foot from the phone while i wait from the noise coming up the hallway drewe is still wading through her drawers and closet in less than two minutes miles is back on the line youre right he says his voice strangely muted berkmanns in the system right now the son of a bitch is alive jesus i knew it the night he stole the master client list he must have put a back door into the system but he never used it he knew the logs would catch him never used it until now you mean right can you trace him miles no the fbi pulled their equipment off our switching system when we closed to clients and the phone company wont help me without the fbi so what do i do log into the blue room and see what he wants hell no baxter agrees harper keep him online long enough to check for typos if there arent any at least we know hes back on his voicerecognition system back in new york how could he have gotten back to new york same way i got to mississippi from manhattan paying cash for air tickets hell he could have ridden a trailways up here by now he could have stolen a plane down there ill get baxter to start checking that stuff i think hes still down here miles why i relate the story of the sunglasses in erins grave but miles puts about as much stock in it as sheriff buckner did just talk to him long enough to look for typos he says if hes back in new york well have him his voice drops in volume baxters wasting his time in connecticut the killing house is here harper somewhere close to the medical school ive already found people whove seen berkmann before washington heights people im on th street right now i hesitate dr lenz said drewe and i should split get somewhere safe yeah wheres that when i dont answer miles says safe for us is a function of edward berkmann no longer breathing at some level you know that okay damn not giving myself time for second thoughts i hang up and log into the system as harpersysop then click into the blue room its empty i type a quick querywhere are youroute it to sysop then activate the voicerecognition program almost immediately berkmannsysop appears in the top left corner of my screen under whos here then like a voice from the grave the now chilling digital baritone fills the office as letters appear on my screen berkmann hello harper how did you like my little film this final proof that berkmann is alive starts my heart pumping like a fist clenching and unclenching in my chest fighting fear i pull on the headset and begin speakingnot as erin this time but as myself harper not as well as the fbi did berkmann dont lie little ankle biter you didnt show that tape to anyone harper where are you doctor berkmann south of the border north of the antarctic im quite safe as i told you i would be thats why im not worried about being traced harper a lot of people thought you died in a plane crash berkmann very gratifying it took a bit of effort to create that illusion harper why bother creating an illusion why not use the plane to run berkmann obviously daniel baxter told you to keep me on the line ill oblige you deserve a little entertainment before the remainder of your pathetic life turns to shit harper what does that mean berkmann the mills of the gods remember when i left your house i managed to reach the plane all right and get airborne but the plane developed engine trouble i considered ditching in the river but my nerve failed i ended up setting down on a spur levee id heard of a venezuelan crew that landed a on a levee near new orleans in an emergency it was simple enough the difficult part was taxiing down the slope and into the water amazing that the plane turned up though very dramatic the lord taketh away my engine but giveth confusion unto mine enemies harper you dont believe in god berkmann you are not qualified to discuss the concept of god with me ive yet to see a single typo in berkmanns words but i want to be absolutely sure ive given him enough time harper ive asked baxter to let me view your execution he said hed do all he could but theres a long waiting list its the gas chamber here in mississippi you know berkmann empty words i honestly cant believe you fooled me for a minute but you did didnt you you and your southern charm it turned out to be as hollow as southern honor the sudden ring of the telephone jars me hitting the space bar to mute the mike i answer it well says miles as berkmanns voice continues from the speakers im on with him now any typos none yet two screens worth of text hes back in new york he says hes outside the country miles sounds like maybe south america out of the country shit how could he get out same way he could get back to new york keep him on as long as you can i dont want to talk to him please harper im getting close to him i can feel it berkmanns voice shocks me back to reality berkmann having a nice chat with daniel baxter harper my motherinlaw was trying to come into the office i had to get her out berkmann another lie she wouldnt be speaking to you at all not after you got her daughter killed the ringing sibilance of water rushing through pipes breaks my concentration drewe is taking a shower i guess i can put up with berkmanns crap for a few minutes in the hope that miles could be right about the killing house harper did you really try to save erin berkmann yes there was no need for her to die were it not for you she would be alive tonight harper turn yourself in doctor this games over they know who you are its just a matter of time berkmann no no no i still have much to do harper such as berkmann i am smiling harper smiling with cosmic humor at fates great joke you lured me to your house to capture me and instead led me to the threshold of my apotheosis harper i dont understand berkmann how could you you are a polyp of fetid protoplasm in the cesspool of the herd i speak to you for only one reason you have something i want and very soon i shall have it lenzs warnings echo in my head like the shouts of an unheeded prophet harper what do you want berkmann dont you know i want drewe i have to squeeze my hands together to stop them shaking harper what connection do you think you have with drewe berkmann what connection do we not have erin was an illusion a caucasian kali expanded into symbol by your imagination but drewe is real everything that has happened each apparent mistake every seeming obstacle was but a waypoint on the road to drewe she is my mother and my father together she is apollonian woman pale and proud aryan brilliant uncontaminated by your corrupt seed because she is incorruptible she is a vessel full yet waiting to be filled she is omphalos a navel of the world through her loins i shall conquer time for years she has waited uncertain why but soon she will know and she will come to me like the moth to the flame harper shell laugh in your face or spit in it berkmann you tremble at every word i speak you know she is a seed you have not brought to flower because you are unequal to her how she must have dreaded your clumsy carnal attentions it sickens me harper how do you plan to bring her to flower berkmann by separating her from you harper how can you do that berkmann with the truth we are broken from within remember your life holds the key to its own destruction you are a liar and a coward the truth of your betrayal with erin and her child will separate you from drewe as certainly as prison walls when she delivers my issue from her pure womb you will feel pain as of nails being driven through your skull from a whirlwind of fear a lifeline of hope the sword berkmann thinks he holds over my head hangs over his own but theres no reason to let him know that harper youll never get close to her you piece of shit berkmann do i need to what is truth but information and that is the easiest thing in the world to move harper shed kill herself before shed let you touch her berkmann keep telling yourself that by tonight she will be trying to reach me harper youre amazing youre a fucking parasite a secondrate quack who spent his life stealing other peoples research and dreaming about his dead whore of a mother this finally stops berkmann at length as if he has regained his composure he replies berkmann i am to you as the sun to a grain of sand as the eagle to the worm i had your friend turner like a woman i swam in eros like a shark in a tidal pool feeding on what i chose i delivered lenzs wife to the knife and it was a mercy killing i am the will to power made flesh upon the earth i am an arrow tearing through the veil of time ive had enough the line about miles rattled me but not enough to give berkmann the last word harper you spout nietzsche like a college sophomore fitting since he died eating his own excrement berkmann i shall be here when drewe calls me i slam down the escape key and terminate the conversation my hands are shaking with rage as i dial miless cellular harper not a single typo are you anywhere close to finding his place maybe im waiting for a guy now a homeless guy named leonardo hes a sidewalk artist leonardo you believe that hes supposed to know something like what i wont know till i see him will i what about baxter he found anything nothing damn youve got to find him miles he wants drewe drewe hes fixated on her obsessed like he thought he was with erin he bragged about you too helaughed hes the most arrogant son of a bitch ive ever seen the silence on the other end of the phone is absolute i know ive wounded miles deeply but maybe i wanted to maybe i want him in a state of fury when he finally faces berkmann harper drewes voice sends a shock through my nervous system i turn to my right and see her standing three feet inside my officethe room she has not entered for seven weekswearing nothing but a white terry bathrobe and a damp towel wrapped around her hair whats happening she asks who wants me ive got to go miles wait i need you to keep him online i cant do it you be careful i break the connection with the finger button harper drewe says again i consider lying then crush the impulse berkmanns alive drewe how do you know i just talked to him on eros oh god his text isnt showing any errors so at least hes back in new york miles is trying to find him right now she folds her arms across her chest as if suddenly cold i heard my name through the speakers i heard him say my name jesus hes just playing games you dont need to know this stuff i move toward her but she takes a step back dont patronize me like that what did he say about me hes obsessed with you hes nuts lets get out of here what video were you talking about drewe what video i sigh wearily he left a video here after erins murder where is it i sent it to the fbi this morning her eyes never leave my face but you kept a copy you dont trust anyone enough not to keep a backup i know you i didnt drewe no one in the world could fault me for that lie i know youre trying to protect my feelings she says but were past that i want to see this man i take her hand and squeeze it hard no you dont you dont want those pictures knocking around in your head for the rest of your life did he have sex with erins body like he did with the other victims no but he danced her around the room after she was dead he showed me her ovaries he pissed into one of my guitars and hung it back on the wall i took it outside and burned it you dont want to see this tape she closes her eyes get it drewe get it the man who butchered my sister is still free he has some kind of obsession about me and you think im not mature enough to watch his pathetic cruelty im a doctor harper get the goddamned thing i go silently to my desk retrieve the eightmillimeter original and hand it to her ill see you when its over she says her face resolute drewe please i know how to work the camera please get out this is something i have to do alone chapter while drewe watches berkmanns video in my office i pace around the kitchen like a caged ape when i can stand it no more i call miles from the kitchen telephone he sounds relieved to hear my voice im still waiting for leonardo to show he says in a loud whisper it better be soon too its getting dangerous up here i just had to take down a couple of kids what do you mean couple of brothers backed me up against a wall and told me i was the wrong color for the neighborhood i thought they wanted to rob meive been handing out cash like santa claus up herebut they just wanted to fuck me up they werent interested in how many black friends i have either i had to kick them a few times kick them i echo in the same moment remembering miless martial arts training the assault charge lenz told me about berkmann must be crazy to live up here maybe its like a warehouse where he can just drive right into the building he looked to me like he could take care of himself miles well find out wont we i just hope i find the place soon its nearly dark up here which means it will be dark here soon miles is talking again but i no longer hear him drewe is standing in the kitchen doorway the towel is gone from her head her hair is a storm of copper tangles her eyes blank circles shot with blood ive got to go miles again i hang up the phone and pull drewe into a tight embrace her arms hang limp at her sides her body seems without breath the robe is wetter than before with sweat now rather than shower water im sorry i whisper i tried to tell you i want to talk to him she says in a dead voice what i pull back far enough to look into her eyes i want to talk to berkmann on the computer i wont let you do it i read your last conversation with him she says in the blue room i want to talk to him if you read that crap why do you want to talk to him you cant figure it out no you will i feel myself shaking her as though i could somehow rattle sense into her but she doesnt flinch drewe thats exactly what he wants he told me youd be talking to him by tonight i know so why do it because its the only way to get him as i stare uncomprehending my office phone rings i ignore it but drewe says answer it its probably miles drewe then ill answer it she pulls away and starts for the hall i push past her at the office door and pick up the cordless leonardo came through miles says in a breathless voice ive got an address its between harlem and washington heights what are you going to do im not sure yet i dont have a building number but ive got a block and a description its a warehouse like i guessed leonardo has actually talked to berkmann people around here think hes mob connected or else a heavy dealer they leave him alone have you called baxter miles hesitates no the implications of this are obvious yet i feel no urge to argue what are you thinking im not i say nothing it would help if you could keep berkmann at his computer he says leonardos taking me over there now i grunt neutrally if hes at his computer hes occupied dr lenz told me you had a certain item registered in your name in new jersey are you carrying that item could be a screech of brakes from the receiver makes me pull the phone away from my ear are you in a cab are you kidding miles says breathing harder no cabs up here were on foot three blocks from the warehouse what about it will you keep him busy i wont have to i reply my eyes following drewe as she sits down at the eros computer drewe cant wait to talk to him what she watched berkmanns video oh man shes way ahead of you let her at it then just get this asshole miles fast ill call you im hanging up now white guys with cell phones dont exactly blend in up here i hang up the cordless and walk over behind drewe she hasnt used eros for six months but she is flying through its screens like a professional software evaluator looks like you remember it pretty well mmm miles has an address on berkmann hes headed over there now he wants you to keep the bastard online what about the fbi she asks clicking the mouse through the livechat area he hasnt called them her frenetic movements cease good she says finally good for him drewe all i need to do is send a quick message telling berkmann to meet me in the blue room right right whats his user id send it to sysop as she types she says he thinks hes going to destroy our marriage by telling me youre hollys father she looks back over her shoulder think what might be happening right now if you hadnt told me the truth this thought is enough to make me feel lightheaded mercifully she turns back to the screen i start to read what she is typing but sense that im crowding her i back up she stabs the enter key message sent come to mama edward the unfamiliar coldness in her voice jars me what about this headset thing she asks will it recognize my voice it might theres a female sysop in new york miless voicerec program is trained to know her if we select her parameters and you tone down your southern accent it might accept you as her it accepts me as miles i lean over her shoulder and punch up the program select racquel hirsch then log her in you logged me in as sysop its the only way you can get in the systems officially closed i want my name at the prompt she says my first name i give her a questioning look but her eyes reveal nothing she pulls on the headset as i enter the necessary commands how does this work talk into the mike listen through the multimedia speakers hit the space bar if you need to talk to me it mutes the mike she hits the space bar and says give me a quick picture of berkmann like shes asking an intern for a patients medical history theres too much to tell hes a child of incest his parents were brother and sister he hasor hadhemophilia what do you mean had hemophilias incurable not if youre willing to steal a healthy liver christ what else dr lenz says berkmanns coming apart decompensating that an underlying sexual psychosis is taking over his conscious mind there are a lot of factors but it all comes down to his mother catherine berkmann the postmortem rapes were all because of her god i dont remember it all the indian woman kali was his lover for years sort of a secondstring wife but he wants someone like catherine a substitute sistermother to be the mother ofhis child drewe fixes me with a hard stare no matter what i say harper ignore it it doesnt mean anything just dont break my train of thought pulling the collar of the robe tight around her neck she turns back to the screen releases the space bar and says this is dr drewe cole i want to talk to you on the screen the echo function puts up drewe this is dr drewe cole i want to talk to you we wait without speaking partly because we dont want the microphone to pick up stray conversation but mostly because there is nothing to say nefertiti materializes at the oneminute mark revolving slowly her inscrutable countenance unruffled by earthly cares my tension grows with each revolution of her head but drewe sits as calmly as if she were attending a medical seminar the ringing telephone startles us both i carry the cordless across the room before i answer hello this is miles says a strangled voice that makes me dizzy with fear miles whats the matter im under arrest what baxter used me to find berkmann he had two agents tailing me as soon as they saw me casing a building they arrested me where are you now outside berkmanns warehouse baxters choppering over from connecticut right now i talked to him hes got guys on standby ready to take berkmann down my mind reels from the magnitudinal shift in circumstances the hostage rescue team baxter says new york city swats almost as good and theyre closer theyre on their way now theyll be in position by the time baxter gets here yes i cry giving drewe a relieved thumbsup as she turns from the computer she hits the space bar and says whats happening the fbis going to raid berkmanns place were still looking at twenty to thirty minutes miles says thats why they let me call you baxter says youve got to keep berkmann at his computer if hes at his computer hopefully he wont have a gun to the heads of any hostages were trying drewe just queried him but he hasnt answered tell her to keep trying despite the good news i hear defeat in miless voice listen i tell him its better this way a lot better if youd gone in there alone you might never have come out hewouldnt have come out miles says softly now he will all he has to do is surrender and he maywant to by now as i open my mouth to argue the digital baritone of edward berkmann speaks in my place rushing toward the eros monitor i see these words appear berkmann id like to believe that however trust must first be established he bit i whisper berkmanns online established how drewe asks in a loud clear voice onscreen these words appear drewe established how theyre talking miles racquels voice parameters are working for drewe disturbed by my volume drewe waves me away from the computer as i hurry toward the gateway berkmann sayscan you prove that you are who you say you are and not your husband its disorienting to hear the digital voice without watching the accompanying text on the monitor it makes berkmann seem that much closer i dont know drewe replies since we dont know each other we have no common experience you can use to test me of course we do youre an obstetrician correct yes board certified of course one never knows these days if you wouldnt mind answering a few simple questions we can leave trivialities behind fine what test would you use to rule out adrenal or ovarian tumors in a patient with hirsutism a serum dheas for the adrenal drewe says automatically serum testosterone for the ovarian tumor hes testing her miles checking to make sure its not me miles makes a choking noise that sounds like laughter once burned twice shy im going to hang up and listen call me when the swat team gets there your voicerecognition program garbled some of your answerberkmann saysbut i got the gist of it what is turners syndrome a genetic defect caused by a fortyfive xoh genotype which prevents the ovaries from functioning a classic turners patient is a short fifteenyearold girl with amenorrhea im glad you called drewe ive been most anxious to speak with you and i with you probably for different reasons i am pacing the office now my whole body charged with anticipation perhaps notsays berkmannare you at home yes using your husbands computer yes where is he in and out were arguing i came home to pack where are you going back to my parents for a start after that i dont know why are you leaving drewe i cant stay here you should know why because your sister died there because she was butchered here by you no i tried to save her harper told me all about that your husband is a liar nothing he says can be trusted hes lied to me before but i trust him in some things harper killed erin drewe thats ridiculous he set up a situation in which nothing else could happen what do you mean do you know why my assistant and i came to your home to kill my sister no because i was lured by your husband he pretended to be a woman right to catch you pretended to be a woman yes but not to catch me do you know what woman he pretended to be does it matter you decide he pretended to be erin he even sent me a picture of her the one in which she offers a silver chalice to a shadowy figure in an arched doorway shes wearing a black gown a highly provocative image drewe turns and looks at me uneasily why would he do that he chose erin because they shared a secret a secret he thought powerful enough to draw me to her a secret known only to them and now only to him just as he planned new fear worms its way up through my chest what secret asks drewe before i tell you you must promise to remain online after you learn the truth wait until you have heard me out before you try to speak to your husband im telling you his secret for a reason drewe much more in your life is about to be clarified get out harper drewe cries suddenly go im not sure whether shes acting or not but im not about to leave he is with youberkmann asks hes gone now what is this secret you promise to remain online yes harper is the father of your sisters child holly is her name i believe drewe doesnt respond are you there drewe thats crazy no already your skin is cold with fear that instinctive fear proves the truth of my words no picture hollys face i have seen that face shes paler than erin was beautiful yes but her face is broader her eyes not as large she is biggerboned you know whose genes those are i dont believe you never fight truth drewe you must always embrace it even if it burns im not afraid of truth good good for this is a difficult one you havent given me any proof youre just trying to upset me you want to get at harper by hurting me listen to me drewe two minutes from now you will hope never to see that pathetic liar again im listening she turns to me again there is fear in her eyes now as i signal her to press the space bar she turns back to the screen and berkmann goes on these word are your husbands listen and judge she used her mouth for that and her hands she knew before i did where i was you know and when i started to finish she didnt pull away she just afterward she stood up and hugged me again she didnt speak but i saw she somehow knew her sister didnt complete that act in the way she just had i feel as though someone has caved in my stomach with a twobyfour lenz lied to me he did tape our sessions probably on the little olympus recorder i saw later and those tapes were part of the case materials kali stole from his study the night she killed his wife i thought of drewe then berkmann recites but she seemed removed from all this wholly apart from it it was as if erin and i were meeting in some place where drewe didnt exist all i can see from where i am standing is the back of drewes head her damp hair falling over the white robe she sits as motionless as if she were listening to a sermon i pray she will think berkmann is making all this up but the rough blade of reality cuts through with every line consumed by impotent rage i dial miless cellular are they going in yet swats not even here man take it easy take it easy hes tearing her up inside im sorry i know firsthand remember help her through it shes got to keep him on unless you can do it i disconnect as berkmann quotes me relentlessly shed risen up and was mouthing is that drewe while drewe said something about a pulmonary embolism i dont remember what i said to get off the phone but i knew i had failed drewe in a time of emotional crisis what i do remember clearly is what erin said the moment i hung up she said how are we going to tell her as berkmann spoke i circled to my left trying to see drewes face i wish i hadnt tears are streaming down her cheeks dropping onto the bosom of the robe unable to endure any more i move forward and lay a comforting hand on her shoulder she jerks away like i touched her with a cattle prod are you there drewe yes she says in a cracked voice i hate this motherfucker can you tell where and when this happened chicago yes but it had been building for a long time because erin worshiped you and you loved harper how could she not do the same she was a confused girl harper exploited her misguided affections he used them to seduce her to debase her sodomize her because only by so doing could he express his selfhatred yes selfhatred you loved him out of naïveté you did not see his fear but in his pygmy soul he always knew he was unworthy of you that you would one day learn his true character he has dreaded that daytodayfor his entire life why are you doing this drewe asks her voice shaky telling me all this to free you what youre on the verge of a great awakening drewe i dont understand but i do i know you drewe better than you know yourself you must be honest with me utterly without pretense im always honest that statement is itself dishonest you must strip away all pretense our time is limited why is our time limited you have to be somewhere there are external concerns i feel a sudden shiver is berkmann aware of the approaching swat team suddenly the phone rings in my hand new york swat just pulled up miles says his voice barely under control two vans were a block away from berkmanns building baxters touching down on the roof of a bank south of here nypds bringing him to the scene in an unmarked car how long till he gets there i dont know hows drewe doing its not pleasant hang on just a little longer berkmann seems to be feeling some time pressure miles maybe youd better warn those swat guys just in case he knows something okay lets keep the line open from now on im here ive had to develop a sort of shell lately drewe is saying to deal with certain things in my life just sosays berkmannbut you can shed that as easily as a serpent sheds its skin you will be reborn even now i am scratching away the husk tell me why do you have no children drewe she doesnt answer at first then we just havent had any yet youre thirtythree years old how can you suppress that urge that silent cramping pulse that beats within your womb like a voice murmuring time is passing time is passing i feel that but this is the real world there are external concerns like you said your husband hes a factor hes more than that he is afraid to have children with you he ducks the question changes the subject pleads that its too much responsibility asks you to wait until things are more stable yes when could things be more stable you earn a living in your own right your husband is a miser isnt he hoarding his gold like midas i feel like a demon just breathed on the back of my neck was berkmann in the tunnel that night after all hiding in his officehe goes onhis sticky fingers glued to the keyboard reading about other peoples sex lives over their shoulders fawning over brainless starlets masturbating for relief because he cant face himself squarely enough to have a real relationship with you what kind of man lives like that didnt he find you on eros drewe asks pointedly yes but i was there for an altogether different reason pineal glands yes but we must take things in order first you must sever your husband from your life from your being can you do that more easily than you know you deceive yourself its never that easy that is why i must tell you the rest what are you talking about your husband harper lured me to your home because erin was trying to make him tell you the truth about holly trying to save her marriage but harper couldnt bear the truth thats why he sent me erins picture why he made sure erin would be alone in your house when my assistant and i arrived he told erin he was thinking of leaving you that he wanted to be a father to holly that he needed desperately to make love with her again thats why she came when she did i didnt come to kill her but to bring her back to share my life but of course she knew nothing about that when i arrived she panicked she stabbed my assistant and my assistant killed her in selfdefense despite my best efforts to save them they both died harper got his wish drewe is staring at me again her tearful eyes wide with horror i shake my head violently and mouthlies but she has been shaken beyond reassurance i didnt see any sign that you tried to save erin she says you saw the wound it was mortal you could have called nineoneone no the civil authorities are philistines they would chain prometheus to a rock for stealing fire what are you talking about as i speak please remember one thing there are no moral phenomena only moral interpretations of phenomena forget the arbitrary rules you learned as a child listen with your will with your unfettered spirit berkmann begins telling the tale he told erin days ago but in a more condensed manner if anything the story is more powerful for its brevity theres no denying the poetry of his language as he speaks of rudolf and richard and catherinealways catherineand kali drewe interjects an occasional yes or mmm but little else as the minutes pass i realize that berkmanns words are disturbing me on some fundamental level what can they be doing to drewe pressing the phone hard against my ear i hear a flurry of voices from miless end then miles says harper im here the swat teams are moving into position snipers on the rooftops the whole deal everybody says tell you to keep berkmann at his computer hes still talking to drewe tell them to get the lead out i dont know how long she can take this swats on the phone with baxter right now hes en route by car theyre going in as soon as he gets here okay berkmanns tale is accelerating he weaves the central thread of his lifehis hemophiliainto a tale of almost mythic proportion the illegal liver transplant that cost a life but healed his great wound sounds like part of a heroic quest and through it all his family looms like a mystical trinity his mother a shining figure in the distance his father walking beside him his grandfather a shadow pursuing from behind harper miles says in my ear right here baxter just got out of a car theyre escorting him like hes general macarthur hang on i try to listen to the action through the phone while berkmann begins speaking of what drewe means to him she listens as though nothing in his depraved history has shocked her in the slightest goddamn itmiles yells in my ear what is it baxters not letting me go in the son of a bitch you didnt think he would did you he used me man the only reason im here is to make sure you keep berkmann online so what tell me whats happening shit it looks like a movie location they dont know where the computer is in the building so theyre going to do both floors at once the roof guys are going to crash through the windows on rappelling gear while guys on the ground blow the doors with plastique what about the hostages baxter has paramedics standing wait here he comes suddenly daniel baxters commanding voice comes through the phone cole baxter tell me what to do i dont want another dallas here nynex shows computer data moving through one phone line at berkmanns warehouse it looks like hes online in there but i dont want him making an ass out of me and shooting cops from the windows i want to hear you tell me edward berkmann is online right this second tired of playing middleman i carry the phone across the room and hold it up to one of the computers speakers most womenberkmann is sayingare waterengorged beings of stasis eternally swelling and sloughing draining men of life even as they produce more life they are but corridors back to the grave i have waited decades for a woman of fire and light you hear that i ask baxter thats him thats a digital facsimile of his voice speaking live to my wife in a voice very like the one he used when directing the dallas raid from quantico baxter says captain riley you are cleared to go how do you like that guy miles asks back on the phone he miless voice is terminated by four flat booms that can only be explosions chapter swat just blew down the doors miles shouts im in the command car with baxter ill tell you whats happening as i hear it drewe is still speaking into the headset her tone almost conspiratorial swats moving through the building miles says softly drewe still talking to him yes he talking back yes that doesnt make sense i know if someone blew open the side of your house wouldnt you run like hell im not him he may be about to blast that whole swat team to hell remember dallas no shit keep him talking drewes got it i checked your transcripts in the tulane medical school computersays berkmannyou scored mostly twelves on the mcat that put you in the top one percent of medical school applicants you could have gone to hopkins or columbia or harvard so what did you score i am the measuring stick drewe ah you could have been a surgeon you have a point im trying to show you how accident has limited you circumscribed your life you attended university near your home town you married a man youd known since childhood settled in the place you were born and there you remain you spend your days delivering welfare babies doomed to wasted lives your nights alone in bed how do you know that i know you drewe youre a barely subcritical mass of potentialities people realize that youre special but they dont want you to realize it because if you did you would leave them forever you are a higher being yet you do the work of a midwife my god to think of you bent between the heaving thighs of mindless women spawning children like roe soiling your hands with their eternal muck youre like a saint sentenced to an eternity of healing lepers do you understand the kind of work you would be doing with me challenging the dominion of death itself they found a hostage miles cries in my ear what male hostage in a basement alive it must be peter levy jesus they got another one a woman wait its just like we thought a swat guy says the basement is set up like a hospital operating room what about berkmann nothing yet its confused in there female physiciansberkmann is sayingdriven beyond their abilities by their parents hard little girls pushed into a male system slaves to technique looking for father figures i dont need supplicants do you know the epigram of disappointment i listened for an echo and heard nothing but praise they found his computers second floor theyre powered up but no berkmann damn it anybody who knows anything always leaves their computers on i know that i snap i was telling baxter says miles berkmann must be in another part of the building i reason thats why he didnt split when they blew the doors hes safe in there somewhere they have the exits covered they say they do berkmann still talking to drewe i tune in long enough to hear drewe say tell me more about catherine edward im sorry may i call you edward of course hes still on hes all sweetness and light miles could berkmann own the building next door sort of like the apartments in dallas nypds covering the adjacent structures oh man what body parts in the basement swat just found them bodies and body parts in a big freezer bodies in plastic bags parts in biological specimen jars to hell with that wheres berkmann weve got to get in there miles yells suddenly waitshit ive got to see those computers ill tell you where that son of a bitch is i hear daniel baxters deep voice the chopped cadence of orders were going in says miles panting like a sprinter again keep drewe talking shes rolling man go my father took me deer hunting when i was young drewe says with a rifle i hated it it seemed a senseless slaughter but then i learned to shoot a bow and i loved it creeping through the forest looking for scrapes letting the does pass by drawing the bow holding my breath waiting for the buck to step clear of cover with his massive rack my arms quivering from holding at full draw and then the release the arrow crashing through his heart in the moment he heard it fly i felt like a goddess that was but a taste of your true nature edward i want to share something with you something ive never told my husband something hes never even asked me what is it a dream yes it started during college long after id stopped hunting this is a recurring dream yes im walking through a forest in winter snow on the ground ice in the trees im not wearing enough clothing to keep warm just an old dress no coat i see many deer but theyre starving i pass them by then through the bare black trees i see a flash of pure white against the bluish snow its a great buck with fur like ermine from antlers to tail his antlers black like wet branches the underside of the tail like sable not an albino because his eyes are bottomless rings of blue deeper and deeper into the forest i chase him my throat burns from the cold once i catch a longer glimpse and i see that he is wounded a splash of blood on his white belly as though he has taken an arrow yet runs on only a heart shot can bring him down as dusk falls i track him to a cave he stands just inside the mouth as though safe in shadow i draw the bow then just as he sees me i release burying the shaft in his heart there is absolute silence in the room do you dress the carcass in the cave the buck doesnt die as he lies shuddering in the cave mouth he is transformed into a man a young man with skin like alabaster but the old wound in his belly remains then i come to him in the cave and he goes down on all fours before me facing away and though i cannot see anything at my waist it is i who penetrate him some part of me passes into him and when he rises his wound is healed he is made whole but when i rise i see thati now have the wound and im no longer a girl but a woman and its me running now running with him chasing me he gets closer and closer and then then i wake up i always wake up before he catches me berkmann says nothing i cannot imagine drewe fabricating this story on the spot the detail is too vivid how little we really know about the people we live with you still have this dreamberkmann asks finally yes and it it arouses me sometimes i have an orgasm when im in the cave sometimes not sometimes i feel only fear raw terror its so simple so clear dont you see you are a huntress who needs to be caught a healer who needs to be healed i am the wounded beast drewe i berkmanns not in the building miles says in my ear were on the second floor swat confirms it my pulse is racing hes still talking miles maybe he was telling the truth about being out of the country maybe he really has another base another voicerec unit somewhere he probably has the money for it the phone company has a busy signal on the warehouse phone yep christ look at this what im at the computers its serious stuff sun digital equipment massive power here so wheres berkmann man some of these boxes i dont even recognize i kneel beside drewe and whisper in the shell of her ear theyre in the building keep talking her head bobs slightly catherine played the piano yesberkmann replies she had a gift i play as well she says this is a lie you play beethoven i prefer chopin tell me something edward did catherine breastfeed you of course there was no cows milk in the basements of berlin are you circumcised edward is that how they discovered your hemophilia no that was for jews my uncle noticed it first through abnormal bruising over drewes shoulder i watch berkmanns words materialize onscreen as flawlessly as film credits hes definitely using a voicerecognition system but where is it i turn away and walk back toward the desk that holds my gateway computer it sits purring like a faithful dog where could harper drewes yell shocks me out of myself i whirl afraid that my name has gone out over the data line but she has her hand on the space bar what is it i ask moving to her side im getting errors in berkmanns side of the conversation a ball of ice forms in my chest what do you mean like typos more like dropouts wrong words nonwords okay ill check on it just keep talking to him she releases the space bar and resumes the conversation though in a less controlled voice miles i say into the phone nothing i walk as far from drewe as i can get and snarl miles what drewes getting errors from berkmann you mean typos all of a sudden yes but more like dropouts she said theres a lot of gear in this room harper including a homeengineered phone system i just picked up a receiver and heard a data stream then berkmann must be there there must be a room in the building swat hasnt found but where drewes voice control is degrading by the second miles what if hesremotely using the system in front of you you picking up that receiver could have caused the dropouts drewe saw especially with a cellular data connection hes never used it remotely before im sure of it so that means he cant miles clucks his tongue if he could have why didnt he its a lot easier to talk than it is to type especially when youre flying a plane or hiding outside somebodys house in the dark maybe its technically possible but not that reliable so he just never messed with it until now you mean a hot wave of fear rolls up my spine miles what if he knew all along we were using his error rate to predict his movements or that we could use it when he killed lenzs wife hewanted the fbi to know he was on the move so he stuck to his old pattern and didnt use voice recognition he wanted them to see the errors and with erin he just stayed offline until he got here that way there were no errors to see even though he was moving there is a sudden awful silence hes known all along miles says quietly its just like his back door into eros he saved it until he needed it i feel like im riding an elevator whose cable just snapped im going to pick up the receiver again miles says tell me what happens almost instantly drewe throws up her right hand then spins in her chair an anxious look on her face more errors i whisper she nods violently we got errors miles would berkmann have seen that probably he might think it was just line noise though hes not in new york miles i hesitate to voice the certainty that has crystallized in my brain i guess we know where he is harper tell baxter to get somebody out here as fast as humanly possible im hanging up now wait ciao pal good knowing you with an eerie sense of resignation i hang up the phone then walk to the office door and lock it the heavy window blinds make it virtually impossible for someone outside to see into the room from my desk i pick up a legal pad and a pen and scrawlberkmann may be here stay calm im calling for help keep talking then i carry it over to drewe and hold it where she can see it her composure melts like ice thrown into a fire my immediate concern is her voice berkmann cant hear the fear crackling through it like electricity but if she loses enough control the voicerec program may stop functioning as she struggles to continue the conversation i dial her fathers house there are two other optionssheriff buckner and wes killenbut bob will come faster besides i made him a promise while the phone rings i walk to one of the two front windows slide the blind to the side and peek out into the blue dusk the deputys car is still at the end of our drive nose angled toward the highway because of the fading light and the cars position i cant see whether hes in it or not hello mrs anderson its harper i need to talk to dr anderson right now theyre not here margarets voice is cold im here with holly whos they bob and patrick they went out to the cemetery to visit erin at night thats what they wanted to do theyre grown men do they have a cellular phone no they took bobs old truck you sound funny whats i disconnect and dig wes killens cellular phone number out of my back pocket my thumb is touching the keypad of the cordless when berkmanns voice shocks me into stillness whats the matter drewe nothing why your voicerecognition program is missing words sending errors as though youre under great stress drewe looks back at me her face pale i motion for her to keep winging it while i dial killens number i shouldnt be stressed she says after all youve told me about my husband what is harper doing wes killen this is harper cole i need you berkmanns alive i just got off the phone with baxter killen says im running to my car right now you know mike mayeux new orleans cop yes hes out there at your place right now what he never thought berkmann died in the crash he took a couple of days off to watch your place he didnt want you to know wanted you to act natural thank god look there are two guys headed out to erins grave family dont get panicky if you see lights i see lights now are you armed cole ive got a thirtyeight revolver and a twentyfive auto through the phone i hear killens car engine firing up get into a bedroom he says cut off the lights put your wife under the bed and get low in a corner with the thirtyeight make sure your hall lights on if berkmann opens the door youll have him in silhouette easiest shot in the world blow him down just hurry ill be there in twenty minutes drewe is speaking too rapidly now her voice like a fraying cable with the news about mayeux pumping through me like amphetamines i dial sheriff buckners office as the phone rings i peer out at the parked cruiser sheriffs department this is harper cole give me sheriff buckner right now its life or death who is this again please i said now goddamn it a match flares in the deputys car it glows steadily flickers then disappears the tiny orange ember of a cigarette takes its place i touch the grip of the at my belt wondering whether i should fire through the window one shot would bring both the deputy and mayeux running but berkmann could be anywhere he might be in a position to ambush both men without even breathing hard this is sheriff buckner who the hells this harper cole youve got to get somebody out here cole ive already got somebody out there the killers here damn it maybe outside my house what radio the deputy you have here but hes got to be careful berkmann could be there is no sound so dead as a dead telephone very slowly not wanting to believe it i put down the cordless drewe is still speaking into the headset i watch her trail off then wait for berkmanns response there is none drawing the from my holster i walk over and say softly in her ear berkmanns outside he just cut the phone lines she closes her eyes like someone whos just been read a death sentence i gently pull the headset off her and drop it beside the keyboard strangely the modem still shows a live connection maybe berkmann left the phone line to the eros computer open hitting the space bar just in case i ask drewe where her gun is in my purse she replies wheres your purse in the bedroom did you reload it yes she grips my forearm hard enough to cause pain and looks up with terror in her eyes harper lets run get your keys and well run for the explorer hes expecting that i lay an open hand against her cheek we wouldnt have a chance drewe speak to me at the sound of berkmanns voice drewes eyes go blank as a stroke victims he left the data line connected i tell her squeezing her shoulders there are two cops outside answer him if you can keep him occupied well be okay moving like a zombie she dons the headset again im thinking she says in a cracked voice what about everything youve said youre not being truthful drewe she hits the space bar again for gods sake harper weve got to run we cant he could be anywhere were safer in here youve got to keep talking give mayeux a chance she shakes her head were sitting ducks in here i feel it wild hope flashes in her eyes you said he didnt actually kill the eros women and we both have guns listen to me drewe i know he has a tranquilizer pistol hed probably shoot me with a dart to get me out of the way then take you with him her mouth drops open as the enormity of the danger sinks in but but what if we risk that if he takes me i could pretend to go along then shoot him when i got a chance what if he shoots me with a fortyfour magnum instead of a dart we dont know what hes got out there drewe we cant just sit here and wait for him i squeeze her shoulders again trying to reassure her weve got no choice she jumps up from the chair and pulls away from me god why did you bring him here how could you be so stupid why isnt he talking i ask turning to the eros screen at that instant the muffled crack of a gunshot bounces off the front of the house drewe screams snatching her arm i run for the door praying that shot came from mike mayeuxs gun could the deputy have shot him she asks as my hand touches the doorknob berkmanns digital voice saysi suppose we all know where we stand now i tear open the door and pull drewe after me up the dark hall and into the kitchen we stare dumbfounded at the twobysix planks i nailed across the pantry door yesterday i start to break for the back door then stop the gunshot came from the front of the house but i cant be sure who fired it its fifty feet from our back door to the edge of the cotton field fifty feet without cover handing drewe the i try to tear one of the planks down from the pantry door but it doesnt budge i plant my right foot against the door frame and yank again but drewe stops me what is it i shout he knows about the tunnel remember he talked about you hoarding your gold like midas he could be in there right now i hesitate if he is the gunshot doesnt make sense i think that crack was just a figure of speech you want to bet our lives on that she asks trying to pull me away from the door harper listen to me im sorry i lost it back there you were right weve got to stay if we run we might get away buthe will too then what happens a week or a month or a year from now he snatches me out of some parking lot or cuts your throat while youre sleeping drewe has gone from blind panic to rigid control in less than a minute what do you want to do i ask you called for help right even if he killed the cops outside somebodys got to get here in fifteen or twenty minutes he could kill us twenty times in twenty minutes but does hewant to listen hes still talking to me shes right berkmanns digital voice is still droning up the hall somewhere outside our house he is crouched over a notebook computer and cellular phone too afraid or unsure to make his move he doesnt want to kill me drewe says clutching my upper arm he wants to take me with him thats why he hasnt broken into the house i can control him harperive got the power right now i can keep him on a string for twenty minutes you just be ready to shoot him if he tries to break in suddenly i see a great irony by declaring his desire to possess my wifeand by believing he has destroyed me in her eyesberkmann has given me the upper hand he has made drewemy hostage we can do it she insists handing the back to me twenty minutes an image of michael mayeux comes into my mind that hardheaded cajun could be stalking berkmann right now okay i tell her move get back to the computer drewe races into the hall and toward the office i veer into the bedroom for her charter arms then follow when i reach the office door i remember wes killens advice and switch on the hall light then i lock the office door behind me drewe is already speaking into the eros headset what was that gunshot she asks time is running outberkmann replieswe must act quickly what do you want from me i want you but how what do you want me to do walk outside with your car keys i have a plane nearby we can be airborne in three minutes my chest constricts with panic drewe whirls to face me stunned i can scarcely speak the strip miles used i whisper he must have stolen a plane i thought your plane crashed drewe stammers of course you did but i never meant to leave without you drewe i knew that as soon as i saw your picture fate used harpers sins to bring me to you and to stay near you i had to appear to die i would have come to you sooner but you moved into your fathers house there were guards i had no way to contact you safely drewe is shaking her head were you at my sisters burial yes did you leave sunglasses in her grave i dropped them i couldnt risk retrieving them but where have you been staying for the last two days in a cotton gin i had electricity and water all the necessities except food my god time is short drewe you were going to leave harper anyway now you know how right that instinct was now you have a place to go i am taking you to a future you cannot even imagine but i know harper is there you must convince him that to obstruct us means death its not that simple he has a gun and its pointed at me hes not about to let me go anywhere silence then i shall kill him let me talk to him edward drewe implores ill make him understand how it is this time berkmann does not respond drewe reaches out and grips my left hand in hers i clench the in my right looking back over my shoulder at the window blinds five minutesberkmann says finallyin five minutes you walk out the front door alone or i set the house on fire chapter hes bluffing i say trying to believe it myself drewe throws down the headset and hits the space bar weve got to run weve got to use the tunnel now i lay the in her lap and shake my head we cant run we lost our chance we dont know where he is now hes going to set the house on fire he wont do it with you inside he might something is working at the edge of my consciousness like a comet too distant to see but hurtling toward me at great speed harper we cant run and he knows it we already made our choice what if we tell him im coming out then just sit here in the dark hed have to come in for me then we could shoot him its two against one berkmann knows about killing drewe its our house but hes been here before if we end up in the same room with him were going to die she is near to hyperventilating and she knows it she clutches the to her chest and shakes her head as if to shake off her terror what about pleasebe quiet drewe she groans and closes her eyes i turn away and gaze around the office somehow i have to kill edward berkmann but the gun in my hand is not the answer facing him down like john wayne would be suicide as i turn slowly i am suddenly and keenly aware of miles as he was on the morning he completed his trojan horse program while buckners men hammered on my front door desperate for time and needing to run he looked around this room and realized that everything he needed to fool the police was right in front of him if only he could see it in the proper light a minute has passed but for me time is dilating with possibility the seconds pass like cars on a distant train berkmann is smart that is his talent but talents are doubleedged swords i learned that the hard way maybe berkmann is too smart for his own good as the air conditioner kicks on something trips in my brainan echo of my own voice just minutes agoremember dallas dallas a jerky video image of an apartment men in black a harmlesslooking white computer on a floor suddenly blooming into black nothingness my nerve endings thrumming i turn faster drinking in the contents of the room the coat sculpture my surviving guitars the computers the rack for my great grandfathers sword which now lies in some evidence room in yazoo city smallersays a voice in my head i tighten my focus from macro to micro floppy disk case stapler vcr halogen desk lamp flashlight canned air for cleaning electronic gear air freshener drewe left in here weeks ago toner bottle for refilling printer cartridges harper for gods sake i hold up my hand looking from the sleek black eros computer to the boxy white gateway then at the printers attached to each and finally the keyboards drewe what i want you to type berkmann a note on the gateway what please just do it what do i type she asks sitting down at the computer go into wordperfect doublespace the note write it as if youre me tell berkmann you hate his guts that youre taking your wife out of the house that hell never have her tell him to wait right where he is because youre coming back to kill him as soon as your wife is safe but its the wrong computer drewe protests i cant send the message to him just do it but whatever you type make the note longer than a single screen you understand youvegot to go a few lines past the first screen okay she says tapping slowly at the keys i flip on the halogen lamp near the gateway then move to the door with the and switch off the overhead light where are you going drewe calls her voice high and thin ill be right back finish the note i close my left hand around the doorknob and slowly turn it berkmann could already be inside the house but i dont think so and im going to be very quick one pull and im sailing up the hallway with the office door shut behind me hard left into the unused bedroom that holds the gun safe shifting the to my left hand i kneel before the safe spin the combination lock back and forth to the numbers of my fathers birthday and yank the handle my right hand parts the thicket of antique muskets grabs a blackandyellow can and gives it a shake threequarters full then im running again the held out in front like a ram thank god drewe cries from the pool of light at the center of the room i shut and lock the office door did you finish the note four lines past the bottom of the screen harper what are you trying to do a moment of doubt as i reach into the bottom drawer of the desk nothing gets lost faster than tools but this one i used less than a week ago what are you looking for my heart leaps as my hand closes around the screw starter im going to blow him to hell and gone what i hold the can from the gun safe under the light black powder she asks you got it i flip open the top of the hewlettpackard printer and pull out the black wedgeshaped toner cartridge drewe stays on my heels as i carry the cartridge into the bathroom tell me what youre doing she demands are you making some kind of bomb yes with the screw starter i pop out the two pins in the left end of the cartridge then flip it around and start on the right what are you going to do with it the fourth plug gives with a pop kill berkmann i tell her dropping the plug into my pocket i need you to clear out a space on the floor of the closet move all the shoes and things to one sidehurry okay after pulling off the cartridge cover i turn the cartridge on end exposing the inchwide plug in the toner reservoir it pulls out easily i start to invert the cartridge over the toilet bowl then realize how stupid that would be the ink used by laser printers is a superfine black powder of plastic and metal that looks like coal dust and spreads like an eruption of volcanic ash if i try to flush it down the toilet the bathroom will look like a blind man tried to paint it with india ink instead i flip open the cabinet that holds my dirty clothes hamper stick the cartridge through turn it on end and shake it until the weight tells me its empty then i pull it out wipe my hand on a towel and drop the towel into the hamper i heard something drewe shouts outside looking out of the bathroom i see her pointing the at one of the front windows just keep to the shadows i tell her running back to my desk with the empty toner cartridge braced against the floor i press the sharp end of the screw starter against the plastic and bear down like a blacksmith punching a hole clean through the wall of the toner reservoir then i punch another hole about a quarter inch from the first hurry harper covering the holes with my thumb i begin filling the toner reservoir with black gunpowder why did i have to write that message drewe asks thats part of the detonator through the plug hole i watch the level of the gunpowder rising i dont understand when you dont go outside berkmann will have no choice but to come in just like you said i glance at my watch nearly three and a half minutes have passed if he sets the house on fire wellhave to go out he wont do it the gunpowder keeps rising he wont take a chance on hurting you where are we going to be when this bomb of yours blows up right here right here in this room in the closet what waiting for him to come in here with us and set it off its the only way you said wed die if we wound up in the same room with him the toner reservoir is full i stuff the plug back into the hole then dig through the bottom drawer of my desk for wire cutters and electrical tape i need wire too but theres none in the drawer stop for one second drewe shouts squeezing my arm so hard i have to yank it away damn it i yell trying desperately to think of some place in the office where there might be wire well be buried under clothes and everything else in the closet how big will the explosion be i dont know you dont know like a pipe bomb we might get hurt okay buthell be cut to pieces drewe freezes her mouth open did you hear that my eyes lock onto a gibson es guitar hanging from its brace above my bed what i ask jumping onto the bed with the wire cutters my god do you smell that the first snip pops the gibsons high estring with a twang like a cartoon ricochet the second gives me the length of wire i need gasoline drewe gasps thatsgas shes right the sharp tang of highoctane gasoline is seeping into the room maybe through the airconditioning ducts hes bluffing i tell her cutting the guitar string into two threeinch lengths i pull off my watch and hand it to her weve got forty seconds tell me when our times up with drewe staring wildly at me i reach into the open cartridge with the screw starter and feel for the corona wire this ultrathin filament electrically charges the magnetic drum that puts the ink in the right places on the page to form text holding up the wire with the tip of the screw starter i stick two small pieces of tape to it one on either side of the tool point then i snip the corona wire in half twentyfive seconds drewe says in a tight voice i toss her the wire cutters cut the mouse off the gateway why just do it throw it in the closet using the tape scraps to guide me i attach a short length of guitar string to each loose end of the corona wire then i carefully feed the two wires through the holes i punched in the toner reservoir and fix them in position with tape times up get some towels i shout snapping the cartridge cover back into place wet them in the bathtub you said he wouldnt do it drewe wails get the towels fumbling like a teenager with a condom i pop in two plugs to anchor the cover then run to the open printer and shove the cartridge home the moment i close the printers lid i have a lethal bomb but edward berkmann is the detonator and for him to function properly i have to make a nonfatal choice impossible my hands fly across the keyboard closing out possibilities for failure harper stop it drewe pleads standing beside me with two soaking wet towels get in the closet i wont do it you want to die we will die if we do this berkmanns digital voice paralyzes us bothfive minutes have fallen into eternity where are you drewe she watches me like a kid with her finger plugged in a leaking ocean dike let me talk to him she begs he doesnt want to talk get in the closet her arms fall slack at her sides letting the wet towels plop onto the floor i cant she says in a broken voice im sorry ill drag her into the closet if i have to but first i have to arm the bomb i stare at the printer my stomach near spasm get back drewe do you smell the gas harper berkmann asksare you ready to burn fuck you i yell with the knowledge that it could be my last i take a deep breath then i lay myself over the printer in case it blows prematurely and hit the on switch nothing happens the yellow and green status lights on the face of the printer glow blink off then come back on indicating the unit is warmed up online and ready to print and i am still alive can you hear me edward i whirl my heart pounding drewe is seated at the eros computer with the headset on yes come out drewe harper wont let me he thinks if i come out youll burn the house with him in it or shoot him if he tries to come out we all have to take chances in life come out now i want to im going to try something okay youre using a cell phone arent you stop playing games drewe my patience is gone im going to hook a telephone to this modem line then i can come to the window youll be able to see me then we can work this out berkmann doesnt reply what the hell are you doing i hiss drewe motions frantically for me to bring her a phone i dont know what shes trying to do but every minute that ticks past is a mile and a half closer for wes killen and sheriff buckner i toss her the cordless and run for the answering machine that is its base whats the number of the data line drewe asks her finger pressed to the space bar sixohone fourtwoseven threeoneonefour she repeats the number into the headset then says do you have that on your screen edward berkmann says nothing call me in thirty seconds im attaching the phone now i scrabble behind a bookshelf with my left hand trying to disconnect the answering machines electrical plug while holding the ready in my right in case berkmann breaks down the door hurry drewe pleads i have it dropping the base into drewes lap i shove the electrical plug into the back of the power supply that feeds clean electricity to the eros computer what the hell are you trying to do i ask again im going to get you a shot at him what how i ask clicking the rj jack into the back of the modem just be ready i dont think hes listening to you anymore the ringing phone makes a liar of me drewe reaches for it but i grab her wrist let the machine get it then pick up after the machine answers drewe picks up and says just a second over my outgoing message when it finishes its run i press memo which will not only record berkmanns words but also allow me to hear everything he says through the answering machine are you there edward drewe asks yes even transmitted by the tinny speaker of the answering machine that single wordspoken without the digital midwife of miless voicesynthesis programcommunicates more subtlety and danger than the whole of berkmanns words so far i like that better drewe says much better the little speaker hisses and crackles in her lap im coming to the window edward she rises from the chair no come to the back door drewe freezes her eyes asking me what mine are asking her is berkmann really at the back door theres no way to know harper wont let me but im coming to the window despite my fraying nerves i force myself to let her cross the room to the right front window she seals the transmitter of the phone with her palm and whispers youre mad as hell youre losing it youll kill me before you let me go out there what she gives me a frantic look like come on stupid when i slap the windowpane that means hes exposed thats your shot not until then okay before i can argue drewe grips the blind cord in her right hand and takes three steps backward pulling the blind to its highest position and exposing six vertical feet of glass can you see me edward she says into the phone berkmann doesnt answer hes not about to reveal his position by admitting he can see her what is he thinking at this moment the only light in the office comes from the halogen desk lamp but it falls across drewe from the side illuminating her white robe and stilldamp hair with a diffuse yellow glow berkmann would probably like to smash the window and snatch her out through it but our house is built off the ground which would make that very tough to do he also knows im armed edward drewe says again her voice plaintive still nothing the smell of gasoline is strong by the wall but berkmann hasnt lighted it yet my first instinct is to move to the other window ten feet down the wall from where drewe stands that would give me the best field of fire but if berkmann is out front he knows that too where is harper he asks suddenly i whirl toward the eros computer my finger on the trigger id forgotten that the only way ill hear his voice now is through the answering machine across the room drewe has put a hand on the window frame to steady herself shes been acting with so much assurance that i assumed she was as confident as she looked but shes far from it in fact now that berkmann has answered she seems too flustered to respond as i watch her floundering the scenario she sketched out comes back to me pressing my chest flat against the wall between the windows i extend my right arm edge along the wall and press the barrel of my against her left temple you see him now she asks her voice full of genuine shock youre going to die for that harper berkmann is definitely in front of the house thats not a good way to start this negotiation edward drewe says im not negotiating this talk then that synthesized voice was so sterile not like this your real voice is much more intriguing shut up damn you i yell supplying what seems like my appropriate line im going to burn you alive berkmann says coldly fuck you i close my eyes and try to picture the scene outside drewes acura is parked broadside to the house about twenty yards from the window the explorer is ten yards closer to the house but farther to the left than the acura harper wont hurt me edward drewe says he doesnt have the guts just like he didnt have the guts to tell me about erin why dont you try walking out then i scream i dont have to she says in a strange voice edwards going to get me out she turns into the barrel of the and gives me a look that could freeze mercury would you really shoot me harper lets see if you will she looks back into the darkening yard and says you know what would kill him edward what if i told him the truth about sex with him tell him shut up goddamn it ive never had an orgasm with harper inside me not in three years of marriage and a year of sex before that of course hethinks i have sad isnt it that will soon change berkmanns voice sounds different somehow more strained i honestly cant believe erin enjoyed sex with him drewe goes on because she knew about sex i can tell you you wouldnt believe some things she did berkmann says nothing my gun arm is tingling the way it did twenty years ago when i reached into the fort to pull miles out i sense berkmann aiming at my hand the way i sensed that rattlesnake it would be a risky shot for him firing through glass so near to drewes head but he might try it with a tranquilizer dart i take a quick step backward pulling the behind the frame of the window what kinds of things berkmann asks suddenly drewe glances at me i saw her get out of a dui ticket by making a highway patrolman you know in his pants i mean it she didnt even take off her clothes his either it was sort of like a slow dance on the side of the road erin didnt care to her sex was like breathing and to you i know how i want it to be i want it to be transcendent am i wrong to want that no the few times ive ever managed to get aroused enough harpers already finished do you know how to touch edward where to touch i know places you dont know you have you slut i scream hang up tell him what youll do if i hang up edward ill light that gasoline harper and when you come running out ill shoot you in the pelvis i have the deputys gun and im an excellent shot i have officer mayeuxs gun too in case youre wondering i grit my teeth and close my eyes i cant see mayeux giving up his gun while alive this isnt working drewe thinks shes stalling but berkmann isnt sitting still darting to my desk i scrawl a message on a legal pad with black magic marker then i return to the wall and hold it up where drewe can see it by looking slightly to the left hes playing you tricking us youve got to turn it around get me a shot in the crackling silence drewe stares at me like a little girl who has walked out onto a highdiving board and lost the nerve even to walk back to the ladder as i watch she seems to waver on her feet yet the moment i move toward her she snaps erect and holds up a hand to stop me ive thought a lot about your transplant work she says im the one who first figured out what you were doing i never thought it was really possible though she waits in vain for an answer its not possible is it thats why you gave up silence thenits not only possible its simple the problem is the illegality the inconvenience of obtaining donors and recipients for testing i nod encouragement to drewe shes found the right button to push you can really keep someone youthful past the normal aging curve of course you could keep me young im going to drewe when the women you went to school with are fighting menopause and osteoporosis youll be skiing in saint moritz making love as long and as often as a thirtyyearold but why me ive seen my mistake drewe whats the point of immortality without someone to share it with the only real immortality is genetic anyway at least for now you shall bear my children i could say ive chosen you but this was all written long ago by fate when i realized how harper had tricked me with erin and that you were the one i wanted i thought of harvesting erins pineal for you there was a twenty percent chance that she would be a perfect tissue match and at least it would have given her death some meaning but i didnt i knew you probably hadnt reached the stage where you could see the rightness of it youre right thank you for not doing that there are always other sources but first the children then more research in forty years who knows what might be possible all that i have is yours drewe my wealth and my talentsberkmann pauses briefly but when he speaks again there is new urgency in his voicei want you to walk outside now drewe harper will not shoot you must believe me i dont know what hell do he hates you for telling his secret he said you wouldnt light the gasoline and he was right what am i supposed to do you must come now drewe or ill be forced to to take risks wait dont do anything harpers already scared to death berkmann says nothing edward silence she glances at me her face pale shes lost him again and she knows it i glance down at my wrist then remember i gave my watch to drewe it seems as though shes been at the window forever but help is still five to ten minutes away i am about to yank drewe out of the window when she reaches down and tugs at the belt of her robe loosening it with her left hand she pulls aside the terry cloth exposing her left breast can you see me edward she asks her voice like taut wire berkmann doesnt respond but hes looking i know it drewe knows it too she cups the breast in her free hand leans forward and presses the nipple to the glass edward nothing no child has ever suckled at this breast silence do you want to do that edward yes she starts at the sudden reply its almost as if berkmann vanished before our eyes then reappeared would you brush my hair if i asked you to she asks recovering quickly yes it needs brushing i work so hard i never have time to take care of it would you take care of it yes berkmanns voice sounds strangely constricted drewe waits then says you lost your mother too young didnt you yes and you never had a sister no look at me edward drewe lets the robe fall open then flattens her hand like a starfish on the windowpane timehe says in a strangled voiceno time youve got to come out now please he wont shoot ill come edward but i dont want harper to die however he may have betrayed me hes the father of my sisters child i would spare him for that alone i wouldnt but you will do what i say she proclaims in a voice so alien it sends a shiver through me because i say so do you hear me edward a stunned silence thenif you want to come out why do you care about him im trying to resolve this edward dont make it harder than it has to be prove you dont care about him i will drewe pulls away from the window her chest coming up with a sticky sound her nipples hard from the coolness of the glass do you see me edward im not pretending like that brownskinned indian girl i am the one the shock of drewes nudity combined with her brazen voice trips something in my brain this is it if shes ever going to bring berkmann out its now i only hope she remembers to slap the glass are you big now edward yes very big yes thats only natural you want to touch me dont you yes you need to yes do you see where yes do you know what its like there a hiccup of silencei its wet there edward burning please come out look edward look shifting the phone from one hand to the other drewe lets the robe slip off her shoulders as casually as if she were stepping into the shower a gasp of disbelief bursts from my lungs i back far away from the wall aiming the pistol at the crack of glass between the window frame and drewes side waiting for her signal she shakes her hair into a fiery riot of copper and gold then stands straight with her arms at her sides as if to display every atom of her being in shameless pride her skin glows like veined marble as when i saw erin so many years ago i cannot process the entirety of her nude image i see her calves the backs of her thighs the small dimples above her rump her shoulder bladesthese are enough to hold my eye from its assigned task berkmann must be rooted to the ground jesus christ i hiss what are you doing edward yesa ragged whisper drewe moves her free hand around her hip out of my sight all i see is the muscle moving in her upper arm help me edward show me your power with my gun arm quivering i edge forward toward drewe i keep the aimed just to the left of her hip through the window into the waiting dusk as my pupils dilate i discern the silhouette of the acura its closer to the house than i remembered maybe thirtyfive feet my explorer sits ten yards to the left of it parked nosein the acura is the natural vantage point for someone watching the window but i see no one in the near field of my vision drewe suddenly spreads her arms like wings and plants her bare feet apart her hands close into fists and her muscles go rigid her body a hard quivering x in the lighted window my heart thunders with fear and awe at the specter she has not created butis woman revealed the hidden unveiled purity and carnality fused with power enough to stop the male heart as i stare openmouthed her right hand flattens against the window and begins rattling like a superheated kettle on a stove i focus on the hand then realize shes trying to signal me with an arm incapacitated by terror in the instant i look back through the window edward berkmann rises above the roof line of the acura his enraptured face shining like an earthbound moon in the darkness time blurs stops we both stand transfixed paralyzed by the realization that drewe is everything he imagined in his messianic fantasies and more edwaarrrd drewes scream jolts me back to myself as i aim for berkmanns face she hurls the cordless phone through the windowpane in an explosion of glittering glass i shoulder her out of the way and open fire my first shot is high and wild the second punches a hole in the acuras door berkmann drops screaming like a lunatic i fire two more rounds then scoop up drewes robe and throw my arm around her waist as she comes up off the floor i try to pull her toward the door but she wont budge did you hit him she asks her eyes white and round i dont think so get the light then shoot me after a stunned instant i turn steady the pistol and blow the halogen lamp off my desk throwing us into darkness edwaarrrd she yells her voice ringing across the yard i fire my last bullet in her direction and watch in horror as she flies backward like a gi taking a round in housetohouse fighting the silence is absolute not even crickets cheep in this strange lacuna of time then drewe is beside me again naked in the dark lifting her robe toward her i sense something like a horsefly beside my left ear and swat at it even as the tranquilizer dartthwack s into one of my guitars filling the room with jangling noise we hit the floor and crawl like alligators toward the office door i feel a strange weight in the robe its drewes i pause raise the gun fire two quick rounds through the intact front window then feel my way to the door when i look back the bright amber message on the screen of the gateway floats in the darkness like a tablet of fire brought from a mountaintop just as it should what did you do berkmann asks his voice a fusion of fear and fury drewes hand grips my shoulder like a claw its the answering machine i whisper at the same time noticing the faint glow of the eros screen to my right while drewe ties on her robe i raise the and fire through the eros monitor shorting it out with a shower of sparks now the gateway screen is the only light holding the hot pistol to my chest i switch off the hall light then slide drewe around in front of me ready she nods the second i jerk open the door she scrambles up the hallway toward the kitchen but i force myself to walk backward keeping the pointed at the front door in case berkmann comes through it when i reach the kitchen i turn and run to the washroom where drewe waits the smell of gasoline is strong here too drewe leans into me clutching my shirt like a child maybe we should stay here she says in a meek voice we cant i hug her tightly her whole body is shaking as though the bravura performance at the window drained every bit of courage out of her with the i part the curtains that cover the small window in the back door the yard looks blueblack in the moonlight the long tin roof of the toolshed gleams beckoning my eyes move lower there is a man lying flat on his back just outside the door his eyes are closed and there is a screwdriver handle sticking out of his right upper chest i let the curtain fall closed drewe theres a man on the ground outside its detective mayeux from new orleans hes probably dead but we only heard one shot he could be alive ill get my bag she says automatically as though someone had just passed out in church i squeeze her arm we cant help him im telling you so youll step over him she blinks rapidly when i open this door were going to run straight back to the cotton field and keep going okay she nods once gripping the i unbolt the door then freeze as a high brittle plea crosses the space between us dont let him get close to me harper i wont her fingernails dig into my arm causing me to twist sideways if he hits you with a dart and you cant see him anywhere shoot me what you do it with that appalling request ringing in my ears i turn the knob and launch myself into the sweltering night chapter i am leaping over mayeuxs body when two gunshots boom through the night i whirl and take drewes weight full in the face and we crash to the ground beside mayeux where is he she hisses in my ear front i groan rolling her off me run whats he shooting at i dont know go i know i should run but mayeux is half covered with gasoline i find his carotid artery with my left hand theres a pulse drewe is still beside me go damn it i hand her the behind the toolshed she takes the gun but doesnt run suffused by a wild anger i lean over and put my right shoulder into mayeuxs belly then heave myself over so that he is lying across me from there its a matter of brute strength working the leverage until i get my legs under me and hes lying sacklike over my shoulder in a firemans carry with drewe covering the corners of the house i half stagger half run across the grass to the toolshed and collapse under the fig trees behind it depositing mayeux on his back drewe hands me the then begins testing the screwdriver handle sticking out of mayeuxs chest having an immediate emergency to deal with seems to have restored her composure youre going to leave that in him i ask as she checks mayeux for other wounds better for him she says probing gently under his head what makes the printer explode before i can answer she says look and pulls a short feathered barb from mayeuxs neck itll go off when berkmann prints your message i tell her peering around the corner of the shed the yard is empty the house silent when i look back drewe is staring at me as if im an idiot why should he print the message he can justread it not without scrolling to the next screen so that keyboard is programmable if you want your comma key where the semicolon key is you can have it that way all it takes is a few keystrokes i still dont get it i reprogrammed every key that can take him to the next screen to issue the same command print screen the down cursor every cursor and page down since you snipped off the mouse he has to use the keyboard the second he does six hundred volts will zap through the printers corona wire which is cut and buried in the black powder a spark will arc between the wires and goodbye edward drewe stares blankly as if trying to compute the odds of success wont he be suspicious expect some kind of trap probably and if your message told him to print it or tried to trick him into printing it hed never do it but he wont see this coming the only question is will he try to read the whole message she nods hes addicted to it the computer is his fetish he may search the whole house first but hell read that message what did you put in it just what you told me to i shh listen what her eyes wide with fear drewe cocks her head listening for the wrong things i close my eyes and try to gauge the distance in the delta some sounds carry for miles siren i tell her even as the sound fades it must be pretty far away it is but berkmann will hear it soon hell run i get to my feet im not sure why but doing something always feels better than doing nothing even if youre doing something stupid what are you doing drewe asks he could take one of our cars make it to the plane im not letting him get away now you stay here i cant leave drewe without a gun but i cant go after berkmann without one mayeuxs shoulder holster is empty im almost resigned to waiting when an idea hits me dropping beside the unconscious detective i pull up one of his trouser legs nothing but a hairy ankle but when i pull up the other i see the ducttaped grip of a snubnose revolver tucked snugly in a velcro ankle holster mayeux carries a throwdown after verifying that the cylinder is full i hand the pistol to drewe youre not leaving me here she says i dont even try to argue after switching guns we cross the yard in a quick soundless rush the grass damping the beat of our feet at the back corner of the house we pause in a pungent cloud of gasoline vapor i still dont hear the siren she whispers the house is blocking the sound maybewe should light the gasoline are you nuts its our house with mayeuxs in my right hand i sprint along the side of the house nearly stumbling on a coil of garden hose when i make the front corner i hear the siren again drewe collides with me from behind a soft impact of breasts and hands the yard is pitch dark the drive still only the sound of crickets breaks the silence where our driveway meets the road the deputys car sits motionless nearer to us the explorer and the acura offer concealment but i know berkmann has left them behind i think hes inside i whisper im going to look wait dont worry im not going in listen for doors or windows he may come tearing outside when he hears the siren youd better take off that robe its like a neon target out here drewe shakes her head violently if you hear him you take it off my back pressed to the clapboard i edge along the front of the house holding the against my right thigh like a quarterback running a bootleg as i near the broken front window i step into what feels like a draft of sea wind its the conditioned air from the house draining into the hot night like water from a leaking barrel berkmann must have heard the siren by now i try to maneuver beneath the window to look through it but theres too much broken glass on the ground weaving around the fragments i cover the ten feet to the second window rise to the sill and peek over it edward berkmann is sitting at my gateway his byronic profile hauntingly illuminated by the amber glow of the screen he leans slightly forward facing right to left across my visual field peering at drewes message as though it holds the key to some eternal mystery berkmann hasnt heard the siren because there are other sounds inside the office the hum of the computer the drone of the refrigerator the hissing of the central air conditioner he must have read the first screen of the message by now yet still he sits staring what is he doing hes thinking the man who developed a worldrenowned computer model of the human brain is exercising his own to solve the oldest problem in the world survival berkmann is less than ten feet from me the printer less than two feet from him at the level of his chest theres a gun beside the computers keyboard nickel plated just the flashy kind of piece buckners deputies carried but that gun cannot protect berkmann from the printer my mind is telling me to raise my gun above the window sill but instinct stops me the slightest movementeven lowering my head out of sightcould catapult berkmann out of that chair with the gun in his hand as if in response to my thought he lifts his head like a birdwatcher detecting a faint call and turns slightly to his left toward me a bolt of pure terror strikes my heart he hasnt seen me hes heard the siren but instead of jumping up in panic he turns back to the screen settles deeper into my chair and closes his hands around its arms is he actually waiting for me to come back and try to kill him as the message promises i will theres more than one siren now several dissonant notes have separated themselves from the general whine made dopplerdistinct by changing distances berkmann swivels my chair to the right toward the wall that holds my guitars what rogue impulses are firing through the synapses in that head he could be guessing my next move or wondering what happened to his favorite eighteenthousanddollar urinal every fiber of my brain tells me to run but instead i bring up the with shaking hands and wait for him to swivel back to the left he does but the rotation stops with him facing the computer screen with a deliberation that sets my trigger finger quivering berkmann reaches out and touches a key on the right side of the keyboard im wondering which key it was when he turns in my direction for an instant his gaze floats just above mine then it locks onto me like a laser and i feel the nightmarish horror of trying to back away from some unspeakably sentient being as he rises from the chair and rushes toward me with the silver gun coming up and then disappearing in a white flash that seems to explode in silence i am sitting on the ground blinking my eyelids which feel like they are on fire theres a piece of bloody glass sticking out of my left arm and more blood pouring from my right shoulder i start to pull out the glass then remember drewe leaving the screwdriver in mayeuxs chest suddenly she is beside me she seems to be yelling but i cant hear her when i try to speak i feel a dull vibration in my throat but hear nothing a white cloud is billowing out of the window above me this tells me the flash was what i hoped it was nothing smokes like oldstyle black powder drewe takes hold of my left arm and tries to lift me when i protest she shouts words i cant hear and pulls harder then her head whips up and to the side toward the window following her line of sight i see a black shadow arc through the smoke over my head and crash beside me in a rain of glass i reach instinctively for drewe but shes gone i try to stand wobbling on my knees waiting for the black hump that must be edward berkmann to jump up and put a bullet through my head he does neither he doubles up on the gasolinesoaked ground and with what appears to be colossal effort rolls over onto his back his face is scorched black and riddled with white plastic shrapnel his shoulderlength hair has been burned off and blood runs from his nose and ears his mouth opens in a wide o defined by white teeth and the first sign that im getting my hearing back is a high keening wail that i realize is no distant siren but a human scream feeling drewe at my side i reach out and close my hand around hers berkmanns whole body is smoking but his eyes are open so wide that the irises look like blue buttons on white saucers even as i see the nickelplated pistol still gripped in his right hand i realize that both the hand and arm are shattered can you do anything for him i hear myself croak i could drewe says but i wont i have other patients berkmanns empty left hand jerks and i yank drewe back afraid that hes trying to get the gun into his good hand but he isnt the scorched hand rises into the air and reaches toward us as though beckoning to drewe but the blackened fingers close on nothing and the arm slowly falls the instant it touches the ground the gun in his other hand fires igniting the spilled gasoline in a blinding blast of heat that drives us backward into the dark berkmanns charred body curls away from the flames like burnt paper from a trash fire as i stare into the inferno drewe drags me down the drive away from our cars yielding like an exhausted child i gaze up the road at my neighbors cotton fields a regiment of red flashing lights is hurtling toward us like a train of flaming chariots all i want to do is lie down bob anderson arrived before a single deputy drewe had set up shop just outside the toolshed and was working on mayeux and me by the light of the burning house bob and patrick and special agent wes killen came charging around the house like marines clearing a hostile ville i recognized killen by his nose bandage bob told us hed seen a man lying on his back beside drewes acura but had no idea who he was killen was afraid it might be mayeux while drewe bound my shoulder with a towel i asked bob whether the man was dead i had visions of an ambulance bundling berkmann into its antiseptic belly and spiriting him away to a miraculous recovery bob said the man wasnt dead but would be soon and would be better off when he was i told bob who the man was he stood there a moment his mouth working silently then he took a deep breath and walked back toward the roaring fire nobody followed him patrick took over treating mayeux drewe explained to wes killen what had happened and by the time she was done bob was walking back toward us a black silhouette against the flames we all looked quietly at him until he said hes dead now we sat some more while drewe removed a shard of glass from my leg and killen talked to daniel baxter on his cellular telephone i asked drewe if she could get the other piece of glass out of my right shoulder and she told me she couldnt because there wasnt any piece of glass id been shot berkmann had gotten off a round during the second that the message was being transmitted to the printer the bullet went clean through sheriff buckner arrived with an army loaded for bear but found the bear already dead he might have been unpleasant about that but bobs presence had an amazing effect on his demeanor he couldnt seem to do enough for us now everyone sits or stands watching the house burn while we wait for the paramedics to arrive the sight of a human dwelling being consumed by fire is a powerful almost sacred thing it eats at our sense of security reminds us that all we have built can be wiped away in a matter of minutes ironically the fire seems a fitting ending to me who was born and raised in that house my past has always been a chronic wound now its being cauterized before my eyes the paramedics load me into a doublewide ambulance beside mike mayeux hes still unconscious but patrick hovers over him monitoring his vital signs drewe squats between the front seats her hand on my forehead the pain in my shoulder is becoming a serious nuisance but then i think of berkmann hes riding a couple of spots back in the convoy in a plastic bag in sheriff buckners trunk the son of a bitch is right where he belongs a lot of lonely and innocent women died because of edward berkmann most of them i never really knew but one i did better than i should have and because of berkmann she is gone holly has no mother patrick has no wife drewe has no sister i share that guilt of course if i hadnt pushed myself into berkmanns path erin would still be alive the temptation to secondguess is strong but i must remember one thing life is simple you are healthy or you are sick you are faithful to your wife or you arent you are alive or you are dead i am alive
